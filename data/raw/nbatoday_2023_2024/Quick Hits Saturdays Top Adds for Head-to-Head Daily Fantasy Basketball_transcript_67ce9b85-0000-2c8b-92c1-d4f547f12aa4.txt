welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right we're gonna get through this one pretty quick folks Saturday morning we got a lot going on in our personal lives I know you do as well  but we gotta get a streaming show out there because we're coming down to the wire here I'm gonna be doing this I hope the next weekend we'll see about timing then and then we'll probably dial back the streaming episodes on the very last week of the season because frankly it doesn't matter because everyone's gonna be sitting those games out anyway and your league shouldn't be going that weak anyway I am Dan Bass Pro this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos.com presentation and here  well I'm Dan bass on Twitter and here  is what you can be doing today the worst schedules on this  cold wet and rainy Saturday morning in Southern California the worst schedule today belong to  kind of the same teams we've been talking about Detroit Indiana Phoenix and Portland  all have basically the same schedule they played yesterday now they're off for two days  and they start next week with the game on Monday but no game on Tuesday  so it's that same general idea offer two days starting today game on Monday off on Tuesday Detroit schedule gets a little bit better after that Phoenix Portland Indiana they alternate days next week so the schedule is a horrible next week but these are the teams that don't have a game the rest of this week  that's the important note  there are four teams  that don't have a game the rest of this week don't play over the weekend Detroit Indiana Phoenix Portland  San Antonio and Utah  like Detroit in Phoenix and Portland San Antonio and Utah have only two games over the next six days that big difference there is that their bad part of the schedule comes next week  meaning if you have those guys you won't gain any games this week by making a move  so you really kind of looking towards next week which is a thing you can do if you're on a buy if you have this week wrap up which feels someone unlikely I mean I guess you know never know you could get Super Lucky in your opponent could have had a team where like three guys got hurt if you're looking towards next week San Antonio in Utah are also clubs that you can  think about pivoting off to but again bearing in mind that their schedule is bad over the next six days but it actually gets worse after the next two  goes from two games and six to one game in four  so I probably wouldn't do anything with those teams until Monday but they are all so of bad scheduling form so in the very crazy chance that you can you have that sort of wiggle room that's those are the second tear down  who has good schedule coming up well this is easy  one team  that's it  it's just the Atlanta Hawks  they're the only team that has a schedule that's really any better than anybody else's other than of course the really bad schedule teams but then we talked about what six bad schedules really only four truly bad schedules  one really good one two kind of mediocre ones now you're talking about 20 some odd I think 22 teams or 23 that have  all kind of the same and yeah there's some that you know if you were trying to get a game today versus tomorrow and so on and so forth but basically everybody else has about three games over five days give or take not everybody but almost everybody there are a couple of teams that have two games over that stretch but it doesn't become a problem until like Tuesday of next week so you'd have three days to kind of worry about it or not worried about it a little bit before you then need to start worrying about it again  the Atlanta Hawks are the only team that has a leg up on anyone else because not only do they have a game the rest of this week today but they actually start next week with three games in four nights and they are the only team that's starts next week with three games in four nights the only one  everybody else in the NBA has either one or two game's over those first four days most teams have two not surprisingly Chicago as a team that only has one that's a team that's going to be coming up on a bad schedule but it's not there yet  this is again to start next week Chicago goes a team that only has one game the first four days next week and that is well San Antonio's the other one and you talk we just talked about remember they go into that bad schedule at the beginning of next week so Chicago San Antonio and Utah move into a bad schedule relatively early next week but everybody else is pretty much the same give or take which days it's happening  you probably don't need to play in all the way towards the end of next week yet but Friday and Sunday our gigantic cards Fridays a dozen Sunday is 13 teams so you're gonna be pretty full on those days and that's why Atlanta has another extra check mark in the good bucket because they cram three games into four days that aren't overload days  they don't even play on the overload days you could hold the land through all through the end of next week if you wanted to because they got a game on Saturday in between the overloads  and then yeah a lot of other teams have sort of like fine schedules but again as you're looking down the line wherever you might be going because there are a few teams and if we have time to tomorrow do this again there if you teams that actually go back to back Sunday Monday coming up three or four of them actually  if those teams then keep on playing through Wednesday or whatever if they go Friday Sunday that's kind of wasteful  the streaming names on Atlanta are basically the same although I think you could probably pair it down even a tiny bit further not that anybody was really going with the Veet crunchy stuff but Jalen Johnson is questionable so there's an actual chance that he comes back for the Atlanta game tonight  and if not tonight I would think that he's probably back for those three games in four days or two of those four early next week meaning if you were trying to squeeze something out of crunchy you already aren't getting very much and then if Jalen Johnson comes back then it gets even smaller so it's really just Bruno Fernando and then if any of this slightly more capable regulars are on the waiver wire which I think is is unlikely frankly you know DeAndre Hunter  relatively heavily rostered but you never know maybe he pops up on a waiver wire and you're probably not doing the Garrison Mathews dance  and you know good crunchy is not doing very much so it's really just Fernando  but it would be pretty damn useful to get three games in four days out of even somebody like Fernando whose you know he's more of a one 50 range guy these days with Onkyo Congo out now if he shows back up again then Fernando turns into nothing but Kong was already out for their ballgame tonight so for Fernando should see his you know 1920 minutes off the bench something like that behind capella and he'll do something with it  but there in lies the rub Atlanta has this amazing schedule they just don't have many guys that you can pick up to utilize in said amazing schedule otherwise if you wanted to you could hang on until tomorrow let's say you had one roster move left this is about the time of the week where you should only have one or even potentially zero you might just be riding it out  if you waited till tomorrow Brooklyn has a month or Sunday Monday back to back as do Charlotte and Chicago you've got three choices super early in the alphabet so that's easy for our scrolling purposes those are the directions you would want to look tomorrow or if you were even I mean you could potentially do it today but typically I would advise don't make a move earlier than you have to because by tomorrow you'll have a better idea of what categories you're attacking and Brooklyn has some options and Charlotte has some options and Chicago doesn't have many options besides on Andre Drummond but those are the teams you're looking at tomorrow  and hopefully that all sets you up to kind of front load next week because front loading next week is one of the most important things you can do because there is no way to backload it because those days are full  there's some teams that have really good schedules on the back half of next week but it kind of doesn't matter  because everybody's playing with them  schedules get really dense halfway through next week  then everybody's off on Monday so that you know the interesting thing is you look towards next week Sunday and Monday are kind of inconsequential days because Sunday has 13 games so you don't need to do anything there and Monday has no games because the college championship so you don't need to do anything there so next week and into the following week they're really a pair of two six game weeks as you're kind of plotting your course through them meaning if we turn our clocks back to this week again  ending this week's strong and front loading next week are really big important things to do  I would say you don't want to have any fewer than two games between Monday and Wednesday of next week and that's most teams in the NBA but it's not all of them  but what it does do is it allows you again looking towards next week it allows you to use a bunch of moves early in the week  load up Monday through Thursday as best you can you could use up all your moves if you want to do because Friday through Sunday it's kind of a wash  unless you want to try to get in on the handful of games happening on Saturday but at that point you know  if you were able to get a bunch of extra games played early in the week I think that's probably worth it  but again you know coming back to this week they're just isn't much for you to do at this point if you can get somebody on Atlanta this would be a good day to do it and this is an opportunity to abandon ship on anybody on teams that are done playing this week a provided you don't you aren't going to need them like you can't drop Devin Booker and Kevin Durant because they are amazing and if your league continues you're gonna need them to win next week but if you have any fringy guys on Detroit on Indiana and there are many of you guys on those types of teams if you have any Fringe you guys on Phoenix or Portland as well this is the time to move on specially now with timani tomorrow by the way being ruled out for the rest of the regular season that news broke just a few moments ago  let's see if you guys have any thoughts for me that I forgot to break down Zoe says in a dog fight to advance to the finals I loaded up for tomorrow at laravia and drop Jaylen during his my choice with my last move you know it sucks but like we just talked about Detroit has no more games left this week and if you got to just make it to the finals that's how you add a bunch of money to your coffers you do what you got to do dropping guys that aren't playing  Tyler says I'm in a tough spot in my final semis the semis and not the finals opponent has about a four game lead on me going into Sunday I have Halliburton Turner and I need to win steals  yeah sucks  if you're about to lose you kind of have no choice but to drop even useful guys I I hate to say it but that's the way it is like if you're if you're in your semis and you're not gonna make the finals unless you drop somebody really really good  you just gotta do it  yahoo public leagues pay out like 70 bucks to the third place team I think so you get your buy-in back and then you get enough for a Subway sandwich  and then second place I think is double that  so even if you have to drop every important player on your team to make the finals just by doing so you basically double your take in Yahoo League's and maybe and sometimes more than that in in private because I know in the head leaks that I'm in or run third place doesn't get any money so in those like just do everything if anybody's taking a 0 and you just got to get to the finals even if you get your butt kicked in the finals you still make way more money by getting there then by losing in the semis so do what you can  DBS any injury statistics on Malik monk well there's fear that it's a knee sprain which is a type of thing that you usually keeps somebody out for anywhere from three to six weeks uh you can wait a minute if you want um and Sacramento plays tomorrow so uh you know you could get more information then but I'd be floored if we saw a monk play in tomorrow's game absolutely Blown Away floored so he probably becomes a guy with zeros the rest of this week so if you have Malik monk you probably have to get off of them don't take the 0 and turn it into something the rest of this week especially because you don't know if he's gonna play next week  that's the Malik monk report  and I said I was gonna keep this one under 15 because there isn't a whole lot to do today and I'm going to keep it under 15 thanks for watching
