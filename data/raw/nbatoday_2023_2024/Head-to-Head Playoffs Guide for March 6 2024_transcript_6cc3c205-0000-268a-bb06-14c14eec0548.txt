welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast as close enough I think to the song being over don't you guys yeah we can jump in first of all you guys like this shirt  pretty excited about this Bobby's World you guys remember this cartoon  this is a new addition to my fun shirt Fridays I was Wednesday  what's happening everybody it's episode two today a fantasy NBA today this is our schedule analysis episode and I think this one's gonna be the shortest one so far last few have been like 12 15 16 minutes I'm trying to keep it under 15 15 Max is basically what I'm hunting for here because I want people to be able to just pop in you know this is coming out and around 2:00 Pacific time you got about two hours before game start I won't be able to just pop in five ten minutes you got your schedule boom you're good to go please do find me over on Twitter at Danbury d a n b e s b r i s uh that's the only promo I'm going to do with the front end of this one I want to just be able to Dive Right on in so what you guys are looking at right now and this is one of those shows that look it's going to go out on traditional podcast channels but if you're watching you do have a little bit of an edge on these where you know I don't know that watching changes my recap shows all that much but this is an opportunity for me to once again show you guys the color coded version of our streaming calendar available to NBA fantasy pass subscribers at sports ethos.com  but I've taken some sort of liberties with it here to make it easier to follow  I'm gonna highlight what I believe as I gonna show up that might not show up  yeah it's not showing up anyway I was hoping I could highlight today March the 6th so you guys can kind of see the starting point of what we're working with  but basically this is what we're doing today  strategically there are only a very select few teams that are worth looking at for streaming starting today that have any kind of edge over anyone else  mainly because every single team in the NBA has either two or three games the rest of this week there is not a team that has only one so there's no opportunity between today and Sunday to gain two games with a roster move  there are opportunities from today beyond Sunday to gain two games with one roster move and that is where we're going to focus our attention so if you're making a move today it has to be presumably for someone who has a pretty bad schedule coming up so some team that only has two games the rest of this week and maybe all so kind of starts next week slowly which you know it's not that many options there most of the teams that have two games the rest of this week start next week with something the teams that have a bad schedule to start next week our generally the teams that are kind of okay to start this one  Pelicans are the I think the lightest schedule in the NBA right now they've got two games over there next seven days Phoenix has three games over there next seven or eight days so that's a relatively lights schedule as well but outside of those well you talk all as a pretty wimpy schedule right now they got two games arrested this week but it's game off off game off off game off off and then they flip right back into extraordinarily heavy  so those are the kind of the two or three teams that you'd look at maybe moving on from someone Utah plays today and then they have one game the rest of the week so that's a situation where you just wait one more day to make that roster move Phoenix if you're going to make the move you could do it today you could do it Saturday or sorry you could do Friday you could do it Sunday you could even do it Tuesday of next week there isn't like a super obvious time for the Pelicans that's the one where you'd make the move today if you have a fringe Pelican which there aren't many because like the team right now has like six guys that are very good and then a whole bunch of guys that aren't even on the radar but let's say you have one of those guys that sort of semi radar  that's a team where you could make a roster move again two games over the next seven days there are some teams out there that have  four over that span so you could get an extra two games played over the next seven game days but that again that's really the only team  where you got it that bad  and then the pals have a game on Wednesday of next week and then they've got it back to back Friday Saturday so they're scheduled does get a little bit better  and again I think that maybe the overarching thing is there that team doesn't really have  like Fringe players that are on rosters right now that team has a bunch of guys that are definitely on rosters and a bunch of guys that are definitely not  and then Phoenix you do have some Fringe guys there like a Roy so Neil who might lose value of Booker comes back sometime in the next day days Eric Gordon who you guys know I hate from a fantasy standpoint but he's on some rosters right now  you could make the move there and try to go to one of the teams that we're talking about that has a good schedule so let's get to that part of it let's talk about the teams that actually do have some sort of Advantage going today those teams are the Chicago Bulls which uh certainly one of the best ones they have six games over the next nine days Chicago schedule they go back to back today tomorrow they also play on Saturday if you needed to move on on Sunday you could in a pinch but I would strongly suggest hanging on for all nine of those days because it helps you get off to a really good start next week as well  the Portland Trail Blazers are my second favorite Choice that's a team that I've liked since Monday of this week they all have six games over the next nine days old it's a little bit differently because they're today they're on tomorrow they're off and then they go to a five games in seven days stretch support Portland schedule actually gets really really good starting on Friday but you could extend it two days early because six and nine is still a pretty darn good span of games  the Warriors have a back-to-back and then they all go into a three games in four nights situation  with the game on Saturday and then they also start next week with the game on Monday so you get off to an okay start next week as well so that's a three and four or four and six and then Sacramento has the weakest of the okay schedule right now they go back to back today tomorrow but then they're off for two days then they go three times in four nights which takes you Sunday Tuesday Wednesday of next week that's pretty good you get two games of first three days it's not perfect so Sacramento would be certainly the farthest down the totem pole  still as we talk about it Sacramento has five games over the next eight days  as we just talked about Phoenix has two or three so that's an opportunity to gain two games with one roster move and then similarly with Chicago and Portland compared to some of these teams we were talking about like the Pelicans who have three games over the next one two three four five six seven eight nine days you actually get a three-game bump by moving to Portland OR Chicago over the Pelicans that's actually kind of insane  like at least  Phoenix has four games over that span so it's a two game bump there  and there are plenty of teams that have five games over that span but those are not teams that you're probably moving on from okay now we've established the teams that we like over the next stretch which again very few short ones like you're going Warriors you're going Sacramento you're doing it for flexibility and somehow you have a whole lot of roster moves left to use this week again not the direction I would fall with that one but you can think about it before I tell you the players that I want you guys to use I want you to again take a moment to go find me over on Twitter at Danbury a lot of you guys are watching on social right now so please take a moment to like the video you're watching and follow the person who's making it this is how we can continue to grow everything going on here I think I've figured something out about the algorithm today you can also of course catch this stuff after the fact over on YouTube if you missed it earlier you can also catch it on traditional pod channels without the video element iTunes Spotify all that good stuff that is fantasy NBA today the name of the show and our partners over at manscaped.com use promo code ethos 2-0  yeah you got that right ethos 2-0 for 20% off and free shipping on your order at where was it again manscape.com I'm gonna throw it up on the screen for those that are watching the video there is your code and there's your stuff that you can get for it uh shout out also by the way to Blake creamer our former hockey Maven here still a hockey Maven just formally of sports ethos one of my favorite people out there on this fine Earth he appreciates goofy 80s and 90s stuff as much as I do that's correct Bobby's World was Howie Mandel  that was back when you was just like a comedian and not a show or maybe he was a show host then was this it was this late 80s or was this early 90s  who knows I was a kid  Bobby was the friend all right let's get back to it so now you've heard and I'm gonna take the schedule off the screen for a moment now you've heard the teams that you should be looking at what about the players on those teams how do you narrow it down to someone that should actually be on your roster well here's the names that kind of popped into my head and yes some good some bad Chicago is really only one name that's not heavily rostered and that's Andre Drummond  I someone hit me with the tweet that was like hey Alex Russo's on The Wire I don't know what he's doing on the wire but yes I saw he belongs on rosters  Portland probably has your best options here you're gonna have to wait on injury reports from those dudes because half of the Blazers are questionable tonight to Monica tomorrow being one of them he's questionable with an illness but if he plays he was a guy that was starting to do stuff even with some of these other guys in the lineup like Jeremy Grant was in the lineup and Kamara was still doing some stuff  Jabari Walker is someone that not I don't really like his Fantasy game all that much but six games in nine days is hard to argue with like even for guys that sucks six games in nine days is really good do Opera DeAndre Aiden is doubtful for Portland's game meaning that he's probably a couple of games away if he does come back from coming back and then Chris Murray who's not putting up much in the way of stats but again six games over nine days you kind of have to think about the alternative like think about who you might be dropping if it's a pelican they only have three games over that span but a lot of teams only have four games over the next nine days what more are you getting out of someone like Chris Murray who you know over the last two weeks  he hasn't been particularly good but he hasn't been the worst player in fantasy which I know glowing recommendation he's like number one seventy five one eighty over that span  about 8 points five boards one and a half steals bad percentages so that's part of it two and a half assists as well  on 33 minutes per ball game so you're talking about a guy with a pretty crummy fantasy stat set but you're talking about the possibility of playing 100 and 180 minutes over nine days they're just aren't many guys that can compete with that and let's say Murray suddenly has an okay stretch of shooting where it's not at 36% now you get one three-pointer do you get 10 points in five boards and over a steel per game like nine steals over nine days is what he'd be at if he continued at that pace that's weak changing stuff from a guy who's pretty bad at fantasy sports you know Kamara is a similar thing the percentages are killing these guys your Barry Walker the lack of stuff besides rebounding is kind of killing him do operate doesn't really rebound from the center position Matisse the Bible is all so questionable but what if you got six games out of Bible over the next nine days do it get you 15 steals  so Portland's probably my favorite spot to go but you can't really make a move until we actually see who's playing for them later today other names to consider Andrew Wiggins if he got dropped with the warriors on a better schedule but shorter and he's got you just hold throughout Brandon Putski if he got dropped all so with the back-to-back the three and four and four and six for those guys and then for Sacramento this would be probably just for the back-to-back but Kevin herder has a cooled a lot after kind of a warm span he's probably on The Wire because Sacramento has the weakest of the better schedule's I don't think that I would go farther down the king's rabbit hole then Kevin huerter because the other guys you move pretty far basically once you get past herder who's in a guy that can hang out between 100 and 150 then you get into Trey Lyles who's like number 250 and then no one else on the team even plays Beyond those dudes  I guess Harrison Barnes could be on some wires he'd be one that you could play on the back-to-back but again like you got to have a lot of weekly moves in the chamber if you're gonna make a move to a King right now I would rather as you guys know I would rather long stream in the playoffs and long stream like three roster slots so you using one point three three three three three move moves per streaming slot per week  and when you pick up a guy like a blazer  or a bull right now  and hold him for nine days you're using one roster slot over at 10 days span basically a week and a half so that gives you now three moves to use over that well more than three I guess he was all the week and a half it gives you more like five moves to use over a week and a half instead of four that's more than that six right either way so you got a lot you get more wiggle room is what I'm saying if you're trying to average 1.33 moves per streaming slot per week and for that slot you've used like 0.67 moves per slot per week it allows you to use the other three moves on two slots which is one and a half so now you can use one and a half moves per slot in those other ones you could do two in one one and the other whatever they're all these teams that are playing five and seven these days and I went 15 minutes anyway even though I said I wasn't going to do it and that's basically what you're setting on tonight this is not a big day for streaming moves this is probably a day if you use a move or two on Monday and Tuesday to kind of sit on things as much as you want it cash in or weakly move and yes obviously the Blazers are a good team to move to but they were all so good team to move to two days ago and they will be a good team to move to two days from today so unless you have someone on the pills where you can add three games over nine days  or someone like we talked about on one of those other low tide teams this is probably a day that you will largely be  staying put uh quick look at the chat room here to see if there's anything on the streaming side that I didn't get into I don't trust that lost guy says I don't trust pods and Wiggins Moody's back in the lineup along with CP that changes the whole minutes in the lineup yeah I mean I guess so moody basically moved in because Wiggins was out I certainly understand the brain and put GMC side with Chris Paul back in there but for a back-to-back you're not going to do much better than two games and two nights for either of those guys and frankly I think Wiggins could actually put up some okay numbers on the back-to-back so he might more okay with should I drop Julius Randle if I'm in week one of my playoffs yeah man he ain't coming back for at least another week or two and probably longer Marvin Bagley or Malik monk it's got to be monke bagley's hurt he can't be taking 0 is in your playoffs right now presuming that you are asking about a streaming decision because this is a streaming show we will once again address rest of season stuff  on our morning show the rest of season show  thanks for watching Everybody
