welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast are we got a pretty cool day lined up for you everybody here  good morning good day managed to get this show actually started in the morning  on all US time zones by three minutes  I got you East Coasters  I got you  everybody else it's an easy one  I'm Dan best birthday this is fantasy NBA today it's our Thursday morning recap show  we'll be going over what happened last night kind of a medium sized Wednesday card medium card every day this week which is honestly the way it should be that's the way the schedule should be we should have six seven eight games basically every day  no 13 game cards that's stupid no one or two game cards that's all so stupid  I know  complaining on deaf ears  doesn't matter you guys saw the thumbnail  he's been in there a few times lately the great key on Ellis will be at the center of our discussion day we also had some injury news that floated in will start the show actually with some injury news  which  sadly  it's Jalen Johnson related  he's out at least a week  meaning if you're in your playoffs  you might not have a choice but to drop Jalen Johnson which is just  the worst  I don't know if I think Yahoo has given him the injured tag so if you're an elite that has a couple of extra injured slots that's one day what that maybe you might be able to dodge it so you don't have to wait any additional ball game so I guess that was  kind of like a little bit of a silver lining on the whole thing that you can wedge him somewhere  but if you're out of injured slots you're gonna have a very difficult call to make so that sucks  crummy news of the morning but don't worry we have so much to talk about on the key on Ellis for rent that you'll forget all about the bad news as we work our way through it follow me over on social at Danbury please make sure you do that and then also please make sure you subscribe however you're taking in the podcast want to make sure that you guys are listeners Watchers viewers whatever you want to call it every day you can be that's part of what allows us to continue growing  and with that  we Embark upon this wonderful journey through yesterday's results Miami at Cleveland will start at the front end and wander our way through Jimmy Butler's back bam Edibles out  who cares I say someone tongue in cheek also just realized I don't have my water at the table with me so we'll be taking a mid show 20 second break to go fetch that  Butler 37 minutes went all Jimmy Butler on everybody this is what he does at this time of year weird rest of the lineup here though cuz no Duncan Robinson and no Tyler Hero on top of that so it's sort of like this nesting doll situation Thomas Bryant got the start at Center but he only played 15 minutes did have 10 rebounds in 15 minutes but who cares  can't trust to do in 15 Nic had 14 and 6 in his start at Power Forward don't care Patty Mills had 10 points a couple of steals in his 25 minutes of a start he got a start in this game don't care  I'm a jaquez tends to not be particularly valuable when Jimmy Butler is in and then the big disappointment for me was Caleb Martin I figured he would do more he did play 32 bench minutes but he didn't do much with them he's a guy that if this configuration sticks for another ballgame I might consider rolling a Caleb Martin out there but you know at best you're talking about a 50/50 place so probably  this is just sort of like the goofy missing pieces if Duncan Robinson was back you'd play him if hero or bam was in Utah play them but you have the wrong guys out to create streaming value behind them  care silver he's drugging along he's working he's trying to replace Donovan Mitchell easier said that done calves are I think kind of running out of gas in terms of the how do we replace missing Stars this year situation because they've had a lot of missed ball games  and they've been able to hang in there  for the most part they went on that nice winning kick the first time everybody went down but you just like Donovan Mitchell's a 49 game's Darius garlands at 45 Mobley is at 38 Jared Allen is basically the only starter on this team now Max Drew's out for a while too Jared Allen's the only starter that hasn't really gone down for any extended period  he missed a few games here and there but nothing substantial  oh as far as what to do obviously Karis Levert is a go George and yang is an interesting fill-in for Max Drew so it's basically for three pointers you know 15 shots is good we didn't do much besides shoot threes and he does that relatively well mind you but there is a whole lot more to it  so he has that Corey kispert level appeal  I thought I was a core would be better and again I think I'd probably play a Chorro if someone came back out and was like Hey Dad everybody's gonna steal be out in their next ball game and a Corso get to play 38 minutes I'll be like all right yeah I'll probably play that dude so bad ball game for Isaac but overall he's playable when he's getting this number of minutes  I think I'd like it better if Levert was coming off the bench I don't know that they have the pieces to do that right now but that would in my eyes make a coral a little bit more valuable because then you'd get a one of the usage guys out of the starting five keep an eye on that  as far as games cap Rodeo Games cap situations are concerned Levert is the only one where you're like yeah that's that's a definite Burger board play niang is again specialist D and then a chorus kind of coin flippy although I do sort of lean to yes on him even after a bad ball game  Indiana beat Detroit to know one surprise Detroit is missing a handful of people right now if you're looking at the Indiana side and you're wondering what the hell happened here first of all blow out so that's why the minutes are all caca may be and then I say Jackson got 29 minutes also because Myles Turner was in pretty significant foul trouble five fouls and 19 and a half minutes for big miles TJ McConnell continues to rumble off the bench at six turnovers here which bad but everything else is pretty much the way it's been this is like his number now 13 and 513 and 6 with the Steeler too  can you dig it I can dig it and then Aaron Nesmith who's like the softest hold and known to man if he plays if this game required a fourth quarter and everybody got another eight or nine minutes niece was probably puts up a good enough line to where I'm not having to say you barely hold on like you know 14 points a block a couple of three pointers is not a bad starting point here and if you added another basically 30% to his Ledger you're talking about you know another four points another rebound whatever it like whatever comes in that fourth quarter would have elevated him to a pretty clear nine cat play so neat Miss Neath myth Aaron Smith have a little marble mouth over here  niece Smith it's a soft hole  oh boy rolling downhill aren't we  for Detroit Cade was back and he looked pretty good he's been  quietly solid the second half of this season he's never gonna get to where anybody wanted him to be because he got drafted way too high he's number 94  on a per game basis but at least that's better than where he was the beginning of the year I think he's been like 60 ish range the second half without checking so that's fine Jalen Duren also a play and dot dot dot that's pretty much where you leave it because Jaden Ivey tends to be not a nine cat guy when Kate is in more of a points League level dude azer Thompson and Isaiah Stewart each got ruled out for the remainder of the regular season which sounds terrifying but it's basically three weeks so it's like  it's not that long anymore for someone to be ruled out for the rest of season still we hope that Thompson's all right it sounds like his situation turned into a blood clot or they said illness at first and blah blah blah he's traveling with the team is what Monty Williams said yesterday so that's a good sign hopefully that means he'll be all right in short order but there's no reason to push him back in there same same deal for Isaiah Stewart who's a little bit of a lunatic but was a really nice schedule play here lately  so basically what you're doing is if you're in Roto you're sitting on some other fun Tech you because when he comes back he's gonna have a whole bunch of things to do because the guys that were around him aren't going to be there anymore  there's no threat of Thompson coming back there's no threat of Stewart coming back so check your wire see a fun Tech heels floating around he's a mustache guy on the Roto side I get it you can't really use a brass or slot on him and head to head  and then if you're looking at replacement level dudes here they're just warranty like legitimately look at the fantasy lines in this game  if metoo could get 30 minutes I might say okay that direction  wiseman's and I like Wiseman be the guy you'd look at but that would require Duren to be down who's like the one remaining healthy starter on this team for the moment Stanley umude a leftist ball game early he played clothes like to a mid 20s and in the previous ball game but he didn't do anything so nope  to son here 30 minutes don't care  all right here's a competitive ballgame Sacramento beat Toronto by 34 points  way to keep it closed Raptors Keyon freaking Ellis okay wait let's do the Raptors first cuz I want to come back and scream key on Nellis is name again because we've been  talking pretty highly relatively highly of him here on the podcast as far as a Raptors go  we just need them to keep a ball game competitive because right now  and like you know the amazing thing is like they're so short-handed that a lot of the regulars had to get near 30 minutes anyway even at all game that was long since over so like Gary Trent is an easy yes in every format Kelly Olynyk is a yes for me in every format someone was like oh no Kelly Olynyk he's falling apart dude  9 3 and 4 with two blocks and a three pointer on good percentages that's fine if that's the bad game  awesome we're okay  so those two guys are obvious yeses for me and then there's a bunch of sort of semi question marks I think Bruce Brown is probably a yes because of his across the board production ability but it's not locked in and he might end up in the doesn't matter group but I feel like he's a doesn't matter guy right now with a little bit of upside because the manual quickly is out and we have no idea when he's coming back RJ Barrett is out we don't know when he's coming back I think it's personal for both of those guys we know the RJ Barrett situation we don't really know the quickly one  which then makes you take one sort of sideways glance at oh shy abaji  who played 30 minutes and he did have three steals but the other stuff was bit lacking  then usually shoot all that much he did take 10 in this game which was kind of new and interesting if suddenly he decides he wants to take 10 shots or more then I'll get in on the abace train but until that time I'm in sort of a holding pattern yeah I'm comfortable with that Boston took care of Milwaukee without Drew Holland oh we forgot to go back to the Kings cheese Dan come on get it together and then after this I'm gonna get my water so you know  wait  for the Kings this game was over early and was better reflected in the number of minutes that guys get you know who gets punished when the Kings blow somebody out  Malik monk because he would normally play the end of the third quarter and then most of the fourth quarter  but in here he played the end of the third quarter and then like the first two minutes of the fourth and then he was just done because nobody needed to come back into the ballgame  so if you're worried about his minutes it just has to do with rotations and blow out Harrison Barnes left and then all came back but who cares I mean Harrison Barnes is more of a schedule level play Dave Young Mitchell is like your deeper League schedule have type of play  Monkees a goal obviously Fox and sabonis or go and now let's talk about key on Ellis who a lot of people are gonna look at this line and see six points  and say what on Earth could be the reason that Dan is so ridiculously over the top excited about him  but  in my eyes the reason is is incredibly cleaner he is Keon Ellis is your next defensive whiz kid of the NBA  over the last two weeks he's averaged 25 minutes a game and 3.2 combined defensive stats which mind you over an entire season probably is unsustainable I will very much give you that guys that put up these types of defensive numbers and give that type of defensive energy on every possession which is sort of like a Jalen Suggs level defensive energy  those guys end up running out of gas at some point  we saw with Suggs too there's a you pay the price at some point for going that hard all the time  you just end up going through a little bit of a slump a fatigue slump  but the beauty of this situation is but we don't know how long Kevin heard hers out another game or two maybe maybe more maybe a little bit less we don't know  but the king's need out of Ellis is this sort of short-term burst  he's probably not going to be their starter the rest of the way all the I wouldn't be that surprised to be ended up starting games in the playoffs when they needed him to lock down an opposing  high scoring guard threat which a lot of teams in the Western Conference have like you know I don't have it looked at the standings like the way they hold the kings in the standings at least six seed right now  yeah Kings of the six seed right now so they'd have the Wolves to open it up  not really a  guard-heavy team more of a wing and forward heavy team  so maybe not the best example maybe you don't see a ton of key on Alice and that particular matchup because they don't need him to go lock down Mike Conley but let's say that let's say the standings shift  and the King's fall back a slot to the seven and then they come out of the play-in tournament and if to play the nuggets  you know don't think they put key on Ellis on Jamal Murray  I sure do  oh don't like get Kevin herder just get toasted for a quarter before they make the switch  that seems nuts  but you guys don't care about the playoffs you guys care about the right now the reason I bring this up is because we're only talking about what ends up being about a four week sample size  possibly that's at most that's like if her missed the rest of the regular season which I don't think the indication is that anything like that is about to happen if we're talking about a one week a two weeks sample size  guys like Ellis can go full bore for that long without really paying the sort of energy tax on the tail end of it go nuts for two weeks when you dial you back off the bench after that when the team gets healthy whatever the situation may be  so I actually think that and I don't know about five defensive stats in a ballgame but over three defensive stats in a game feels actually pretty sustainable for him in the very short term  10 days 15 days kind of thing  does anything else happen well that remains to be seen if you're looking at sort of the recent numbers here for Ellis over the last two weeks he's at 7 points three boards which is like nothing one and a half three pointers and then the big defensive stats and basically no turnovers  so on five shots a game by the way and he took six in this ball game lo and behold like if he gets a six or seven shots a game  combined with the defensive stats you're now talking about a guy that could actually put up top 50 super short term numbers  on the shoulders of over three defensive stats and you know again like six shots a game gets him to what 8 points eight and a half points  one and a half to two three pointers a game that's all you need in nine cat when someone's getting that many defensive stats so that's why I'm so excited about it and someone brought up a good point over on social media like what if he has a game where he only gets one steal and no blocks is it going to be a really bad game yes yeah  but you got to remember how things average out you know five defensive stat game here like look at the dudes game log lately have we missed some of them maybe defensive stats for Keon Ellis over the last five games are three four three six and five  if you think he averages out to just around three defensive stats the six and a five  basically means that there's a 0 coming up in there someplace or you know maybe a couple of ones or like a one and a two or something like that that's going to bring the average back down to that more reasonable marker  but if you think key on Ellis can go above that  then maybe you don't think there's as fast to fall off either way Kings have a great schedule going right now on top of everything else he's the guy that in my eyes could help you win  two defensive stats not and I said this on yesterday show he's not gonna like when you them by himself but Sacramento starts next week front loaded on Monday Tuesday back to back  what if you got to start next if you're seasoned continues in your in your playoffs what do you got to start next week with back to back key on Ellis games and he comes out and he gives you six Steals and two blocks over those two games what an amazing way to start your week you put yourself in the driver's seat you force your opponent to start thinking about categories maybe they weren't thinking about going for  I just think there's so many reasons to want to put key on Ellis on your team  in my eyes at least  I have been a few spots frankly I wish I had him in more  all right I said I was gonna get water after that one so I'm gonna get water after that one and then we're gonna talk Milwaukee in Boston so sit tight everybody I be right back  Milwaukee there we go no Yannis sorry for screaming in your ears everybody know Giannis so that means Bobby Portis gets to go huge again and he did khris Middleton looked pretty good he'll sit out the back-to-back most likely and so then you'll get a Malik Beasley game  but Beasley overall is trending down  which we kind of knew was going to be the case when Middleton came back if you want to pre-empt it for schedule play folks Milwaukee does have a good schedule next week because they go on the the quality days but in terms of like a games cat play that's gonna be a pass for me  Boston know Drew holiday in this ball game so it sounds like he might actually be dealing with a real injury which meant Payton Pritchard now boy what a stream he's becoming this five game in seven day stretch for Boston two big games before Sam Houser went down or he might have also been in that same mix and now Boston goes into another back-to-back starting tomorrow where you know at least half of the starters well shouldn't say at least half but around half of the starters are going to sit out the front end and the other half are going to sit out the back end of that back-to-back  probably shouldn't refer to it as a back end  now what's done is done so pritchard's gonna crush and Al Horford's gonna be great in the one of those two games that he plays in  and that's probably about as far as you go with you know others on Boston  maybe Luke cornette has an okay game mixed in there but Pritchard is a guy you can use an all formats for that back to back in my opinion  Oklahoma City there's nothing on the OKC side they have an out of fantasy note in Forever this ball game was over earlier than the final score might indicate even though if you look at the OKC side you see shape played 33 minutes they basically left him in the ball game to get to 30 points okay he's trying to run up his number of 30 point games I think they wanted to try to get him up to that marker she's averaging 30.9 on the year and I think they want him to average 30 so whatever they're doing what they're doing out there the Jazz are the more interesting team here and interesting I mean extremely confusing  Locker Kessler's a start calling Sexton's a star John Collins as a start  Larry marketing when he plays is a start keyonte George is generally a start although you're gonna get these hyper inefficient games Blended in and because he doesn't get that many defensive stats there isn't really a floor so you down through the floor deep down underground he goes for some of these ball games but I think George is generally a go  and then taeler Hendrix is the guy you're looking at sort of going can I  you got three blocks in this one which saved what was otherwise it relatively quiet line and that makes me think probably not  Rodeo games I don't think I'm gonna do it in terms of like a nice scheduling spot yeah obviously Utah's had a good schedule going since Friday of last week it rolls basically through the end of next week that you know they four games this week for games next week and then with the two games at the end of last week that it's it's pretty well clustered not great but I mean it is pretty damn good and then for this week you know they've got the second half of a back-to-back tonight and then they play again on Saturday if you wanted to get off of a jazz you could do so on Sunday but I didn't save you all that much  I had to headers fine rotors I think we gave you our names they're already  Clippers beat up on the Blazers this ball game again was not quite as close as it looked all the regulars for the clips mostly got normal minutes it was good to see the regulars put up better ball games  if it's a zubats finally had a better one he tends to be kind of streaky so maybe this is the start of a slightly better performance for him the issue of course for zubats right now is that the Clippers have all three of their centers healthy so zubats Daniel theis behind him Mason Plumlee behind him all of those guys are getting into these games and then it becomes really hard for Zoo to get more than about 25 minutes which he needs to have fantasy value  he's sitting right now in the that kind of that no man's land that doesn't matter area in about 26 and change minutes per ball game but he's been trending the wrong way and that's the thing you got to be worried about over his last month zoos at number one 30 and that was still by the way in a round 26 minutes of ball game for the last couple of weeks he's a 25 minutes a game thanks to some good percentages he's also kinda holding in that  130 range  and then over the last two weeks he shooting 73% and 93 at the free throw line so he's sort of overextending himself there he probably always gonna be in that doesn't matter group and then yesterday's game able to he was actually slightly behind it and then he had this big ball game yesterday so he sort of bumped himself back into the doesn't matter group  I think that's where he sits if you need big man stats great if you don't you don't he's right on that borderline do with him as you see fit it's not gonna kill you either way and then for Portland you got some truly awful games DeAndre Aiden was bad Anthony Simons was bad you got a better game out of Chris Murray  clap your hands if you saw that one coming not me  the little band had 12 points but took him 12 shots to get there so that was rough scoot at 185 and 2 that was a little bit better for him at least Jabari Walker had 12 points in a couple of steals you have so many  very risky questionable  guys on this Portland team and you have just the two main starters that you should use against a roto games cap Aiden and Simon's  that's it  I think we're down to the last two here last two ball games yeah last two Philly  worst game of the year for Tyrese Maxey coming in the head-to-head finals for me um so annoyed about that Kelly oubre is off and rolling though these days didn't shoot the ball great but had six more defensive stats so he's coming along and Paul Reed at 5 defensive stats and got 28 minutes and I'm still like  there isn't much more I can say about Paul Reed are there than that I have this weird Sinking Feeling  but yet he continues to do enough and the minutes were better in this one so that was good to see  he remains I'll say the same thing I've said after and this is why I need that page of fringy fantasy players where I just catalog how I feel about everybody the blurb right now if I would write one on Paul Reed is technically he's a start period  I'm still worried about it period but technically he's a start  period  Kyle Lowry assists stream only  that's it  Phoenix got another Whopper out of Grayson Allen what a hell of a season that dude's had  where is he ranked now in nine cat  52  wow almost into the fourth round  2.93 pointers a game and he's shooting 51% from the field  to get that many threes from a guy who's helping your field goal percent is  truly magical they think there's only two dudes in the NBA that were doing it it was  it was great now and Larry marking and who now has fallen off actually said 48% from the field so I think Grayson Allen is the only player in the NBA hitting around 33 pointers a game  and all so shooting 50%  yeah  Kyrie Irving is all so right there he's at 49% but that's your guy  Grayson Allen best combination of field goal percent in three-pointers in the NBA  crazy  start the starters I know Bradley Beal out of bad ball game but start the starters that's it for Phoenix  easy handicap that was fun wasn't it worthwhile game to look at Memphis and Golden State so Golden State and actually both sides of this game have some stuff to talk about for Memphis we know they're playing their main guys against teams that are in the playoff hunt they're trying to be sort of honestly spoilers but they're trying to maintain the Integrity of the closing run and then it's like they're more willing to bench their key guys against crapper teams so they can continue to lose those ball games  they've got the Spurs tomorrow and we don't know what they're going to do because technically the Spurs are a crapper team  San Antonio 15 and 54 but they're four and six in their last 10 among the crapper teams the Spurs are basically playing the best  in the NBA  of all the tank goes  so I don't know Grizzlies might play some of their guys but they really need to make sure they lose this game Grizzlies are 23 and 47 and you know there are a half game behind the Raptors they got to make sure they stay back of that I don't know that they can fall far enough to drop behind the Blazers who are also quite terrible but they got to make sure that they don't accidentally pass someone so who's gonna play I don't know  when they play reasonable competition this is the lineup you're seeing  possibly plus Luke Kennard when he comes back  so Desmond Bane Jaren Jackson Jr those guys are easy start decisions when Luke conchar starting and playing 30 plus minutes I'm pretty comfortable playing him  I know he didn't score in this game but he still had seven boards five assists in a steal and usually he'll get you a three-pointer or another defensive stat  contract is an amazing punt points play right now  but I think he's generally good enough in the other stuff that even if you're not punting points he sits inside the top 100  Santi aldama apparently I was way too early on being bullish on him last month because now he's finally figured it out and the key seems to be that he needed to get better players around him so that he was a little more open because he's firing away all of a sudden taking more shots now alongside the two big usage guys and he did when they were gone GG Jackson scored 35 points he's on a heater right now aldam is on a sort of a semi heater as well but he does more things across the board boards assists steals block stuff like that  why am I kind of splitting hairs between these two guys well with aldama if you have decent percentages he becomes very very good  for GG Jackson when you have decent percentages he becomes okay the they're just they sit aldama sits a little bit higher than Jackson because of the across the board ability where Jackson is more about points and threes and very little else and if the other stuff happens it's massive gravy but if it doesn't  then you see that sort of like we just saw with counted George if the shots aren't falling the line looks ugly really fast like very empty so  for head to headers Memphis has kind of a  crummy schedule especially starting today they play one game over four days they have three games over nine days coming up here which is pretty clunky also not not like the worst in the universe but pretty bad if you were trying to schedule play Someone Like A Jake levia or even a GG Jackson frankly you're probably looking for a team that's playing say five games over those eight days and get the two extra ball games in there as far as games cap goes would I it's an old it's an old joke I can't tell it because it's a little bit offensive  what I play  aldama against the games cap in their next game  against a wembanyama  like maybe without the two  mostly Star level guys  I'm gonna say yeah  would I play GG Jackson against the game's cap I'm gonna probably say no  although gosh if everybody's out and he's in there and he's taking 20 shots how can I say no you know maybe I'll say yes on both of them for this next game against the Spurs don't know if Luke Kennards gonna be back yet if he is and he starts I would play Luke Kennard because you're probably gonna get 10 plus points and you're probably gonna get six plus assists on decent percentages with a bunch of three-pointers  then I be will a little more worried about conchar and you might see the regulars see their minutes ratcheted back in that ball game even if they're not into a full rest game so like let's say JJ plays he might only play 22 minutes or Khan I'd only play 25 minutes and set of 33 or Kennard might only play 25 minutes so you gotta be really careful in these games against other tanking teams for the Grizzlies and that's why they're so hard to add on the head to head side Roto it's not that tough you just bench him for a game worry about it the next time around because I think next week the Grizzlies play all good teams  nuggets Lakers magic yeah  week after that they got two competitive teams and two non-competitive ones so that would be a tougher one for some of these guys  and then the Warriors kaminga nice ball game he's a play every day Chris Paul doubled he's a play every day Klay and Steph are plays every day and then you get into The Fringe or ones which The Fringe your Warriors for me right now or Wiggins Draymond Green and Trace Jackson Davis could Brandon puts officially a drop  this is the kind of ball game that's gonna make them all look very good because they put up 137 points against the team not playing any defense  Wiggins going for 22 and 10 is lovely but he had had I don't know how many games in a row before this of  relatively uninspiring basketball not bad but uninspiring  before he had his family thing which sounds like it's not great I think there was a report that like you know his brother left to go deal with family stuff as well he was playing pretty pretty good ball you know High Teens and scoring a couple of three pointers a game four or five rebounds two or three assists he was getting about a steal a little more than a steal a little less than a block that was pretty good  he's come back from that and while his minutes have come up we haven't seen much Beyond about 15 points and four-ish rebounds  they're just they're sort of needs to be a little bit more yes five steals over eight games and only two blocks over those eight games since coming back so that's hasn't really been enough  and then he sort of caught fire in this one  so I wonder is this a game that wakes him up a little bit  they've got Indiana that'll be a high scoring game coming up so maybe it's another opportunity for Wiggins I think he's generally a little bit over rostered his number 215 on the year I know he's been better than that lately 1:30 range over the last month  we gets probably falls into that doesn't matter grouping  which again that's fine if you need some points and some rebounds and one and a half threes and probably a steal  that's fine but you're likely not going to get that many games like this where you sort of Blows the roof off you're gonna mostly get games that are almost exactly like 15 and 5 and then every once in a while you're gonna get an 11 and 4 game and then every once in a while you're gonna get a 20 and 9 game and it's gonna even back out to 15 and 5 basically  15 and 6 something like that so it's not bad  but it's not all that great and the Draymond Green had 10 12 and 7 in this ball game and he at least in my opinion is very much like a punt points level guy only right now he's also in the doesn't matter fan club  it's pretty amazing actually I'm so glad I came up with that name for a group because it's there's a lot of players in there where it's like damn what should I do with this guy  doesn't matter  last month dream on is 157 because he's shooting 43% from the field instead of high 40s that like that's the only difference he goes back up to high 40s he's at 8 points 8 and a half rebounds and six assists with little less than a steel little less than a block when he shoots in the low 40s is it 7 points and eight rebounds and six assists and that's the difference between 120 and 160 basically so Draymond pretty much a punt Points Guy very much a doesn't matter level dude and then Trace Jackson Davis who's minutes have been sticking in the mid-20s now admittedly he got a couple extra here because the game was over but it does seem like he's carved out a role in this range he was awful at the free-throw line yesterday so it kind of Tanked some teams with a one for four 13 and 5 with a couple of blocks would be pretty good if the free throws weren't a mess but I you know they'll find large be probably not all that great  he's more in my opinion I don't think I'm using him against a roto games cap I you know had to head Warriors have a good schedule this week and next week and the week after that and the week after that they run fours the rest of the day  so that's fine I'm going to go Jackson Davis all fours down the stretch I'm okay with that but Roto I don't think I'm quite there  if comingo or Draymond misses a game I'd probably fire him up get that extra two three minutes a few more big man stats  on the Roto side two  but before that I think I probably lean to know  in Roto  had her so different right now they're so different with the playoffs going on I had the fantasy playoffs going on  Rodeo Leaguers are sort of stat hunting at this point you need your best guys in there but you also need to be targeting specific categories  which is why we're doing two shows a day frankly because there's just like there's almost no overlap  because you can't you know with Roto if we get a team where there's like three guys ruled out at the last minute there's an awesome opportunity for it for a guy to step into 35 minutes and way more usage but I had to head you can't use a roster move on that guy and then have to drop him the next day you need to use your moves judiciously you need to be adding games to your Ledger  use a roster move on one guy who's supposed to step into a big role and he doesn't like you've blown up your whole week  you need to be long streaming unless your season ends in four days in which case  your long stream is four days long  can't believe this week isn't even half over yet I'm stressing man finals week feels like it should be half over  it'll be half over one half of the games today you're done  take some deep breaths  I got some questions about Mitchell Robinson sounds like he's close he's participated in practice for the Nicks I mean they'll bring him along somewhat slowly here so I wouldn't expect him to play more than about 17 18 minutes in his first ball game but he gets into the mid-20s  then he becomes a playable dude so keep an eye on that head-to-head you can't get out in front Roto check to see if he's on the wire you can sort of stick them on your bench and get some juicy defensive stats mixed in there some rebounds some field goal percent that's something to sort of  consider in passing  what's a chat room got for us today  let's see here do do is Brooke Lopez droppable after this week that's so that's a little bit more of a streaming question the answer is a hard no because he plays all three  quality days next week meaning you might pick up somebody that's a four game week going Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday but you might not be able to use them for any of them so no hold on to all of your buckaroos and all of your Pelle Pelle Pelle screams my kids have been watching Umizoomi those two teams play Tuesday Thursday Saturday next week those are coveted teams for next week  why are JJJ and Bain doubtful on the injury status page so that's the basketball monster injury Page by the way and it's because they've been resting against Bad teams so that it's a it's a guest that they rest against the Spurs we don't know we don't know  do I think Wendy Jalen brown or Zion rest on their back-to-backs Zion has been resting periodically on back-to-back so I would keep one eye on him  Wendy's been playing there as lately and they've lost plenty of ball games so I'm gonna say that I think Zion probably  you know I had the Pelicans are number of the five seed they really don't want to fall back to the seven  I think if Zion is capable they'll play him  Jaylen Brown will rest one half of the back-to-back that one I feel quite comfortable with  do you see Bam's injury being longer than a one game absence you know what I don't know I don't know they were able to win without him  when we know that he do not rush guys back that's just not their mold if they go into the playoffs is the 10-seat they don't even really care cuz they feel like they can get their  trying to remember what I read on the BAM thing yesterday I mean backs are weird I think at this time of year you have to assume guys are out for more than one game but um and then get sort of pleasantly surprised if they're not certainly if you're in head-to-head you got to hold through tomorrow if it gets ruled out for tomorrow then you probably pick somebody up with still has two games the rest of the way there's only one team that has three games left it's the Pelicans and the options there for streaming or not particularly good  a Kong was back again is Capella a soft Hold Ya Cabela's a soft hold he'll be he'll be just barely good enough I'm okay with that  Chris Paul Payton Pritchard or Keon Ellis  I don't know if we're talking head to head a road oh if it's Roto and you're going rest of season it's Chris Paul if it's  Rodeo for the next two ballgames it's Pritchard  I don't think Alice wins my wins wins this in wrote over for me and almost any situation for head to head it's probably Ellis because his schedule is so good  for a tanking team Spurs have been playing their players compared to the Wizards Blazers and Grizzlies yeah I mean the Wizards played their guys until like four days ago so I don't want to give them too much heat  you know the Grizzlies guys they all got hurt and they started resting everybody yeah I mean the Spurs are playing their guys that I think they got tired of being the absolute bottom of the barrel  and they want to see a little bit of growth there is something to be said for guys feeling better if they kind of grow towards the end of the year but anything can happen where three weeks to the end it's gonna be weird guys  who do you like most for defensive stats key on Ellis Isaiah hardenstein on Echo kangwoo it's probably Ellis for me believe it or not  should I drop ogn and Obi for Deuce McBride well if you're in your playoffs you probably have to drop in a no because I think they said they expected him to miss a couple of ball games and you really can't take zeros I don't know about McBride starting all of them for the Nicks I think there was a little bit of a matchup thing happening there  where it was a Warriors last ball game right yeah so they had a key  defensive matchup at the guard spot that they wanted McBride on they might go bigger against the Nuggets kind of have to wait and see later on tonight with their starting lineup looks like  not you Marshall with an ad for streaming yeah I mean yeah kinda you know he's got three games in four days here so basically and then they all play on the light days next week and then you just like prey  because they got a great schedule coming up  six games over eight days sorry six games over 10 days my bad uh but  three of those games are bonus days next week and you got the three and four this week where you don't have any overflow  and so you know you just hope that you get something out of it  now that'll wrap us up fun stuff coming up later on today we'll have our streaming show probably in the early afternoon also recording a segment with Ryan Ward today who's a Lakers reporter at Lakers Nation he also hosts a Lakers podcast to all so like us on the believe Network and we'll get some thoughts on what's going on with the Lakers if you might expect someone like a Jarred Vanderbilt back in the near future if Gabe Vincent can carve out a role does anybody else on that team that might be worth keeping your eyes on so that'll be fun will probably I'm gonna have to learn some stuff from a tech standpoint but we'll probably try to get that edited into some kind of future show  I think I can I think I can share a video  on these things but we may be figuring that on the Fly anyway that'll probably pop up on my guess would
