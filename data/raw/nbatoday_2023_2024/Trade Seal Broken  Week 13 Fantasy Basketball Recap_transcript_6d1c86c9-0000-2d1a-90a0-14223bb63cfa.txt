I think before I went to sleep last night we're in the low 100s this morning please please please I beg of you all please go do that for me  I will love you forever  let's talk what's been going on for the week I'm gonna make my face well let's see how big should I make my face can you guys read that now we'll go bigger let's go bigger on the words because you guys need to see the names  this is of course is a week in review we cover the last roughly five to seven days or so typically more like five days I know it's like a week in review but we did our weekend analysis back on Monday make sure to follow ethos fantasy BK to get your news and subscribe to everything and so on and so forth  but let's start with the ads that's everybody's favorite part of the these weekly review shows we're gonna dive in with the ads of the week and some of them are repeat names and some of them are names that I tweaked a little bit but just kind of roll with me on this as we go  Donte divincenzo back on there you had one slow game this week but then Josh Hart sat out the Knicks game on Thursday and so defense gigantic I don't think that he necessarily needed to be repeated but I put him on there because he's been truly impressive  in the time he's been given and with heart out obviously that number went up a lot but his per minute production lately has been really impressive even in you know 25 to 28 minutes and so you know I  at this point that's enough  and anytime you get more than that it's just it's gravy  Jayden Ivey's back on this board last couple of games have been nine cat relevant prior to that he had some very big points League type of games there's a continuing balance that has to happen with Jaden Ivy and I talked about it Ad nauseam on these shows so I don't want to go into that much detail on it again because he's a repeat name  when his percentages are not atrocious and at the turnovers are not too high he can be a nine cat guy but he's again in that sort of West Brookie and mold of somebody who can get points and rebounds and assist not like rust used to do because he was the guy who was so good at the counting stats that he actually counterweighted the bad stuff  Ivy is more in the okay right now the counting stats are really good but they're not so Elite that they can counterweight the percentages in the turnovers  so yes better and ate cat better in points League better if you're punting a percentage you guys just Factor all of that in what you're in your decision making process here but he doesn't need to be on this board because it's some kind of format  he belongs on a team  and as I'm talking about Jaden Ivy as about three minutes ago we did get an update on Cade Cunningham who was expected back within the next week  so that's gonna shift things all around again and that'll make that'll impact Alec Burks who's going to be on one of the lists coming up a little bit later in today's show  it also and before I get to the next name on the ads board which is Draymond Green who was on their last week but I don't think everybody believed me I and I I'm not super high on Dre I actually let's do dream on real quick  so Draymond played 24 minutes he makes the guys around him better and as long as he doesn't do anything else stupid like choke somebody out or kick someone in the Nads he's going to be impactful for that Warriors team he's gonna get as many minutes as his starting to aged body now can handle  I don't know that that gets him inside the top 100 in nine cat but it gets him close enough and he does such a weird assortment of stats that he almost definitely belongs on a fantasy team  very good for punt points builds  and you guys know I tend to kind of gravitate in that direction  but  a pretty crazy thing happened this morning that I can't I was gonna talk about it right at the outset and then I got side tracked by our trade deadline show Sports Illustrated just ended this morning which I know like  how many of us are super  like in green you know Knuckles deep in Sports Illustrated nowadays the answer is not as many as say like when I was a kid because that's I was like the thing yes I cover was always a big deal and it had this big name power and yes it's lost a lot of its boom over the years but it's still crazy to think that in one moment and I don't fully understand what the hell happened here but apparently the arena Group which and there's like a sub header under a subheader and so on and so forth they just laid off everyone  the authentic Brands group  apparently revoked the arena group's license to publish Sports illustrator I don't even really know what that means  I don't know I don't actually fully understand all that stuff but I mean  SI has been around for what half a century  and then on the morning of January 19th 2024 it just gone  you know they're going to be fighting it someone's gonna have to fight this but that is crazy  1954 thank you to Matt lual who friend of mine from my time in the minor league for having the actual the actual timeline 1954 to 200024  that's wild  absolutely nuts  it's almost 70 years old and then just gone  man  I guess I got sold about five years ago these things that happened and then covid and then you sort of forget all about it but this is this crazy man  just slowly kind of bled away and then kaput  wolf tough morning for  a tough morning for journalism man another tough morning  holy crap David we're done what's up dude  wow what a crazy start to the show  David is nothing to do with anything here but one of my very late night Bakersfield Blaze listeners who was up first thing in Scotland hey you know doc was telling me we had doctor on the show a couple days ago he was saying that one thing I should make sure to do is to ask where people are from  and I'll be blown away how cool it is so I'm gonna do that at some point in the middle of the show but right now the sort of live listeners you guys are still filing in a little bit so I'll hold off on that for a little bit let's get back into the ads buddy hield is an ad right now for me and it's a little bit speculative because we don't know exactly what the Pacers rotation is going to be like you cannot base what you're doing on yesterday's results because they were down nice Smith they were down nem hard they were down siakam there down Halliburton like you talking for rotation guys so obviously buddy hield had a perfectly reasonable amount of things to do the question in my mind is okay so we know siakam is going to start so that'll push Jalen Smith to the bench and we know Nesmith and Halliburton are gonna start and that'll put TJ McConnell to the bench but then between bennedict mathurin and Buddy hield which one gets benched  of those last two  that's the one I'm not entirely certain of so if it's healed that starts  I would then hold on to him it's if it's math and that starts I don't think either of those guys ends up actually math in her heel hands up having value but  I think it's worth our time to hold on to heal for like a day three days whatever it takes to see niece Smith and Halliburton all so get back because it sounds like I'm gonna play tonight to find out if Buddy yields gonna be in their starting lineup  golgo bats on my ads board the magic seemed like they're leaning towards letting him continue to play about half the ball game and in half a ball game he's been right at the edge of the top 100 now I reserve the right to abandon ship on this Goga thing they however have taken moving or out of the rotation most just stopped playing Wendell Carter Junior Goga those guys are splitting the 48 minutes at center right down the pipe in fact their last ball game  each guy had exactly 24 minutes played down to the second  if Goga drops down below 23 I think you drop but if he's getting about half the ball game he's playable as a low end low upside second third string Center  Wendell Carter Junior interestingly enough who did have a good last ball game actually has the worst overall nine cat ability then Goga because Wendell doesn't really get defensive stats don't stop don't talk to me about how he got a couple in the last ball game we're talking about full body of work he doesn't get many  Wendell Carter Junior is better suited for points because he is more consistent with points and Boards things of that nature but nine cat he contributes in like two  Xavier Tillman is on my ads board again you know we're talking low upside types is last ball game Tillman had 10 points five boards six assists a steal a little block he played 36 minutes though that's the important thing if a center even on a bad team is out there for 36 minutes he's gonna do enough because he's just gonna be close to the bucket that's all you got to do just be big and be near a bucket because you'll get rebounds then you'll get some blocks or steals just by being near the rim don't get into foul trouble you'll survive  Tillman's not a good free throw shooter but he didn't take any in that ball game he's usually an okay field goal percent guy although he was going up against Rudy gobert so sub 50% in that last ball game  but again like if Santi aldama is not gonna get a ton of sentiment it's  then it has to be Tillman right now  we'll see if Memphis brings in anybody else just to sort of try people out because this season is a lost cause for the Grizzlies at this point unfortunate but true they're down most of their starters  so Tillman's on that board and then um  and I forgot I had him on the board last week I don't know why I didn't put him back this time around in fact let's just do this while you guys are watching let's make sure that everybody's got you know what I because I put him in the fill-in board but Canard and Vince Williams can be on the ads board because even as fill-ins they're so they're so long-term that it almost qualifies as more than that like Marcus Martin's gonna be out another five weeks right and that's the first time that you might see something impacted here because Desmond Bane will be out probably longer than that anyway we'll talk about we'll talk more about Canard and Vince Williams when we get to the injury replacement board but that's why they're not on the ads board or if they weren't on it initially because they are technically filling in for Bain and smart and John Morant but Jaws out for the year so you can't really call him you know anybody taking his place no longer a fill-in because he's not coming back and the other two guys probably do but we're talking write down the stretch  let's do the holds next who should we hold on to here few of You by the way of all ready in the chat room where you guys are listening from which awesome well we'll do more of that in a little bit your holds list let's see a few of them require explanation a few of them don't I don't know why Alex Caruso's on there I think I just forgot to delete him off of last week's so let's do that while you guys are watching too  goodbye Alex Caruso you're not a whole you're just a dude who needs to be on rosters  Alex Caruso's so freaking good man I'm telling you everybody's talking about what they would give up to get Deonte Murray team should be giving up almost that much to get Caruso if he could just consistently stay healthy and he has for the last little bit knock on something for the Bulls sake he's a 10 points three and a half boards two and a half assists 1.3 steals a block almost two three-pointers he's really improved his shooting  and when he's on the court he's just one of the best plus minus guys in the whole league because he's one of probably the top five defenders in the NBA and people don't realize that  that kid is something else  so impressive number 83 by the way in nine cat this year  love me some Caruso anyway he doesn't need to be on a holds board because I don't think anybody's thinking about it Aaron Smith is a whole to we find out what his deal is going to be in Indiana now that they're getting all these names Dennis Schroder is a is a is a whole  this one I'm less excited about he's been  like he's been generally fine and it doesn't seem like the wheels are going to totally come off  but he's like kind of right in that same dream on green rank area of like between 100 and 130 which is good enough in some instances you know if you're hunting threes say Dennis Schroder makes a lot of sense as your point guard because he doesn't shoot the ball from outside particularly well but you know decent percentages lately and some assists and things like that so I can't specifically say Shooters droppable because there's a lot of formats where he makes sense  just not really whoopsies Turn the Page by accident just not really my format  Derek Lively is a whole he's back and he's playing well so this one's a pretty easy One Max strus is a very tough hold right now he's on a run for the ages of shooting futility  because over the last month he's still playing 31 minutes a game which is down a tiny bit and he still getting you know four to five rebounds he's still getting four assists and he still getting a steal and he's still getting over half a block  but he's shooting 30%  and you can go back farther than that with stress I mean it has been ungodly 38% for the last two months  he continues to play a lot of minutes and he continues to get boards and assists and Steals and blocks better than we expected coming into the year  but the whole story on him right now is that he cannot throw a stone in the ocean and if you've used that expression before he cannot shoot right now  I think he's gasped I saw a stat I think it was maybe a week ago that he had run the 5th most the fifth longest distance of anybody in the NBA this year behind like Tyrese Maxey and I forget who the other names were on on the like most running board uh but juice has played in 39 ball games he hasn't missed much time as minutes or high he's always on the move  and he's tired  and he's a little bit dinged up  and it's all kind of catching up with him right now but the beauty is these guys are NBA players and eventually they pull out of these shooting nose Dives and the cool thing about stress is we're seeing right now sub 40% shooting for the year and he still just barely hanging on to 9 cat value he's right around 110  which is startable in most 12 team formats  but he can't shoot 35% you can't so if you got him enrolled you bench him because he's hurting you more than he's helping right now head to head I think you just have to sort of plow through and wait for him to come out the other side and have a stretch where he shoots 40 849 percent for a couple of weeks and bring his season number back up to 41 402 he's been at 44 before  hard to know exactly how this thing ends for him because he hasn't had this kind of workload in the past but he's just not like he's too good to be at 35% shooter long term  Dan says well also acknowledging that he's basically been at 35% shooter for almost two months now he will snap out of it you've seen it a thousand times with guys in the NBA guys go through prolonged slumps sometimes and that's what this is  Trey Jones is a whole I don't think that anybody was really considering a drop on trade but just in case the outside goofball chance you were thinking about it don't do it  don't do it he's starting and he's a top 100 guy when he's starting so don't do it you honest valentina's as a whole he has not been very good lately JV  his minutes have trended down hard last 10 ball games he's only a 23 minutes per game but here's the thing it'll be okay  because even at 23 minutes per game he's still inside the top 100 at 13 points 9 boards a block in good percentages he has a very high floor I was too mean to JV during draft season because I said I didn't want to draft him inside the top 100  mostly because I thought he and Larry Nance we're going to split time and I thought Zion might even see a couple minutes at Center and now you're kind of seeing that but again the beauty of JV is that he doesn't need 28 minutes to be fantasy startable he needs 28 minutes to be a top 50 guy which was the big surprise so far now he's back down to 22 23 24 minutes more where I expected him to be this year  still better than my rank I had in between 100 and 120 he's at more like 8100 range so he's still okay but he's not a drop  fart that's no  and then probably the toughest one here is Cam Johnson I think maybe the hardest hold right now but the argument here is that Brooklyn's just been atrocious the whole team sucks  I would bet a small fortune that playing against the Lakers wakes him up a little bit like someone's gonna have a good game tonight I don't know it's gonna be my bridges might be cam Johnson might be Camp Thomas he feels like just the kind of guy that would go nuts and Los Angeles someone's going to shoot the lights out because it's the Lakers and that's just what happens but the Nets are an absolute dumpster fire  I think they've convinced themselves internally that if they could get Ben Simmons back they'd be more competitive again and frankly  I have two I have two sort of competing thoughts on Simmons in my mind  competing thought number one I've been on record on this show is saying I don't think Ben Simmons plays more than five more games this year  I could be wrong I'm a fantasy analyst I'm guessing but  this dude has I don't know if it's degenerative nerve issues or if it's between the ears or some combination of both  but he just like he hasn't played for more than a couple of weeks in the better part of half a decade it's been like three years  but the other thing is if he somehow managed to prove me wrong on point one if he does if Ben Simmons does get healthy and plays for a couple of months  he would make most of the team better  besides Spencer Dinwiddie who was all so already falling off a cliff didn't witty already has a suspect Fantasy game and so when it's suspect Fantasy game and it's all so not going well he's on a fear not everybody he's on an upcoming list here on today's show  Ben Simmons would hurt him but he would probably help most of these other guys because they just be more open with him as the distributor  to that end  a lot of these guys are kind of by Lowe's cam Johnson is a by low because you can get him for almost nothing right now mikal Bridges is a by low I think I had him on the Bi-Lo show yesterday  I don't like Spencer Dinwiddie enough to call him a Bilo Nic Claxton yeah I mean he's been fine it's mostly been the free throws that have held him back lately but like the whole team is a Bi-Lo because Something's Gotta Give  what I'd like to see happen is for them to sell off Parts at the trade deadline but I don't know that they could I don't know that they would get enough for the parts that I'd want them to sell anyway so like you might see Dorian Finney Smith get moved for you know some seconds and and filler but that's not gonna change who does stuff for Brooklyn  All That to say hold on to the Nets or Buy Low on the Nets cuz it can't possibly get any worse than it is right now that whole team is a trash situation  just by the way he feels like a good time to

trade deadline show page and hit the thumbs up I beg of you I beg of you go hit that thumbs up over there I think we've gotten 11 of them so far since I've been yelling about it on the show so I don't know if we can get a few more and also if you want to hit like on this show that's all so cool but I actually wanted more on the trade deadline show  here's the I'm scared list I had these guys on the list last week Derek Jones Junior Dante Exum Tim Hardaway Jr blah blah blah so on so forth so thj we know Tim Hardaway is going to be good  any time that Kyrie or Luca sits out of ball game because he needs  15 to 20 shots he's gonna get shots up he's probably gonna be okay that's the hard way story these other guys it's not about the shots so much as it is just having a little bit more to do because for Dante Exum it was about field goal percent but he needs to take enough shots for that to be a positive impact thing and for Derek Jones Junior uh he can get you a block or a steal every once in a while but you also need him to take a few shots  to be the other option when Tim Hardaway is not chucking and you know it's small but these guys going from third to Fourth option or fourth to fit fifth option whatever it is all those little steps they hurt because these guys were hanging on these guys are like just inside the play line as it was you bump them down just a little bit  that actually can move a guy over or behind the cut line  I have Brandon Putski back on this list He's listed as hanging by a threat he's not a drop for me yet but it is teetering on that break and you could make a similar argument to him as you could have about struer I think I think the fatigue is playing a pretty large role  my concern here with the Warriors that they're they have other directions they could go  where with the cows we've seen now there isn't if there was another Direction they would have done it by now Jalen Suggs is also a guy I'm putting on the extreme like short leashed list right now how much longer I'm willing to watch him scuffle I actually think he's kind of tired and a little bit banged up too and then Spencer Dinwiddie who we just talked about a moment ago I'm actually fine if you guys wanted to drop Dinwiddie in a lot of formats Point sleeves you can probably hang on but horrible field goal percent one of the worst in the entire league doesn't do enough in the other stuff turnovers are not great field goal percent terrible free throw percentage is not good enough to counterbalance that the way that some of the other bad fuel goal percent guys are he doesn't get that many defensive stats I mean he's like it's like Dennis Schroder but with bad field goal percent  feel gold percent of the few things that shooter isn't completely screwing up with some points some assists that's just not enough here for Dinwiddie  I've been preaching the negative Dinwiddie thing for a long time and I don't mean to be like people think that I don't like players when I talk down about their Fantasy game I don't care about their reality game  that's not entirely true I do care about their reality game in as much as  whether it will force them into different minutes like D'Angelo Russell is a good example of this last week I was screaming from the mountaintops his reality game is good enough that none of this with the Lakers make sense and he's gonna get to do more soon and then sure enough they decided they needed more offense and they played him more  such as not the case with Spencer Dinwiddie he's not so good on offense that Brooklyn has to keep him on the floor because we saw when he's been bad lately he's been benched for Dennis Smith Jr and he's been good he gets his minutes back that's a dangerous spot to be in so Dinwiddie I don't care about anymore at this point all right I've been trying to convince many of you that he was a drop basically from the minute that  think it was cam Thomas  and cam Johnson both came back around one was before the other I was like a month ago now I can't remember what happened a month ago and I don't think anybody believed me but I think folks are probably starting to believe me now and then on the other ones we'll check back in on pajam ski and Suggs a week from today and we'll check in on them every day basically but it's possible that they buy themselves additional time it's also possible that  we are headed towards the end of the line for them we will find out soon and that's why we want to be a little bit patient with these guys but they are on the I'm nervous board because I wanted you guys to know that I am considering going in a different direction  if you watch this names for you guys Andrew Wiggins he's getting more of his job back with the Warriors I don't know that it's gonna matter because he's been bad all year and I don't see why on January 19th that should magically change Santi aldama is a watch list guy in case the Grizzlies ever decide to just start giving JJ games off or Xavier Tillman has some sort of little injury that knocks him out I'll dhamma in 20 to 24 minutes is not quite good enough because he's not a great percentages guy despite being a big man good with points boards does get some Steals and blocks  I feel like he needs about 2728 minutes to get there for me and I don't think he gets there unless one more guy goes down but it's possible maybe he does  that's why he's on the watch list Kelly oubre Jr is on the watch list  I don't think he's gonna make it farther than that and then Larry Nance Jr who you guys know I have a very soft spot for Larry Nance he's beloved one of the funnier smarter more generous dudes in the NBA he's just like everybody loves him the fans love him his teammates love him coaches love him he's hard not to it's hard not to love learning as Junior uh but from a fantasy standpoint he also has a really good stat set  the problem of course is that Jonas Fallon is a freaking Warrior dude missed what like six weeks of the ankle sprained about three years ago and honestly God I can't remember the any other time he's missed significant action lately  jv's just always there and as long as jv's always there it's gonna be hard for Nance to get more than 23 24 minutes  and then with the fact that you know Valentine has a big ball game or if they need his offense more than they need Nancy's defense you might see the numbers flip worse for Larry  he's been good enough Nancy has the last one to two weeks to start  but the the clouds of inconsistency in terms of just rolling minutes  aren't going anywhere as long as JV is upright  and that makes it really hard for me to say oh yeah you can you know play Larry Nance against the games cap because what if he comes out in place 17 minutes it could happen one of these nights  so I like Larry a lot I'm just not quite there yet with him this year I've been fooled so many times and as the who taught us we won't get walled again  the stream while warm board had a couple of tweaks between last week and this week we added Kevin herder to the stream while warm list which now makes up the following eight names guys that you only play when they're hot drop them when they're not Bobby Portis Nas Reed Cole Anthony Kevin Love Deni avdija Jordan Clarkson RJ Barrett Kevin herder streaky players in the NBA who's minutes  or shooting one or the other is very streaky and when they're on the good side you can cash in and when they're not you got to get the hell out of there before it destroys you  and now  injury replacement board shorter this week you guys might notice I think there's only 10  well 11 names because I have two guys on one line and  this is way less previous weeks we've had this go into multiple pages  so even though it feels like everybody just went down I think the reality is that everybody that just went down was on the Grizzlies they were all just on the same team other than like izza zubats and The Grizzlies those are those that are the injuries of late you have a couple of things that are shorter term and you know we work those into the board here but for the most part it's the Grizzlies and it eats a zubats  but you add them onto the names that were already on there and you add it to the fact that a handful of guys actually came back this week then you have this slightly more manageable injury board so new name Daniel Gafford in the concussion protocol I wasn't gonna play Marvin Bagley because I figured the Wizards would ease him in but they played his ass 40 minutes  that was crazy no one could have seen 40 minutes coming even if you had the gall to play him as a streamer you were probably like man I hope this dude gets like 27 minutes and scores 15 points with eight boards well he played 39 minutes at 20 and 11 with five defensive stats and went a robust  oh for five at the free throw line yow  did so many good things and then  had diarrhea right on top of the table where everybody was eating  served this gourmet meal and then just pooed on it  but it's not gonna be that bad every time he's not a good Fellowship but he's not that bad and if you want to play Bagley I think in the next game  presumably if gaffer misses another one I think I'd have to give you the okay to do it they're playing the Spurs tomorrow on Saturday so you figure that'll be a competitive ballgame which is again all we really ever asked of the Wizards  so bleep It Marvin Bagley to the Moon please don't foul him  TJ McConnell halliburton's been out nem hard is out also so that makes it even easier for TJ but Halle is close is what we've heard so obviously you keep a very tight watch on that Alec Burks has been a pretty good feeling since Cade Cunningham went down he was actually scoring an okay Mount even when Kate was there but just that extra bit has been enough to get him into startable in most formats Mason Plumlee is the filling with the Beats down Clippers were very happy to get plumblee back and not have to play Daniel theis big minutes  can Plumlee get 30 minutes of game  I call it questionable because even zubats at times had trouble getting to 30 and zoo is better than Plumlee but Mason can pass he can rebound and get some steals he doesn't block shots really I know we got a couple in the last ball game but again you have to look at the body of work with these people  I'm not that I am plumblee terrible free throw shooting I don't know how many minutes he's gonna get on a game to game basis but he is your filling for zubats and if you're looking for like a third string Center he can definitely get you that  Al Horford is your filling guy with Boston it sounds like the Celtics that skipped their last ball game uh is those guys are likely to be back so then you would not play Al Horford but if anybody sits out for the Celtics owls your guy Carousel vert he's been on this list for a while with Darius Garland out although I'll say again I think Garland's back in the next two weeks I don't have any official  nothing official to say that I know that to be true I just feel it to be true and I've gotten a lot of those I feel it calls right before  saddiq Bey who is like the small forward equivalent of golgo batad Z he'll be around the edge of the top 100  Nick Richards same general story Mark Williams also a guy that I think you could probably trade for at it insane discount right now because with the hell knows if he ever comes back but I don't know if I have this Stone do that one Malcolm Brogden is your filling with Jayden Sharpe out in Portland and then obviously with Memphis we mentioned these two guys earlier they're basically adds because fillings for two months are effectively adds but if I don't know why I put jaw in stead of Bane that should say Bane and Marcus Smart not John and Marcus Smart that's a typo on my part uh if Bane and smart do come back in six weeks then these guys will go back to probably not being very good  but I don't know maybe they don't come back maybe the Grizzlies just shut them down for the year in which case these guys would move from injury replacement to ads board but because I'm pedantic and because I want to make sure everything is exactly where it belongs they have to be listed as injury Replacements because if those guys in front of them weren't hurt they wouldn't be putting up these numbers  and finally stashes know I tricked you stashes are coming tomorrow ladies and gentlemen I have plans to do a stash show on Saturday  Saturday's tomorrow yeah today's Friday I have a few names up my sleeve you guys have heard me mention them in passing on previous shows if you've been listening very closely you probably know who they are or at least some of them but there was a big ground swell mostly on social media where again you guys can find me at Danbury that people were like yes Dan who are your stashes are you stashing this guy you stashing neck guy  the answer is let's just do a little show about it that's the easiest way because we can go into detail on the odds of certain guys working out I just I don't think social media is the right venue to talk about who your stashes are and the reason I don't think it's the right menu is because every stash  requires an explanation that doesn't fit in 150 characters  typing out just a wall of text on a Twitter thread nobody reads that it needs to be in little bullets but that's not the way you do it with these discussions so for example let's take one name that will probably talk about on tomorrow's show Gary Trent Jr possible stash  if you think Toronto moves Bruce Brown on to another place which it sounds like they're considering doing  if I would try to do that on social media I say oh yeah I'm thinking about stashing Gary train Junior people be like why who am I dropping what are the reasons here okay look here's the thing you have to take all of these with this what are the odds that it pans out what are the odds that not only does Toronto trade Bruce brown but nobody comes back that would take Gary's minutes and more importantly nobody comes back that would take any more shots away  because shots are already at a premium behind Scotty Barnes RJ and Emmanuel quickly those guys are all getting a bunch on offense Gary Trent cannot afford to be any farther down the pecking order than fourth and frankly even that  is iffy  but with Bruce Brown around Gary Trent becomes more like four and a half  because he's basically splitting it and brown is probably a better fit for what that teams trying to do right now anyway  but Toronto is not trying to win anything this year sorry I know they're gonna peel a win away every now and again and they you know they had a good one right after the trade went down but they're not a good basketball team they're 12th in the Eastern Conference they're selling off pieces they're two games back of the Hawks for the 10 seeds just to get into the play in tournament  which by the way it's not Out Of Reach because the Hawks are all kind of bad  the Nets are in front of them also very bad team so anything's possible but the Raptors are smart massage at it when they could get a bunch of stuff and accelerate rebuild around Scotty Barnes quickly and Canadian poster boy RJ Barrett  it would be dumb to make a run at it if you could have a bunch of assets that you could either then package for something cool or just use them and get fun young players so either one of two things is going to happen either the Raptors surprised the hell out of all of us by trading for a superstar using all the stuff they just got for siakam but that seems dumb because they just traded away siakam who's not a superstar but not that far behind that level he's like a near Star level player and they were bad even with him the Raptors are not one pretty damn good player away from being good they are multiple pretty damn good players or one like Transcendent player but those guys are not on the market  Zack Levine is not going to turn the Raptors into a six seed  does jonte Murray is not going to turn the Raptors into a six seed these guys might get the Raptors back in the hunt for the nine ten  is that the move  probably not  and could I have said all of that on Twitter  no you need a show so tomorrow would do a show on stashes and we'll probably recycle some of what I just talked about on Gary Trent and I hope you guys will tune in for that click check of the chat room by the way I would love to know where all of you guys are from that would be really cool and already I've seen Southern New Jersey was the first one that popped up what a perfect first one to have Australia but living in Sweden Puerto Rico Taiwan awesome and then this question did you go to Cal man yeah I went to Cal go Bears  I wear a cow hat there it is still on the wall over here I wear an oski hat every once in a while on the show that I don't know if people catch that because it doesn't mean it says calendar small letters across oski is the mascot that's the name of the bear it says Cal very small letters across oskies hat on my hat it's like a hat within a hat  but it's not like a big obvious cow logo across it  but apparently I'm gonna have to get used to Eastern time zones stuff because cows in the ACC now and so that we got Washington DC that just picked up just popped into the chat room  did anybody ask anything that I didn't hit a JJJ shut down risk question this is from our friend in Southern New Jersey yeah you know that's not a bad question so JJJ had a big ball game yesterday that was cool um he's number 47 on the year after you guys remember just an absolutely atrocious start to the season but over the last two months he's been a third rounder I believe and over the last one month yeah also in the third round the blocks haven't really been where we all expected and they're still a chance that those ramp up he goes on a big block Surge and that would push him from third round up to probably second or maybe even late first  but the question is what can you get for him right now because everybody's afraid and rightfully so that the Grizzlies are gonna pull the plug on this year and they will at some point because they're 15 and 26 they're not catching the three or frankly four worst teams in the league meaning you're not gonna get in that bottom three to get the the equal share at Lotto balls but the Grizzlies have a shot to be worse than the Blazers there are three and a half games better than poor Portland right now and they're basically in a dead heat with teams like the Raptors the Nets are like a game game and a half ahead of the Grizzlies in the standings the Warriors are gonna keep trying so I don't think they have to worry about that but the Grizzlies are going to want to try to get worse than the Blazers and make sure that they stay worse than the Nets in the Raptors so the plug could get pulled at any minute here luckily they're bad enough at the at the moment where they can lose even if they're playing JJJ a lot of the time  what could you get back I think you could probably still get back somebody in the kind of like  and it can't be lately it's got to be like full season and you probably want to go for somebody who's doesn't have as much name power as they do fantasy power so like you could get Nic Claxton back I think pretty easily for JJ he's right around 50 mostly because it's free throw shooting has been he's taking more of them that's not great  you could probably get Keegan Murray I think you could aim higher than that frankly you could probably get  oh who could you get you could get Franz Wagner while he's hurt he probably even aim higher than that you might be able to get someone like a DeMar DeRozan  for JJ you might be able to get someone like a Daniel Gafford when he comes back he's been really good this year  so I don't think All Is Lost you can get a really productive player for him or what I'm probably doing here is I don't know that I would try to move JJ right after everybody goes down for the Grizzlies I think it's better to just let that news kind of settle and let Memphis lose a couple of ball games maybe they accidentally win one again like they did a few days ago and then maybe you could get like Jalen Williams who's been on the upswing for JJJ I'd love to get j-dub that would be an amazing grab you might be able to trade for Evan Mobley who's out for another probably three weeks but then you could get you know top 40 production when he comes back  so give it  another three games  and then see what you can churn out  let's see we got La we got a Los Angeles person um Brazil of course that's my boy Rubens also a cal bear  Louie  I may need to look that one up  I don't know  Canada sweet question about Josh giddey who's had a slightly better stretch so obviously he has historically been better in the second half of Seasons I'm sure that the weight of not being prosecuted in Newport Beach here in Southern California being lifted is helpful and to get his credit over the last what is it about a month he's been right around top 100 which is  probably a better case scenario for him because he's always going to be a guard who rebounds well gets some assists  doesn't shoot the three ball doesn't get defensive stats  and can be okay at field goal percent and free-throw percent but probably isn't going to be a helper in either of those because he doesn't go to the foul line  almost ever  and feel gold percent is is sort of sub-average but he doesn't shoot that much so it's sort of like a small negative  basically all that to say I think you could probably sell high on giddy if people are looking at the last couple of weeks and are like oh my God Josh giddey is the man now um  you know small sample size theater he's at 90% from the free throw line over the last two weeks he's at seven boards and six assists and it's been good enough to get him into that sort of like 75 to 100 range but also  if you extrapolate what he's done the last two weeks for an entire season it's not 75 range he's in the 75 range because a number of guys that are normally ahead of him over the last two weeks have had bad weeks 11.7 board 6 assists I mean you're talking about Draymond without defensive stats  that's probably 100 to 125 range which is where he was last year by the way that's where he finished  he'll go on a run here of you know 50 to 90 and then unfortunately we've seen it when the free throw percent comes back to Earth or if the rebounds and assist come down at all  then he falls back into that 150 range so no I don't think anything substantial change get he's a better second half player than first half we got a Seattle by the way in the chat room but when he runs hot like this you try to move him  and I think that's probably where we'll take a pause on this one about 50 minutes that's enough right you've heard enough of Dan lecturing to you especially with the show tomorrow we'll do a stash show tomorrow thank you again everybody for listening whether it's live
