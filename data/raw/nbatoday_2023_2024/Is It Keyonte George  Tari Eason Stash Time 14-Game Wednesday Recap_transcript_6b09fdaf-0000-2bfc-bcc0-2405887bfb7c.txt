welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  yeah I'm trying to time it a little bit better so folks that are watching get the end of the intro music folks that are listening on the traditional pod channels you guys just get the normal fade out because I can set all that up in Adobe Audition just his bifocals a good morning everybody happy Thursday to you all nice relaxing Thursday just a couple of games tonight  Tuesday was  so I prefer I far prefer it just a couple of games  I think we've gone over this on this on the Pod before I don't know why I'm getting back into this thing I like when there's like seven or eight games every day  we had that in the bubble  the only redeeming quality to the end of that God awful year of 2020 was  the fact that we had games running from the afternoon all the way through the end of the night and they're only like seven or eight of them because they only had two quarts to play on that was sweet yeah now you jam them all in we had so many games yesterday in this tiny little pocket  there were two games on what you'd call sort of like traditional West Coast time and one of them was in was in the mountains Denver just started late they were kind enough to start late everybody else for us at least here on the West Coast was 5:30 or earlier there were 12 games that started at either four 4:35 or 5:30 and only one of those was 5:30  there were 11 games it started a 4/430 or 5  nuts trying to keep up with all that crap  sheesh  what do we got on the docket today what do we got on the docket today well the EU as the kids say these days I think the kids still say that the usual we got a giant Wednesday to recap all those games I was just talking about a few things that popped up in there that's always fun when you get some new names in the mix  it's exciting it's the ebb and flow of the fantasy season sometimes you get some new names that emerged then you go a week or two where it's just like tracking the usual stuff trying to figure out if somebody's moving up moving down  that every once in a while you get those few days where things shift you know in sort of  beefier context and we had a little bit of that last night we'll preview this short two-game Thursday we'll do a few questions from the chat room and then we'll put a pin in it  I  the  there was someone over in our Discord he said he didn't want to he didn't want credit for it but I'm going to give Anonymous credit to one of our Discord folks which by the way you guys can join that the link in the show description is the right one I actually could confirm that this time  he said he didn't want he didn't want credit for it so I won't address anything by name but  this Discord user came up with what I thought was a really really fun idea for a show  and I'm not gonna have time to do it today or tomorrow probably not over the weekend although I'd like to do a show over the weekend we'll see if that takes shape so we're looking at some point next week  but it's a it's a trade show that effectively is like Let's Make a Deal  so I would come on a program  I would sit in front of you like I do today and say all right everybody in the chat room and this will be more fun for live viewers but I think folks after the fact would find it amusing as well all right live viewers I am selling player X  so  you know let's say  who's who's a sell High guy right now I am  I'm selling Tyrese Maxey  a little bit of a cell high off to a hell of a start point 7 blocks per game  that's right Tyrese is gonna get you a blocking game  I'm selling Tyrese Maxey so then what I would need from everybody else in the chat room watching whatever  you guys would then offer players to me  in return so you'd say oh I'd give you Darren fox or I'd give you  JJ I'd give you LeBron whatever it is whatever names you throw into the chat room and the show would basically be me saying I'm taking that deal or I'm not taking that deal and explaining why  sort of a fun way to engage player value's it would focus on the main guy that I'm selling but also it would sort of compare it to whatever players came up in the main contacts and I think I think that show could be really a lot of fun so hopefully we'll get a chance to try that out next week we'll try to keep the guys in the cells going next week that's another fun thing that we've been able to add to the mix but let's go ahead and dive on in welcome to the show again everybody it's fantasy NBA today it's Thursday morning I am your host Dan Vespers you can find me on social at Dan best press d a n b e s b r i s  yesterday was a big one was a big one but the thing about it is once you get into these gigantic cards and results  you have to figure out how to isolate the stuff that's actually fantasy relevant because there's so many names that did things in a given night I'm gonna players played yesterday about 300 or so  and so much of it doesn't change  so the key for us here  keeping this podcast under two hours is to isolate the stuff that mattered  so let's start going through some of the teams we'll just plow our way ahead and take a break for some water in the middle but that's where we're at Washington a rare victory for the sometimes hapless wizards they got it over the all so sort of hapless Hornets for Washington it's their second win of the Year there now tied believe it or not with those Hornets we were just talking about it two and five through their first seven ball games not that that's what matters for Fantasy folks well matters are fantasy folks is that Kyle kuzma is rumbling so far he is a cell high in the top 40% from the field at 83% of the free throw line those numbers would both basically be career highs for him that's coming down steals probably come up a little bit but probably not enough to counterbalance the other stuff he's getting the 20 shots that we hoped I think you could probably move kuzma let's see right now 40 I said 39 you could probably get someone inside the top 60 65 range and I think you probably do that  the bad news for all of this is well you guys know I love Dillon right but he hasn't been good enough consistently enough this big ball game yesterday just pushed him up to number 123 and nine cat so no I'm not adding Dylan right he did however vastly outplay the starter tyus Jones who played only 19 minutes in yesterday's ballgame and Jordan Poole got dramatically outplayed by Bilal  and so that's a lineup that just saw more activity the guys that were on the court yesterday was those two dudes plus kuzma Landry shamet Danielle andere played some extra minutes off the bench he's showing himself to be kind of a fun rapid fire score or type  but all of that meant that we got another ball game  where Ty is Jones didn't play normal minutes Jordan Poole didn't play normal minutes Deni avdija sort of got near normal minutes but not quite  and I get it I mean the Wizard's got to go to the hot hands there but also it continues to  ruin fantasy days because tyus Jones is averaging against 25 and a half minutes per ballgame Jordan Poole is averaging just 26 and a half minutes per game almost 27 these guys are not inside the top 130 right now that's not true Tice Jones Is 129  one has to believe that those minutes will come up so does it make it a Buy Low on both of those guys I think it's more of a Bi-Lo on tyus Jones because so far he's done kind of what we expected in the minutes he's gotten he just needs the minutes to be more like 30 132 and 25 and change you're adding another 20 to 30% of what he's doing right now and he'll be totally fine with Jordan Poole you added another 20 or 30% yeah obviously helps a little bit but Steals and blocks probably coming down field goal percent  maybe free throw percent probably goes up for him but they're just  the path to Top 40 for Jordan Poole which is where he was getting drafted is fraught with Peril right now I don't think he gets there really nothing on the Charlotte side Brandon Miller filling in in the starting lineup for Terry Rozier and a whole lot of nothing Mark Williams only played 18 in a half minutes he had fouls early didn't have as many of them late but they just sort of went to different looks PJ Washington Nick Richards took care of more minutes at the five blah blah blah Move Along Boston nothing that's a team we can just skip right over unless somebody's out which they were not Sixers we're just sort of casually keeping track of a few things like Nick button once again A plus seven team best plus minus for Nick Patton  by the way like you know it's not Victory lap time but the Sixers do have the second best record in the NBA right now and I feel like I was the only person who was on them as a team getting good  which is weird Everybody was just like yeah I know Harden's been a mess but they can't possibly be better without him and was a funny too I think it was been Bell Simmons who I mostly tuned out over the last couple of years but he sent a tweet out yesterday that was like man it was more fun playing the Sixers when they had one guy on their team who didn't want to break a sweat yeah a lot of teams are going to feel that way  fantasy wise you're holding Kelly oubre until we figure out what the hell he is after this trade  in the starting lineup I think he's less fun because you know Tyrese Maxey took 27 shots and be took 20  and then it will bring only 11 we just kind of Off the Bench he was getting more shots per minute  but you guys all want me to talk about the Anthony Melton he got 29 minutes and yesterday's ball game and he shot one for nine  the shot is just way off right now and he's maybe the hardest hold in all of fantasy Sports  but it reminds me a lot of Rob Covington like seven years ago I don't know if you guys remember this but I tell this story once I think her fantasy season  Rob Covington  back when he had some juice in his legs and he's not back on the Sixers again I think it was was I think it was on but he was in Minnesota  I think it was in Minnesota so it's like five or six years ago  and there's no way for me to figure out exactly what it was because  his numbers for the entire season were very normal but if you have time and I don't because I'm in the middle of a live show right now but if you have time to go back and try to figure out what season it was for Rob Covington where you started the year shooting something ungodly it was I think he shot like 19% over the first couple of weeks I can't remember what what year it was it was somewhere in there I thought it was Minnesota maybe it wasn't  and I dropped him  and it's the worst drop I've ever made in fantasy sports because he was still playing his normal minutes but nothing was going in  but he was getting his you know one and a half Steals and one block and all that sort of typical rokos stuff but I had a team where like three guys got hurt and I had high hopes for most of those injuries to come back and be different makers and I was like well I don't really know what Rob coming to do when he gets back I thought he was going to be decent  came roaring back and ended up as like a top 30 fantasy player after that now that's not to say that Anthony Melton is going to be a top 30 players that's not what I'm trying to claim here what I am claiming though is that due to shooting under 30% right now  and I get it he's not a good shooter to be begin with but 29% for the years probably not happening  and as the shot comes around you probably see more minutes come around as well  so then the shots go up the minutes go up the threes go up the points go up the steals go up the boards the assist everything all comes up together as that 26 minutes becomes 29 or 30 or whatever it happens to be because they are a team that when he's clicking he can be a part of what they're trying to do but right now I mean he just he shooting blindfolded but that's why you're hanging on a little bit longer I know it's the hardest hold in all fantasy sports but I feel pretty strongly we need to do it we need to give them at least another couple weeks to see what his role is  when he's actually shooting the ball like a normal person  let's keep moving Utah they were competitive for some stretch of this ballgame Indiana kind of pulled away late and that's why you got kind of normal minutes for the regulars on both sides not all the way there but most of the way so like Larry marketing still got his 35 minutes Jordan Clarkson played 34 he finally woke up but who cares like I said it 1000 teams times even with this big ball game Clarkson still isn't even inside the top 200 in nine category leaks he's just not a category League player  and in the most marvelous news of the day Taylor Horton Tucker is finally out of the starting lineup of low percentages and high turnovers and a couple of assistance deals and we officially don't have to worry about this nonsense anymore because keyonte George is now the starting point guard for the Utah Jazz he had seven points 9 assists only one turnover yay somebody to feed the ball to the other guys and that may be his job here on this club but frankly I'm interested in seeing how it goes  that's not to say that he has necessarily this you know World beater of a fantasy game but if he's gonna play 27 to 30 minutes at night he'll get you six probably assists in that range  shoots the three ball a little bit not very much the thing is he's just not gonna shoot very much in general and what we don't really know is what is a lot of playing time going to do for his defensive stats because he only has three Steals on the year to this point now admittedly he hasn't played a ton of minutes in most of those ball games but even in the ones where he got more playing time he only has what one he didn't get any yes yesterday  so I don't know that the ceiling is all that high for keyonte George I think you could pick him up Roto you'd stuck him stick him on your bench if you want to pick him up on the head to head side you're basically just gunning for assists at that point which again that's fine but I don't know that it's gonna be a big time difference maker  the Difference Maker here is that you don't have to worry about Taylor Jordan Tucker anymore which I've been trying to save for a week but now it's very official  also John Collins slid up to play center with Walker Kessler out for a couple of weeks that's sort of interesting news that broke in the afternoon yesterday I forgot that I we talked about that on the secret show with Brew not on fantasy NBA today by the way I'll give you a little more info on The Secret Show in a second Walker Kessler is out at least two weeks with an elbow sprain that he's been trying to play through since opening night which is a really good piece of news if you have faith in Walker Kessler to basically say this guy's not right he's not playing right he's not healthy that explains a lot of what we saw going on with him  John Collins had some foul issues in the first half that's why the minutes were at 28 and not in the low 30s  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with

be 21 plus not available in all locations  it's also worth pointing out Kelly Olynyk five vowels and 21 minutes he is likely going to be a useful fill-in while Kessler is out we didn't get a chance to see it in this ball game because the foul stuff but I'm good with a Kelly Olynyk injury stream board spot meaning good sort of a one Burger play if we're gonna rank it in one two and three burgers  oh Chaya bogey also got into the starting lineup yesterday but I don't I don't know that there's enough as Brew likes to say meat on the bone there  meanwhile Indiana is putting up some really insane offensive numbers and it's super fun and the Pacers season win total over was one of my biggest plays of the year so seeing them rattle off a couple of Victories is always nice beating up on a bad team that doesn't mean a whole lot but they're five and three now Pacers have looked a lot better after kind of a clunky first couple of games to the year  unfortunately the thing that's making them look better is Rick Carlyle doing his usual tinkering so in this one Aaron Nesmith got hot so he stuck around for 30 minutes off the bench Jalen Smith who's been really good in limited playing time off the bench was quite good again but the problem for him is that he's averaging 18 minutes a night right now  believe it or not he's a top 90 fantasy play in 18 minutes a night but there's just no guarantee that he's gonna get more than that  this is why we were all so high remember he was on the old man squad last year and he just couldn't carve out any playing time he shooting 72% that's definitely not gonna stick but damn if he is not giving them some really good bench it's  I just wish I had any faith at all that they were going to stick because  you know again he's a 25 minutes yesterday  could be 12 the day before that 1620 1922 it's gonna bounce all over the place depending on Whose warm  and in this one the bench unit for the Pacers was actually really really good  also Benedict Catherine had a better ball game so he played a team High 38 minutes  he'll get picked up everywhere and they'll get dropped for the next one because typically doesn't do much beside score he did a couple things beside scoring and this one guys I must remind you matter is ranked 213 and it's not a fluke that he's down there  so unfortunately we're gonna keep looking at the Pacers and saying all right Bruce Brown tough hold buddy hield tough hold Myles Turner kind of a slow start to the year but he'll be fine the minutes have been a little cockeyed he's playing 26 minutes a night and he's not up to number 34 and 9 cat so this really not a whole lot to worry about their Halliburton is number nine and he's only playing 32 minutes so that's even a number that could get a little bit higher  and then you know neesmith Jalen Smith he'll be topping all these guys were just like okay if one of these guys could just carve out a consistent 28 29 minutes the world is their oyster but it's just ain't gonna happen  if it does we're gonna pounce on it though be ready Spurs got spanked at the Gardens at Collins was basically the lone bright spot I guess you could say Jeremy Sohan was okay Zach Collins sitting right at the the 100 Mark in nine cat but that's largely because he's at 2.8 turnovers per game which is a number I think we have to believe is going to come down in eighth cat he's number 72 for whatever that's worth and I think that's probably more where you should be valuing him because we know the turnovers are not going to stay at 3 per ball game although he is doing some orchestrating just somebody to keep an eye on weapon Yama got taken apart Nick's defensively you knew there were going to be focused on him that knocked him back down to number 44 and 9 cat but obviously he'll be fine next side ball game was was pretty well in hand but a few of the starters played bigger minutes not Tibbs minutes that's how you know like you look at Jalen Brunson at 32 RJ Barrett 32 Julius Randle 31 and you're like oh that's starters minutes that's not Tibbs  starters minutes  tips start as minutes is 35 306 so this game was technically  air quotes over early and the reason I bring that up is because Josh Hart only played 24 minutes off the bench and if they goes back to that again with RJ Barrett healthy that's not going to be enough I need 30 out of heart that's what we've been talking about  we used to call it the Marvin Thad line  Marvin Williams and Thaddeus Young in 30 minutes because it could always put a fantasy value and then I had to change the name because that is Young turned into a permanent monster when he went to Chicago  so it's really the Marvin Williams line Josh Hart is a member of the Marvin Williams Club you need 30 minutes but if you get it guaranteed fantasy value  nothing can derail it because he does things that don't require the ball in his hands  Clippers it's gonna be a bumpy ride man it's gonna be a bumpy ride the Clippers are three and four they've lost both games with James Harden  after winning three out of five without him  Paul George  he was sort of the big usage guy in this one took 20 shots didn't make that many of them  Norman Powell was decent Off the Bench but I don't think you could expect that you're looking at the main guy's  and just like I don't  so there's two things that we need to talk about with the clips thing number one is  is it going to get better yes obviously it's gonna get better learning how to play with James Harden is going to be very difficult for a team that's built on wings it's like Harden's done the five out offense so like they'll figure out a way to do it but  he was the guy with the ball every time James is gonna have to figure out how to play off ball a little bit better  he's gonna have to buy in in a way that he never really has before and I just  okay so that's thing one yes it's it's gonna get better and so thing one suggests that James Harden Kawhi Leonard Paul George these guys are all going to hit into a Buy Low posture if it hasn't already there it will be certainly over the next week or two  I think it gets better after about a month and maybe you'll even see incremental gains between then now and then but I wouldn't expect  a big Leap Forward I wouldn't expect like the obvious game  kind of look back in early December and say okay now I get it they're starting to they've they've begun to figure things out  however while that is true while it is a Bi-Lo for I think most of these guys  I also don't know that this is going to be a match made in heaven and everybody is saying that and everybody might just be right  the steam brought in Russell Westbrook to be the point guard to get the ball to Kauai and Paul George and he beats a zubats in the right spots whatever those may be  now they've brought in a guy that is both point guard and looks to take kind of inefficient shots sometimes because he's not getting as many free throws as younger James Harden good  I  James Harden is still a good basketball player so let me I want to qualify the following statement with that  I just still don't really see how this fit works  I don't know  like there's just you need it maybe if there was a big man that was a bigger part of things or if Kawaii and PG weren't the more  if it or or better offensive options  I don't I don't see how this turns into something magical though I do see that it will get better than this  so those are the whole like can we hold two thoughts in our head at the same time thing hi Ben Simmons got the ball game off I think he was resting his back if I'm remembering right maybe he had a little bit of soreness anyway Royce O'Neill filled in he's a great fill-in for Simmons Dorian Finney Smith filled in for Nic Claxton he's been a great feeling their cam Thomas heard his ankle in this one left in the third quarter basketball monster you can see on the screen here they've got his his estimated missed time at about a week we'll see how that goes it should give us time to figure out if it's going to be Lonnie Walker time or Dennis Smith Jr time or  some combination that basically creates neither because Lonnie and 21 points on 16 shots here that was you know a lot for a little Dennis Smith Jr 25 minutes he does more of the whole assists and steals thing does anybody get over the cut line I'm not making a move now I'll make a move after I see what happens in the next ball game  plus if Ben Simmons is back you gotta figure that they'll want more spacing so I guess you'd leaning Walker in that instance  zombie Pelicans went into Minnesota and got spanked which I think you could probably figure because you know pills were missing most of their starting lineup no herb Jones knows on Williamson and no Zion was out for the birth of his child so congrats design on and no CJ McCollum was dealing with the small thorax which is a slight lung deflating due to air in the chest cavity pressing against it creating a pressure difference  uh what did we get here well everybody was was ready to annoy Jordan Hawkins the next big thing as you guys may recall if you listen to this podcast I was sort of tempered a bit to say look I don't know what's gonna happen the next one because I don't know that he's gonna stay this hot I do think Hawkins belongs on rosters while McCollum is out but we're gonna have to feel this out a little bit  the other note there is that Dyson Daniels and I think that was probably more the herb Jones absence then the Zion absence  but if that happens again Daniels is worth a look as more of your defensive specialist bald Distributing type  but mostly this was just ugly  they got beat up by Wolves team that is I feel so smart right now I know really seven games into the season in the whole thing could come apart because the wolves are five and oh at home and Owen to on the road  but they're good  I thought they'd be pretty good this year and so far they are  my Conley another quietly solid ball game with low usage just steering the ship he's number 54 and 9 cat because Conley is averaging over Forest Football game and I think he's turned the ball over one time all year that's exactly what they need out of their point guard  because the team turned the ball over 16 times yesterday  but their point guard didn't do it  that's huge man  I know he's not racking up assists four and a half is not that many but to do it while basically never turning the ball over  there is a value in that this is partly why I like playing nine cat because someone doing what cone is doing should be rewarded  he's been incredibly efficient so far he shooting around 50% from the field which frankly that probably comes down and again has not turned to the ball over almost at all one turnover in seven games that's amazing  Kyle Anderson it's looking more and more like he's going to be probably streamer level he's at 137 and 9 cat right now he's getting his steal and he's getting his block and his field goal percentage is decent but he's just not out there quite enough  so that's why I'm leaning that way not read a little quieter in this one but he's been above the cut line so go ahead and roll with him there Jaden McDaniels you guys know I love him as a player I think he's destined for the Shane Battier Award of being way better in real life than they are in fantasy Lakers down most of the players that they actually want to use in a given ball game really hot jamura came back but no Anthony Davis no Jarred Vanderbilt know Gabe Vincent no jaxson Hayes know who my forgetting or someone else I'm forgetting there so uh they're just getting ripped apart and with the way Anthony Davis that like the last line of defense Christian Wood didn't work he had on a horrible game filling in for add Dilo and hatchimal were kind of the only players that survived this one but they just got destroyed by a Rockets team that's now blowing out three straight opponents and Houston's four and three somebody I think told me it's the first time the Rockets have been over 500 in four years or something  that's kind of insane  all right well I don't think we can read too much into this ball game you can keep one eye on hachimura but you know a lot of his value was tied to the fact that there was no Anthony Davis and Lakers went small ball hatchimal at the five but then they couldn't stop anybody so the rocket shot 55% everybody that was able to play 20 some odd minutes basically put up numbers the thing I do want to focus on on the Rockets side is tari Eason who we knew was making his return yesterday 14 minutes nine points nine rebounds a block a couple of systems in a 3 Houston's bench is thin  they've gotten a lot better as a team this year because they've dramatically improved the starting five with Freddie Van Vliet and Dillon Brooks and then the just sort of the general Improvement of Jabari Smith Jr and Alper and shengwen then Jalen green had a heater in yesterday's ballgame but there aren't that many guys playing behind them you know they got Jeff Green who's ancient  put him 9 points at six boards and 11 minutes that's how bad the Lakers were yesterday we even got a bow Bond sighting the bench is  not good for Houston and they just don't want to use them very much unless they have to but Atari Eason feels like the kind of guy that has he gets revved up he should see 25 bench it's I would think  so if you want to stash him I'm good with that I think he has a better fantasy feeling than keyonte George while we're talking about sort of the who to stash stuff from yesterday's ballgames and that was my takeaway from the Rockets is that Easton looked really good  before we get to Detroit Milwaukee I want to remind everybody once again to come find me on social media I am at Dan Bass Pros over there and please take a moment take you 10 seconds less to go hit like And

there's a question from the chat room asking what whoops what is it what is this burger thing you keep referencing yeah so it's just a really fast way that I referred to injury replacements  I don't remember how it happened I think I was just floating through emojis on Twitter last year when I was making a list of players feeling in for injured guys so Dorian Finney Smith would be an example right now who didn't have fantasy value in it collects and was healthy but Clarkson went down and now Finney Smith is playable Knightley in Roto had to head whatever and one day I think I just said all right like I'm gonna give players that I think are a decent fill in one Burger players that are very good feeling to Burgers and like World beater fill-ins get three burgers and then it just became the burger board but it's effectively the injury replacement streamer board and it just much faster to say Burger  Detroit Marcus Sasser is on a serious heater right now he has pushed his season long value all the way up to number one oh three in 20 minutes per ball game but he's also shooting  almost 60% from the field and hit two three-pointers at night we just know from watching the NBA for even a few weeks in our lives that that's not a number that's going to stay  so it's fun as he's been and as streamable as he seems to be as long as Alec Burks and Jaden Ivy are out we know this is going to come to an end at some point so just be ready when that happens Jalen Duren got himself into and out of and then back into foul trouble in this game he still managed 11 12 and 5 but no defensive stats presumably he'll be better in the next ball game this is why when he was a first rounder I said go ahead and see if you can get like a top 40 guy for him right now because he's now outside the top 40 I still think Duran has a chance to be a top 60 fantasy play this year I don't know how much higher I see him going than that I do think he has a chance to be involved in this sort of rebounding top of the board battle but he's got this ankle soreness stuff and then foul trouble is going to creep in every once in a while so just like  it's again hold two thoughts in your head you can both love Jalen Duren as we do and I still think I was the first person to say pick him up last year which is weird for me because he's young but I was just watching a Pistons game and people were exploding off of him like they waited 85 pounds less and I know that's not the case but he's just a strongest dude ever but to hold two thoughts in your head you can both loved him and also understand that he wasn't going to be a top 25 guy so see what you can squeeze out of it good ball game for Cade Cunningham I know the turnovers have been a pain he's at five and a half still and he had five more in this one but you take 33 8 and 8 even if there were no defensive stats which I think is something that probably comes around for him and then also our Thompson is someone that we're like it's it's hard to not be super excited about him but at the same time we also probably need to understand that the three plus defensive stats per game was always probably gonna come down a little bit but he's just doing so many things man 15 rebounds and yesterday's game with her and back Isaiah Stewart back to a drop  Brooke Lopez had four fouls in the first nine minutes of this ball game and then he didn't pick up on the rest of the way and so he ended up with 14 points 6 boards four three-pointers and four blocks I don't know how we got there but we did he's right at his 80P right now and if it feels like it's been in an atrocious start to the year which gives me a lot of confidence that Brooke Lopez is probably on his way up  Janice got ejected  it was kind of dumb there been some weird ejections lately in the NBA officials got a take it easy a little but it allowed to go maximum Dame  that's it  Max druce we've been waiting for him to sort of start to get the field goal percent around this is a better shooting game he didn't take as many shots as I would have liked but I'll take that better percentage  he's up to number 82 in nine cat again you know two and a half weeks into this thing so still small sample size but not nothing the nice thing about Drew said I don't I never saw coming coming into this year  was the rebounding  it's been  pretty consistently good  I didn't know he could rebound sorry Max anyway he belongs on Ross's Carousel over at 295 and 5 I've been talking a lot about on this show and you guys know for many years I've been staunchly opposed to him but this season you've heard me softened my stance on Levert  and a lot of that is because it does look like he's embraced his role on this Cavs team  he's at 18 points four and a half boards four and a half assists and a steel with a couple of Threes Off the Bench typically I know he had Garland missing a few games in there but it just does kind of feel like he's a guy that they're giving a lot of opportunity to and so certainly in head-to-head I think you need to have Levert on your team Roto I'm a little more  say afraid  he's gonna go out there and have one of those game like yesterday he managed to shoot 50% from the field and over 80% of the free-throw line but you know he's taking 14 shots and 16 free throws  I'm gonna need a mouth guard to prevent me grinding my teeth into nothing 16 free throws I'm very worried he's gonna go 10 for 16  but I do think he belongs on to head roster at the very least Jared Allen slowly still kind of working his way up to that Full Tilt and the Thunder team that kind of spreads you out so they went to more Evan Mobley at the five not a huge surprise there for the Thunder no real notes I don't lewd has been better than usual this year but we've watched enough Ludo to know that this is not a thing that's gonna stick 2.2 defensive stats and 50% from the field  this is much like the Dillon Brooks start to the year a robust sell High opportunity Tyler hero nasty ankle sprain in this Miami game he's expected to miss a couple of weeks Kyle Lowry stepped into a much larger offensive role yesterday I don't know how much of his his body can take of that Duncan Robinson also got more playing time  so it wasn't necessarily that Lowry played more because he's been getting around 30 minutes a game as the starter it was just that he was forced to do more  Duncan Robinson did play more he didn't do more  so I don't know I mean you could probably make a case to pick up Kyle Lowry here and just see if this is like the time that he's gonna have to go be involved he's averaging 7 points a game but he is a top 100 play because of one and a half Steals and basically two three-pointers and five assists that that's gotten him into that mix  Duncan Robinson I think you can probably still consider him more of a 3-point streamer so go ahead and add Kyle Lowry just sort of see how this goes if hero really does Miss three weeks and Lowry is the guy that's like all right I guess I got to take a few more shots today that would be worth while that would bump up the scoring the threes all that stuff and and that would that's good for him  meanwhile you guys know where I stand on bismack biyombo everything goes fine for a game or two and then the wheels come off it's it's the same story every year and I don't expect it to change as he gets into his what mid-30s now I would rather take a shot on Luke Kennard  or Santi aldama on that Memphis side I don't know that we can trust all dominant play enough but his Fantasy game is pretty good Canard is just your you know run-of-the-mill amazing three-point shooter and his minutes still kind of trending up  I don't know if we're gonna get all the way there but you know the worst desire Williams looks and the better Kennard looks the more you're probably gonna see him and he just makes everybody else so much harder to guard because Luke can stand way the hell out there and kind of turn it into more of like a forearm for if Memphis wants don't clog things up all right you got your outlet amazing shooter if you throw it to Kinard 28 feet away  is he going to do enough from a fantasy standpoint that's another sort of secondary question if he plays 30 minutes I would probably do it because you're looking at three to four three pointers and that by itself is off in enough to get it done on good percentages I don't think you need to pick him up yet but don't write it off  Phoenix over Chicago and over time Grace and Allen went nuts but yeah I mean you're not gonna worry about that Bradley Beal season debut looked as you'd expect kind of rusty but he'll be fine once he gets up to you know 28 29 minutes he'll probably max out in the low 30s this year uh that's fine good news there you can probably fire him up for their next ball game if you really wanted Chicago side I just keep hoping and praying that Alex Caruso can find his way into high 20s and minutes and he got it here in overtime because he was Far and Away the Bull's best player yesterday but it's just not enough nightly I want it to be so badly I wanted to be so badly and it just  he's number 88 in nine cat right now but it's not good to evaluate someone right off of one of their gigantic games because they're always going to be better and then he'll go back to having a quieter game and you'll fall back into that 12130 range because right now it's mostly because of defensive stats in his field goal percent 1.6 deals 0.8 blocks almost 60% from the field he's doing very little else on the basketball court from a fantasy standpoint  but damn if we could just get him like 26 minutes a night I'd call him a premier pickup in that spot  oh well  Gary Trent was a little bit better for Toronto but he did nothing besides hit for three pointers so I'm still mostly on the outside with him Yakima portal  Dallas is gonna do this to teams where they're gonna run traditional big men write off the floor so Toronto went small it worked because they have all these very rangy Wings they can throw out there like Scotty Barnes and OG and Adobe those guys can handle the tough defensive assignments they just want to make sure that whoever's playing Center can switch out onto the perimeter and that's what they did and they won  Pearl was a zero plus minus and then the rest of the starters were all more like a plus 7 or plus nine that's basically where the game was right there  Dallas side Tim Hardaway hit 53 pointers he's somehow managed to continue his very three-point heavy start to the year he's ranked number 92 on the shoulders of four three-pointers a game and almost nothing else I have to believe it's some point this cools  guess it hasn't yet  is this the start of the grant William's cool off he's number one 13th so  think we're probably looking at streamer level for Grant Road Otis but  God settle back on streamer and then no Derek Lively he was out with an illness and the Hope was that maybe do I Powell or Maxi Cleburne could step up but now not really  the Warrior's another day another Andrew Wiggins clunker he's really bad I think there may be something wrong I don't know what it is  I couldn't possibly tell you  I don't know if he's hurt he's mentally hurt but  I think I just stay away at this point  Chris Paul 27 minutes a little bit upsetting given no Draymond Green you kind of hoped he would play more Warriors really did keep their minutes in check for the the main guys in this ball game Steph played 34  clay played 32 nobody else got over 30 it's kind of surprising  Kevon Looney typically decent when there's no dream on so that's another thing you got again I thought we'd get more out of Chris Paul at least more assists but just keep rolling with it that's generally your Warrior side for the Nuggets we were waiting to see if Reggie Jackson could carve out a role here to replace Jamal Murray and this is a much better ball game right Reggie 20 points 6 assists  he looked good and that's the reason that we even considered it is that you know sometimes Nicole yolk is just turns guys into better fantasy assets like he's done with basically everybody else that exists on this team  and so maybe you can consider it with Reggie  I don't know that he gets there for nine cat Rodeo I think head-to-head he makes more sense because you just sort of pile up whatever stats he brings you  but now we're looking at a month out for Murray so Reggie Jackson can get himself inside the top 100 for a full month that would be worthwhile  and then finally Portland Sacramento in overtime Malcolm Brogden pulled a hammy just a matter of time with him kind of hoped it would be longer than this and Skyler May has played 37 minutes 18 points 11 assists column a speculative add he'll probably play the point guard spot but he doesn't hit many three-pointers and he typically doesn't shoot 53% from the field either I think you're basically looking for a smattering of points mostly targeting assists with Skylar Mays and that's fine because this is hard to find but just don't expect too much out of him because his Fantasy game is not that well-rounded but very much a guy that you could add and kind of see how it goes and then over on the king side Malik monk had a weird free throw shooting game but otherwise he again is the fill in guy for dear and fox he had 23 points 10 assists just keep rolling with monk until Fox shows his face once again  Keegan Murray guiding a lot of Keegan Murray questions he shooting all he just can't shoot right now and that's the perfect time to buy low on a dude because he's number one 27 almost exclusively because he's been a high volume 34% shooter from the field that's a number you know is coming up into the mid-40s and when it does Keegan's a top 80 guy so see if you can get him for someone in the 90s or 100s  it's worth it  trying to look at the board right now see what I can find in that range  PJ Washington absolutely I'd give him up for Keegan  saddiq Bey I probably doesn't get it done  keldon Johnson might get it done if people aren't aware that his percentages are going to fall off a cliff I'd rather have Keegan Murray there  let's see what do we got in that range I think Jalen Suggs if John if you want to fall on us as a giant ball game at some point here that's a great one to sell for Keegan Murray  by the way you can also buy on Jalen Brown forgot to mention that on the Celtics he's shooting 44% from the field in 71 at the free throw line and the steals are kind of low when that all comes back around he'll jump back up towards that top 50 range where he is every year and it's funny you know for the YouTubers you guys always get to see this big board behind me and all I'll take the the box score window down for a second Jalen Brown he's off the side of the screen on this side of me my right side first know last pick of the fourth round  this was  this is the 2020 2021 season the draft that happened in December  drafted in the same spot  dude hasn't moved in half a decade in fantasy drafts  I love this crap  all right let's take a quick look at tonight Thursday just a two gamer there's really not a whole lot going on there that we need to talk about Milwaukee is at Indiana  you heard my thoughts on Indiana if for some magical Twisted Universe Rick Carlos just like you know what for a month I'm just gonna play my starters starter minutes  well we probably have two more pickups on that team whoever they might be  but it isn't that it's just not gonna happen so  fat Atlanta  it's really nothing like the only question I have with Atlanta is Canadian Bay State inside the top 100 if he keeps bouncing into and out of the starting lineup  so far he's barely hanging on on the shoulders of 48% shooting and two three-pointers being a decent field goal percent guy while also getting teams three pointers is a win but are his Steals on the way down after he had that five steel opener I think he said like one steals since then maybe two free throws right 91% that's probably not a number that sticks either I'm still holding on Bae but I'm also predicting he falls outside of the top 100 because Jalen Johnson is just too damn good and every time the Hawks play somebody with a scoring wing on the other side Jalen gets to start which feels like it might be the case again tonight if they want Johnson to go deal with Paolo Bond Carroll  we'll see  Orlando team with very good streaming schedule  this week well wait on Markel faults status we know that Wendell Carter Junior is out so you're watching to see if mob Wagner or GoGo batad zecchin actually get any kind of Stranglehold on that Center minutes probably not is the answer by the way Gary Harris I'm assuming is still out because he's super old but you know will get more information on these guys in the afternoon  if those guys are all out Cole Anthony should remain decent  I'm still like I can't figure out for the life of me why I have this weird Jalen Suggs Crush going this year but I do he's not at all the kind of fantasy player that I'm usually into because his percentages I for free throws actually been okay so far but the field goal percent has been bad 30% but he gets steals he gets blocks he gets bored he gets assists he's I think it's just the eye testing man I've watched a few magic games and he looks really really good Suggs looks good I know he's not knocking the shots down but the magic of four and three  and he's been a nice part of that  and on top of everything else he's only playing 25 and a half minutes a game right now and he's right at the edge of the top 100 if he somehow can get the shot going even into the low 40s give me 42% of 36 does that buy him more minutes on the court and is more minutes mean more stuff  he just has this nice fantasy outline like right now he's won three point or one point seven steals point seven blocks over five rebounds over three assists from a guard spot the rebounds  but he can't shoot to save his life  if that number comes around a little he can rocket boost up the board and I think that's why I'm into Suggs even though I just know it hasn't been there and hasn't been there  like in his career so far but I got to think he's a better shooter that he's been so far this season  anywho let's pivot over to the chat room while I remind everybody to come find me on social at Dan best briefs and like and rate and subscribe surely you've subscribed to the YouTube page surely you've subscribed to iTunes and Spotify so that we can keep growing  let's do some questions what range players do you think I'll need to offer to pry Kawhi Leonard or Paul George off of other players in nine cat Roto that's a really good question because I think you're about to Embark Upon A Buy Low on these guys what I don't know is how other teams value them right now because Kawaii is a third rounder to this point on the year because he's shooting 70% of the free throw line and nobody really knows why Paul George is still a first rounder despite a couple of quieter ball games and so that might make it a little tougher to get yourself some PG but  Kawaii I've got to think you should be able to get him with someone in the 40 range because people are afraid of what they've seen all so you might get a better price if you just keep waiting because I don't think this hardened thing is going to fix itself in the next game or two I think it's going to take weeks  so again I mean that's all the thing with with like a stock market you know we rolled the dice and see if the price continues to go down and maybe buy at a better opportunity or do we try to do it now  I think Paul George is still going to take a guy that's like probably pretty close to where he got drafted so I don't know the word there yet hardened same story that it isn't it isn't really a Buy Low yet on him fully but I think Kawaii you can probably get for someone in the 3540 range and if you give it another week maybe you can get everybody else for five ten slots deeper  streamer spot in my points League should I choose Hawkins moving or Jalen Smith  think I'd probably go Jalen Smith amazingly well maybe Hawkins yeah go Hawkins points league go Hawkins  what do you think of the Pacers Nesmith and Jaylen Smith  dealing with Kessler's Simon's hero and Clacks and hurt well I mean again we've talked about the Pacers a thousand times these guys come and go on Carlisle's whims if they're having a good ball game great  Jalen Smith shooting 72% that's coming down  neesmith he gets hot and he gets in there you just never know what day it's gonna happen  is Keegan and Clay even worth starting in Rodeo right now Clay's been terrible um I you know if you want to bench key get into the shots starts to fall I'm okay with that it does still feel like he's doing kind of enough to cover up the bad shot and you started don't want to miss it when the heaters starts and then I think I'd probably argue something similar with Clay although for him there's been a lack of usage that's been a little upsetting on the Thompson front I'm more worried about Klay Thompson than I am about Keegan Murray  Dan who's the preferred drop in this Roto League 12 team her Wiggins Josh Hart Kyle Anderson probably dropping  probably dropping slow mo  Wiggins yuck  it's probably Kyle Anderson but it might be Josh Hart it's not Wiggins because I just I think there's something wrong which makes me think either they fix it or they reveal it or they shut him down or something because this he can't possibly be healthy  should I drop Brogden for keyonte George my injured slots are already full you might have to if you're interested so full so go ahead  would you drop heart to stash Olynyk or keyonte George know I think I'd keep heart  for now give him another game  I traded Gordon Hayward for Ben Simmons is this a good trade both are injury prone Bridges returning soon in Charlotte I needed another point guard um  yeah I'm okay with it I'm okay with it although Gordon Hayward does look more spry this year for whatever that's worth  Skylar maze or Malik monk we're starting in Roto who to pick up by dropping strews I don't know why you need to drop screws he's in the 85 range this year and he said two decent ball games in a row I am probably starting monk in Roto and hoping that you don't get the weird free throw stuff at least until deer and fox is back I don't know that I'm starting Skyler maze I'm a little worried about what is  sort of lack of this stuff well maybe you could start both I mean they just don't really have any point guards left right now so  even if he's bad 30 minutes of bad point guard is probably worth it so let's go yes and also I'm not dropping streets  what do you think of Derek Lively and Lou Dort in a ten Timur had if you had to choose which one would you keep probably Derek Lively do it a door is doing right now is way out over his skis his Fantasy game is never looked like this before I can't imagine it sticks although I admittedly he's been good to this point  cam Johnson's durability is a big issue yes  but I don't know what that's in reference to um Conley is barely top 100 when you punt turnovers yeah that's true but I don't  I don't put them  I  also or maybe I do it had to head but at the same time I don't  and Josh and I actually had a show where we talked about this before the season punting uh is not about trying to lose a category it's about not paying super close attention to it but if you win it by accident half the time that's a lot of extra wins over an 18 week regular season  you know nine extra wins that might decide your league  so having someone like a Mike Conley I think there's the the built-in value there if you're punting turnovers doesn't mean you have to lose them it means you don't pay close attention to them but that also means that having a guy like Conley was helping in a few things  well very much not hurting you in another that's a good thing  should I trade Josh giddey and Spencer didn't witty for Freddie Van Fleet absolutely yes  no see I traded Jordan Hawkins and Jalen Suggs and PJ Washington for Karl Anthony towns a three-for-one yeah you won that one by a lot who the hell would do a one for three that team must be awful  what's your thought on scoot same thing is that I've said the last like five straight shows he's gonna be probably pretty good in February  do with that what you will that's why I tell you guys don't draft ball handling point guards rookies don't draft ball handling rookie point guards  timetable for my heroes return Maryland I know what you're going through here my hero There Goes My Hero that's my monster thinks about three weeks we'll wait and see kind of have to read the tea leaves a little bit  nausea or Dorian Finney Smith well Nas feels like a rest of season guide Dorian is a klaxon fill in so I'll go Nas on that one  is Kelvin Johnson a cell hi yes he is because it feels like he's been amazing and he's just barely inside the top 100 because he can't shoot  at least not consistently 46 from the field is probably going down 70 at the free throw line he hurts you and as many places as he helps you so yes  thoughts on Camp Johnson is he must roster yes I know his durability is funky but he's probably gonna be a top 60 guy when he's rolling starters minutes and that's a pretty damn valuable dude Dyson Daniels casein Wallace Kyle Anderson and Luke Kennard for a Friday Sunday stream all are on my waiver wire yeesh  well I don't know who's gonna be in and out for the Pelicans so hard for me to say Daniels slow-mo and Kinard or more you're guaranteed minutes guys  let's go slow mo  Jalen Johnson versus us our Thompson who do you prefer rest of season oh I love them both man that's not fair  um let me go Thompson I still think we haven't seen a Johnson cool down and I do believe that one will come at some point  Myles Turner and Gordon Hayward for Anthony Edwards or is that in overpay  yeah I would do it I don't think I don't think it's enough actually so many probably drafted aunt at like 14 so they're not gonna give him up for  I know the whole hayward's been sort of on a heater but Myles Turner has not you're selling on Myles Turner at the wrong time is my advice in that one  I have Tyler hero in my injured slot and looking to pick a player for today is it Aaron Nesmith or Cole Anthony give me Cole Anthony although again I don't know what the false Gary Harris status update is I don't think we've gotten one yet this morning probably get one by the afternoon  leaning call Anthony here because we know the Pacers yank minutes around  should I Kessler for bam I'm assuming that's a trade uh yeah go get out of Bio if anybody would actually do that trade  what do you think about RJ Barrett is he a player in Roto nope hasn't been for I don't know how long he's way out over his skis in shooting right now very much as a cell hi RJ shooting 87% at the free throw line I would invite all of you to look at his best free throw shooting seasons ever and compare it because  it's not close guys  last five seasons this year 87% prior to that 7471 7561  how about field goal he's at 47 this year career 42  his percentage is will fall off a cliff because we know they will sell high on RJ Barrett I didn't even realize he was as high as he was what are your thoughts on Amen Thompson and tari Eason I think Ethan's gonna get pretty consistent playing time I think they'll find ways to work on it in there but I don't know if it's gonna be  all the time  as the Rockets have veterans now they'll go with the vets  is Dort going to fall off yeah I think probably  Brook Lopez for cat is that a good Buy Low I mean yeah but also Brooke Lopez is is ranked 77 so he's not a cell High usually you have to pair a cell high with the Buy Low  I don't know that you're gonna I don't think that the cat person gives up cat for Brooke Lopez  rank these three Zach Collins Duran Walker Kessler it's Duran then Kessler than Collins  was France's field goal percent last year a fluke or is this just a bad shooting start  no I think it's field goal percent probably comes up a little bit  I think his field goal attempts might come down a tad so there will be a little bit of a counterweight their Franz is probably like I think 80 range is probably about where he belongs on honestly um should I trade Mitch Robb for Ben Simmons know I'd rather have Mitchell Robinson drop Kobe white for DeAnthony Melton  the  sure why not  would you swap Paul George and Alpine for Booker and Beale or Turner  oh yeah PG&E for Booker and Turner I would do I don't know about Beal I think beel is the worst of the bunch in this group  yeah I think I like Booker and Turner if I'm picking a combo here  thoughts on trading Valentine's and Keegan or Dinwiddie for Tyler hero and a points League yeah go for it any of those combos if it gets you Tyler here on I'm doing  we see that already thoughts on dream on green forest Levert or for Anna nobe Anna know he's the best of the bunch then dream on then levertis at the bottom Josh giddey hold or trade  I don't know what you can get for him he was on my bus list  y'all didn't watch my bus show before the season you're probably stuck with him I don't know what you can get back you can get a top 100 player for giddy back I'd probably do it thoughts on John Morant when he comes back should I try to trade in case they decide to tank and shut him down I'd be surprised if the Grizzlies wanted a tank  I think you should trade him right as he's coming back because everybody's gonna be celebrating it and you might be able to get like a top 40 top 50 guy form at that point because you waited but right now I don't think I would trade  Cole Anthony or buddy hield today uh growth I guess healed  is Dashing miles Bridges now a good move so I've said this before I say it again I'm actually just not doing miles Bridges this year  I think I think the NBA almost went to light and I know there's new stuff going on  I get it everybody deserves a second chance but it doesn't mean I have to put them on my face 18  now if you don't care then yes this would be a good time to do it I do so I'm just  just not doing it  pick one to drop Brogden scoot or Dort  uh  I don't know man  I don't really know how what your team can handle because two of those three guys are hurt I don't think you can drop Dort he's the only one of those three guys that's playing right now school will be good in February Brogden might be out for three weeks  I don't know man  Brogdon  Mitchell Robinson for Tyler hero uh let's go hero  Keegan or Dinwiddie points League uh let's go Keegan  would you trade ossur for Mitch Robb I think I'd rather have Thompson  choose one to save your life  Marcus Sasser keyonte George Jordan Hawkins does this mean that I'm like drowning and one of these three players has to which of them throws me the life raft know I know what you mean this is for just like getting into a ball game real quick probably go Hawking's of those three I just think Marcus Sasser is about to cool down I may be wrong there though  if I want to Target Myles Turner should I try offering Jalen Brunson or Darius Garland which one is the better player to keep  Garland's off to a very bad turnover start to his years so I don't I don't know that he's gonna be enough to get you Myles Turner right now  Brunson might  both of those guys are like 45 range per game dudes when things settle and miles is probably a little higher than that so I'm okay with offering either of them  uh I would probably rather have Jalen Brunson on my team over Darius Garland for whatever that's worth but anyway what's your take on the Wizards mesh rotation so I talked about this right at the very beginning of the show the Wizards were the first team we talked about they went to hot hand yesterday and they're so bad that they're going to need to do that from time to time my expectation is that the minutes do settle a little bit for guys like pool and tyus Jones in particular they've been kind of on the wrong end of the reserves are playing better than the starters you're definitely holding both of them I think tyus Jones has a decent shot to get up into that 7580 range where he was getting drafted I don't think Jordan Poole gets up into the 40 range where he was getting drafted but they'll certainly be better than they've been so far so the answer the next question is are we holding Ty is Jones the answer is yes all right any of these guys Keepers in a 10 team and Aaron Gordon Jalen Johnson tyus Jones right now all three are playable in a 10 team or I do think Aaron falls off  tyus Jones is probably your first drop if you're trying to stream a spot in a 10 Team league 12 teams definitely they all belong on roster's what do you think about Demar for Brunson and Jalen Williams yeah  that's a rare time where I would do a one for two because I think Brunson and Demar end up pretty close to each other in rank and then so Jalen Williams is this sweetener that probably ends up inside the top 6 0  should I trade Anthony Edwards for lamelo ball  punt free throw  if you're punting free throw probably not if you're putting field goal I'd say yes  I think there's a reasonable chance both these guys end up ranked in like the mid to high 20s on a per game basis  lamelo's at 508 right now while shooting 39% from the field he's most likely on his way up Anthony Edwards is it 23 he's kind of maxing out right now because of his percentages  I don't think that there's a clear winner in this either way  guy in my league traded McHale Bridges and jaw for Tyreese Halliburton I'm fine with that  what do you think Chris Paul's floor ceiling is in a points League ah it was never a guy you probably should have been targeting in points he's gonna always be better in category because of a good typically good percentage is steals assist things like that he's not gonna score all that much so points I honestly I don't really know should I be worried about Kauai with hardening the picture know um I think this is a Bi-Lo on Kauai  Jeremy Grant are Yousef nurkic nerc is coming off a gigantic game so this would be that moment to probably sell on him so is Jeremy Grant actually Grant's off to a very poor start  I think that's shut down fear makes me lean nerc at this point but Grant could have a pretty good run here with everybody else hurt on the Blazers  will Jonas Nader go crazy if I say Chet is better than JJ probably  we'll have to pass that along to join us on Twitter  that's very funny  that's where we're gonna pause it our ten I think is probably enough here oh you snuck in it you snuck in two questions at the end any other player you like on the level of lowry marketing and that's an open-ended question mark in his number 16 I think they probably finishes somewhere inside the top 25 ish so Target someone who you think finishes near there shengwen or Mark Williams rest of season I think Sheng goon Mark will is likely to slow down on the field goal percent that's same I think is what I would have felt at the start of the Year too and who's a better pickup hachimura or Kyle Lowry let's go Kyle Lowry sorry guys we're done now cutting it off cutting it off too much talking I will
