welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  happening everybody  I am Dan Vespers this is fantasy NBA today we're just gonna do one show today because  well frankly my voice is not bouncing back the way that I was hoping it would  probably because I  did two shows Monday and yesterday and then we took the kids trick-or-treating last night and  you guys care that much about this stuff but I don't know if you guys knew this there's a very large  like blocked off Halloween event in the middle of Santa Monica every year we didn't know that that was there but some friends of ours said let's go do that and we did  and it was a bit overwhelming and also when you go to those giant ones the candy they give out is pretty whack because they got to have enough for like  thousands of people coming through the key is you want to go to a place where everybody's really wealthy and like a couple hundred kids come through so they know they have to have candy but they can get the good stuff  which from what my experience here in Southern California is the Pacific Palisades area because you got all the houses just lined up parallel streets everybody does it man  my oldest came home with like I think multiple full-size candy bars from the time they they went trick or treating in the Palisades  I posted a picture of our family all together on Twitter I know that they say it's stupid to post photos of your your loved ones on social media  but you know what I'm stupid so  there you go today we've got a short Tuesday to recap Big Wednesday preview is probably the bigger part of this show at least in terms of you know things that could shake out tonight that we want to be ready and on top of but there were a couple of things that happened yesterday quickly before we get started I hope you guys will find me over on social at Dan Vespers d a n b e s b r i s obviously like the video if you're watching with us on YouTube rate if you are listening on Spotify iTunes or some other podcast feed and regardless of where you're finding this content please hit that subscribe button that's a really really big deal every time somebody hits those it pushes I know with iTunes in particular the Subscribe button actually does a really big thing in terms of like moving a show up the board with YouTube I think just you know likes General engagement things like that is the key and then the same story with Twitter which we're all kind of figuring out on the fly but certainly the more that you guys interact with me  the more that the show just sort of gets out there so thank you for all of that in advance  what I'd like to do like I've been doing lately is get the the recap board up on the screen so everybody can kind of watch along with us here don't worry everybody listening I will be reading all of the names after the fact what I haven't fully figured out as I can continue to sort of piecemeal my way through the YouTube side of things is if I stretch this thing to the whole screen  and cover up some of it with my face is that better or worse than if I put myself off to the side and make the screen a little bit smaller I'm figuring out on the Fly Guys so bear with me here we'll try the face to the side mode today  I also hope that the more that we do this more of you do come and hang out with us live on YouTube because the chat room is open  I'm gonna try to get to questions at the end of the show again I'm gonna try to go a little bit easier on my voice today I can feel  a little bit less strain and a lower impact day I know would be really helpful for me so anyway Knicks beat the Cavs won 1091 Cavs did have Donovan Mitchell back but let's start on the New York side of this ball game  you had a minute split at a number of spots largely because of the blowout so I wouldn't read too much into the extra Isaiah hardenstein minutes Mitchell Robinson has had a pretty good lock on that Center spot after kind of a quiet first game of the year basically the things that I do want to look at in this one thing number one Emmanuel quickly 18 points and 24 bench minutes  he's an interesting case study because right now I I do feel like he's someone that you probably should be rostering on the head-to-head side he's number one 32 but he's doing it with positives and points threes and free throw percent and so you do get some some gainers out of him even if the other stats aren't really good enough to start a counterweight that in the traditional Roto style Roto I don't think Emmanuel quickly belongs in starting lineups  also of note in this ball game  Josh Hart 28 minutes his line was not particularly impressive  Excuse me while I sometimes mute the microphone to cough here is still getting through this tough week  you guys know I love Josh Hart you know I love getting out of position stats  he's not even remotely close to playable right now he's outside the top 220 in all formats  but if the minutes Trend up towards 28 to 30  that's how he becomes a fantasy add so he's a guy in the next play again tonight it's actually the same two teams in a bat in it a back-to-back rematch situation I think they're actually still in Cleveland tonight might be getting that wrong so this is one of those ones where like Lizzy Josh Hart play 14 or 15 first half minutes I might give the green light on an ad in that moment  because I'm not really worried about what he's doing with the minutes we know that if Josh Hart is out there he's gonna get rebounds he's gonna get threes he's gonna get steals he's gonna typically do it on relatively decent percentages he's a glue guy he's a ball mover all that good stuff we need the minutes when he was playing 22 first you know three games of the year for the next that wasn't going to be enough 28 probably is  but again RJ Barrett only 25 Quentin Grimes 22 Randall 31  Jalen Brunson 34 he saw the bigger chunk and so yes these bench guys did see a little bit of extra time the question we then have to ask is is exclusively because of the blowout or is it a situation where they wanted to try to spoon feed Josh Hart a few extra minutes we'll find out more tonight  Cavaliers Donovan Mitchell was back but he wasn't enough to do it by himself he needed some help and he really didn't get any yesterday because Evan Mobley didn't shoot the ball well he had some rebounds assists in blocks so he sort of floated a bad what could have been a much worse line Max Drew shot the ball poorly all so for nine from the field but did play a team High 33 minutes that's all you need to see folks  so look like Max druce he was a top 20 guy before yesterday's clunker he's still inside the top 50 so far this year on 35% shooting from the field  and I know what you're gonna say Danny's not gonna get 15 shots at night you're absolutely right but he's also not going to shoot 35% so if you're worried about one you should also be relieved with the other I believe strongly that Max druze is a full season value unless they change something considerably here but I don't think that the Cavaliers like the backup situation and I don't think that they're going to blow up the starting lineup here until they actually get their starters back because they haven't had Jared Allen for a single damn day this season  Darius Garland they only had for one game Donovan Mitchell I think that was only his second game of the year  Donovan by the way sorry this is just third game I should say third game for a Donovan Mitchell  excuse me I mean the voice thing here is really is chewing me up I'm really hoping that it's better by tomorrow or Friday and I'm sorry for grinding this voice into your ears this week but I got to get this show out  and no I'm not that worried about these guys coming back taking all the stuff away from Spruce by the carousel over was in for this game either so they're down a lot of bodies already Spurs beat the Suns 115 114 and saying Spurs beat the Suns is burying the lead in the most substantial way I ever could the sun's LED this game for 46 and a half minutes basically start to almost finish and then the I guess it's like 47 and a half minutes and then the Spurs took the lead with two seconds left two seconds left  son's had a 3-point lead Spurs got a layup stole the inbound pass from Kevin Durant basically laid it in for a 1-point lead and then the sun's didn't we're unable to make their last second try the absolutely obscene ending  suns are  the walking wounded right now and the one that everybody said don't draft because he was the injured one that star is the only one that's upright  sons are lucky I think to be two and two to this point Devin Booker playing in the first game with Kevin Durant was a nice reason why they were able to get one of them  but let's start on the Spurs side before we get over to the zombies Suns Spurs did finally have a good ball game and we got some efficiency out of some of these guys at least Kelvin Johnson shot the ball well when he shoots the ball well he's playable the problem is that we saw it last year it doesn't happen enough for it to be a long-term thing and so far  he's just inside the top 100  bad free throw percent serviceable field goal percent 17 points 5 boards four assists I don't think we see  I don't think we see a lot of this stuff hold all season long  based on what we saw at a kelden last year but maybe he does have a better shooting season and I think that's what you're kind of praying for  Devon vessel is teammate all so had a half decent ball game the steals were kind of the big thing for vicel heating in that 90 range  Victor 18 and 4 Blocks he's still kind of figuring things out he's number one 24 Larry because of turnovers and percentages if those start to come around you'll see the the craziness of the stats at kick in  and then Jeremy Sohan who I've said repeatedly I'm just not a buyer on specially not as the full-time point guard yes he had five assists yes he had seven rebounds but only eight points no threes no steals no blocks bad percentages and five fouls and 30 minutes he's just I mean I again I tried to warn everybody on this one he's number one hundred and ninety eight  Spurs need to be playing trade Jones at the point guard spot he was a plus 13 in this game so Han wasn't -7 and again it's not a coincidence trade just runs the team better  until he gets the extra minutes Trey Jones is not the easiest player to roster he's been able to float his value with good percentages and 1.3 steals so far but you're going to need more long-term because at some point the 52% and 100% splits are not going to be though those  maybe the 50% doesn't come down that much because he doesn't really shoot the three ball but he ain't shooting 100% at the free throw line this year so that's something you can Bank on  and I know that I tend to be a little bit negative about the Spurs I just  I have trouble seeing past the efficiency stuff  now obviously with one banana you can look past it because at some point this year it all he'll have these games like yesterday where the efficiencies a little bit better even if the turnovers are still a mess but the blocks are going to be crazy and he's just going to do all sorts of things he's gonna put up a fantasy line that's going to make you fall out of your office chair but then like with keldon Johnson we know the other shoes gonna drop and with vicel it's not that I think he's going to be bad I just think he got drafted in the 60s and I don't know that he gets to that point Trey Jones is a guy that has a little bit of upside if the minutes come around Zach Collins is one that has some upside if the turnovers stay lower which they were yesterday only had two instead of so far this year he'd been averaging I think like four turnovers a game yesterday's ballgame brought his season turnover mark down to three and a half and right now that's sort of artificially deflating his value he's number one 23 and 9 cat  but he substantially better than that in eight cat which is not exactly what you thought you were getting when you drafted Zach Collins who's you know top 70 in eight cat formats right now and if the turnovers ever do level off to a more reasonable number he could get to that Mark and nine cat  so Collins I like with upside obviously one banana has the big upside but he got drafted really early so nobody's doing anything with that you're not going to be buying low on women and nobody's gonna be selling him that drafted him right now trade Jones might be the guy that you think about trying to get in on if you think the minutes are going to Trend up for him and the indicators are that they probably should but it also seems a little bit like the Spurs or covert tanking by playing so on a point guard instead of Trey Jones  I'm not saying I'm just sort of saying like we know there are better team with Joneses the point guard  on the sun side Grayson Allen has had a couple better ball games here I just have trouble getting the full buy-in on Grayson Allen because he can disappear just as fast as he appears  he doesn't typically get many defensive stats which would be a way for him to float his value on nights when he's not knocking down a bunch of three-pointers so I'm probably leaving that alone  Eric Gordon is and I hate to say this out loud because now there's record of it a slightly safer streamer on this club because at least you know when Beal and Booker are both out he's gonna take a whole bunch of shots and then you just sort of  pray that some of them go in and then nurkic is obviously a start Kevin Durant is a start well we kind of figure out what America is gonna be the rest of the year let's keep going Magic on the back to back in Los Angeles they didn't have much in their legs for this one Clippers beat him what 18102 Clippers without all of their power forwards and people on Twitter were asking me if I thought Kobe Brown was gonna see a bunch of playing time and I said I don't know now I thought about it a while and I said honestly they'll probably go small they'll play Kawhi Leonard more power forward in that send it ended up what they did they went with the back court of Bones and rusts so bones sort of more of a shooting guard type  even if Russ is slightly larger as a human being you guys get the idea  Paul George is off to a hell of a start so far this year he and Kawaii are both questionable for their back-to-back today  we'll see if they play I think that's against the Lakers Clippers off to a good enough start where they could potentially sit some guys down and not really worry about it they're three and one to start the year I think their record is going to indicate whether or not they push their main starters but this game also was over sort of early you know PG Kawaii they each played 3233 minutes so not an overwhelmingly large workload  but if they do keep those guys on the bench you're gonna get vintage For Better or Worse rust  I don't know if that's  that could be messy you probably do it and hope that it works and then bones will be a very easy call on stream today if both of the superstars sit I think Norman Powell would also make his way into that mix folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown well in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of beer Wine and

guessed it  your armchair  download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's d r i z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations I don't know why I jumped over the magic the road team in this game but I just felt like we should get to the clippers because they might have some stream opportunities some stream opportunities depending on who sits out for them later on tonight on the magic side just kind of a generally ugly performance faults was fine didn't get the assists you wanted but at least was able to sort of float his stuff with a decent field goal percent France was okay Jalen Suggs is the guy that I want to highlight and I highlighted him on yesterday's show all so don't worry we'll talk about window Carter Jr again although my thoughts on him really aren't changing very much  Suggs I think is an ad I picked him up in a couple of spots he looks  solid this year the minutes have been there so far this season the Steals and blocks are nice he's rebounding a little bit I'd like to see some more passing out of him  the field goal percent I don't think is going to be a mess because he doesn't shoot the outside one all that often  so I'm willing to give it a shot is what I'm saying and right now there are bunch of guys that have popped up as drops over the last two to three ballgames and so I figure there's really no harm in replacing a 0 upside guy with someone like sucks where if things land like if they trade Cole Anthony or something like that and could move into a much safer role and one that I think we'd want to be a part of meanwhile on the Cole Anthony front he's at number 173 in nine cat right now because sadly his game just doesn't translate to nine cat all that well  you need him to get rebounds and assists and he sort of like a supercharged version of Kobe white on a game to game basis where he makes much more sense as a schedule streamer in head to head and then Roto games cap there's not enough there to play him on almost any evening unless you've got some guys hurt and then Wendell Carter Junior everybody keeps asking me about him and I'm gonna give the same explanation every day until it lands which is he's not a guy I targeted in drafts at all because he's a center that doesn't get defensive stats he's a points rebounds only big man who right now isn't even really getting you the points in the rebounds so what's the valuation there he's a bylaw  but he's not even really a Bi-Lo that I'm concerned with so if you want a low upside Center that's probably gonna finish somewhere between 100 and 125 you can probably get him for the tail end of that range but I don't know that it's going to do you any good other than if you wanted to buy low on Wendell Carter Junior and then wait till he gets super hot for two weeks and then try to flip him for another big man who's maybe more a 7580 range dude perhaps you think of it as like a two-step process here but I don't know even know what players you could toss out to get him at this point maybe we'll do a little bit of work on that on social media to sort of figure out what people really feel about  old wcj before we get to the big Wednesday look ahead I want to take just a second here to remind everybody that you can find me on Twitter at danbas and to please take a second mid pot even if you got a pause this thing to hit the like button subscribe either on YouTube or on traditional podcast channels that's actually a really big deal and then if you're listening on iTunes Spotify stuff like that please do drop a five star review also go check out the sports ethos in season fantasy past right now it's pretty amazing this year we've added five brand new tools to the existing fantasy pass which is already really nice you get access to the analysts via the premium Discord and that reminds me I should probably throw the Discord link into the live YouTube chat so folks that are hanging around either now or even after the fact so you usually leave the leave the chat room on you guys can just punch that link in and you can join our free side of the Discord if you have  any  questions about how the premium stuff works you can hit up myself in the free Discord you can hit up Keith cork in the free Discord and we'll get you sorted out over there that again is the fantasy past starts at just six bucks and it has this really awesome new head to head match up tool that I would strongly suggest you guys check out and if you have premium already there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be using these tools that are already at your fingertips  let's look at tonight  big Wednesday card coming up  a lot of things to pour through here  and I'll try to do this at somewhat of a decent speed mostly because I want to do a few questions before I rest my voice  all right here we go  Milwaukee I guess you can so this one's  said I was gonna do it quickly and then I immediately went into a hemming and hawing mode here  I  don't want Chris Middleton on my fantasy teams but we should probably be tracking his minutes cap because if you if somebody gets really annoyed with him to like to the point where they want to drop him for almost nothing then you could make that reach out  extend the Olive Branch see if you can go get him for pennies but I don't really want him for anything more I wouldn't even pay a nickel for him but if I can get him for a couple of pennies I would probably do it  for the Raptors is Dennis Schroder really this good he's looked great so far yakka Turtles minutes are they on the rise or was the last ball game more of a one-off and Gary Trent who I admit I am not at all sold on I've been told that I am wrong on that one I don't think I am I think he's gonna have a bad season we know they're not really all that enamored with him long-term and so much like kind of the Buddy hield situation in Indiana what's the impetus to play him a bunch if he's not part of their plans  took too long to get through the Raptors Blazers nothing really you know it's the same stuff so you know if you're interested in my thoughts on these teams where I say nothing you can just sort of go back to one of my previous shows or tweets storms and see so like for instance the Blazers we know Malcolm Brogdon to play We Know shade and sharp Supply we know DeAndre Aidan's a play we know Jeremy Grant is a play and we know that everything else is a little bit up in the air  I don't need to repeat it every ball game  for the Pistons Jalen Duren is questionable so we'll keep an eye on that if he's out Marvin Bagley would be a one night stand fantasy one night stand and is Alec Burks a thing did not expect to see him seeing this chunk of minutes it probably has something to do with boy and Bug zdanowicz being out because he was gonna be the scoring type and they just need someone else they can put the damn ball in the bucket beside Cade Cunningham so maybe we're looking at you know two and a half more weeks of Alec Burks being a value but two and a half weeks ain't nothing and that could potentially help you in almost any format  Pelicans I'd like to see some consistency out of herb Jones he does belong I believe on rosters right now but if we don't get consistent play out of her but then that would be a reason for concern for the Thunder nothing we know exactly what we're getting at there for the Pacers I'd love to see somebody not named Tyreese Halliburton Myles Turner or Bruce Brown become safe but they're not  buddy hield is probably the guy you're holding out of all of those other dudes because if he gets moved his value likely goes up bennedict mathurin would be the next one on my list of guys you're squatting on because if someone gets out of his way then maybe you see him take a little bit of a value boost Celtics nothing Cavaliers just sort of need to know who's playing his Carousel in a play do we have any shot of a Darius Garland I don't believe so I think the latest is either doubtful or out but  we can dream and then you know you take everything else from there Nick's Josh Hart we just talked about him earlier on this is one that I'm monitoring very closely Josh Hart is sort of like one of the key watch guys for tonight because he gets good minutes I'm adding him even if the stats aren't there the minutes is what I want to see  for Brooklyn Dorian Finney Smith nice little Burger border right now and oh we just got news mid-show that Spencer Dinwiddie is out  so Lonnie Walker is your sort of long shot stream he played well when Dinwiddie went down in their last ball game I don't know that I would trust him to do it again but with Cam Johnson still out we know Camp Thomas is going to be cooking and  take it from there  Wizards  we really haven't seen a Wizards game that wasn't bordering on blowout  I'd like to  latest on Daniel Gafford is that he's likely to be a game time decision for tonight hopefully he's in there when he wasn't they went small and it was terrible but it did help  Bilal get into the starting lineup and so I guess if that happens again you could maybe take a burger board flyer on him I'd rather see Gap in there I want to see The Starters play competitive game get their 30 some odd minutes  and then Jordan Poole he talked about on yesterday's show is possibly a Buy Low all ready but again he was a guy that I suggested maybe avoiding on draft days because I know the upside was there but the floor  I just I didn't want to spend a fourth round pick on somebody with that low of a floor I think you have to be a little bit more cautious there but he will come around he's both a Bi-Lo and a maybe he doesn't get to where he was drafted kind of guy  for the Hawks I think it's just fun to watch Jalen Johnson right now but in terms of fantasy stuff we're watching to see if Sadiq bake and continue to be fantasy relevant Off the Bench and then you know my daily reminder to be patient with an echo Kong woo nuggets nothing wolves nothing really you can keep some tabs on slow-mo Kyle Anderson and and Mike Conley but I think they're generally gonna be what we expected them to be for the Hornets lamelo ball is off to an absolutely horrible start so far this year  I don't know that you can get him and a buy low because someone probably drafted him in the first round and I doubt they're willing to part with their first round pick for anything better than a set or anything worse than a second rounder and in my mind Leo was gonna be a second round or anyway but he was a first rounder if you're hunting field goal  so if he would be a perfect fit for your team maybe you go try to get him for someone that's over performing that maybe isn't the right fit but he hasn't been struggling long enough for someone to be willing to part with lamelo for less than something that frankly right now is too much if that makes any sense and also Brandon Miller he's been really good so far belongs on rosters and frankly you could probably start him  for the Rockets were still just kind of tracking team chemistry I don't think that we've seen them gel yet we've seen them run offense through Shen goon we seen them run offerings through Freddie Van Vleet we've seen them let guys do a little bit of chucking on the side  I don't really know what the Rockets are yet we're going to figure it out they were a team that I said back in July when season win totals came out I did a show and I was like look everybody's telling me the Rockets are going to be really good this year my take in July was they're going to be trying to be better but I wasn't sure that they were actually gonna be all the way better yet  I think that they're going to get better as the season goes the question is are they going to get better fast enough so the rockets and I don't like Jalen green so let's put that out there he's a guy that I'm not trading for in almost any circumstance outside of points leagues you can do the Jalen green thing but if people get impatient with Freddie Van Fleet people get impatient with Jabari Smith Jr in particular Shen guns off to a perfectly fine start he's I think pretty much what people wanted which was big popcorn stats and then kind of lacking in some of the other stuff he's number 89 in nine category leagues right now largely because his free throws have been quite bad to this point 57% that's a number that's going to come up so you can Bank on him moving a little bit forward but I also don't think he's gonna average 20 points a game so there will be a leveling with Shen he probably ends up pretty close to where he was drafted which was between 50 and 60 so you're not going to be able to get him on a Buy Low  but you can get almost anybody else on that team on a Buy Low if you want it question is do we want it  and I think the answer for friendly is probably yes for Jabari Smith Jr is probably yes although that one's gonna be a little bit more of a headache day-to-day and move from there  for the Bulls is Kobe white A Drop in nine cat leagues I believe the answer is yes I just don't think he does enough in non-scoring and assisting categories to Warren a roster spot you guys can feel free to tell me I'm wrong I don't think I am  so there  and then Alex Caruso is sort of the other half of that equation if Kobe white doesn't belong on teams does Caruso then belong on teams and I think the answer might end up being yeah  they're just better when he's on the floor  problem of course is you can only have so many guys on your team that are  punt points dudes unless you're actually punting points and Caruso's basically a Points Guy because he's gonna average 7 points a game in a good world but he's rebounding he's assisting he's stealing he's blocking and that's a pretty cool combination to get out of a guard  so Caruso is probably a roster herbal guy  he's gonna be on wires in a lot of League because he doesn't score at all which means you have time to kind of mull that one over if you want and I'm hoping it ends up being a firm yes right now it's kind of like a floppy yes  for the Mavericks waiting on Kyrie's status  but then there's all sorts of other stuff going on with Dallas Tim Hardaway Junior's on one of his patented heaters when he's on those you stream him when he's not get the hell out as fast as you can  grant Williams I'm referring to him I refer to him on Twitter as a roto tease which is basically what he's been so far in that he's not going down three pointers at an efficient clip and he's rebounding but he hasn't done anything else and it hasn't been super consistent so he's number one 65 in nine cat if he could get a steal or a block he'd move inside the top 100 that's really all it would take with the rest of his fantasy numbers but so far he hasn't done that and until he does I'm on the outside looking in with him  same story for all of the Mavericks centers I simply can't buy the idea that a three-prong Center attack is Gonna Leave fantasy information or fantasy value for anybody  so Lively you can probably move on from not that anybody had roster Dwight Powell or Maxi kleber but all three of those guys are chewing out of the same bucket  and that's bad for everyone  for the Grizzlies were just keeping a tabs on Xavier Tillman tends to play Big minutes against Big Fred courts as we've known Utah's front court is a question mark is it going to be Walker Kessler because if so then you might see a lot of Tillman is it going to be Jon Collins and Kelly at the five that you might see a whole lot less so it's a little bit of a coin flip on the Memphis side for Utah we just told you what we're watching for is Walker Kessler gonna play Big minutes again he had a nice ball game in their last one can we get an encore  who the hell is taking Taylor Norton Tucker this year I am inclined to just say leave it alone I know he has a good ball game seemingly every other day but that's not enough to sustain nine category value points leagues you hold Horton Tucker category leaks I think you can move on  basically the same story for Jordan Clarkson there as well points leagues you probably hang on category leaks I don't know that you actually need to  zombie clippers for one more day we got report that James Harden is in town but unlikely to make his Clippers debut because he hasn't practiced with the team and if he doesn't play in this one the Clippers are off for like almost a week so it'll have plenty of time to get acclimated same story for PJ Tucker meaning especially now with the Kawhi Leonard and Paul George questionable for tonight we may get a bones Hyland Russell Westbrook Mayhem game along with Norman Powell get ready to stream the crap out of those guys if we do get word that the stars are all out and the new guys haven't yet arrived  Lake Lakers Christian would very much a watch list guy he and Anthony Davis looked awesome together in their last ball game they played great they're kind of figuring out how they can switch on things well allowing one big man to still remain back towards the lane to contest shots obviously teams are going to want to play Anthony Davis out but having wood back there who is not great defensively but he's actually not terrible around the rim principles wise is where wood is always struggled but if he's allowed to just sag back off of somebody who's not directly involved in the pick-and-roll  that's how he can be a really big bun and also collect those rebounds because when teams play Anthony Davis away from the bucket they know the Lakers have a rebounding issue no one besides LeBron on the court these days has been able to grab one really hot Amor is out that means maybe more for wood  by the way it sounds like Gabe Vincent is all so doubtful for the Lakers got that news in the middle of our podcast as well doesn't change much he wasn't a guy you were playing but they're gonna need Austin Reeves to wake the hell up D'Angelo Russell's been great anyway  I am curious to see if wood can maintain mid-20s and minutes when hatchimals around because it does feels like a little bit like those guys can be not interchangeable necessarily because Christian Wood is a bigger  better rim protector but Ruiz the better  I guess foot mover if you wanted to have somebody that could deal with the perimeter a little bit better  we'll see either way the wood ad unit looked very very good that's the note from the Lakers last ball game and as we looked towards this one that's the note for this one which is we could see him play a bunch of minutes again and if we do maybe that's the way he ends up back on rosters after getting dropped because he wasn't playing much the first what three games of the year for LA  Kings are without Dr and fox for we think a week my guess is it'll be a little bit longer on that one Davion Mitchell is likely to get the start but more than likely it's guys like Malik monk who see extra shots you'll probably see Kevin herder get a few extra shots you'll see Keegan Murray get a few extra shots they'll run basically all of the offense through demonic the bonus so expect him to see a little bump in assists but I'm not I'm not into the Navy in Mitchell grab that it didn't really work last year when Foxx missed a few games that either and for the Warrior's I don't know that there's anything actionable today other than to say that Andrew Wiggins has been just the worst  he is much like Wendell Carter Junior  a guy that  is a Bi-Lo but is also a player that I'm not all that interested in rostering so if you're gonna buy on Wiggins you're doing it with the goal in my eyes at least of hoping he gets hot for a week or two at some point in the next month and then you try to move him for somebody better so it's that same thing like a means to an end you're not going to turn the lava hot waiver pickup into a top 60 guy in one trade you're gonna turn them into window Carter Jr who you're gonna turn into Andrew Wiggins who you're gonna turn into somebody Who You're Gonna then finally turn into that top 60 guy and you just all year you want to be sort of slowly chunking away at Value in trade you're making  Because unless you're in a new league you're not gonna trade a hot pick up  for a sixth rounder competitively the people just don't do that because they're not more owns  I had somebody on Twitter I put a note out at some point late last week I think I said something like hey look don't try to turn your your hot guy into a second round or in one trade  and they said that's terrible advice if you can do it you should do it  if you can do it you're in a bad League  if there's money on it I guess okay fine you know go pick everybody's Pockets or whatever but most of us if you're in a cash League the people in them have some idea what they're doing and you're not gonna be able to lease them like that so  trade in chunks  quanta I believe would be the physics terminology for it but anyway talk about the Warriors we were talking we were on Andrew Wiggins but I want to move off of him because just talking about Wiggins frustrates me right now Draymond Green how do his minutes change for this ball game I assume they're gonna continue to slowly move their way upward and then what does that mean for Chris Paul that's the big storyline for me because we got to see a whole lot of Chris Paul orchestrating when Dre was out team looks really fluid with Draymond back so I'm not worried yet but does that mean that Paul's just gonna be orchestrating less because if so that would put a little bit of a dent into his value and that's something we need to be aware of  listen guys I'm nothing if not pragmatic on this show I'd love to come out here and tell you that Chris Paul is just locked into 30 minutes and 8 assists tonight but he may not be  so that's I think the Wednesday look ahead those were all the games right yeah the Warrior's the last one it's a big car tonight folks one two three four five six thirteen  yeah 13 gamer everybody's playing tonight baby  let's start pivoting over to the live chat I hopefully the more times that I look at the live chat the more of you will realize this is a fun thing to come and do with us my voice is starting to

dial my activity level down  and we're just going to talk our way through these questions as opposed to kind of broadcasting you guys are accustomed to me broadcasting my voice but we're just gonna talk here so kyung says  Suggs or Cole Anthony or Lonnie Walker or Tim Hardaway I like that we got a lot of oars into this question are they worth the pickup in a 12 team Roto League uh Suggs I think is the one worth the try he's the only one of those four guys that has any sort of rest of season upside potential  Tim Hardaway is your stream play while he's hot but if you catch him on the day when he cools off he ends up doing way more damage then he's worth  Dave slicks says are your ads and drops more for daily or seasonal leaks right now I'm looking more at rest of seasons and stuff and I hope that I try to be clear when I talk about guys that I'm picking up as to why I'm doing it just make sure that you're sort of hanging in there you hear the name then stick with me to hear the reasons why  Polly says Wendy is Harvey Dent yeah first half he's Harvey Dent second or first half he's two-faced second half he's Harvey died depends do you like the good guy or the bad guy Delonte says I can't wait for wimby to get a better feel for the game and be more consistent vessel and keldon to come further into their roles and pop to figure out that Sohan point guard probably isn't the Move versus Trey you are right Delonte I don't know that Kelvin is gonna do much more than he's doing right now but that last point and the first one because Wendy is gonna slowly figure the game out and the Sohan point guard thing is is absurd  can I throw a compliment on the screen just inflate my ego a little Polly says this is NBA fantasy best podcast the industry Dan you're the best my brother thank you dude I really appreciate that  brown boy Junior says what's Maxie's floor and ceiling Tyrese maxey's florist top 50 does almost no way he falls beyond that with hard and gone  and you're seeing the ceiling which is the first round I don't think that that's where he's going to stay though  yeah there's a cough  Max he's not gonna average 30 points in five three pointers a night I think you're probably looking at a more reasonable ceiling of like 20 to 25 range so 20 to 50 is the range on Maxey  Delonte says your family costume was incredible thanks dude shout out to amazon.com a Charleston says hi Dan can you please rank saddiq Bey Malik Beasley Josh Richardson and Duncan Robinson do they all project to be top 115 no Bay is 115 I don't know that the other guy sniff it all with Richardson I am interested to see what his role settles into in Miami he has a chance to be the most valuable of these four guys but we don't know how they're going to deploy him when he's healthy yet Beasley and Robinson as I have almost no shot  Josh says hey Dan is there a reason to grab or hold Bobby Portis this early in the season do you see any path to value for him outside of a honest injury I do not  can Gordon Hayward keep this up  hard to say miles Bridges is the big question mark hanging over that one we're gonna roster Hayward at least until Bridges comes back and then you kind of see what happens from there  if Zach Levine got traded to Philly how much would his fantasy production drop  not much  I think he'd get a little bit of a fresh start look  but you're probably looking at top 60 instead of top 40  Vaughn says who's a better ad kante Georgia trade Jones trade Jones mineral says hi Dan someone dropped Middleton in my 12 team 10 category Roto with offensive rebounds how much would you bid on a 100 fat budget  ah crap Middleton  well we we talked about him earlier in the show as somebody that I don't really want to deal with the headache of but if you can get him as I said for two pennies I would do it and this is basically a way to get him for two pennies because you don't even have to trade anybody away I'd probably go 26 bucks on Middleton it's a pretty big chunk I know but you're still left with 74 to use the rest of the year if this is a yahoo public prize  I think you gotta get him and it's Roto so it's easy to hit the game's cap typically  the hope I think for Middleton is that he's going at Full Tilt by Christmas  and if it's anything early than that you call it a win but if you're basically sitting on a luxury stash of a guy that could be a top 60 player  and you gotta drop a pretty good chunk on him  who is a drop between Tillman Mitch Robinson or John Collins it's probably Tillman  David's old man squad David love that shout out to the old man squad I just did a trade and Rodeo vouch and Joff for Kawhi Leonard I didn't give up too much right no I love it Kawaii even with hardened there is gonna be awesome and Jive no chance in Roto to get anywhere near what Kawaii can do Kevon lunar Xavier Tillman arrested season uh Tillman  Suggs or scoot rest of season oh  well Suggs is likely gonna thump him here for the next month or two once scoot starts to figure things out that's when you probably end up wanting to Pivot back his way so I guess the question is  can your team survive with scoot  if it's head to head until he's a useful fantasy play  because if so you probably stick with scoot if not  it's sucks  azer or keldon Johnson that's as her Thompson and that's an easy one for me  freaky what do you think about Bruce Brown is he a 12 team rest of season guy yes I believe so  Ryan is Butler and capella and Miles bridges too much for Garland and Deonte Murray or Jamal Murray I'm not sure which Murray in a points League  yes that is likely too much I'm assuming the butler is the best of the bunch but I don't have the ESPN points numbers in front of me um  yeah this is relatively fair I guess  I don't hate it either way I don't hate it either way go whatever side you like but  Bond Carroll or Jalen Johnson points League points like I'll go by Caro category Lee gets Johnson  JP hi Dan do I start Delon Wright County Georgia Moses Moody tomorrow Delon Wright because keonte might play eight minutes Moody might not play at all if Thomson's Klay Thompson's back in there  so  oh I need steals assist threes and Boards well I might get you three of those four things  they met today  Ian says 9 cat who wins the trade Sohan and Wendell Carter Junior for klaxon Lewis the clocks inside  because Clarkson's probably the best player in the deal  and then a Congo infos our likely both startable I don't know that so on a window Carter Jr even really 12 teams  Jax says trading Jalen Duren and Clint capela or Jalen Duren and Kyle kuzma for Jimmy Butler and Christian wood would you do it trade that I would definitely make hopefully you can replace the kuzma stuff  it's a 10 team so you're basically just gunning for first and second round values and I think during probably settles back towards top 40 top 50 maybe later and Butler's gonna work his way up into the top 15 like always  is Scoot a hold yeah you have to I mean I told you guys not to draft him but if you did anyway now you got to hold him  thoughts on cage turnovers per game I think maybe you asked this question yesterday they're gonna be really really high  probably not five which is where he's at right now but for is very much in play  so get used to it man it's why I didn't draft him anywhere that didn't feel goal percent  Rock says hey Dan would you trade away Reeves for Wiggins uh  no  is it by low time for Franz Wagner not really he's been fine he's number 65 and 9 cat  I think he probably if anything it's almost a cell she's been the only guy on that team able to make a shot and he's shooting 95% High Volume 3 throw I think he probably settles back towards the 80 range wow that was the last sip of water so whenever I run out of gas here that's the end of it hey Dan what are your thoughts on on Yoko Kang woo he played 24 minutes last game to Capella's 23 yeah I mean  we sort of an over this one he's probably gonna be around 22 minutes 21 22 minutes when Coppell is healthy and he's gonna be a top one 10 115 120 guy in those games and then if capella ever misses a game which we know he will oh Kong was a top 40 guy as a full-time starter so you just your way in it out you're waiting it you're balancing it he's startable even in these capella games barely but startable and then you'll mix in the big ones  is Bruce Brown a close your eyes play every day guy yeah I'm fine with that  would you sell high on Scotty Barnes he's off to a really good start this year he's top 20  yes three and a half to defensive stats is not sticking I'm not even sure the field goal percent sticks but maybe it does  21 points 10 rebounds six assists you're absolutely selling high and you're gunning for someone in the top 35 to 40 range try to make that incremental Improvement on your Club David says with Simmons playing well does it affect claxton's minutes when he comes back also like a sub to Dan guys yeah everybody's sub to Dan guys  no I think it'll impact Dorian Finney Smith more than anything else  a different David says was trying to think of trading up to a top 36 plus Scotty Barnes question yes I think that's a good idea  BS says Hayward or Middleton  it's probably Middleton but you're gonna have to be waiting through some crap to get there  Nick says I traded yakka Pearl and Julius Randle for Jimmy Butler yay or nay yay very good trade oh I made it to the end of the questions I think qsb says what do you think of RJ Barrett arrested of season category League he's terrible  if you had to pick Dinwiddie or Barrett Dinwiddie in category League's Michael Barrett and points but I don't play any points leaks  Trey Jones or Mike Conley for assists probably trade Jones  Noah asks his buddy hield droppable technically yes but you probably better off just hanging on  to see if he gets moved because if you drop him and he gets moved somebody's going to pick him up and then we know buddy hield can like last year he was a top 50 play as a starter  if he goes to some team that badly needs a floor spacer and he gets starters minutes you'll feel very silly  problem is that in the meantime it's it's gonna be real freaking rough he's outside the top 120 right now hopefully he can just sort of hang on at like just playable enough which is where he is right now that you can luxury stash him until he's somewhere better  up all right you got that question was reposted  me in a cross says I like tracking the old man squad it feels good to have drafted value picks yeah and you know the other thing I throw out there is that the old man squad tends to be yeah the last thing I was saying is that the old man squad they do 10 off to often get off to kind of slow starts because the old dudes are easing into the season so don't panic there's a couple guys that are not quite there yet they'll be fine  zubats are Looney  let's go eat pizza on that one  I have WeChat Scoot and O'Connell I know I went overboard and upside but do I hold or try to make moves for more consistent floor guys right now well Chad has been amazing so I don't think you need to worry about anything there scoots the one that's going to be trouble for a bit  my vote is just hang on  is Suggs a hold now or just a streamer I say hold  kcp or Gordon Hayward rest of season I'm gonna say kcp because I don't know what miles Bridges is going to do to Hayward and I may live to regret that call so just with the caveat  kcp we kind of know what he is which is probably someone that's going to end up in that between 80 and 100 and 105 and there's a chance that Gordon Hayward could be above 80 but if miles Bridges comes in and starts jacking those minutes then the whole thing comes apart  let's see last question here for cup Jake someone dropped Jared Allen who do I dropped to get him Mark Williams Astor Thompson or Jalen Johnson geez  well that's a tough one because you got to drop somebody it's probably Jalen Johnson  because even though he's playing better than Astor Thompson right now on a nine Cat Side it just feels like the ceiling for us or is insane so unfortunately it's Jalen Johnson  which by the way Segways into this question are asked her Thompson I think I'm gonna go ask her and Nicholas says would you use the number one waiver claim for Daniel Gafford yes I think I would  and that's the end of it guys I'm very sorry I can't do any more I'm out of water and I'm out of voice thank you so much for listening I was gonna try to do a Bi-Lo sell High show later today but that's just not gonna happen in my current vocal situation  if I have some vocal strength we'll do two shows tomorrow but I make no promises maybe it's something that I try
