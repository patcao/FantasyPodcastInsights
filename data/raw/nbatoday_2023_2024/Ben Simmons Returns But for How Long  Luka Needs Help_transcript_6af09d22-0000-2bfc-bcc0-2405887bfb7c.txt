welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast good day everybody  what the hell is today Tuesday  January 30th  we're a couple days from February might be time for me to start growing out the rabbinic beer again  or not  doesn't matter uh welcome to show this is fantasy NBA today just a standard Tuesday recap Edition here in the morning I do have again  pipe dreams of bonus shows in the afternoon we'll see if they come to fruition I still have all these ideas of shows that I haven't done so the ones that I've the idea is I've had that we've pulled off so far baillos we've done some Bilo shows we've done a lot of those actually we've done some sell highs which people don't seem to enjoy quite as much for whatever reason  we did a few stash shows those were big hits those one really those really hit the  the YouTube algorithm slipping slide um but I got these other ideas and I don't want to say them out loud because then somebody's gonna be like that's a good idea Dan and they're gonna do it before I have time to but let's see I have one two three four five five other ideas that I haven't done yet this season that I just  I gotta find a way I gotta I gotta peel the time out for it I don't know I'm gonna do it  damn it  but I'm gonna try  the big news of the morning  there's a few of them actually  busy news morning actually so let's start with a small news of the morning Isaiah Stewart did not practice for the Piston so one would assume that he probably misses their next ball game there isn't an obvious at all if we find out that as her Thompson is starting then that would probably be something of light note  smallish  smallish News Patrick Williams of the Bulls is expected to miss at least two weeks which means if you've got an IO just to move floating around on your way for wire this would be a reasonable time to go scoop them because it does seem like he's gonna have a couple weeks of actual fantasy value that's good that's something um  also news of the morning news of the morning Darius Garland is expected to make his return  tomorrow which means that my Bi-Lo show from yesterday where I did finally have Garland on one more time that was a third time we had him on as a you should be buying low now  well that was probably the end of the line because now the news is out there is expected return to Morrow means that whoever has him is no longer going to be willing to sell at it absurd discount you probably missed that window if you have Darius Garland congratulations you've made it through the dark times  and you hope that the minutes ramp up pretty quick because he wasn't dealing with a knee or you know core or whatever where you know you'd kind of need to ease back in I'm sure they'll  not gonna get pushed super hard because he missed whatever was 67 weeks here but  but  it's a jaw injury so you know make sure he doesn't get whacked in the face his first couple games back and then he'll probably get ramped up pretty quick more news of the morning dejounte Murray and DeAndre Hunter Dione DeAndre Hunter both practiced or where I part of hawks shoot around I should say earlier this morning I don't know if that means they're gonna play in this game against the Lakers but hunter is a name to keep an eye on because we know dejounte Murray on the trade block we know the Hawks have a there's the possibility that  okay so let's say that the Hawks trade a few guys  DeAndre Hunter would be someone that then steps into a very large role as it says right now his role wouldn't be that great other than to kind of minimize the Deep Bay who likely becomes a drop when DeAndre Hunter comes back provided again nobody gets traded here in the next couple of days but then the deadline is only nine days away from us right now so  you know if you're sitting on Hunter I think you could probably continue to do that  I thought Deontay Murray I put him on to buy low show yes right so I still think he's a Bi-Lo even if he does play I think people are so freaked out you could turn into a Bi-Lo more news of the morning Cade Cunningham returned to practice so again it feels like things were more precautionary on that front that'll mean that Alec Burks is not a stream in Detroit anymore and Jaden Ivy who's probably barely hangs on to points League value not even going to be close to 9 League 9 cat value when Kate Cunningham comes back  Tyreese Halliburton is expected to play tonight for the Indiana Pacers but will not get a full workload according to Rick Carlisle  LeBron James is expected to play tonight Anthony Davis is a game time decision for tonight and those are some of the tidbits of news that broke either first thing this morning or late last night  now I suppose I can officially welcome to the show good morning

taking in this content that really does matter as we continue to try to push this thing forward  I think we're  I think most folks see this as like this like  top two or three  fantasy NBA podcast realm which is extremely cool like never in my wildest dreams that I think that that was gonna be the thing even when I started doing it like  you guys know I was a minor league baseball broadcaster I've talked about that for a while I do some college baseball some college basketball even now gets me out of the house and it's a lot of fun still but I still think back of like it was in March of 2016 when it was like a month maybe after Brew Aaron bruske started who ball and I wrote in I was just like I've been I'm I'm awesome at fantasy sports how do I get involved in this and  and Brew taught me how to do some blurbs I learned blurb for the website and then somewhere along the line we were talking on the phone he was just like what do you actually do I was like I'm a broadcaster he's like we needed we need a fantasy basketball podcast here at hoop ball and I was like that sounds outstanding that's like my wheelhouse and that was  that was like April or May of 2016 and I was doing shows with Brew like once a week and I did a show with I don't know if you guys remember Vince Miracle like once a week in there twice a week in there and then it was not until December of that year that we actually like turned it into a legitimate podcast feed  and then here we are now as one of the biggest fantasy basketball podcast on the globe ridiculous  what a ridiculous Universe this is  anyway we got to get into the car because yesterday was a big one and we're gonna want to move through this thing with some kind of what's the word I'm looking for is a lacquer tea the right word  aquacy  cheerful Readiness that's not it that's not what I want oh speed and eagerness yeah there we go I'm speedy and I'm eager Eager Beaver New York Beach Charlotte surprise surprise but they did it without Julius Randle who's set to miss a few weeks with a shoulder dislocation and without OG anunoby who was a late scratch yesterday but they figured they didn't need them and they were right they didn't need them because Jalen Brunson grabbed the wheel of this thing and they didn't need a whole lot beyond that although some expected and good pieces of data on this one Donte divincenzo 28 and 5 he took 22 shots in the Ballgame that's crazy but you was gonna be good with Randall out and then a secondary bump with Annie out Josh Hart 39 minutes started 812 and 7 on a it could have been even better if he hit a three or got a steal or a block but he's also a guy that I'm using here while Randall is out  Isaiah hartenstein started but only plays 16 and a half minutes is he slowly ramps back up to game speed still put up a good line even in 16 and a half minutes so yeah not worried about that pressure is a chewa also saw big minutes I don't like his Fantasy game I've said this to you guys many times so it shouldn't surprise anyone  so as far as the Knicks go and by the way Quentin Grimes 32 minutes off the bench but man let's assume OG comes back in the in the relatively near future the next year starting our hartenstein because at some point here he's gonna be in the 20s and then he'll go into the mid-high twenties and we know he can dominate with that or anything beyond that so hard Stein Brunson even shenzo and heart those are the four Nicks that I'm starting right now and then OG when he comes back but I don't remove anyone he just gets added on to that pack  Charlotte uh so no lamelo again and Nick Richards had a bad ball game but he's fine until Mark Williams comes back if he ever comes back and then certainly with all of these guys out PJ Washington is a start because he's gonna take a ton of shots with no lamelo  Cody Martin finally had a better ball game but I'm not adding him because he'd been super quiet up until this one Brandon Miller and Miles bridges are guys you start with lamelo out when ball comes back let's assume it's at some point here not too far away we saw the guy that took the biggest hit there was actually PJ Washington because he wasn't taking as many shots he was coming off the bench in that spot and if that's the thing that happens again and I think he becomes more of like a  you know I had to head you get away with it I don't know that I would use PJ against a games cap once little is back but again Terry Rose years gone there gonna be trying to move Kyle Lowry and Gordon Hayward who we haven't seen in forever and so then lamelo's the only one that's kind of hanging over this thing Cavaliers are  playing their freaking butts off these days they're 28 and 16 now and they've won nine of the last 10 ball games there's 16 and 8 at home 12 and 8 on the road yeah that means they're gonna have some more Road games coming up here but like firmly in the five seed right now and I have came back of the Sixers and the Knicks  Cavs have been amazing they got evenly back for this ball game as well which  I'm like this team is really impressed the crap out of me I know they'd run against some pretty weak competition but now they got Mobley back he started on a minutes limit played 21 and he'll be fine he'll ramp his way up there  interestingly the guy who lost out in this one was Charis Levert because Isaac Korra was playing well and so they just stuck with that line up so where do I stand on the Cavs well obviously Jared Allen and Donovan Mitchell have been insane lately and now Evan Mobley I think  probably startled in his next ball game frankly get him up to like 23 minutes that's probably enough  as he works his way back up the board Max Drew's is a start again 147 and 3 is shots starting to come back around thank goodness it was a very long slump for him and then Levert I think you can go ahead and drop  especially with Darius Garland do back tomorrow and you know again Mobley ramping up so Garland's going to be back that means Levert's not gonna have a whole lot to do or Carl's gonna lose his starting job in a minute here and the calves are gonna have a  strong starting lineup again and all these other guys have sort of figured out how when where they fit  well the main dudes were out I'm blown away because remember when the Cavs lost Mobly and Garland in like back-to-back hours whatever that was six seven weeks ago a lot of us myself included was like you know if this team loses a bunch of games in a row they might turn into Cellars and lo and behold they got better  that's wild man  that's positively why Wild  anyway shout out to the Cavaliers I didn't talk about the clippers because fantasy wise I don't think there's really anything to talk about  there has been no consistent  fill in for evidence that was the only question we had and there hasn't been one Norm Powell was decent again in this ball game he's a luxury Clippers have but he's not there every day Phoenix beat Miami on the road Miami's lost seven games in a row the news in this ball game is that Grayson Allen turned ankle early in the game and did not return Eric Gordon stepped in and had his first big game in a  decade know that's not fair like two months basically so no I'm not picking him up you you know you'll see games where okogie plays more you'll they'll do a little mixing and matching in Phoenix  I would prefer that Grace and Allen just come back and we don't have to worry about it but I also I'm not I'm just not a fan of Eric Gordon's Fantasy game which and this game totally be lied how it usually goes for him you just like when they had Superstars down two of them typically I was like yeah go ahead because you knew he was gonna get 18 19 shots and you just prayed that he didn't go sick of 19 from the floor but he did sometimes  and now you've got the superstars in there I know Gordon took more shots than KD in this one but you know that's the thing you think is gonna happen regularly  I also have this bridge and so on and so forth as far as Miami goes you know who to start at this point it's the main dudes and it's nobody beyond that  I was curious what I may have his job would be as he sort of ramps back up into game shape and the answer is it was inconsistent he was bad in this ball game so that cost him whatever chance he might have had for more minutes I don't think you need to hold on to anyone that's not one of the four main dudes from Miami  Jimmy Butler bam out of Bio Terry Rozier  Tyler hero uh  the only good news for Miami right now and it's it's fleeting because they've Fallen all the way down to the seven seed with the seven-game losing streak the only bit of good news right now is that Jimmy Butler has been on a pretty good heater since he came back from injury he's up number 30 now on the season we just talked about like a week and a half ago two weeks ago he was number 49  and he's an early second rounder since coming back from his injury as well so that at least is good  Brooklyn blew out Utah you can pretty much throw this thing out John Collins and keyonte George were the Jazz that kind of survived this ball again I asked Walker Kessler's line wasn't too terrible but everybody else was bad we talked about Jordan Clarkson being a sell guy when he was super hot now he's cool off this is just how it goes your holding Collins sex then obviously obviously Laurie marketing is been very good all season long but everybody gets to have a bad one once in a blue moon so just know no valuation changes on the Jazz from this one from where we were at previously with these guys which is basically Walker Kessler because he can put a Big Blocks numbers in low minutes he's a start marketing is a start Sexton is a start Clarkson is not now these cooled off you want to wait for the heater again or you know buy super duper low and then sell super duper High he's so streaky  Kris Dunn not enough minutes keyonte George not enough minutes consistently and then John Collins right now is probably startable  because he's on kind of a a usage tear over his last few games but I also don't think that that sticks forever  now for Brooklyn and this is probably the kind of team du jour today and he's and Ben Simmons is the thumbnail for today's podcast Ben Simmons is back  he played 18 minutes off the bench and he was the biggest impact player on the Nets in 18 minutes off the bench 10 points 8 boards 11 assists a steal a little block on a perfect five out of five shooting um yeah he looked good the question I guess is how fast do they ramp him up can his body handle it by the way the answer to that question is we already know know it cannot so do they I mean is this a player that they keep throttled down a little bit because of his back and body issues I don't know I don't have the answer to that question but what I do know is that he made them a lot better  I don't think it was at all coincidence that Spencer Dinwiddie 26 minutes the team was a plus two Ben Simmons is 18 minutes A team was a plus 27  I have been telling you all the fade Spencer didn't witty since the beginning of time now because I don't like to do not because I don't think he's a decent basketball player but because his Fantasy game is whack  he's a very low fuel goal per cent guy who's not really a free throw positive sometimes score is and usually gets you some assists that's all you're getting out it didn't witty and a lot of that is about to go away  he'll have the odd game here and there where you're looking back and you're like oh man why did I drop that dude because he had like 1971 game then you got to look at all the games around the good one  and you got this one a bonafide clunker so with Simmons back my Dennis Smith Jr stash idea for the trade deadline also probably Goes Up in Flames again you know Simmons might be out in five days we have no idea how long this is gonna last but his return is unquestionably good news for both cams and Mikhail Bridges who had already been coming on Bridges he's been pretty good for about the last  what are we at now like two-ish weeks  yeah third rounder over the last two weeks  that's we hope repeatable for him third round value that was kind of what we were shooting for at the beginning of the year third rounder that doesn't miss a ball game would have had him at or above his 80P but you know when you have two and a half months before you hit third round that your top 90 guy yeah it makes a little harder to come back from that but either way he's gonna have open shots campus is gonna have more opener more open shots cam Johnson had one of his best ball games in a long time here and I hope that that's a sign of things to come that they can just sort of  they can play campus cam Johnson together they don't you know with Spencer Dinwiddie could be the odd man out it doesn't really change what you're doing with those guys I had told all of you to hold cam Johnson at least through the trade deadline I know you were yelling at me that it's hard I don't care I still think that was the thing you should do and this ball game is I think a at least a reasonable example of why  cam Thomas is a hold possibly a sell High although again he's another guy that if he gets pushed into the starting lineup the rest of the way that would be very good for him and then with Simmons you know I mentioned picking him up as a stash and now you just sort of see how it goes  by the way I don't think that I would have started him today or in this ball game  which would actually be yesterday Dan I need a I didn't get enough sleep last night  I wouldn't have started Simmons if someone was like Dana you're gonna start him on this minutes cap nope and I would have missed this one so now full disclosure there I need Simmons to get up near starters minutes before I feel comfortable dropping him into a rodeo lineup and he probably skips back to backs and that creates some other problems but also I mean look how much better the team was with him there  Utah's really cool off after their super crazy run huh  I have a really cool off  but cool off a fair amount  Boston beat New Orleans this game was tight throughout and  Pelicans went Wing heavy in this one  which meant that yonis Valentina and Larry Nance each had trouble seeing enough minutes JV was able to do enough in his 20 minutes Larry Nance was kind of not  I still like Nance we've seen pretty consistently here lately he can do enough in 20 minutes on a court he just didn't have it in this one and when guys are not you know World beaters in fantasy you're going to have some quiet games  Trey Murphy was a little bit better and he played 28 minutes so that's good but I don't think he needs to be on rosters right now he's very close to the cut line in my opinion he's like  pressed up against the department store window  like literally right there but I'll let me how badly do you really need three pointers and almost nothing else I'd rather have heard Jones between those two guys Franklin rather have Larry Nance between the three of them I think Nancy's guy you should probably be holding in Roto  if you don't need a center that I guess that's a spot where you could move on her Jones is another guy that you see you have two or three of these very quiet games then he pops off for a monster one and that's how overall his value continues to stay you know 90 range  but it's gonna be the Danny Green syndrome in between where if you watch every herb Jones line you're gonna end up being annoyed and dropping or benching and you're gonna miss the good one  this was the front end of a back-to-back for the Celtics so Horford played in this one and he was a good fill in and then poor singers will probably play in the other one but that's really the only note on Boston so let's Keep On Truckin  Wizards beat the Spurs uh cool he had a decent line but again  only six shots and this is why like the minutes were already there he was our 31 minutes if they trade tyus Jones what's 30 one gonna become for cool to believe 302 33  it has to be about usage and I thought I was actually had a decent amount in this game we took 16 shots he had nine assists the ball was in his hands a lot it's just in my mind  like I think they need to move kuzma or pool for cooling at enough  ball in hand on offense to be a consistent nine cat guy this year  Marvin Bagley remains an intriguing stash candidate should Daniel Gafford get moved I don't think they're going to be able to trade Jordan Poole and it'd be sort of a bad time to do it because his value has fully bottomed out  which is saying a lot considering how bad of a year it's been kuzma could get moved Gafford could get moved high as Jones could get moved there's just like there's only so many guys you can sit on leading up to the trade deadline the guy on this team that would see the biggest bump would be badly because he goes from 18 minutes to 302  and his numbers don't double because that's just not the way the sort of curved line works for how much you get to do when you're on a basketball court but they wouldn't like  he could legitimately be like a and eighteen to twenty points score in starters minutes seven eight nine rebound something like that and you just pray that he doesn't screw up everything else  but again that's gonna require a Gafford move  and and the cool belief one in my opinion requires probably a Jones and other usage guy getting out of the way  you can make an argument for it you can make an argument for a stash on on those guys and just hope that one guy gets traded and see what happens I don't think it's impossible but as I sort of handicapped the whole thing it just it sort of feels like it needs more opportunity  to do stuff on the court not to be on the court because he's already doing that  now to be they a feature player in anything going on  well the Jeremy Sohan crash was about as hard as expected you know we knew that the heater wasn't gonna last forever and turned it turned sour in a hurry  and this is you know I've talked about a lot about how I'm trying to be better on this show about being accepting of playing guys that are just hot even if I don't think they're going to be consistently good fantasy performers and that's what's led to the creation of this sort of stream while warm contingent  and so on was on that and you know her and RJ Barrett and Jordan Clarkson Cole Anthony's Reed Bobby Portis these are all guys that  at the end of the year  now maybe well herb got off to such a hot start but most of these names that I just read off are probably not going to be inside the top 100 at the end of the year but they're going to have two to three weeks stretches probably a couple of times during the season where they are and what and it doesn't happen it wouldn't have anything to do with the players around them it's not an increase in Opportunity it's not an increase in you know minutes it was just like they got hot for a few weeks or a couple weeks and the coaches like your hot right now go play more  it's very hard  to handicap that because you don't know when the heater is gonna run out and anything can cause it  it's like in baseball it's easier to see when a heater starts than when it ends baseball it's like a guy who's in an 0 for 21 slump and then all of a sudden he gets a broken bat bloop single to right and you're like oh here we go  here comes it you know four four four night it's coming right now boom it's like clockwork every damn time basketball similar thing guys in a deep slump  has it's like a desperation heave three pointer when they're not thinking about it and then Bingo they had two three four shots in a row after that you can always see it coming on the positive side what's hard to figure out is when the cold night is coming  you kind of need to know like oh did this guy eat something weird before the ball game is he moving slow because yeah the squirts  it's not sleep well bad in the hotel fire alarm went off like all these weird little things that could mess up a guy's heater I don't know what happened to Jeremy Sohan before this game but he certainly wasn't the same one as the last five ball games and now is this a spot where you start to get in his own headers and and slumps they have this feedback loop thing that goes on guys are missing they're missing they're missing and they start they stop believing that it's going to go in  and a golf instructor when I was like 14 or 15 years old I'm not very good at golf anymore because I mean I'm still okay but I played a lot when I was a kid and he made a big deal about visualizing  close your eyes  visualize perfect contact with the golf ball  and I didn't get it I didn't understand it as a teenager So and I've always had this weird problem that when I tried to visualize myself doing something and this probably says something about my I have a psychiatric issue that's gone undiagnosed I always had trouble visualizing it going right  the one that I remember from my childhood I don't want him getting off on this tangent on a day where we have to cover 12 ball games but  I was on bowling team my senior year of high school at Corbin Bowl in Tarzana California we were called the Jamba Juice  stupid name for a team you can guess the makeup of the team however anyway I was pretty good actually I'm quite good bowler restraint I'm not Mookie Betts good but I'm pretty good and I tried to do the visualization thing on that as well but for some reason every time I visualize myself  bringing a bowling ball back and forward  I visualized it hitting me in the back of my right leg  I can't figure out why that was the case because that like gets out of the way  you know it it brings off to the side it opens up and you bring the ball through  as the same thing with golf when I try to visualize a hack  it wasn't consistent contact it was like I chunked the ground or something  but that's the that's what this is I was obviously a victim of my own brains issues  but players are the same thing when they close their eyes do they see the basketball going in or do they see it clanging off the side of the iron  I've tried to teach my seven year old about visualizing we do it as we're going to bed at night and it's not about sports successes for him it's visualizing things that make him feel happy and calm because I want my children to sleep through the night without any nightmares that kind of deal but just this concept of positivity of being able to visualize successes  in it people say you can do it in business I don't know how you visualize like walking into a meeting and closing a deal that feels like nonsense because like what are you visualizing this other person saying this you can't  interpret it in my opinion you have to visualize things that you have control over yourself what can your body do and what are the the guaranteed results of physics basically in that instance and for these guys they could do that  anyway all that to say you never really know when a slump is coming  but if it's coming and these guys that like consistently are not r o s rest of season guaranteed producers it can hit hard and he got to get the hell out of the way when it does step aside let the bus come through and it'll hit somebody else  and again I try to be better about being willing to take a shot on heaters  but it is a saucy play and it can really get you a bit  Kevin herder would be another semi example of this he's been very very good over the last two weeks and I think that's actually pushed him now he's at 136 on the season now so it hasn't even pushed him back inside the top one hundred  over the last month he's number 90 because again prior to the last two weeks he was awful last two weeks he's top 20 yeah I mean I think we we all kind of expect the Kevin herder hot run to stop at some point but he's cooking right now and so you got to play him he's one of the Street East dudes in the NBA Harrison Barnes is also been hot and the combination of those two guys being hot and Barnes wasn't that hot in this one but he got extra minutes for some reason has marginalized Malik monk he's been a total no-show over the last few weeks  and I'm honestly I'm torn I'm freaking torn on Malik monk because he's number one 51 on the season and that's about where he started the year and then he went through a stretch for about a month where he was top 70 and now the last two weeks he's where I was he's like outside the top 300 brutal percentages just not doing anything at all  and so he's dropped himself all the way back down to that slow start to the year  and I'm seriously considering putting Malik monk in the Stream while warm contingent because he was asked to do more when heard her in Barns were awful  and when one of those guys is bad and the other one is good monk is probably like borderline when they're both terrible he's a must start when one of them is okay he's borderline but when they're both playing better which is I guess sort of what's happening right now for the Kings then Monk Is Not playable  I don't know man I I feel like I'm too low on Monk  and I feel like I have been from the outset and I feel like it's gonna get me but I just I don't think he needs to be on rosters right now  I don't think you're gonna be kicking yourself all that much until he starts to warm up again and  you know if somebody picked him up before that fine they'll get the next heater but you can get one of these other guys that goes on a heater I heard a heater  let's talk the Grizzlies because they are full they are straight up and fermery right now John conchar who was already feeling in for Luke Kennard who was already feeling in for Desmond Bane all the way out this is full Russian nesting doll style stuff now with Grizzlies they called up Matthew hurt on a an injury deal I forget that the nomenclature on that and he had to play 23 minutes right out of the Chute the starters for the Grizzlies not surprisingly got pretty big minutes in this one Xavier Tillman was forced into larger action and if this is the lineup they have to try it out again then freaking have at it JJJ was inefficient here but obviously he's a start when he's going Santee eldama did the kind of game that we were thinking of where like the eagle field goal percent was bad but the free throw percent was fine he made his one foul shot 16 points five three-pointers seven rebounds two assists in two steals he can do a lot of things Santi aldama and that's why I remain cautiously bullish on him because look I mean look what look what happens when he gets 14 shots  that's a juicy fantasy line  I don't think I have the stones to play Scotty Pippin Junior and I definitely don't have this don't play David Roddy because I don't like his family he's mostly three-pointers and he didn't make those here any missed some free throws and just like way more bad than good uh same story for Gigi Jackson interesting but typically I think hurts you more than he helps  but you can't really it's not like I can tell you guys to go out and pick up Xavier Tillman because I have no idea who's gonna play for the Grizzlies in their next ball game  aldama Vince Williams who was also had for this one and JJJ are the three Grizzlies and Luke Kennard that are presumably like near healthy or healthy that I would play and then again just like keep tabs if Tillman starts the next ball game because they're super short handed you play him  just make these tweaks but you got to do it on the Fly  Timberwolves without Mike Conley got a win over okay see that's kind of interesting Timberwolves now a half game up on the nuggets for the top record of the West there's four teams that are all kind of duke it out for that top spot that field kind of safely the upper half of the Western Conference bracket but this is a really good win for the Wolves specially with out Conley know I'm not streaming Nicole Alexander Walker that's the only question on the wolf side Jalen Williams heard himself in this one he left late and then the hope is that maybe he doesn't miss any time but you'll kind of have to wait and see Jen Holmgren is on my Bi-Lo board and this made him cheaper so that I actually kind of like right now go by low on home because he's in a little bit of a shooting Funk he'll be fine even if it takes the All-Star break to get him there this is a good young basketball player who is just a little low on Steam right now  and a lot of those teams at the top of the West that got off to the super hot starts wolves thunder in particular they've been a little more human of late  and that's why the kind of come back to the pack  and that's a that's a nice battle going on at the top of the West these days  Lakers looked like a team that won a double overtime game and night and a half earlier and they just had they had nothing in the tank for this one God blitzed right out of the gate which has been a problem for the Lakers prior to switching over to this more recent starting lineup but don't worry too much about it jarred Vanderbilt is a guy that I like he got ejected for flicking Dillon Brooks in the head and the Lakers were extremely annoyed with Brooke's after the ball game for a shove in the back when Vanderbilt was dunking they said he was his trash shock word is that his Trash Talk crossed a line that to me sounds like the Lakers being a little bit of babies about it but I I was in the car listening to the game and Lakers play by play guy was not really describing the ball game I don't want to I don't want to be that guy but it was really some of the most painful play-by-play I've ever listened to so I have no idea what was actually happening in this game but what I've read after the fact is that  the Lakers took umbrage to the push in the back during a dunk because that's the kind of thing where if a guy if he doesn't hold onto the rim  then the legs go forward the neck and head go back and that's how you get someone really badly hurt and so they were just pissed at Brooks right from the outset and the Lakers were tired when you're tired you're always gonna be angry at people  so yeah no big valuation changes d low is still hot  add is questionable for tonight LeBron is going to try to play it in Atlanta and I think Jarred Vanderbilt is going to get a whole bunch of playing time he's gonna be the one Laker who has a little bit of energy for this one so yeah give me give me those five Give me the main for the Lakers plus vandal for the Rockets Jalen green is very much a sell high right now he's taking a ton of shots and he is making them and this is the hottest he's been at any point all year and it's probably the hottest he's been at any point in his career but you got a capitalize on it because this is a guy who was in a deep mental Funk he's bursting out of it and he's just gonna hit every shot he takes for the next I don't know how many games  and you got a ride it I mean this is one of those ones that's clear is a bell that he's just super hot and suddenly confident and get what you can I mean if you can get anybody inside the top 80 for Jaylin green you absolutely do it frankly I think if you can get anybody and stop that side the top one hundred you do it  don't worry about Freddie Van Fleet he didn't you just didn't have to do much in this game because the Rockets had way more energy they shot 53% and just absolutely swarmed the Lakers on the glass three rockets at nine rebounds or more they out rebounded the Lakers by 20  three rockets had more rebounds than anyone on the Lakers  that is a tired basketball team now playing a back-to-back expect the Hawks by the way to put up some big numbers tonight I would think 80 sits it out Jabari Smith Jr was also back for Houston cam Whitmore at 20 points and 18 minutes I continue to push him more as a keeper Dynasty type you know if you're if you're playing him right now you're getting some stuff which is good but I just I I can't bring myself to go full trust here while the minutes remain this low it's just it's kind of impossible to have workable fantasy value in 18 minutes a game and they're still without tari Eason  Dallas big comeback win over Orlando Magic continue to be in my eyes one of the most difficult teams to Handy cap on a night tonight basis France Wagner 9 cat Pollo bunk Carroll points League guys and then it's like oh I got a lot of questions about Jonathan Isaac because he played 20 minutes for a couple of games and I said you know I can't trust Jonathan Isaac and then he played eight minutes here and Anthony black out of nowhere it is returned home I'm told I had 20 points I don't care Jaylen Suggs had three steals I do kind of care about that because I said if the defensive stats really do come all the way back for Suggs I would get in on it but as minutes have been stuck in the mid-20s lately so no Wendell Carter Junior two games in a row he's basically split the center minutes with no Vagner so that makes kind of both of those guys I know do you need to hold on to a rental car to Junior  yeah probably but I honestly wouldn't care if you didn't and then Cole Anthony had his first decent game in a long while maybe this is the thing that wakes him up and gets him back into the stream while warm contingent but also Mark L faults was not there for this Blog game and that certainly helped the guards for Orlando get to do a little bit more  no Kyrie Irving for the Mavs so it's Luka Tim Hardaway and Derek Lively and that is the entire story for the Cavs I don't care that Jaden Hardy had eight 18 and 7  that's it I don't care I'm not playing anybody else on that team  Denver built me a walkie the new look Milwaukee Bucks new look being Doc Rivers looked an awful lot like the old look Milwaukee Bucks  other than it does kind of seem like Brooke Lopez's gonna be more involved so that I guess is a decent first sign but you're not really changing anything with this team evaluation wise no adjustments of any kind Denver we haven't had evaluation adjustment since opening day and we can just zoom past that to the last game on the board the only truly late game yesterday Portland blew out Philadelphia but Philly was without Joel embiid and without Tyrese Maxey for a second consecutive ballgame which meant that Paul Reed got to have fun again Kelly oubre got to have fun again Patrick Beverley got to have fun again and they're obviously not good when those guys are the main dudes and so they got waxed by a bad team  Tobias Harris was also not good but he's you know certainly someone you could play  I don't know who's gonna play for Philly in their next one I always helped I hope that impede and Max your back but I don't know if they're gonna be and if we find out somehow I had a time that they're not then you go read and probably Beverly for another ball game for Portland scoot Henderson had his sort of once a week decent ball game I don't know when the when he's gonna truly figure this out the general the rule of thumb for rookies is after the All-Star break and so maybe that's when things start to come around for scoot presumably Malcolm Brogden will be on another team by then obviously play the crap out of him while you can Jeremy Grant I think is going to be very difficult to trade deodhar 8 in his playing better again lately Simon's up and down it's fine I feel like the questions you guys have for me are Jabari Walker and Scoot  scoot I just answered that's like that's a guy you  consider acquiring after three bad games in a row  in late January so like around now and then you pray  and Jabari Walker is someone that we need usage guys out of the way so Brogden  and someone else  like a Brogden got traded right now and shaedon Sharpe wasn't back yet Jabari Walker might be playable  I still think they need Jeremy Grant to move so that Walker can just like really have a lock on the forward minutes because he's a decent rebounder  but he doesn't do much else you know we need him 10 to 12 shots and  we need some defensive stats which are all so lacking  I don't know man I everybody's higher on Jabari Walker than I am I I'm not seeing the fantasy side of it  and last two weeks he's played 30 minutes a game and he's outside the top 200 because he's averaging Nine and Nine with one combined defensive stat on bad percentages  eight shots a game that's a big note there if that goes up to 11 now you're talking about oh I don't know 13 and 9  over a 3-pointer a game maybe plays an extra one and a half minutes maybe the Steals and blocks pick up ever so slightly maybe the percentages aren't as awful  he could creep towards value there but he's a long way away from being a true nine cat play I don't know why everybody is so much higher on him than I am maybe y'all are playing points  I don't know oh I forgot to do mid-show promo oh well lucky you guys

see Jeff asked if Levert is a drop I think the answer is yes  um but  Josh Hart and we talked about him do you see Andrew Wiggins getting back to consistent form for Fantasy playoffs I don't so this is a good question I didn't talk about Andrew Wiggins because they didn't play yesterday he's had a couple good ball games in a row  zazo is the question here so what I said on yesterday's show if you missed it was that I do think Wiggins is someone we should pick up  because if it clicks he could go on a run that like levels off his terrible numbers for the season so far we've just sort of seen no indicators that things are about to magically click like maybe it gets better for him in this lineup with Draymond and kaminga Wiggins Klay and Steph and they're just sort of like more room to operate in the Warriors are gonna play faster and not much defense so maybe it clicks I think the odds of Wiggins being good the rest of the way is like maybe 15% so if you have dead weight I'd say yes pick up Wiggins and just see what happens because basically every time he has one big game I'm like yeah we should probably pick him up and see what happens in the next one and so far every single time we've done that he's been horrible in the next ball game  but what if he's not we'd like to be the ones that are kind of in front of that train so  call it like a I don't know hopeful stash oh I don't have a word for it  what is Chet holmgren's trade value go back to yesterday I did a Buy Low show where Chet was the was a feature player on it so that one I actually already answered on a different show  um do do do do do do do do who would you stream today out of some wacky names we'll do we'll deal with that over on Twitter we talked about pressure to jaunty Porter I don't trust him at all and turtles getting close to buy the way so that'll hopefully  Jordan Aurora oh  okay so the Raptors have a lot of guys out right now that helps things noira Gary Trent Dennis Schroder all those guys are gonna get a bump  rest of the season value for Vando  I think a great Universe 110 to 120 range  Gafford versus Jalen Johnson  oh Jalen Johnson because if Gafford gets moved somewhere there's no guarantee that his role stays exactly the same the awesome player with the neatest Center a lot that his role would be safe but you just like you don't want to you don't take that chance take the locked in guy who ain't going anywhere special if Atlanta starts to blow it up and then it might just be like the Jalen Johnson show  and yes I know Derek Lively had a big night but he also makes a crap out of a rookie mistake and I'm sure Dallas would love to not have to deal with those develop Lively with someone in front of him  who is not glued to the ground like some of their other Center options in Dallas all right okay that'll about Do It um again trying to squeeze in a bonus show this afternoon I can't guarantee that one so but please do like rate subscribe and we'll see you guys
