welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  hope everybody had a nice weekend I did  did I  think I did  you know one of the things they don't tell you about Parenthood is that you legitimately can't remember even like two days in the past pretty sure we had a good weekend I'm pretty sure that we spent almost the entirety of the middle of Saturday taking just like copious amounts of crap out of our house my wife was like please stop calling it crap but it's crap  it was it was straight crap  we are as I've mentioned on the show a few times we are a Jewish household so Hanukkah is over and did last Thursday  but my wife's parents are separated so kids are going to get presents from both sides there my family has about 800 cousins here in California so kids are going to get a lot of presidents there and then my mom likes to just bring things so we had this big influx of stuff I know everybody else  Christmas is one week from now many of you will be having a big influx of stuff in a week so you know this pain and then we just you know we realized that we just had so many things that the kids don't use one of the things you go through here and I know I'm like way off topic because we want to get into the waiver wire stuff is  you know we have two boys we have a seven year old boy and a three and a half year old boy and so everything that gets passed down and ends up living in our house for way longer than  normal like if we had I don't know maybe it would have been different if we had had a girl the second time around or something but  all I know is that like every toy that the first one got  the  we we wanted to like kind of keep around for the second one  but then they don't even enjoy the same kinds of toys so I don't know what the hell we're doing here anyway Saturday was great because we took these big garbage bags of stuff just dumped him took a whole bunch of things and left it out on the on the street in front my kid my seven year old made a sign that just wrote free stuff we pinned it there was glory is so I hope that your weekend was as cathartic as mine  we have fantasy to discuss  that's what it's gonna look like here in a matter of moments we have fantasy to discuss but first welcome to Fantasy NBA today this is a sports ethos presentation and I am your host Dan Burrs make sure to follow me over on social media at Dan best

will cover every single team each 30 each team's most recent ball games all 30 and we will hit on the best pickups the most important moves to make over the weekend things that may end up being drops here it's not going to be sorted like we did on the Friday show you guys kind of know how these Mondays want these Monday First shows go we will probably have a little bit of a weekly preview thing coming up at some point later on today  so let's just go ahead and Dive Right On In  one thing that I have been doing a horrible job of is kind of burying the lead a little bit in that  if there's any big news that's come out I keep forgetting to bring it to you guys the only thing that's happened to this morning  that's not to speak of anything that happened over the weekend the only thing that happened this morning is that Shams had a tweet that Draymond Green has started his counseling there's an expectation that it's going to take at least three weeks and you guys probably recall that  I guessed 10 to 15 games Andre Moines suspension and that actually still feels like a somewhat reasonable Target will see I would go so there's  you know you don't can't really know for sure but  we shall see  all right let's talk games now Boston beat Orlando this game was one that the Celtics had kind of circled they talked about it after the Ballgame just a club in the magic that had given them a hard time I think Orlando whooped him the last time they played and so the Celtics came out and they were ready to rumble as far as fantasy stuff goes you know Goga every time that I I I'm ready to kind of move on from the Go-Go thing he has a couple of better ball games he is  I'm trying to this sort of a new category for me in this in the fantasy add drop universe and it's called The Stream wild warm  because I don't know that goes ever gonna get like blindingly hot I don't know if I can say a stream while hot but go get does seem to be a stream well warm guy  and I think that's where he's at right now so go ahead and play him until he hits another one of his little lulls or window Carter Jr comes back or whatever that's fine getting some questions about what to do with Jalen Suggs he's been sort of periodically hurt the last couple of weeks but he's still number 74 on the season overall so you are holding there and I have no qualms about that and advice as far as Boston goes there's really nothing they had their starting five and those are the guys that are going to get it done when this team is healthy Derek white has been insane so far this year he's actually number 207 in nine category league right now 27 on the shoulders of two and a half threes and 2.3 defensive stats pretty awesome pretty damn awesome 48.89 splits as well early third rounder can you believe that  risky 150 had him super high and I was like I don't know man that feels kind of high and then you know  in my eye but I had ties Jones higher than the b-150 and for a while it looked like I was very wrong on that one but Ty is spanking right now we'll get to him later on  Pelicans beat the Spurs 146 one 10 this game was blowout so nobody got many minutes on the Pelican side if they got their damage done prior to the game getting out of hand great that was only the case for some of these dudes Ingram McCallum JV those guys were good before the game got out of hand Trey Murphy was decent he's very much a start and then you got a bunch of bench guys that did stuff as well all varado Marshall so on so forth the big question on the Pelican side right now is what do we do with herb Jones because he has been quite bad last three or four ball games in a row  you got a hold the problem of course is that we can't just hold indefinitely and I know people were like why why like he's still inside the top 50 on the year why is this guy you're even talking about and the simple answer is that Trey Murphy is bringing something that herb doesn't bring which is they need more floor spacing and sometimes they need somebody to just sort of step out open things up and that allows other people to be more open because teams don't really respect herbs offense  For Better or Worse  they're gonna be games where they need her Jones to go guard a dominant scoring Wing those will be games where his minutes will be a bit more guaranteed but then you get to situation like this one where herbs not shooting the ball well the Spurs are not very good offensively anyway so they can go to their offense lineup  as far as the Spurs go the web banana at Center experiment from a reality standpoint isn't really changing their fortunes very much but from a fantasy standpoint he's been ridiculous starting at Center  early second rounder I believe  since moving to the center spot late first rounder over the last week ah the numbers are are silly he's still can't really hit a shot or stop from turning the basketball over but do you even really care when he's putting up like six and a half defensive stats a ballgame now you don't really care  the rest of this bird is you guys know my feelings on them you pretty much sell anytime they have a really good ball game  that's that's where I'm at  I think it's possible that I was too low on keldon Johnson this year because I was too high on him last year and I just didn't believe that there was that gear he could kind of get back up into  and he's number 66 so I gotta tip my cap a little bit but it does I still look at it and think something's gonna give here he's also apparently on the trade block and then every time you know Devin vessel has one good ball game he sort of follows that up with a clunky one so that's the thing like you get two good ball games in a row out of these types of guys you probably go see what you can get for them on the open market  I have one eye on Malachi brain I'm not even two because I don't think anything's gonna come of that but he is playing starters minutes right now and then Zach Collins is probably a drop at this point he's basically not playing now we played like 20 something minutes the first game that Wendy was at Center but on unless Victor's in valt trouble it doesn't look like Collins is gonna get more about 1618 minutes and that's not even remotely close to enough for him to get fantasy value a lot of blowouts in the NBA these days next game was not a blowout Milwaukee beat Houston 128 119 Dillon Brooks got ejected right near the tail end of this ball game didn't really impact the outcome which is good because we got another good game out of tari Eason 11 points six boards to steals this was one of his believe it or not more quiet games lately but he's been wonderful of late like you can't look at the full season for East and you just got to look at what he's done lately and he's been top 50 over the last week  on I'll admit unsustainable rebounding numbers it almost 11 ball game but who cares he's been great 26 at half minutes is enough for him to get it done he's gonna be a decent field goal percent guy you hope that the free throw number isn't quite as bad as it's been over these last three or four ball games that that kind of levels off that comes up as the rebounds go down we know he's a good steals Guy  Tara Eason should be rostered everywhere I feel pretty damn strongly about that  Freddie Van Fleet is also been on the rise of late he is now number 40 in nine cat  he's been a slow and steady thing for Van Fleet remember he was at 50 like two and a half weeks ago we had him on our by board as sort of a buy low but like how we're going to get there well it's the steels  it was always this deals for him because the other stuff was where we needed it to be  steals are at one point one now if those get up to about 1.3 1.4 at any point this year he climbs into the early 30s and he's beating his ADP and right now he's right behind it so it's not like it's been a problem but  anyway there you go as far as the Bucks go Damian Lillard was on our Bi-Lo sheet last week because he was shooting 41% for this season and I was like well that's just not gonna hold so this is your opportunity to go get him he was outside that he was outside the second round he was like somewhere around 25 26 or early third well is up to number 17 took him one week and you're like damn that's not that big of a move that's actually an enormous move  to bounce that far near the top of the board is very difficult and he's basically done it with two  bigger ball games in a row this being one of them 39 points 11 assists better shooting  I mean he probably could still go higher believe it or not because he's still only shooting 40% from the field and still only taking 17 shots a game on the year and he took 19 of this one folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid

i z l y.com today must be 2021 plus not available in all locations I guess no reason that he couldn't get to 18 or 19 shots I don't think he's getting up to you know 2122 or whatever it was in in Portland for stretches but  could he clear 17 yeah  anyway he's like mid-second round now  pretty close to where he was getting drafted  but when you see something as obvious as damn shooting 41% that's a pretty clear by low  getting Malik Beasley questions  I'm not in any kind of panic over this I like it didn't  maybe I missed maybe I'm reading the tea leaves wrong but  he's just sick isn't he  he's out for two ballgames and he's been pretty good most of the Season prior to that so  I don't know why that's coming up in my Mansions no you're not you're not dropping Malik Peasley  Wizards competitive again I know they lost this ball game but who cares they were in it until the very end  so that meant the regulars got regulars minutes  Daniel Gafford played 35 minutes in this game he's an absolute tank when he gets starters minutes Gafford is number 51 in nine cats and a half minutes per ballgame I mean you see it right here if he gets starters minutes he's a top 40 guy or better  I don't expect this to happen every night because again these are still the wizards but  damn  and tyus Jones this one off a triple double he comes through with 22 and 11 with six Steals and four three-pointers  tyus baby he's back he's number 63 in nine cat on the year right now  lots to like about what Ty's Jones is done especially lately he just was hanging around top one ten top one 20 where every damn game was a blowout and his minutes were like 23-24  it's just taking a week of normal minutes to get him inside the top 65  this is why he was on the old man squad board not because I thought he was going to go for 21 22 and 11 with six steals but because just give him starters minutes we've seen him go top 50 before  starting to assert a little bit more control over this team taking some of it away from Jordan Poole taking actually a lot of it away from dennya who you guys might remember at the beginning the year I was like damn maybe I was too low on any idea he and Dennis Schroder were the two guys that were much better to start the season then I expected and I was like sheesh did I really Biff this one  Schroeder I was still a little bit low he's at number 100 right now I added more in the 125 130 range but at least he's not 50 and I thought I had just missed by 80 slots  and then Avia I was like yeah you know I didn't fully trust him to get all of the stuff going that he does a few things okay but he's now at number 128 in nine cat and that's with turnovers still kind of low for Denny  he very quietly has become more of a schedule stream type of guy Kyle kuzma we had him on the cell High board for weeks in a row people kept yelling at me that I was wrong he's now outside the top 100 in nine cats just a matter of time until the percentage is caught up with him we always knew they would he fouled out of this ball game but who cares the issue was that he shot 32% from the field on 22 shots and missed both of his free throws that's the issue  not that kuzma can't score or rebounder pass the issue is that typically and he had two blocks in this game but that's weird doesn't get defensive stats can't shoot turns the ball over it's too many negatives in nine cat  Jordan Poole had one very big ball game over the weekend and then followed that up by shooting terribly and then falling down on a key play he's number one ninety four on the year I mean if this team is really going to let tyus Jones run the offense a bit more that probably helps Jordan Poole to move more off ball shoot shoot shoot shoot  he's so close to droppable he's so close to droppable you'll be mad when he has those one big game Jordan Poole Mega blasts like once every four or five games but in between you're gonna be like well thank goodness I didn't have this  29% high volume game in the mix  and then you guys know my stance on Bilal who believe six points aboard an assist to three pointers he's numbers come in blowouts  I still think he's gonna be good when the Wizards pull the plug on some of their veterans later in the year I just don't think we're there yet  Grace and Allen's back and he's a much better fit alongside two sons superstars in Eric Gordon he's a guy who needs shots to have value and when two stars are in for Phoenix there aren't enough shots left for Gordon so he's not my guy there Grayson Allen is not someone I'm trusting and Rodeo just because there's sort of a lot of things that need to break the right way but he makes a lot of sense as a head-to-head play um even if they if you got to kind of a clunker opponent like the Wizards were here that might be a day you could try Allen because he's gonna be open  got some Steals and blocks  he's not that far away from men all systems kind of guy well Bradley Beal is back out again for I think he said he was opening me back somewhere between two and four weeks we shall see the season from Hell continues for Beal and we move along  Warriors are a very interesting team right now because they're a team in flocks they won this ball game despite Steph Curry missing  a three-pointer  and not just one but all of them Steph had seven points on 12 shots in this game one of the worst ones he's at he has like one of these per season  but the last two three seasons in a row even in his awful game he still somehow managed it one three-pointers this snapped a streak for staff and I didn't realize this until well after the ball game but then I managed to actually scroll through Twitter and and found the answer this snapped a streak for Steph or he had hit a three-pointer and more than 200 and 250 consecutive ball games I think 2608 was the actual number admittedly I don't have that right in front of me right now but they still won which I guess is good news the bad news is that they were up by 20 and they almost blew it but Klay Thompson suddenly shooting well I don't know if this is something that's just gonna stick but his season-long field goal percent is up to 41 and a half now he's right around the edge of the top 140 and 9 cat and I was having a text message conversation with one of our our Clippers  pod host Brandon Marcus was also very good fantasy basketball player and he was asking about which Warrior I trusted more between clay and Wiggins and I said clay  and the reason for that is that with Wiggins who by the way all had a good ballgame here  Wiggins had shown no energy of any kind  all season long this is his third good game the entire year at least with Clay 2025 games in he's got like six or seven pretty good ball games under his belt  and he's been shooting he's been trying to do stuff he's just been very bad at actually doing it  Wiggins wasn't even doing anything he looked like it was between the ears and you have no idea when that's going to go away but anyway for Clay's top 50 over the last two weeks now he's coming on that's good  I want to talk about  I want to talk about Wiggins I want to talk about pods Brandon ski I want to talk about Johnathan kaminga on the Warriors let's do with let's start with Wiggins first so he's coming off the bench now he played 29 minutes in this ballgame and he had 25 points and seven boards which is a very good sign for him but the last two times he's had a good ballgame he followed that up by well let's see I think the official term is a bedwetting in the following one  of the two times he had a big ball game he followed It Up by Smashing his finger in a car door and missing a week and a half  so there's been no consistency at all with Wiggins so far this year and you can very quickly go to the board and find his good ball games I'm not talking about the serviceable once I'm not talking about the good ones he had 31 points against Oklahoma City on November 18th didn't do much else steal a block in three three assists but 53 pointers he did on good percentages came out the next ball game had 12 and 7 and basically nothing else which is like fine you can get through it but no  other good one was in Sacramento he had 29 and 10 that was on November 28th it's in three's good percentages  smash his finger in a car door came back and had nine and three and then 12 points and three nine fourteen I know points is not everything but it's been a lot of it for him like there's been three games all year he's taking 15 shots  which seems nuts  and a lot of games where he hasn't even hit 10  but he took 12 yesterday and he made a lot of them that's a big part of it you know shooting nine for 12 is going to inflate your numbers  is this a game that Steve Kerr says oh look Wiggins is awake now let's let me get him back into the starting lineup or was this just a one-off  and so because we know  that in a good Universe like you go back to the first half last year before we can still dealt with a whole bunch of family things he was rolling top 60  I think he actually even finished the year  where did we can finish last season number 63 he was actually better than that he was top 50 at the beginning of the year  and so like we seen it before that's that whole thing what is he done we've seen it  but if you go back two years to the Warriors the average 17 four and a half two three-pointers steel point seven blocks but his free throw percentage in his field goal percent were so poor that it held him outside the top 100  and that's the fear I have with wiccans is that even if he starts to put some stuff together is there any actual guarantee is there any reasonable guarantee that he can hold consistent fantasy value  the big reason last year why his rank was higher was we shot about 1% better from the field but the big reason is that he kind of stopped going to the free-throw line is it bad foul shooter would only took two a game last year that was the big thing his you know he turned a big negative into small negative by just not taking free throws  is that something we think can just magically be fixed this year  if he's on your waiver wire and he probably is because the move to the bench meant that his fantasy value was far from a sure thing if he's on the waiver wire you probably consider it  specialty Head to Head where you might just have a decent head of decent week of free throw shooting and not hurt you very much Rodeo I don't think he really need to take the plunge on Wiggins frankly I would rather have brain in pajami Road oh who we know is going to get rebounds assists steals hustle stats not ruin you in the percentages  he's a more well-rounded believe it or not fantasy player than Andrew Wiggins  so pajamas I think needs to be used everywhere right now kaminga is more of a punt free throw guy as we're finding out I don't want to say on the Fly he was bad at foul shooting in the past but the more opportunity means more missed foul shots so I don't think you need calming on your Roto team I'm adjusting that from I thought maybe you could sort of stash them and see how it goes I don't think you need to bother with him on Roto  head-to-head if you're punting free throws he's a go if you're not you probably let somebody else deal with kaminga  so that's where I'm at with those three guys that's the Wiggins pajam ski  kaminga Trio for the Blazers they're back to mostly healthy right now Jeremy Grant 30 points in this ballgame yesterday so he's recovered from his concussion that's a nice one he's number 82 on the year which feels like a range he could probably stick  Anfernee Simons he's coasting along now DeAndre eight in Hit or Miss but you know he's playing he's getting the minutes and those guys are the guys are definitely using  and then you've got these more fringy dudes like and people are going to hate hear me say it and sharp who was not a playable fantasy asset before the whole damn team got hurt  there's a reason he's number one 50 on the year in 36 minutes per ball game and it's because he's basically a punt field goal guy  and a little bit of a punt turn over guy when you think about sort of a late round dude who's averaging almost three turnovers of all game well now his opportunity is diminished greatly diminished  only 10 shots yesterday for Sharp with Simons around and Grant around he's gonna find shots a little bit harder to come by  and it's a similar story for Malcolm Brogden who's now coming off the bench and yeah you got 2627 minutes but he's not sort of the main dude anymore Simon's and Grant  and even to some degree scoot Henderson who is going to continue to slowly work himself into that understanding of NBA speed type of thing it's gonna be that up and down  it's a weird Road  sharp by called a cell High a bunch of times I don't know that anybody did it but this is why he has holes in his Fantasy game that are easier to overlook on the head-to-head side  but Rodeo the bad right now is outweighing the good if you're trying to attack all nine categories  Scout I think is probably worth the stash at this point because now we're in mid-December so you know a couple months into the season or like halfway through the typical rookie learning curve that's something  Brogden I'm gonna hold a little bit longer with the caveat that it does kind of feel like he's about to run out of gas entirely and then you could move on in between  days of the week I like to try to quickly just bounce back in here and sort of like

answer whatever it is 10 15 20 questions they they piled up and a lot of you guys through questions in that Friday show I think there's up to like 80 some odd comments that's the best way to get a hold of me right now so if you got something that didn't get answered in the chat room or you're listening on the Pod and thinking man I'd like to hit Dan up about something find this YouTube show comments after the show is posted that's the best way to get a hold of me there  okay let's go back to Saturday see what we got going out more blowouts we already talked about the bucks but the Pistons they've lost 150 games in a row at this point this is a disaster  I mean they are they are truly bad Larry truly horrible basketball team they're down Jalen Duren Marvin Bagley came back he played 22 minutes you could probably start him in a points league but I certainly wouldn't drop him in anywhere anywhere else James Wiseman picked up 26 bench minutes because this game was a blowout so that you know Pistons just ran with whoever you're not picking up either of those guys in any meaningful format uh sorry Thompson is probably the only one that's drawing questions right now he's a whole while he's starting but I don't think you need to hold on to Jaden Ivy I don't think you need to hold on to Killian Hayes I've said that before Cade boy and bogdanovich Jalen Duren those are the three Pistons that is that deserve a roster slot and then maybe you've got a name or two here and there that you drop in on like a back-to-back or a three games in four nights kind of thing but that is the best case scenario for that clunker of a team  Joel embiid just in the last few moments got listed as questionable that just flashed across Twitter I think that when we get that news about six minutes ago  and obviously if he's out it's Paul Reed time but we don't know he's questionable the hell of the Pistons playing tonight that made actually present the answer to this question the Pistons have another stinker opponent not piston sorry the Sixers Sixers are playing the the Bulls all right well he'll probably try to play if he can so wait on that news I don't know that we'll we know the answer either direction obviously if he doesn't play you go Paul Reed and then everybody else gets a bunch more shots Kelly oubre is still the question mark here we haven't really had a Sixers competitive ballgame in seemingly forever so we don't even really know what Kelly oubre's gonna be doing when the Pistons have to play their guys for more than 22 23 minutes so I would hold on a little bit longer if it looks like as the team plays competitive games and newbies getting healthy that his minutes are still stuck at like 20 1222 then we end up moving on but if they do start to inch back up into that you know 24 25 26 range that's where you would hold on and make sure there's a roster spot there so hold for now on Uber  Charlotte you can pretty much throw this one out it was over very early Gordon Hayward also missed this ball game I think he was just sick Bryce mcgowens got the start at small forward whatever  Mark Williams as long as he's out your playing Nick Richards Brandon Miller's a goal while lamelo's out Terry Rozier obviously a go miles Bridges was not allowed into Canada who just found that out a couple hours ago so we will likely see some sort of change at power forward for a ball game I don't know that it's a player that I'm gonna jump at and try to play maybe they just shift Hayward up to power forward but just something to keep in mind Myles Bridges likely out for the Hornets game in Canada  Atlanta at Cleveland so the one of the big pieces of news over the weekend was on Yucca okongwu who's been playing alongside Clint capela even when coming off of the bench  and then got a start not this ball game but the previous one got to start a long side capella I think that was on Friday  in this one cappella sat it out so Kong we got to slide back up and started Center he's an all systems go dude right now  perhaps one Jalen Johnson comes back we see them move back to a more traditional lineup but for the moment and DeAndre Hunter by the way you started dealing with some knee soreness on and off if he's out then you get moral Kung will again  this is basically one of the reasons we said hang on to Hong Kong woo forever because there's always going to be some sort of path for him  no top 120 some odd as the backup is just barely playable in formats more of a streamer in a lot but that infinite upside that's that's the deal here you can still place a Decay as long as Jalen Johnson is out and otherwise that's kind of it for the Hawks for Cleveland they got some bad news a couple days ago I can't remember if that broke before or after we did our Friday podcast I think it was after Evan Mobley surgery he's out for six to eight weeks now instead of just sort of out indefinitely now we have a timeline Darius Garland Shuffle suffered an injury to the face he's out for a few weeks  the Cavs are in a weird spot now whatever ball games they can win over the next couple of weeks is gonna go a long long way for Cleveland because if they fall apart the seams you might see them start to entertain offers for Donovan Mitchell  as it turned out here Jared Allen went gigantic he was another one of our Bi-Lo guys he exploded Max Drewes is in a shooting slump he's actually a Bible right now if you guys want to he's been shooting like 31% over the last week and a half he'll bust out of that funk we know how Shooters go they go cold they go hot  Dean Wade I'm not adding Isaac akoro I'm not adding a big ball games here because Atlanta didn't play any defense Charis Levert is actually the guy you want to be playing while everybody is out for Cleveland he's gonna be much better in points leagues than he is in category leagues I do think there's enough usage though for Levert to where he can kind of  overwhelm the inefficiencies with more counting stuff so make sure Levert is on a roster again I'm passing on Wade and akoro and then streus Donovan Mitchell Jared Allen those guys have been starts all season long  Pacers lost in Minnesota without Tyreese Halliburton so no big surprise is there if Halliburton misses any more time the obvious feeling is TJ McConnell this game was over early so  the minutes were even screw we were the usual you're holding buddy hield I know he had a terrible ball game here I don't care hold him starter Scott smoked  Minnesota's got the best defense in the NBA Isaac Isaiah Jackson had a big ball game because Myles Turner only played 21 minutes in the blowout blah blah blah blah blah the only thing that really matters was Tyrese Halliburton being out seriously that's it  Jade McDaniels went back out for Minnesota he's questionable for the next ball game Anthony Edwards is questionable for the next ball game though he looked fine in this one now is read he's another in the Stream while he's technically hot actually so instead of stream while warm now I was read is in the Stream while hot department so keep him going  I'm not doing anything if Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels both happen to miss the next ball game you could potentially look at Nicole Alexander Walker but I don't think I'm going down that path most likely it just means more leeway for the nas Reed heater and so no real changes for Minnesota we continue shuffling along  Chicago Tori Craig got hurt it was having actually a gigantic ball game in this one and that opened up even more space for Patrick Williams although it sounds like Alex Caruso might be back early this week still that said tomorrow obviously you start Kobe white obviously you start vouch obviously you start with Craig out and Levine still out you can probably start Patrick Will Williams in most formats as well I would assume got 41 minutes here and I I truly this is one where I I have to admit I don't know the answer onto suit movie because it seemed like he needed multiple like he needed Demar and Levine out it seemed like to get enough space to operate but maybe that's not the case  the problem of course is we even when he's playing big minutes there isn't really a guarantee that he's gonna do enough stuff because this isn't that many three-pointers he gets you some assist but not a gigantic amount people see five or six sometimes and they're like oh yeah average is five assists know because most of the other ones he's at two or three  steals are pretty good I like the steals for aisle and that I think is why we probably need one more High you usage guy out so that he can actually consistently get 10 11 12 13 shots instead of more like eight to ten that does make a difference  because you know he's not the world's best field goal percent guy either and I know we got 12 shots and then 11 in the last two ballgames and if that actually stuck that would probably be enough for him to be a top 100 Guyanese  he's extremely roster like I should say available he's extremely available very low Roster number in Yahoo League's and you can kind of understand it  what I'd like to see is if Caruso comes back and plays what does that mean for to soon move and then that also presumes that Caruso makes it through the Ballgame which may or may not happen  so I think we can probably hold off a little bit longer on an IO pickup but keep an eye on it  meanwhile for Miami it sounds like we might finally be getting bam and hero back meaning this this wildly long Mega streamer pile for the heat gets super super risky overnight with two I usage guys coming back probably at the same time  Kyle Lowry is out basically for rest  but I'll tell you this I don't think you're comfortable playing any of the streamers if both hero and Bam are coming back at the same time  Kevin loves been a stream lately I've been late to jump on that one because he's Kevin Love and he's you know  old  and that means it probably too late  I guess junior he was up he was down he's back up again  I don't think I can stream him if Heroes coming back I don't think I can stream Caleb Martin if bam is coming back I don't think I can dream Duncan Robinson if Heroes back  I think it's best to probably just leave all of it alone watch for a game and then make your call on drops and ads after that  that's the safe move  now if you're on the head-to-head side like obviously you're not benching a guy you probably just let it go for one game see what it looks like the heater doing with these guys is it gonna be a total Log Jam that would be my guess by the way then maybe all of them end up drops but does anybody sort of rise above the pack is he going to be Caleb Martin does he rise above the pack does rise above we don't know  you kind of just have to wait and see  cam Thomas is hot again he had 41 points in the Nets lost at Golden State he is the premiere  flip  he's a flip guy  this giant game moved him back up to number one 108 on the year in in nine cat which again I think tells you everything you need to know  because he gets super hot he ran you know top 40 top 50 for like the first week and a half two weeks of the year and then he was like outside the top 200 for a few weeks and then this gigantic ball game is going to launch him back into a top 50 week just flip him  when he's hot go try to get somebody that stops 60 or better when he's cold go try to buy him for someone that's like 90 to 120 range and do it over and over again if you want I mean the legal probably catch on to you pretty quick just do it once if you like but he's a guy that you can get when he's cold and sell when he's hot because the difference in numbers is so astounding that people can't remember what happened in between  he's a he's a short-term memory loss  by low sell High both sides guy  no Dorian Finney Smith in this ball game that meant Roy so Neil had a much safer job Off the Bench although the news this morning is that Finney Smith is opening to play in their next ball game so probably just leave that alone Oklahoma City at Denver game winner for Shea but from just a strict fantasy standpoint there really wasn't a whole lot in this ball game on either side  Chad Holmgren had eight blocks that's awesome but it's not like he wasn't being played in every format everywhere he's number 10 in fantasy right now Shay obviously 100% started Jalen Williams is started everywhere the rest of it is a big fat I don't care  people like Dan what should I do with Josh giddey well if you listen to this damn podcast leading up to the season you never would have had him up nuggets are a whole lot of I don't give a crap Justin holiday has been filling in for Kentavious Caldwell Pope who's been out with a concussion otherwise this is nothing there's just no news at all  I guess the only news is that Nicola yokich is not  at all running away with the number one spot and I don't think he will  not that being top four is anything bad but  anyway whatever  we talked about poor little already but we haven't talked about Dallas yet the bad news out of Dallas is that Derek Lively went out with an ankle sprain early in this ball game that meant that the Mavs had a choice of either running super small which they mostly did Dwight Powell played 22 minutes at Center and then you know the rest of the way they were mixing and matching and just kind of spacing everybody out and shooting three-pointers typical Mavs stip type of basketball  going into each ball game you need to be aware of who's in and who's out for the Mavericks right now  obviously Luca but Tim Hardaway Jr is playable mostly because Kyrie Irving is out so Kyrie's shots almost immediately go straight to Hideaway  I don't like Tim hardaway's Fantasy game as a whole but if he's getting you know 17 shots he had 21 in this ball game that's enough for him to get enough three-pointers to counterweight the bad field goal percent the typical lack of rebounding assistance and things like that so Hardaway Juniors a stream right now  Dante Exum is sort of a stream people like Dan he's been so hot yeah that's the thing  I just can't in my mind  assume that Dante Exum is gonna keep shooting like 80% from the field last two weeks he's at 61%  and that's basically why he's a top 50 guy over that stretch because a lot of those are actually three pointers  so does he fall into the stream while hot category the answer there is probably yes certainly on head to head it can you know there's no harm in playing a guy who's super hot I mean he's shooting 701% for the last week this is obviously an unsustainable number  but I mean if you just keeps doing it for one or two more like just because he did it for three games doesn't mean it's going to balance out the next three games he might be super hot for seven or eight games and then balance out we don't know how the ebb and flow of a Dante's and heater is gonna go so go ahead and stream him if you want if you're doing it on the road or side just be aware that at some point the shine is coming off of this thing it gonna be the next ball game I don't know  I can't possibly know  you can stream them while he's hot that's fine  and then Derek Jones Junior who I would argue probably has the slightly easier to translate fantasy stat set  is also a little bit of a do you stream him while he's hot kind of thing um he's  you know it gets you Steals and blocks typically the field goal percentage is pretty decent he's more of a three-point threat  all of these guys these these mostly eczema and Eric Jones Junior in particular  it fluctuates so hard on a game to game basis that it is really hard to know if you're going to pick the right day on a roadside  I guess I should call it a game's capsize  so I'm not playing either of them in games cap I have no problem with you guys want to play on both frankly in head-to-head where they're again you're not just you're not gonna hurt yourself and Dallas is a pretty good week they go four times the first six days this week all the  that's loaded towards the back end they go Monday Wednesday Friday Saturday so if you want to go Wednesday Friday Saturday or just the Friday Saturday back to back maybe that's the better way to use these guys maybe they've cooled off by then Tim Hardaway Jr I think you can go  in basically anywhere though as long as Kyrie's out  Utah lost in Sacramento it was a blowout but there were a few things we could take away for one Walker Kessler was back on the bench for this game and he did nothing so you talking to you stay yank him around Kelly Olynyk got the start and I think some of this was just like what do you want to do with Sacramento I'm a little surprised they didn't throw Kessler at dimona sabonis who then went 9 for 10 shooting in the ballgame  anyway as long as starting you can probably use him in pretty much all formats Collin Sexton same story that's because Count Day George and Jordan Clarkson or out the Olympic one is feels like will hardy just like taking a handful of darts at this point Walker Kessler remains a by low every time he has two or three gigantic games you taught us something to slow him down and that creates another buy opportunity so feel free Larry marking it is back okay her to report that he's on the trade block and Utah's asking for for first rounders good luck with that uh but the streamers here are Olynyk and Sexton  and that would be that again they better be starting or I'm not doing it  line of the nine of course on Saturday belong to Keegan Murray who we've been calling a Bi-Lo for how long the whole goddamn season to this point  field goal present up to 44 after this gigantic game is nine cat rank is up to number 57 and someone hit me on Twitter they're like Dan are we celebrating a bit early here yeah I mean I guess but  he was toiling in that 100 range and I was like yeah this guy like he's shooting 309% right now this is a simple Buy Low you just have no idea how well by low is going to fix itself is it going to be like one  Monumental game that jumps a player 30 slots I like Keegan Murray here or is it gonna be more like Freddy van Fleet who's been just sort of very quietly a little bit better than when we called him a Bilo and he's moved up 10 slots over like two weeks  there's different ways to get to that endpoint  Murray just happened to break a whole bunch of NBA 3 point a records on his way to doing it in one night  so yeah is this going to be another game you see no of course not but his season average now is at 15 and a half two and a half three six boards to assist 1.3 Steals and a 4485 split that's repeatable I don't know how he gets there on the night tonight but that's repeatable  and he's not a Buy Low anymore because he cashed it in one damn ball game  one eye popper  there was no Darren fox in this one if you're wondering why Keegan Murray got 23 shots and why Harrison Barnes got 11 shots  anyway Nick Scott blown out by the Clippers who are suddenly cooking  Clippers are cooking right now Kawhi Leonard has been possessed of late he's all the way up to number seven in nine cat right behind Luka doncic passed Donovan Mitchell and Kevin Durant over the weekend he's top four over the last three weeks basically over the last month kauai's been a top four per game guy  one of right now the best picks in all of fantasy basketball  because not because of his per game but because he's playing  why is number six by totals  in fantasy right now  it's wild I know he's number one by totals over the last three weeks some of that because his teams had a heavy workload but 10 games over that stretch number one player by totals last three weeks is Kawhi Leonard there wasn't much else to take away from this ballgame Paul George came back so Norman Powell's no longer on the radar Isaiah hartenstein continues to just sort of quietly plug along as a decent replacement Center for Mitchell Robinson we've mentioned he's not going to get many assists because of how New York runs their offense but if he can get you some rebounds of defensive stats and good field goal percent that's good enough  that's good enough  Josh I got ejected early doesn't matter I'm fully now settled on schedule play for heart he says knowing that probably in the next two weeks I'm gonna be like now wait a minute what about Josh Hart and we're gonna go through this same stupid song and dance all over again because I have a problem and I can't admit that I have the problem  let's play a little who played on Friday and then didn't play over the weekend game I know the Lakers were one of those teams was there anybody else  Toronto what's the Lakers and Raptors  and Grizzlies Lakers Grizzlies  Lakers have a number of players that are possibly in possibly out LeBron is questionable Anthony Davis's questionable I think camera is just likely back  who the hell knows anyway like you gotta wait and find out if LeBron sits you get all those fringy wings that get enough shots to be useful if Anthony Davis sits there wasn't sort of an obvious one-to-one replacement there  more shots for the wings again with no ad but the game could get ugly pretty quick all so  so you probably just kind of have to wait on that one Toronto a whole lot of nothing that's the nothing at all is changing their fantasy wise night tonight and then with Memphis it's it's time to start planning for what the Grizzlies are gonna be  with John Morant and then Marcus Smart  this would be their 25th game coming up the next one for the Grizzlies game 25 so Jaws back after that he's been practicing I'm sure they're going to work him into game speed but he'll probably get mid-20s and minutes his first game off the suspension  Marcus Smart was I think hopefully to play five on five over the weekend I don't know if we got a final report on whether that happened but he could be back later this week so the Grizzlies about to get a pretty big shake up meaning who the heck cares what they did on Friday because it's all about to change it and that  my fine Feathered Friends is your 30 team weekend review We're not gonna do a preview of Monday night because we talked about all 30 teams so you guys know what I'm looking at and that would just be me repeating myself but I will once again remind everybody if you have some questions put them in the comments tab on YouTube that's the best way to get a hold of me right now later on today I don't know what time because my kid is on winter break he's playing a video game in the Next Room kind of amazing that he didn't come running in at any point during this podcast I
