welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast hey everybody Welcome to a new week fantasy NBA today it's All-Star weeks maybe I should have said welcome to a new weeks of fantasy NBA today  I don't know get done really matter what I said their same show coming up either way I'm Dan Vespers this is a sports ethos presentation Sports ethos.com as the website ethos fantasy BK is the news feed  that is 14 followers away from 11,000 over there on the ethos fantasy BK news feed I am at Dan best Bruce  somewhere in the 21,000 range which continues to Boggle my mind and just makes me want to do more and more and more because the obsession is  very real  I have my voice  but for how long  is the question  my younger son woke up like nine times in the middle of the night yesterday moaning said his throat hurts said his tummy hurt we don't know what the hell's going on  he's three three year olds don't really know how to triangulate their pain  but I have a sneaking suspicion that whatever he's got it'll be mine in two days so get ready for debilitated Dan again on Wednesday but you know what will enjoy the voice while we've got it  please do follow me over on social if you're watching on Twitter and like half of you are when these shows start which you know shot out to the the live feed over there please do remember to throw a follow on things if you're watching listening after the fact whatever or live over on YouTube iTunes Spotify whatever it turns out to be  I beg of you all please take a moment to hit a like button on something anything that floats your way that has anything to do with this podcast share subscribe that's still the single biggest thing you can do to help grow the show is that it hit that subscription button but again whatever you guys can do would be delightful  they also was like I got to talk about before we got things going I don't think there's a whole lot  news of the day we'll get to that we're gonna cover all the teams so you know plenty of there will be plenty of time for those Shenanigans um  yeah I didn't sleep that much either as a result of of my kid being awake at 1000 times in the middle of the night so this is this is going to be fits and starts I think on today's show I also need to as I'm looking at myself on the screen probably deal with some facial hair overgrowth but you know what  there's a time in a place for all that and it's not right now because I got to get a showed out to you guys in the midst of all of this stuff my wife is also on a very early rotation at the hospital a couple weeks every year she trains neurology residents and they started like 7:30 in the morning and said of everybody else that starts at 8:30 or 9 so she's out of here I got double kid duty until if I can get him to school they're not sick so everything's gonna be on kind of a weird schedule that's what I wanted it that's the thing that I was trying to remember I just want to warn all of you I don't know when the shows are going to drop this week and next week it's gonna be weird I'm gonna try to get some weekend shows slipped in those have actually been a really big hit lately some of the biggest listeners ship of any of our shows has been these these weird off one off weekend editions so we'll keep trying to get that going as far as today goes we got a couple things on the docket number one is a weekend review and number two is the preview which is a bigger deal than I think many weeks because it's all star break time All-Star break starts on Friday of this week a couple teams actually do play on Thursday there's like three games I think on on Thursday some of that stuff is makeup related because the Warriors remember had some games canceled due to the tragic death of their assistant coach  so you have a slight imbalance on the card and as a result the Warriors have a very a robust schedule this week they are a six gamer over the All-Star weeks and I believe that they're the only team that has six now there were as plenty of teams there's a number of teams that have five but the Warriors have that that one game Advantage so we'll get into some of that stuff towards the end of the show how you also want to  be judicious with your moves because you got to stretch four moves out over two weeks and Yahoo League's now  so you don't want to go blow them all at the front end blowing them all on hats  but I want to talk about the weekends Games first that's where we start I want to reset our brains for anybody that's been you know in a Super Bowl Haze congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs I don't care about football but Super Bowl is always nice because you know get together with friends and loved ones and all that stuff let's start with the very narrow Sunday card just two games yesterday pre-super Bowl action they sort of got him out of the way Boston beat Miami 110 106 nothing of all nothing at all of note on the Boston side but Miami had some notes and again for those that are watching live you can see all the the injury marks on the screen as we scroll through the basketball Monster Box Score page  first of all Jimmy Butler who's out at least two days that was two games excuse me that was some of the news that broke this morning he's on a leave of absence due to a death in the family so we wish all the best to Jimmy Butler and the the butler Clan but he will be  presumably out to the all-star break Miami's got games Tuesday and Wednesday and then they're off and the only have one game on the back end week of All-Star break so this is a brutal week to have a heat so on the head-to-head side I don't know that there's a whole lot you're gonna do with this Tuesday Wednesday back to back that feels like sort of a wasted move because you're gonna have to abandon ship on any heat streamers in head-to-head because of how awful their schedule is on the other side of the break and also the possibility that some of this injury stuff works itself out on the other side of the break  because it wasn't just Butler Josh Richardson dislocated his shoulder 7 minutes into yesterday's ball game he's out for a few weeks Terry Rozier had some nice stuff and he left halfway through and he'll be out for probably the All-Star break I don't know if maybe back on the other side  Roto on the other hand because you're not beholden to your weekly roster moves you do have a little bit more that you can do  Caleb Martin and 15 and 8 with 33 in yesterday's ballgame he's been starting but there hasn't been a whole lot of stuff for him to do I may have got the start for Jimmy Butler  Junior excuse me he had six points in three boards in 29 minutes so that was sort of disappointing Duncan Robinson played 33 minutes off the bench and had 15 points in three three-pointers hey what Highsmith had two and three  so there  we know Batman bio we know Tyler hero are gonna be starting  here on how to buy or the easy choices presumably Martin and Jacquees will continue to start and then we're just looking for somebody to replace Terry Rozier  will that be Duncan Robinson I don't know we'll know by tomorrow but as we've learned before if Duncan Robinson is in the starting lineup for the heat he's fantasy startable that's kind of his thing basically guaranteed that he's gonna get about 25 to 34 minutes and in that amount of time he'll hit generally generally again small sample size stuff here generally enough 3-pointers to make himself worthwhile and he's been a little bit better in other facets of his game this year he's done a little bit of other stuff besides just posting up at 3 point land and waiting for somebody to hit him with a pass  do I start Caleb Martin on the Roto side  sort of comes and goes with the breeze same story for jacquez who does seem like he's kind of petered out after that vicious run he had earlier in the season  if all three of those guys are starting if that's the way if that's the direction he go Tuesday Wednesday There's a real chance that all three of them end up with fantasy value remember before when Butler and hero were out for a long stretch he had like three guys that stepped into replacement level stuff  hero still in there though as is out of Bio so you know from a usage standpoint Rozier being out he his usage was kind of smedium anyway  Butler obviously had a lot so yeah I mean you're putting stuff back in the bucket but you kind of need to make sure you're getting the guy who's gonna take it  and that when he's starting is usually Duncan Robinson so that's probably the direction I would lean if I was going to do anything on the road outside again had to head because their schedules such dog do you probably just leave it all alone  Thunder smoke the Heat  or The King's excuse me I'm sorry guys I really didn't sleep all that well I'm gonna say the wrong word a few times and then I'll correct myself you guys know where I'm going the Thunder are extraordinarily not interesting from a fantasy I mean they've got three guys that are great fantasy players but nothing ever really changes Lou Dort had his once a month hot game you can ignore it I don't know how many times I have to tell you Josh giddey is not a guy that needs to be rostered but I'll say it again King's are the one you'd pay a little bit more attention to and you know they went to sort of whatever lineup could get him involved it was a Davie on Mitchell focused come back if you can call it that in this one they cut a 20-point lead down to about eight at one point  so Mitchell had a better ball game ignore Malik monk has been hot lately makes a lot more sense in head-to-head than he does in Roto because of those ups and downs for monk he's on a heater right now so yeah you could play him in both but you also don't want to use up a bad game on a games cap where with head-to-head it's like oh okay I guess you know now he's cool back off again I'm gonna hold on to Kevin herder just for one maybe two more ballgames this one was sort of blowout related they used different lineups that got him back into the game so her didn't play as much as he normally would but again you know and I and I tweeted this last night I don't know if you guys all of you not all of you but many of you have listened to this pod long enough to remember when I used to talk about the Marvin Thad line the Marvin Thad line for those uninitiated is a  theorem  that which that states that certain players need 30 minutes to have fantasy value there's certain guys that just sort of need to be out there long enough to have value they can't do it in less than that and Kevin herder probably fits into that the Marvin Phat line he's got to be above the Martin Marvin deadline this is named after Marvin Williams and Thad young this was before that turned himself into  sejic Johnson towards the end of his career as they've been calling him and and now he's just too old to matter but back when in the sort of the middle of their careers it was just they needed to be on the court needed to hang out long enough to have value and heard her needs 30 minutes  this game was weird  I think you can probably dump the box to a certain degree if it happens another time then we probably move on  a lot of games popping on Saturday and I did a show on Sunday morning because of how many games happen on Saturday so I don't want to rehash everything we talked about on that specialty show that that we did yes yesterday but was certainly go through some of it Oklahoma City got blown out by Dallas you could ignore the Thunder side the the Maverick side was interesting because Maxi Cleburne continued to get the started center with no Derek Lively even though Daniel Gafford is in town Gafford had 19 and 9 with the Block in 17 minutes starting to rack up stats much faster than that but that's the beauty of Daniel Gafford he was top 30 player it's a third rounder in Washington in 2627 minutes of ballgame his numbers are gonna Trend up as he learns The Playbook as he learns the defenses all that good stuff I expect Gafford actually at some point this year to maybe even take over and just sort of run that starting job  yeah they've got different sort of mix and match combos that'll be a little bit annoying for him because Lively comes back you sort of the higher flying guy clebus more of the floor spacing type and Dallas will go to different looks but I I believe still that Gafford is the guy they want to wedge into what they're doing  so very much a hold PJ Washington played 24 minutes yes that's more than Gafford in his debut but I am much more further down on PJ that I am on Bradford that's just because of how fantasy numbers are calculated Washington's a low percentage is guy who yeah he can get you some counting stats but usually not an overwhelming large number of them he needed 13 14 shots and Charlotte to post consistent value and I don't see him getting anywhere near that number in Dallas so I think he Trends towards a drop if he might not be what already Detroit  Simona Funke oh Detroit debut and it went well 20 points nine rebounds of Steel and 33 pointers on 19 shots  second I used to John the team behind Jade nivi  he was basically in a deadlock with Cade Cunningham who had more assists okay and I think overall the higher usage rate but still crazy to see Pontiac just step in and do all of that  this is like a No Mercy No Remorse kind of start to his Pistons 10 year  I don't know what happens when I say a steward comes back  I don't know what happens when Quentin Grimes gets healthy because they're probably isn't enough minutes for all of those guys Troy Brown Jr played 19 suppose he could end up getting very little  Mike muscala got ten so as those guys come back maybe you could sort of take those 29 minutes just  completely take him away from those dudes  and then I don't know does James Wiseman continue to play to shake Milton get any more time is Marcus Sasser being phased out I guess you could sort of find minutes for Grimes there  I am genuinely concerned though that one Stewart and Grimes come back they're just gonna be too many males on this Pistons team for any one of those guys to really move above the others in the interim Pontiac looks like an ad 20 points and nine boards and 32 minutes is is pretty awesome  we know it can hit threes we know we can get some steals  not a ton but some this was a very high number of field goal attempts that likely comes down this will probably be one of his better games as a piston frankly but they ran them like 18 straight minutes and it's possible he just starts the next ball game from muscala  so I'm gonna add fontecchio if I have to move on in a week or two I move on in a week or two I don't think that's the end of the world but I'm adding him now as is the case for us our Thompson who all so I think belongs on rosters 10-8 and 5 with a couple of steals we know he can play on the defensive side we know he can rebound he's not gonna ever have the energy he had to start the season you guys remember when he was just going crazy and rebounds and defensive stats  but there gonna eventually just have to shoehorn minutes to Thompson because he's part of their future and he makes them competitive defensively in a way that not all the guys do on this team  so I think he just gets to play but again like we're gonna run into this log James stuff with Grimes and with Stuart and you know maybe he doesn't get to do enough and I said leading up to the trade deadline I thought sorry Thompson would be more of a silly season guy so more of a March he gets to go crazy  but there's perhaps a little bit of a bump here  while two guys that are probably gonna get to play some minutes are out so there's the bump those guys come back it'll probably take a dip and then at some point they're just like all right  Young Buck go do it  I don't have any thoughts on the Clippers Norman Powell got his head blasted open partway through this game but that doesn't really change anything you got zubats who didn't get to do much here the Clippers went small but overall he'll usually play normal minutes and then you got the three Superstars and that's it  Spurs who cares trade shows is a Hole by the way bad game for Trey but he's a hold Jeremy Sohan has been trending down after his hot stretch  don't say I didn't warn you the thing is like guys don't really change their stripes  it was cool to see so Han playing better for a couple of weeks  but  these things have a way of  Disappearing and he's outside the top 25 over the last three weeks again don't know but I don't want more I need to tell you guys if he goes on another heater you sell high if you can get anything at all that's the direction you go Brooklyn's got kind of an interesting spot Dennis Schroder made his debut and he looked great 27 minutes 15 points 12 assists three threes is not a sustainable number the scoring well not 12 assists but the story scoring and a decent chunk of assists is sustainable I think he probably profiles as like between 90 and 130 which is which you kind of call Fringe 12 team if he's in the middle to back half of that and a little more reliably 12 TV if he's in the front half of that  for that reason I think Schooners at least it kind of see all this goes I don't know if I'm using him against the rotor game's cap in Brooklyn's next ball game but I don't think you're going to really lose out by playing him on the head to head side  keep an eye on Dennis Smith Jr probably not an ad but he never know cam Johnson is out already so nothing large changes for the next one but remember when he comes back he'll slot it at 25 to 31 minutes and where do those come from Jalen Wilson probably do we see Dorian Finney Smith get ramped up or ramp down  does Ben Simmons continue to get additional minutes  there are a lot of questions in Brooklyn that could end up creating you know Another Log Jam  or maybe they just enjoy each other more I don't know  Spencer Dinwiddie was not getting along with the program there it just it wasn't working  and he's gone and so they're probably will be a little bit of a clubhouse bump that's not to say that Spencer's not a good Clubhouse guy that just was something a Miss in Brooklyn these pieces didn't they didn't go exist right  Ben Simmons you guys all probably want to know what I want to do with him and I I still think he's probably gonna be a bigger headache that he's working a good ball game here with five defensive stats but that actually was a very low number earlier this season I don't know that it's just gonna magically get itself turned around  Head to Head he's gonna be taking a lot of games off the low minutes mean that it's going to be hard to sustain great production every ball game until he gets ramped up if you want to pick him up and stash him on the Roto side If you're sort of in a punt points billed or put free throw and put points that would be a weird combo but you know who knows uh not that weird I guess if you're kind of Big Man heavy then Ben Simmons fits the build a little bit better and you know if you're looking for the stats he's better at you could spot play hymn on the Roto side I just I can't imagine that he's gonna be someone you can use reliably and head-to-head  what do I know Charlotte beat Memphis in the relegation battle 2024 John conchar had a really nice ball game and I am seriously considering adding him on the Roto side because he's good at board steals blocks field goal percent usually hits a three-pointer didn't get one here and typically gets a few assists all so  I don't think anybody's about to cut in line though to take him away from you so you can sit on that for as long as you need to and The Grizzlies are such a dumpster fire of a team that it's like why you know what what are we even doing here  Jared Jackson Jr Vince Williams Junior those guys are the easy starts I think salty llama still deserves a roster spot I am and all that's the same thing I like I don't tell me times I can repeat myself if he puts up last year's percentages over this kind of silly season run he will be a solid fantasy value if he puts up this year's percentages which right now is 43 and 660 he won't be it's as simple as that  he needs to be last year's aldama with additional juice basically from playing alongside nobody  but I'm holding him because the dude got 32 and a half minutes and 14 shots and that should again if the percentages are not a complete an epic disaster which they were in this ball game that would be enough  so I'll hold all dhamma  starting JJ and Vince Williams in Roto had to head obviously anybody that you're holding your starting because we're daily legs GG Jackson is intriguing but probably more tips more towards points League because of the likely field goal percent issues and then what did we just say about conchar kind of teetering on the brink of being a roto Start Head to Head a little tougher but again like people Overlook the categories he's better at and so he could actually make sense on that side  Charlotte all right  oh boy oh  what do we do with the Charlotte Hornets well trained man got 27 minutes in his Hornets debut remember this still Noel ball for this team but that's really only the the one lone big piece that they're sitting on still  Nick Richards uh gave up a dozen sentiments to Red Hot dava's Burton's  the weirdness continues all right look so Miles Bridges Brandon Miller these guys are obvious starts Nick Richards is gonna be kind of like a fringy you know third Center kind of play Cody Martin I don't trust as far as I can throw him his Fantasy game is bad bad percentages  and you gotta be way too good in the other stuff to counterbalance that and it's a little bit of what I'm afraid of with both  Mr and man  is can the percentages be can they can they be decent enough as it's the same Santi aldama discussion we had can they be good enough to support it add if the other stuff is only okay  I would be probably more willing to take a flyer on man just because he's starting but then like if if lamelo comes back is he the guy that goes to the bench I don't maybe is Cody Martin uh it's probably man  there's a lot that still hanging in the balance head-to-head I think you add man Rodeo I'm not I'm not adding in any format yet watch list and Grant Williams you can watch list you got 32 minutes in it some three-pointers and got some rebounds his Fantasy game is a little bit light outside of Threes so I don't think you need to go down that path and then Richards is sort of a borderline hold and that's where I'm at with the Hornets right now but I'll admit that could change  today there they're early game their hosting the Pacers that's like the first tip on the card tonight and we might have a whole bunch more information on them by half-time on  we get to

a trade deadline deal in three seasons  and they're just  they're languishing man  I would absolutely hate to be a bulls fan I feel very bad and maybe I shouldn't pity but  they're just so married to relative mediocrity it's it's so frustrating because they could have blown this thing up they could have gotten a truck full of stuff for Alex Caruso a truck full  I don't know could you get as much for tomorrow because the contract is bigger and voucher has a few years left they could have gotten the world for Alex Caruso and they didn't do it because they're just bent on making the play in tournament so stupid Andre Drummond had four fouls in this ball game early and so whatever we were trying to learn about whether or not they were willing to go to a big boy lineup we didn't really learn in this game that meant more Iota sumu he got 39 minutes this game went to overtime by the way so if you're wondering about the the vooch playing 43 and Kobe White playing 45 to Rosen 44 it's not because their coach is completely insane it's because there were five extra minutes so yes the fantasy lines were bigger than usual but this was more the the Bulls from you know three games back or two games back even which was just start the starters they played extra Drummond in one of those games in there and if you picked up and doctors that one which I did in one or two spots I think you wait and find out how he looks in a game where he's not in foul trouble  and hold on the io too not that needed to be set I don't think Jonathan Isaac 25 minutes for Jonathan Isaac and yesterday's ball game and that is not a reason to pick him up and head to head because his minutes are going to be very low in back-to-backs he's going to get intermittent days off one would assume yes they're trying to get him into back-to-backs now he played I believe in their most recent one but he only had eight minutes in the second half of that back-to-back that was January 29th in February he's played 2021 10 19 and then 25 minutes and I believe this 25 minute game was the highest minute total for Isaac this year yes confirmed it's higher than any minute totally played last year he didn't play the two seasons before that so this 25 minute game for Johnathan Isaac was the highest minute total he's had since December 30th 2019  which I really probably should tweet that that's a ridiculous stat most minutes he's played since December 30th 2019 in a regular season game yeah in any kind of game  wow I didn't think I was gonna have to go back that far but lo and behold and not surprisingly when Jonathan Isaac gets 20 plus minutes he's a Fantasy Juggernaut guys remember what he was doing that year before he blew out half of his body which is sort of the Jonathan Isaac special in 2019-2020 covid year no I know what you're thinking he did not miss that season because of covid or any sort of vaccine stuff he missed it because he exploded his leg exploded again which is just always the case but prior to that he was number 17  in nine cat leaks 29 minutes A Game 12 points 7 boards 1.6 steals 2.3 blocks a 3-pointer 4778 where the where the splits if you put that same line up right now he wouldn't be quite as high because because fantasy numbers have just gone insane in the last four or really two years frankly but those lines 12 and 7 with almost four defensive stats that's still a top 25 guy now  is there any chance at all Jonathan Isaac averages 29 minutes the rest of this year or frankly at any point the rest of his career I doubt it  but  he makes that team  whatever you think about him as a human being or like brittle this of body  he will make any team he's playing for better when he's on the court because he's one of the most gifted defensive players in the NBA and he's a florist spacer on offense  I have zero faith  that he comes out and plays 25 minutes again in the next ball game but they did have two game two games off two days off I can speak  and they'll play again tomorrow so they didn't play Sunday they don't play today  he's only six percent roster largely because in head-to-head leaks he's going to be way bigger headache that he's worth  but I picked him up in three Rodeo leaks three of them because if there's a magical mystical Universe where goat playing a lute is wandering through the forest and he tells you to pick up John that I think you kind of got to do it  because what if we got to play the what if game on on Isaac what if the stars align  sorcery happens  and he actually plays consistently mid-20s and minutes for any length of time  you would absolutely positively need to be on that  because his defensive stats are nearly unmatched in the NBA when he gets normal minutes like Matisse diebel Anthony Davis there is just you can count on you count on one hand the guys who can do that his type of defensive stuff in both steals and blocks  those players are extraordinarily rare Andy Davis I guess you're basically talking about like who could get you one steal and two blocks what did I just say Jonathan Isaac got back in 2019 I don't think that was one in two that was  come on Dan you can figure this out what the hell did you just say was only a few minutes ago it was one in two one point six and 2.3 the number of players in the NBA that can get you over one steal and over two blocks is  you know less than one hands worth add is it 1.2 and 2.4 Wendy's at 1.1 and 3 and pretty sure that's it let's Brook Lopez is at one block or one steal which I don't think he is  right and he's someone steal  where are you brolo what the hell are you at right now Brook Lopez steals 0.6 so oh Daniel Gafford oddly enough one steal 2.1 blocks Daniel Gafford this year gets the nod  but listen like you almost don't have to do anything else  Daniel Gafford is that 11 points and eight boards good field goal percent once deal two blocks he's number 32 this year  and the Davis not surprisingly top four when be top 12 and yeah those guys do a lot of other stuff but like if John and Isaac plays mid-20s and minutes he's probably not doing one stealing two blocks but one and one and a half is actually within Striking Distance  and I want to barf as I'm saying it because we know he's gonna play two weeks and then  drop metaphorically dead again  we know it we know his body  but what if it didn't  the mystery box but this is why you can't do it on head to head you just like you can't get on that roller coaster it'll break you Rodeo you can get on that roller coaster because you put them on your bench you you can wait a week two weeks whatever you want I mean honestly this game coming out of it two days off is probably your best chance to deploy him  over time whatever like  you just throw them out there and you're like come on 21 minutes  anything better than that is gravy  so yeah Jonathan Isaac  throw them on your Roto bench see what happens  call Anthony got 30 minutes that came out of nowhere and I move along because I don't care  Philly beat Washington won 1913 to buy his Harris's questionable for the next ball game dealing with a hip injury Maxi was back from an illness so that's good but he'll just cruising Paul Reed is fine  stardom start both of those guys start Uber a start Maxi start Harris if he plays Kyle Lowry is signing with the Sixers and I mean he'll play a little bit I don't think he's gonna play a ton uh but they don't really have a point guard right now they didn't really need one when they could run their offense through a bead and through Maxi but now I'm beat is down so you might need a point guard a little bit D Anthony Melton they're hoping to get back before the All-Star break which not many opportunities left for that I think Phillies got two games here going into the break yeah today and Wednesday so hopefully we get melting back for one of those his role will be small as his body gets really loosened up I don't think they want to risk him getting hurt that the Philly right now is is looking towards the Finish Line there the five seed two and a half games up on the plate in tournament but two and eight in their last ten so like it's not panic time but it's not that far off for the Sixers they need these guys back but they can't risk destroying them on the way that makes sense I added Anthony as a stash he got dropped in some spots I get it like teams need healthy bodies  he'll have plenty to do when his minutes ramp up I not gonna pick up Kyle Lowry  for the Wizards Marvin Bagley played only 15 minutes it is returned from injury as the starting center and I feel like this is a worst case scenario in this ball game nice thing is he's getting dropped in a bunch of spots which means for those of us who have a little bit of patience we can at least kind of see this thing through a tiny bed his roster ship went down back to 40 it had gotten I think as high as like 46 or 47 at one point and if he's bad again then you'll really see him get dumped but it also is worth pointing out that the Wizards went small in this game kuzma and avda were basically the power forward Center combination in some form or fashion and they it was fine because the wizard or the Sixers didn't have anybody that could punish them inside Paul Reed is not gonna punish you inside  and Philly went small to counter it  as not gonna happen every ball game  let's see who the hell was the Wizards play next  they got Dallas look at that they get to play their old buddy  I don't I don't think Washington can go super small in that game they might try to to see if they can stick with Luke or Kyrie and just switch everything but then you can have kleeba Gafford on the gaffer's gonna be dunking all over his old team if the Wizards go Ultra small and then maybe they do have to go a little bit bigger and then they got the Pelicans that's a gigantic team no way the Wizards could go small in that one so I think we're gonna get some Bagley they've got yokich coming out of the break they've got well okay see so I don't know what they'll do with chat but then they've got Cleveland like the biggest front Court in the NBA so at some point I think they're going to have to say all right Marvin like we just we need your size out there go figure it out I'm gonna hold him a little bit longer  funny I mean the silly thing is I'm arguing for a guy who's Fantasy game I absolutely detest but I do think that if he plays 30 minutes he's a play  Corey kispert finally cooled off if you had picked him up to stream probably just hold a game longer avdija looks like he's a actually a pretty good sized winner from the Daniel Gafford trade because he is now basically the backup center on that team  and tyus Jones not getting traded  oh righty that's good stuff  well we had all braced ourselves for tyus Jones to turn into a full blown pumpkins and instead he had a giant game and he's now inside the top 6 0  they could still shut him down in the next you know six seven weeks or something like that but not getting traded bought us a lot more good basically  and then cool to believe who I have said 1000 times I don't think he's Fantasy game really translates if he reliably takes like a dozen shots he might be able to get there but I don't see him reliably taking a dozen shots Houston was down a few guys for this one this was kind of a throwaway for them and the Hawks got very lucky to catch the rockets in a game where they didn't have their two most important players Rockets have lost four games in a row they're now the 12 seeds back of the Jazz things trending the wrong way Health certainly a problem no Freddie Van Vliet no Alpine for this ball game I'm in Thompson got a double-double in a filling start for Van Lee you can start him as long as Freddie's out and just hope the percentages don't bust you Jabari Smith Jr is a play with two high usage guys on the pine Dillon Brooks is probably a play his shooting shot him right out of the ball game in this one but if he's gonna take 19 shots he's fantasy startable  same general story for Jalen green you just sort of like plugged your nose close your eyes hold your breath and hope that he doesn't break you but he did have a triple double in a horrible in efficient ball game  and then Jeff Green play got the started Center I mean  how could he's body even a handle that and it was pretty good actually  no I'm not gonna use a Jeff Green rohto game but you know if we find out that Shane gun needs any more time off you could maybe lean that direction and head to head uh are  shadows questionable so this might just be a non-issue  but something to think about keep it on the front of your mind  for the Hawks saddiq Bey after being ice cold the whole year I mentioned it on our shows at the end of last week also he was having one of the worst shooting stretches of his life which either meant one he just was not good anymore or two at some point it was gonna level off and you're seeing some of the leveling now he's been a much better shooter over his last two to three ball games in particular he's pushed himself up to number one 14 in 9 cat and even though I think at some point he Trends towards a drop as this team gets healthy right now they're not still still no capella DeAndre Hunter is still getting back to back off he his minutes are still very much held in check and does not take more he played in this ball game but he missed the previous one so you could still hold saddiq Bey a little bit longer  let's see here what else we got Jalen Johnson is awesome and that's the only thing you need to know about that Indiana you know I have like one very small eyeball on whether or not anybody steps into the Buddy hield role and it just it doesn't look like it Andrew nembhard playing minutes but his Fantasy game requires a lot of usage to get there so nah  nah Tyrese albertans back up to 30 minutes again hopefully we all bought low during that very narrow window where they were like oh indefinite you know minutes cap  fart sound effect nope we do that wasn't gonna last longer needs myth is a hold this is a quieter ball game but generally he's been pretty good for the next we're just kind of waiting to see how the piece is fall  Isaiah hartenstein upgraded to questionable  recently um so if he plays that obviously takes Taj Gibson basically back out of the rotation it will take some minutes away from a chewa who was forced to play some Center here but I don't I mean he'll still get probably high 30s  but it does allow the next a little more freedom they don't necessarily have to go to a chew at Power Forward they could play boy and but zdanowicz there if they needed to Dante even shenzo boy and Bug zdanowicz Josh Hart Alec Burks precious of these guys are all going to be kind of vying for the same two to three buckets right now and the good news is that two to three buckets call it three buckets is probably enough for a Chua  heart and even chenzo to still have fantasy value and maybe booked on itch  probably not Burke so I know he had a big ball game here but only 22 minutes makes me think that's not really a sustainable number but zdanowicz at least got 33 minutes  and that  probably doesn't come down when hartenstein comes back if anything his probably stay relatively consistent  so I'm holding a chewa obviously you're holding Bronson you're holding heart and Stein because he's good you're holding a heart you're holding even shenzo you're probably gonna end up dropping Burke's  bug zdanowicz  I think I have to coin a term here and just call him a temple hold which is I think he's probably gonna be a drop because he needs a lot of shots because of kind of a week fantasy profile and I don't think he's gonna get them but if ever there were a moment he could it's well and Randall are still out so temp hold on boy and bugnon Rich  Cleveland can anybody score on the Cavaliers is actually the big question here I called Max Drew's probably a drop and then he was like stick it in your eye Dan and he put up 14 and 7 assists on 55% shooting with two threes well you know sorry Max he's number one 12 over and he's going like two bad games one good game two good games one bad game kind of thing and it's frankly it's hard to know if he's an everyday guy right now  uh some of it's because the Cavaliers are blowing out everybody they play some of it is because his usage is inconsistent and so it's all a big fat question mark  I think screws probably profiles more as a high-end schedule play head to head he probably you can just keep using him his defense has been very good this year he's not really hurting you a child other than field goal percent so if you're hunting that this makes the decision a lot easier Roto I am trying to hold him still but it's hard to know when to deploy him  I still think Charisma Verde is gonna end up a drop the minutes trending down he's not gonna shoot 75% every ballgame Darius Garland is a by low right now 11 and 8 in this ball game he's been pretty bad frankly since he came back from his jaw injury at some point he's gonna get to do a little bit more the Cavs are on a vicious tear right now and so nobody wants to upset the apple card but as soon as they cool off a little and they will at some point they're not gonna win 95% of their games the rest of the season then you'll probably see Garland start to take a little bit more back from the main bucket Kelly Olynyk 11 6 and 3 for defensive stats and a three-pointer in 22 minutes in his Raptors debut I said on the show over the weekend that I think he has to be a speculative add  I don't exactly know where the other three ish minutes we need him to get are gonna come from because Turtle only played 21 in this one anyway but I just want to wait and find out and I want to wait with him on my team  because even if all he gets is 20 minutes we know Olin and put up some decent fantasy numbers so no matter your format I think you can spec ad Kelly Olynyk play him and head Rodeo keep them on your bench while we see all this thing shakes out Gary Trent he could call him a temple hold all so I don't think he's gonna end up having enough to do but listen this ball game got out of hand he was not part of a unit that was making a little bit of a run and even if he was he wasn't taking any shots so I think Trent probably ends up as a drop RJ Barrett the cooldown is going to come you've been warned and that's kind of it for Toronto  Steph game winner time for a golden state that was pretty sweet that's pretty sweet stuff for Phoenix you're holding Grayson Allen I know it wasn't a big ball game here but he still a huge huge part of what they do Royale only played 11 minutes in his sons debut I think that probably Trends up but if my guess is correct it will be more at the expense of guys like Joshua kogi and Eric Gordon I think they really like what Grayson Allen brings most of the time with that that starting unit so he probably sticks it for the Warriors Gary Payton is back I think this ultimately hurts  everybody a little bit Klay Thompson was the guy who kind of lost out in this ball game  hang on to Clay Jonathan comingo remains his sell high if you can get someone top 60 you do it like this is a very empty ball game for him and the kind of stuff we were more worried about happening  plenty of points  took the most second most shots on the team behind Steph but that other stuff we know is leveling off at some point so let's see let's make it simple hold dream on green hold Andrew Wiggins right now hold pajam ski hold coming so high  gonna skip over anybody hold clay and for Gary Payton just kind of keep an eye on what he does to the other guys more than what he actually does himself  Pelicans beat the Blazers in a game where I looked at the final score and I thought maybe they just ended it after three quarters Trey Murphy had one of his big explosion games herbs is actually good two and you're like Dan you said they couldn't coexist well they did in this one largely because Zion was out so they both got to start and they both got starters minutes that was useful  I don't know what if I would play them  if it happened again even because we've seen games with Zion out where they still weren't particularly good but they were the only two guys reliably making shots outside of your own felonious so they got to sort of do a little bit more if herb Jones got goes on a warm shooting run he'd be an ad in all formats I just we've seen Trey Murphy bounce back and forth from a consistency standpoint a lot  you're kind of just watching to see if these guys get hot  that's what a lot of streamer level guys are stream well warm if they get warm you make the move I think you could wait another game and find out and then for the Blazers Malcolm Brogden is out for a couple of weeks  injury tank whatever you want to call it so that brings Jabari Walker a tiny bit closer but as we've said he needs like everybody out to have consistent fantasy value and apparently this still wasn't enough they needed Jeremy Grant out of the way DeAndre Aiden was sort of the last man standing at Center he had a big ball game Portland is a ticket day by day team right now I'd love to be able to tell you here's your drops and here's your ads but you kind of need to just get the injury report 30 minutes before the ball game and you make your move from there all right let's play the game we play every week and find out who didn't play Saturday or Sunday that Dan is forgetting to talk about Utah Minnesota Milwaukee and the Lakers four teams well that's annoying and not all of them even played on Friday Lakers played on Friday you're not venturing beyond the main guys I know really high tomorrow at 21 points in that one but a lot that's because the Pelicans didn't bother to defend anyone so still d low still LeBron still add still Reeves  I'm not super worried about Spencer Dinwiddie ruining any of those four guys frankly maybe he does but  I got it I gotta sort of see it to believe it before I do anything there and I'm not picking up Dinwiddie even though I do think he has a decent role  especially while the Lakers are down Vincent and reddish who I guess is getting closer now as those guys come back then everybody rolls everybody's roles get a little bit lighter so maybe didn't witty has a narrow kind of streamer window here but I'm not picking him up  Milwaukee they got most of their guys back no Middleton still for this one he'll miss probably a couple more ball games Malik Beasley is the better stream there when Middleton is out A J Crowder is playing plenty of minutes but you know his Fantasy game kind of comes and goes a little bit and then for Minnesota there's really nothing on a game to game basis unless Jade McDaniel sits out and then Nas read and slow-mo get a little bit more stuff  let's quickly talk about the week ahead um there isn't really a whole lot that I can necessarily present to you guys to say oh this is like something you badly need to look at for it all to make sense but the best thing that I can show you here is just a quick snippet from our what we call our streaming grid over at sports ethos HQ that kind of lines up what all the teams schedules look like together so let me throw that on the screen real fast and there you can kind of see there's The Big Empty Chunk in the middle nobody plays between the 16th and the 21st it's one day shorter this year again because you've got the the couple of makeup games happening and and so a couple came teams do go on that last Thursday I think that's actually the same as usual but again what you're looking at here is how can I justify a roster move so for one thing you've got the Warriors the Grizzlies the Bucks the Wolves we just talked about and the Jazz oh that was another team that didn't go over the weekend Utah sorry I skipped talking about the Jazz because they haven't played in frickin forever  Walker Kessler John Collins they got a huge lift with Kelly Olynyk getting traded keep an eye on kante George keep an eye on Kris Dunn and that's sort of as far as I need to go with Utah I think but so these are teams that play three games the first half of this All-Star two weaker  and then you got some teams that played three games the second half and I think if you really want to break this thing down the way to look at it is number one if you can get on a warrior streaming level Warrior you do it most of those guys are rostered right now and you're not gonna go beyond the guys we just talked about like you're not gonna go pick up a Moses moody or something like that because who the hell knows if he's gonna get six minutes on a night so you probably don't have anybody you can pick up on the Warriors they're probably rostered if there is someone you get them because they've got six games over these two weeks and then you could just hold them the whole two weeks it's beautiful it's the ultimate long stream it's a two week-long stream because you might get two more games three more games in some of these other teams without having to do anything else the goal in Long streaming  is to gain anywhere from one to two games with a roster move over the length of the stream and the Warriors give you that opportunity  there aren't that many other teams that give you that opportunity but if you looked at let's say no one on the Warriors floats your boat you could go Grizzlies bucks wolves or Jazz the first half of this week or this period you say two moves on those guys and then over the break you can pivot to one of the other teams now that has three games on the second half  that's actually a much deeper list Charlotte has three games the second half Cleveland Denver Golden State still as we mentioned Houston the Clippers the Lakers the Pelicans the Thunder the magic I'm at 10 already the Sixers the Suns the Spurs the Wizards 14 of the 30 teams have three games on the back half of this All-Star break so you basically want to make sure that you're streaming spots are for one of those 14 teams which means you're going to have a lot of choices of what you could do there but I think maybe the big focal point is if you have anyone on your team that's kind of stream level look to make sure they don't have you know like a two or a one that you could get off of Oklahoma City if you have anybody that stream level which I guess would be like a lewd door get off of them they only got one game the first half of this period they are the only team that only has one game the first half of this period Miami and Memphis are the two teams that have won game the second half of this period do not get on those clubs you can use one roster move to get possibly two maybe even three game bump and that's how you got to use your moves be judicious do not use them all up early make sure you have some of the second half of the week to get onto some of those three gamers and that should take you through to the end  and that'll be that 55 minutes of content what do you think about them apples on I was hoping to do it in 45 not so good um  had someone in the chat room being like Dan your mic is off and then he realized it was it was his YouTube page thank you guys as always for listening I really do appreciate that take some time here on your way out those of you that joined us part way find me over on social media at Dan Vespers d a n b e s b r i s Sports ethos.com is the website but he those fantasy BK is the place you can hang out if you want your your sweet news oh we did get one piece of news from the Pelicans Dyson Daniels tore his meniscus so he's gonna be out for the foreseeable future that probably helps Jose Alvarado more than anything but maybe not enough to get him over the hump also Jordan Goodwin signed a 10-day deal with the Grizzlies he is not with them today but he does potentially it sounds like he'll join the team tomorrow and Jordan Goodwin has great Fantasy game great Fantasy game so if we find out that he's gonna get a decent sized role with the Griz he could be a really interesting stream  I don't think we need to do anything with him until we see what he's going to be doing tomorrow during their ballgame right they got a game tomorrow Grizzlies or the Grizzlies today Wednesday Thursday Wednesday Thursday so that Wednesday game at Houston if you see Jordan Goodwin lighting it up and this is Rodeo by the way because remember Memphis is a One Gamer next week second half of All Star segment then maybe you pick him up for on the Roto side for that Milwaukee game  specially because Memphis is gonna probably rest their last two veterans on a back-to-back but Jordan Goodwin keep an eye on it that's a a keep an eye on spot  okay we're officially done anything else you need to know we'll do over on social again thanks so much for listening everybody check out our buddies over at manscaped.com join our Discord the link is in the show
