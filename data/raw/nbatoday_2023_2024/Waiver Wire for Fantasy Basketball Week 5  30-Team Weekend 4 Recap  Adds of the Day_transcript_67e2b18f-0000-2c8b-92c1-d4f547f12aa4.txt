welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  well yeah schedules a little bit cockeyed sorry everybody sorry everybody I probably should have given a little bit more warning but honestly I didn't know how today was gonna go because  it's Thanksgiving week  Happy Thanksgiving week everyone to all of you that are  trying to figure out how to work your way through this week with multiple children now stuck at home for a few days  I share whatever feeling I should share pity  it's probably pity  a Pity that this is fantasy NBA today a sports presentation I'm your host Dan best burst thanks you thank you for joining us at the slightly later time on Monday morning I know most of the time when the kids are in school we get these things going by about 9 a.m. Pacific time but they are off my older kid had his seven year check up at the doctor they all got their flu shots and everything all we were down there so we got to get the nanny over and then we got to get the kids off to a park and blah blah anyway shows now so  here we go  you can find me over on social at Dan bestbus I would kindly request that you do that because that's where we do a lot of our work in between the podcasts again that's at d a n b e s b r i s or just Google search  Dan from hoop ball or Dan from Sports ethos  Twitter X whatever and it should pop up shouldn't be all that tough to do so  we're gonna be checking the waiver wire today for everybody that popped up over the weekend we're gonna go over all 30 teams most recent ball games and it reverse chronological lightning round fashion just the way we always do on our Monday shows we'll do a quick preview of the eight games coming up tonight Monday evening that should be relatively straightforward and easy  so without further Ado now that I assume you've gone and you've found me over on so she'll and you've hit like or subscribe or whatever it is that you need to do on YouTube or Spotify or apple podcasts or what I Tunes or whatever you're using to listen to this show now we can talk a little bit of fantasy sports the way this works is we'll go through every game that happened over the weekend in Reverse chronological order  by day not by the actual hour of the game so we're not going to start Sunday night we'll just do Sunday then Saturday and then if anybody didn't play over the weekend will cover their last game on Friday and that'll reset us for the week ahead we are not going to go in order of priority in terms of like a player that you need to add so sit back pay attention I'll try to highlight those key players when we get to them but we're gonna go through every team  Sunday Philly beat Brooklyn 121 to 99 this ball game was over relatively early although Tyreese Max is still managed to get 36 minutes in it the Anthony Melton is rolling now after his awful start to the year but again this is what we were talking about he wasn't gonna shoot 28% for the entire season now he's Trucking Nick button came back for this one after missing three ballgames and you know he was part of a lineup That trounced Brooklyn but he didn't do very much that's the certainly the much larger downside  the fact that Kelly oubre is not expected to miss a whole ton of time meant that bottom became less of a priority before certainly having a game where he does almost nothing makes him less of a priority here as well I do still think that platoon can hold nightcat Rodeo style value while Kelly oubre is out but you don't have to play him until we actually see it happen one more time just so we know he's kind of got his legs back underneath them again so he's more of a watch list Play Just For the Moment after I thought he was going to be better than that and then mystery games for personal reasons and blah blah blah  over on the Brooklyn side the one thing we were keeping an eye on because everything else is pretty straightforward not Lonnie Walker I know he popped off and scored 26 points in 32 minutes but he's not a guy that's gonna see this type of playing time so you can pretty much ignore that  Spencer Dinwiddie was the guy that I wanted to pay attention to to see if his role could get elevated far enough  with Ben Simmons out for an indefinite period of time  my guess is that the answer is gonna be no Dinwiddie has never really been a study asset because the Steals and blocks are low the percentage is 10 to be someone low with him  not that free throws usually bad the way it has been so far this year but it's usually sort of a neutral and the field goal percentage low and so basically looking can he do enough in the points at assist Department to make up for the fact that he's not going to help you very much in the others and the answer with Simmons out has been almost  he's like a 130 141.50 kind of value over the last weekend one really big game in there that's kind of yanking the number up the board most of the time it's been kind of meh and I'm inclined to assign him a grade of math in terms of whether or not I think you need to actually play hymn on your fantasy team  Pistons are annoying there was a moment earlier this year where I thought maybe they could be kind of interesting from a fantasy standpoint you know we we saw Cade tons of turnovers at the beginning of the year but at least he was putting up pretty big popcorn numbers  and  Alec Burks is putting up some numbers before he got hurt and Jalen Duren was putting up first round value and then his ankle got sore and Marcus Sasser had a few good games when everybody was hurt but the Pistons have sort of gone back to being the Pistons they started Kevin Knox in these last couple of ball games that's been  far and  Isaiah Stewart should have been decent enough to get value with Jalen Duren out but even he hasn't been able to do it during the way is a game time decision for tonight Pistons I think of a game week so they may just hold him out to give him a little extra rest they're basically still whether they want to be or not in tank mode  Kade has  not really moved up the board the way that folks would have hoped  does that change the fact that he's abide load know I mean he's a Buy Low Cadence by low but I don't think he was ever gonna get to where he was drafted I was low on him because you know I don't like to go into a draft with a punt field goal attitude he's become a punt field goal and massive pun turnover guys so far this year and the defensive stats haven't been there so far which I do still think the defensive Stats come around a little bit for Cade but he needs help and like sure the return of boy on bug zdanowicz at some point in the next couple of weeks will help  but will it open enough  us our Thompson is really cool he's been fun to watch so far this year but I also think he's gonna start to run out of gas and we may have begun to see that a little bit percentages were not going to be as a thing for him and so he was able to float his value with rebounds and crazy defensive stats and some of that like you just can't keep that up all year when you're rookie and you're trying to get your legs under you and your fighting with these gigantic dudes for the first time so he was always gonna come down a little bit  and we need during back because at least at that point you could have durian who's and and tomson or a little bit I guess safer in terms of fantasy value and then you've got Cade depending on the building of your team but that's kind of all it is right now for Detroit everything else is there  Gary try not a decent ball game despite OG nanobii being back some of that is because this ball game got out of hand quickly I'm still not buying on Trent  he needs to be a three-pointers and steals Guy and I just don't see that there's enough room for him to get their Scotty Barnes 177 and 9 to no one's surprise his defensive stats have started to come back to earth a little bit as well he's now at three combined I say only three combined I know still nuts but that continued slowly erosion in those gonna be something we don't really notice until it's sort of done happening  he still gonna have a really good year I don't want this to sound like we're gonna knock Scotty Barnes but like he was never gonna be a number six guy in fantasy because he was averaging for four and a half defensive stats game and that just wasn't gonna stick he's not a giant blocks dude that wasn't going to just magically switch  and that actually moves fantasy value pretty quickly because a block us steel every ball game that's that's actually quite a lot of them when you think of it over the course of an entire year so Barnes if you can still get somebody in the top 20 I think I would try to do it to me he probably tips outside of that at some point still seems like he's gonna be a win this year but not maybe a mid first round win the way it looked after the first two and a half three weeks  hey the good news train finally arrived on Yakima portal he said two or three good ball games in a row he's now inside the top 80 and 9 cat the free throw percent has cleared 50 thank heavens  the defensive stats are starting to come around and I don't think we need to worry about him anymore Dennis Schroder and Spencer didn't witty are doing their best impressions of each other Schroeder still hanging in there inside the top 85 and maybe he can keep that up I don't know that nothing really changes for me on him after this Blog game  or Lando smoked Indiana this ball game ended with the title score than the actual ball game was you saw Indy come back a bit during some very late garbage time Jordan noira Isaiah Jackson Ben Shephard these guys were putting up numbers in the fourth quarter but this game was over early and you could see it by just looking at the minutes Paula bunker oh 26 and change was I think the biggest number of anybody on either team on a triple check yeah that is indeed the case so you can pretty much just dump this box score right out the window  move on to the next one do not make adjustments to your Pacers or Magic valuations based on this ball game it was over by Midway through the third quarter  Denver they are human  I guess it makes sense that Denver would would maybe have a little bit of a tougher time against like one of the bigger teams they're gonna play not that anybody really needs to be worried about the Nuggets they'll be fine they're now in third place though behind the Timberwolves and the Thunder  thunder of 15 games in a row nuggets have lost two games in a row is there possibility that the sort of Jamal Murray absence and Championship hangover maybe that's kind of kicking in now as we  like to call it the dog days here we're still in November we're just getting into the holidays so this is still an area where I think you'll see teams can kind of get up a little bit more but we're no longer at that adrenaline of the first week two weeks whatever it is and so you're kind of seeing team settle and someone on Twitter reminded me that last year I called this the great leveling and this is when the Great leveling starts to happen  it's when guys that got off to a super hot start tend to cool off guys that got off to a cold start tend to warm back up and you just see everything in the league  uh sort of squirm its way back towards the mean some or near it some sort of mean reversion and you'll see that with teams in addition to players  so the great leveling is now basically upon us where weak five it usually happens by the end of the sixth week of the Season that you kind of know okay this is what a guy's gonna be and you started to see it with the bylaws the cell highs all that kind of stuff it's it's coming back to where we knew it was gonna be and the window to  acquire or sell off assets that got off to very hot or slow starts is going to now dry up in the next week to two weeks this is really when it happens so you got to make a move now if you're gonna make your move  as far as this ball game goes Michael Porter Jr was kind of the only nugget that survived the mess Nicole chat his one of his rougher games of the year  Cleveland side you got a big one out of nowhere Craig Porter Jr not to be confused with auto or Michael a lot of Porter juniors in the NBA these days he had a big ball game but you can pretty much ignore that no Charis Levert know Donovan Mitchell and the Cavs won anyway  crazy stuff Jared Allen is still I think there's still holding them under 30 minutes although I don't know that that would have mattered a ton in this ball game and he remains kind of a soft by low he's stood in just outside the top 100 right now and some of that's just simply because  you know he hasn't been on the floor and enough to get the extra 2 points and two rebounds or whatever it needs to happen it's slowly moving up the tables and at that point it'll settle kind of back in where he always is  Evan Mobley always good and then even better when anybody's missing Darius Garland had one finally I guess had a better ball game and I guess it took Donovan Mitchell being out to get him there Garland still averaging almost five turnovers a ball game he'll be fine  you could probably never gonna get to the mid-30s where he was drafted on a per game basis and 9 cat obviously is nine cat and ate cat values really different with the five turnovers a game right now uh but  you know he's a point guard who scores and assists and so that's always a pretty rare commodity and if you can get him for like a 75 range guy that would be a price I think maybe you might want to consider throwing out there  and then I don't know do I need to continue to even mention Max druce  this was by all accounts a slightly quieter game for him and he still number 55 and now we're what 13 14 games into the season still somewhat of a small sample size but  consistently plays the top two or three most minutes on the team the rebounding has been there which no one thought was happening that's why he didn't really get drafted in that many spots but as soon as we saw the minutes that's why we jumped on him after that first or second game of the year and I haven't looked back  Sacramento they've been played some good ball these days dear and foxes out of his mind right now he hit three or sorry six three-pointers he's the number eight player in fantasy hitting 3.63 per ball game while still shooting 51% from the field he's at almost two steals per game  is it possible that fox took another step forward it's possible  I don't know that I would call it probable  if only because  he shouldn't 42% from downtown this year  and his career 32%  that's a massive jump  especially when you consider the fact that in addition to everything else he's taking four more shots per game this year then he did last season  and three and change more than any year previously in his NBA career  and he is taking three and a half more threes per game and he's always been a pretty good steals guy but he's been more like a one and a half as a two which I guess is possible like it could just sort of fluctuate up so there's I would say a number of things with Fox that I would expect specially from a fantasy standpoint to start to to tape or attached  but while he's this hot he's probably gonna keep shooting this much  and you're like oh Dan is Phil Gould percent is down from last year yeah but it's three pointers are up from 1.6 to 3.6  that feels like a number that probably won't stick by the way no Kevin heard her for this ball game maybe the other footnote there is Chris Duarte having 13/8 and 4 with a couple of steals and three threes filling in for herder I am not making a move on this for one I think hurt is gonna be back pretty quickly and two we know we know enough about Chris Duarte that typically unless he actually has a pretty large role it's hard for him to put a fantasy stats and somebody was yelling at me on Twitter about Malik monk like how I was leading everybody astray on Malik Monk  he's a  magical deer and fox fill in who has been extraordinarily I'm gonna say inconsistent because he's been consistent in what he does when he's on the floor his minutes have been extraordinarily and consistent when dear and Fox's there  it's like Michael Lee played 18 minutes in this ball game despite having 12 points in four three-pointers in them he was actually putting up numbers  but the minutes are so erratic that it's hard to really lock it in and say oh yeah this is like you got to do it  the screen you're seeing if you're watching on YouTube shows this game is a blowout it didn't really get out of hand until pretty late that's why you saw you know sabonis still played 35 minutes he basically got his normal a lot and then just a couple of guys didn't come back in for like the last three or four that was really the difference here where Lucas still got 32 and of 35 something like that so the blog didn't dramatically change the minute distribution it got out of hand much later in the Ballgame which for then you're like okay well like why didn't Malik monk get a couple extra minutes why not let him play 23 instead of 18  honest to God I have no idea  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of beer Wine and

every ballgame he is more valuable and head-to-head than he isn't Roto because he's been good at threes and assists so far this year but and free throws a little bit of free throws as well but he's been very bad in field goal his turnovers have been kind of high not atrocious the Steel's numbers kind of low the blocks are high but probably not going to stay there and then he doesn't rebound and the scoring actually isn't as high as it kind of feels like it's been he scored more when foxes out so you've got this  and this is when I talk about like a guy that's maybe more valuable and had to head than Rodeo it's often what a guy has two or three strong categories but also two or three very weak ones  and it had to head you're like okay well if I'm not super competitive in the weak ones that I don't have to worry about not in a punt fashion necessarily but just like it doesn't hurt my team as much as with Roto if you're trying to monk out there every ball game right now in a typical 12 team were with an 82 game cap he's been outside the must start window I don't know if that makes any sense but hopefully it did  Derek Lively is a good story on the Dallas side he's starting to and I this is kind of what I thought when we talked about him last week or was like this guy's gonna get a tiny bit more consistent every two weeks or so so you want to see those minutes per game they tick up from 24 and then like a month later he's at 25 and a month later he's a 26 it's gonna be a slow growth curve as he learns more about the NBA and all the stuff that you have to do to be consistently successful  but he's been good enough so far that you have to hold on for the ride  and I wasn't sure about that two weeks ago because it's where all over the map  but now they're starting to get a little more secure  and that's kind of good enough for me so Derek Lively he's a hold  Tim Hardaway Jr the cool down I gotta believe is coming here you only have two three-pointers in this ball game he wasn't like cold but is value is floated by three pointers  kind of all he does  and as those ticked down from four per game which never felt like a number that was sustainable then he falls sort of outside the must play zone and into the stream if you need threes and some scoring Zone but he's not the only guy in that zone so that means you don't really have to sit on him all the time Phoenix in Utah played a little extra basketball and wowsers we got some fantasy lines to kind of lick our lips over here  Kevin Durant Mondo game he's now up to number nine in nine category leagues and he's played all 13 games for his team so far as I knock on every piece of wood within sight  his very slow free throw shooting start to the year is now a distant memory after he goes seven for seven in this ball game  I mean at some point Bradley Beal is gonna show up and that'll probably ding Durant it's definitely gonna ding Booker Eric Gordon had a big ball game but I'm throwing that in the trash I don't I I want nothing to do with Eric Gordon he and Grayson Allen are scheduled plays with Bradley be out but not Rodeo so if the sun's run into and I don't have their their streaming calendar in front of me while I'm doing this particular show but if the sun's running into a very good scheduling spot and a couple of games against the high octane Jazz was probably that but you know three games in four nights kind of thing that's where you pull out the Gordon and the Grayson Allen card but on a day-to-day  it's Durant it's Booker on that team right now and and that's about it it's really weird to see Devin book now Booker's only played in five ball games so obviously there's sort of a sample size thing going on here it's very weird to think that the numbers he's put up so far are not good enough for first round per game value the top of the board is a pinball machine right now it's crazy Booker's at 29 Points 10 assists and five and a half rebounds  on 51% shooting from the field and 94% of the free throw line now don't get me wrong I don't think any of that stuff holds for the entire season uh if bill ever does decide to play  it's the fact that Booker doesn't have any defensive stats so far but I mean the stuff that you have to do to get inside the top 10 right now is just ridiculous  it's ridiculous the numbers these guys are putting up  not the point of today's show I guess so let's keep trucking along Larry Martin  with these giant ball games like Market in 38 and 17 two steals two blocks on very good field goal percent he's number 11 right now no drop off for him and a lot of that's been because keyonte George is changed the Jazz  he's fixed him  not that he's been outstanding himself but he's fixed him guys are in there right roles  catchy George at 11 assists in this ball game he could not shoot to save his poor little life to for 12 from the field five turnovers he's another guy that probably ends up profiling is better in head-to-head than Roto because again you know rookie ball handler  even if I think some of the ball handling stuff that doesn't usually apply to Rookies or does usually apply may not to George in that was weird phrasing I know  I don't think he's gonna be beset by the same issues that normal rookie ball handlers do because he's not  he's not trying to run the team he's just orchestrating and distributing but you're still seeing a lot of it anyway like even though the assists are very high for George you are seeing the bad feel goal percent you're seeing the high turnovers you're seeing the fact that even though over the last week he's playing 30 minutes in averaging 12 points and eight assists with a steal he's ranked out the top one 50 because he's shooting 34% from the field and he has three and a half turnovers for ball game and he hasn't blocked a shot in that stretch and it's threes are at one and change and he's only scoring 12 points  Roto that's a tough sell Head to Head it's like look I'm crap like maybe I'm hunting field goal anyway or maybe I have a massive games advantage or disadvantage so this week turnovers don't matter to my team so if you're just focusing on the assist the rebounds the steels like the free-throw percent then cool but if you need all nine  that becomes a hard place still I do think he belongs on rosters I think in all formats and rodo you're probably just squatting on him to see how he grows head-to-head you play him out and see what happens  otherwise yes you saw one big game from Taylor Horton Tucker you can throw that away doesn't matter Jordan Clarkson had 227 and 5 but he did it on horrible percentages and so it's kind of the same old story for Clarkson  if you can sell on Clarkson you do it that's a pretty easy decision to make let's keep going  Boston uh five more three-pointers for Sam Houser who  look at some point he's gonna cool off there's no question he's shooting something like 60% from downtown over the last couple weeks  and so he's averaging what three four threes a game on 53% from the field it's just a combo you can't get from someone over an entire year and so because of the Rarity of that combination he is actually a 9 cat play right now but you know it at some point this stuff just levels off I was a good shooter but he's not going to be the best shooter in the universe you know by a factor of like 20% over Steph Curry that's just not gonna last forever so get it while the gettin's good but then understand at some point  it'll it'll flip back the other way we already know by the way and we'll talk about this later on but Derek white Al Horford are out for the Celtic second half of their back-to-back they can come up with whatever reason they want to on that what does it mean  I mean you probably see Howser moving into the starting lineup for white Horford was coming off the bench behind we're seeing us anyway so that's sort of a non-factor the biggest news perhaps of the entire show he screams to make sure that folks haven't started to tune him out over these this low plot we've got through the weekend Santi aldama starting small forward for the Memphis Grizzlies put up 28 points 12 boards six assists two Steals and six three-pointers on 27 shots  whoo  and I know this team isn't healthy John is going to come back what are they like buy halfway to the John Morant suspension being up and Marcus Smart is out for a month so it's at some point he'll be back all so and Luke Kennard is out I think he got hit in the head but I don't remember doesn't really matter for this either way I'll dama was already I think we talked about him on Fridays tweet storm when the hell was memphis's last ball game was that against the Lakers let me make sure I got their their calendar right so Memphis played  no they were in San Antonio the previous night actually but it was after the Laker game that aldama came in and took 15 shots in 25 minutes off the bench and I did my tweetstorm on Friday night and I'm pretty sure I said he's a guy that you need to be paying very close attention to because if Memphis decides to give him any minutes he actually does have a very translatable fantasy stat set we saw before when he picked up a bunch of sentiments to start last year or power forward minutes when JJJ was out well they're giving them a look now in a big way  and it's he's cashing in is he put up 1710 and 3 with the steel block and a three-pointer against San Antonio in a win the previous ball game and frankly they I think just like what he does when he's on the floor he's versatile he could step out into three as you saw with six of them he was bombing away from downtown to me he's a mustad player until someone comes back from Memphis and then we'll see what happens after that but basically they've said look we can go we can run JJ at the center spot which they did more of in this ball game Xavier Tillman being out all so helps aldama because that forces them to go smaller they didn't want to run a ton of Bismarck Beyond but he picked up five thousand fifteen minutes anyway but you don't need 39 minutes out of Alma you need mid to high 20s that's how quick is fantasy stats can rack up mustad player must start player right now while we see what shakes out in Memphis  okay see blue out Portland this game was over early Chad Holmgren had himself a little Perfecto on the night six of six shooting from the field to have two at the free throw line no turnovers he's number 14 I believe in nine cat right now  I still think if you could sell chat for a second rounder you do it because you gotta believe that at some point this sort of rookie fatigue stuff Creeps in  he's also shooting 57% from the field and 91% of the free throw line these things that will probably come down a little bit as well so uh but again like if you're not gonna get a locked in top 20 kind of guy then you don't have to do it I just think there is an opportunity there for Portland I don't really care nothing in this game changes everything for me they got blown out early eight and we'll be fine Skyler mazes your streaming guy shaking sharp people seem to think is having this like incredible start to the year but he's number 180 in nine cat High turnovers lowfield goal percent  really what kind of sagging things for him and then being just slightly sub-average in like three or four other categories the scoring is been good the rebounds have been kind of okay but that's kind of been it like we there's been this goo goo gaga thing going on for shade and sharp and I I like him but he's playing 37 minutes at night he literally cannot do anymore for that team and he's not even close to a road open Play just try to understand that these things do Factor Houston and La I  so I've been very critical of Alpine in the past but he deserves a ton of credit by the way and I probably should have done this a week ago but I really wanted to sit down and watch him play a full game start to finish  especially against  like a legit defensive Star level Center I don't think he Davis comes and goes sometimes he disappears some times he reappears things like that but Hades a damn good basketball player  and he fouled out dealing largely with shengwen and what the Rockets do on offense I'll print this defense has gotten better that was the big fear coming into the season was that if his defense didn't improve Houston was just run somebody else's Center but he's improved his position defense has gotten a lot better he's no longer chasing Steals and blocks everything the Rockets are doing is based on kind of being in the right place at the right time Freddie Van Fleet and Dillon Brooks have gone a long way towards and stilling that type of culture and Shen good his body in and so that's keeping him on the floor offensively there was never really any question about what he could do but his defense just from a mental standpoint has gotten so much better to cover up the fact that athletically on defense he does still struggle to sort of like stop guys that are going at him at a full speed but that doesn't matter right now because he's doing enough positionally that keeps him on the floor and so I feel like a lot of his numbers so far this year are pretty  sustainable because he's doing this stuff on the defensive side  the one thing to note with shengwen is that he hasn't gotten the defensive stats this year and I don't know that they will get better because I I think the Rockets approve of the like okay don't try to block everybody don't be on an island We're not gonna leave you alone under the basket to try to block everybody that comes your way  don't foul stay on the floor we're gonna run off it through you  and so as great as the popcorn numbers have been and they have been 20 points 8 boards six assists that's that's you know demonic sabonis light big man stuff not nearly as many rebounds the defensive stats are probably going to be a little bit stuck in the mud  so you have this kind of sabonis build but demon is a vastly superior rebounder maybe the best in the entire NBA  otherwise their stats are almost a carbon copy for each other so bonus one more assist about point three blocks more per game but their field goal for free throw almost a dead heat same with turnovers  so Shane good is like your did you not get sabonis in the second round kind of guy but because the rebounds are going to be a bit lower and also because it's hot I mean we still haven't seen this go for an entire season I mean again I don't see any reason why it should completely vanish  but I don't know that the defensive stats get all the way back where they were prior years when he was a poor man floating on an island and just on skates chasing everybody  Freddie Fleet what I'm 16 assists which might ruin any by low there although I do still think he goes up a little from where he's at because I think you see a few games some at some point in here he's gonna have a game where he gets like five steals but again there is that kind of positional defense thing the Rockets are doing so it's not going to be wild flailing  Nick nurse steals numbers  but he's playing massive starters minute is and everything else is basically where it was last year and so all we need now is you know another point eight steals per ball game which  two games were he gets for steals in both of them pretty much takes care of that is that reason to go buy low I mean yeah if you want to get like an 8-ball sure that's something  Dillon Brooks had hit for his first big game in about two weeks he had fallen off after a very hot start he's now at number one 100 after this huge one but he's not gonna stay inside the top 100  tari Eason is out for rest on the back to back for Houston he's not getting enough minutes for it to matter right now anyway so I think we can probably move along from that I made the mistake of assuming LeBron James was going to age apparently he does not LeBron James is a cyborg he had 37 6 and 8 with three steals two three-pointers and just absolutely teabagged the Rockets throughout this ball game  he was fired up to play against Dillon Brooks you could see that  but also he and Anthony Davis and Austin Reeve sorry Austin were the only Lakers that could make a shot and you could tell LeBron knew it so when Anthony Davis fouled out that was like okay  it's time  and LeBron all game long just get rescuing his team because Tori and Prince went for 11 he couldn't hit a 3-pointer and Dilo finally had a softer ball game he'd been very good for the Lakers so far this year but this one dropped his shooting percentage down a little bit  really was only kind of okay  but like I said six three-pointers I think they went something like six for 30 from downtown of this game Austin Reeves hit about a 30 footer was a big shot late in the contest too but LeBron's been nuts uh  I I I can't possibly begin to understand how he's doing it he's shooting 59% from the field so far this year a number that is frankly likely to come down he's also a two and a half defensive stats per game on number that is also likely to come down so as much as I've been in very impressed with what LeBron's doing he hasn't really been hurt yet tweaked whatever it was a calf or a shin or something but he came back quickly  uh he's been questionable for a lot of these ball games but he seems fine what's the game starts  his usage is in deed way lower this year and that to me is the number we really got to be paying attention to his usage is down he's only at 17 shots this year after 22 last season eventually that will drag his numbers down because he's not going to shoot 509% from the field all year the Steals and blocks are knocking the likely stay this High when he's not playing Center like he did a couple Seasons back so then the scoring will probably come down attached because I don't think he wants to have to do this much stuff  can you sell high on LeBron probably because he's freaking LeBron what would you aim for  any second rounder I'd be down with  let's get back to Saturday Sunday was kind of the bigger one over the weekend  oh you know what I forgot to put this stuff on the screen sorry YouTubers that sucks for you guys oopsies let's go back to Saturday I this is a  silly silly oversight but whatever for one day the YouTubers you guys got basically the podcast experience  just look at me yelling about numbers whoopsies you guys are probably telling me that you couldn't see it either and I never looked at the chat room because I was too busy just yelling about stuff womp womp womp hey take him over to find me over on social again that's at Dan Vespers d a n b e s b r i s s  and please do like and subscribe it's so fast just hit the Subscribe button it's so easy to do I don't know why you guys even home about it just go take care of that bad boy  play a warning I don't know that we're gonna have time for questions today so  so sorry although this is a good one Cody says finally catching you during a live I'm usually a pod listener I recommend letting your pod listeners know what time you stream live love the show Cody great great point problem is  it's not the same every day when the kids are in school it's usually around 9 a.m. Pacific time but it does bounce a little around a little bit based on other stuff going on in my personal life usually family related like today for instance it took the kids had doctors appointments in the morning and then I had to get the nanny off to the park and so everything was just a little bit more complicated and so the shows like you know hour and a half two hours later  not exactly what I wanted to do anyway let's keep going please like And subscribe that's the point there Donte divincenzo filling in right now for Quentin Grimes he was okay in the first try he was very good in the second trial on Saturday he ain't going to shoot for 12 at 7:30 pointers every ball game if you want to head to head stream him if Grimes is out I think I'm okay with that I don't think I would use a game's cap on him because we really just don't know if he can be consistent  Josh Hart in 29 bench minutes but we still don't really know what his role is  why yes RJ Barrett was back but he only played 26 minutes and again Grimes was out so extra shooting guard small forward minutes we're just there available the more I watch this the more I think Josh Hart if the Knicks ever get fully healthy probably won't play 29 30 minutes of ball game but right now we just haven't seen it  so he remains a hold to me heart does  Emmanuel quickly reminds me an awful lot of Malik monk not necessarily that their stats are the same but that they both sit in that same region where the minutes are not secure  the scoring is gonna be probably pretty good quickly does more at the free throw line monk does more with assists they're both good at like two things but also very bad at two or three others had to head plays they are totally fine Rodeo they are not quite there unless the right player is out  for the next it's either Randall or Brunson you take a usage player out and quickly gets a big bump  for the Kings it's Darren Fox  but when those guys are all in it's a hard time to roll  Charlotte and to No One surprised Myles Bridges has been a strong contributors so far we kind of knew he was going to be a good fantasy asset but I made my call the beginning of the year that I was gonna try to win without him he's on your team that's fine play them he looks good  Gordon Hayward doesn't these days he's falling off a cliff I don't think it's all miles Bridges though because it's not like miles is taking his initial ball like play initiating which is a lot of what Gordon did a lot of it in my eyes is the fact that lamelo balls finally shooting the ball better and his field goal percentage up to 43 now so he's not like completely ruining your team with field goal person he's still very bad there on 20 shots of ball game but this is what's moved lamelo up to 30 in nine cat despite the four turnovers a game and he is much closer he's like an early second round or if you're punching turnovers and and field goal percent so this is why teams took him in late in the first round they were gonna build around his positives and around sort of avoiding his negatives  but the fact that lamelo is now playing better and taking all these extra shots and and sort of confidently running everything means that Gordon Hayward hasn't needed to do that as much  I'm still holding on to Hayward you also gotta bring big game out of Brandon Miller today who I you know one big ball game to meet doesn't mean that he suddenly needs to be started every day he's number 180 in nine cat even after this big ball game so  I mean what was his rank before it outside the top 200  does this mean that he's gonna just magically go on a crazy run you might get hot for a couple of games  I don't think Brandon Miller is more than a schedule play  I feel the same way about PJ Washington actually use more of a schedule type of play all so just because there are some holes in his nine cat game and a lot of them were  very evident in this ball game but it's that's been the way it's been throughout the year  Heyward can have the better Nine category stuff then these other guys we just talked about but if he's gonna fall off a cliff then we'll move on still I think you know we saw it for almost a month I think we got to give them at least a week week and a half to make sure that this is either permanent or not  I have no thoughts in the Timberwolves there a very predictable team and a Mike Conley had a quieter ball game but I don't care and for the Pelicans  I was gonna come on today and celebrate Dice and Daniel's being this incredible stream but we got word this morning that Jose Alvarado is coming back and so that could actually ruin the Dyson Daniels experience  I'm interested to see what the pals do my guess would be that Alvarado gets eased back in over a couple of weeks but every minute he takes from Daniel's as a minute that makes that stream a little bit harder for me to continue to sort of Hammer as one of my favorites I think you could probably still play Dyson at least for the first couple of games after Alvarado returns but we may want to feel this one out a little bit  Jonas Valentino's another Big Blocks game I don't know where these are coming from you probably want to sell while you can you know he's always gonna put up numbers when Zions out and Zion was out herb Jones is still rolling all so probably a sell High Jordan Hawkins I'll say the same thing I said last time his face he was way too tied up and whether or not he's hitting his three-pointers he's more of a head-to-head plate not a Road Old play for me but hey there's a possibility to Alvarado becomes a roto play if he just takes the Dyson Daniels minutes  do I think that's gonna happen I don't is it possible absolutely possible  Miami literally nothing to talk about Kyle Lowry I cannot bring myself to trust in this fill-in role I may not queso was someone that I was like close but not quite for me Duncan Robinson is a hard go so you got your main three at a bio Butler obviously and then Robinson feeling in for hero easy call  Chicago came storming back in this one behind I don't even really know because they want it with 102 points tomorrow Rosen couldn't hit a free throw but he scored 23 Zach LaVine did a better job of Distributing vouch 15 and 8 kind of a quieter ball game and then Alex Caruso has been starting lately and to no one's surprise the Bulls have looked slightly more competent when he's done so Caruso is a much more fun Roto play than head to head but I think he's a go basically in all formats right now while he's starting and playing bigger minutes  we talked about Mavericks already we haven't talked about the Bucks Brooke Lopez who was slightly quieter in this ball game but has a totally zipped his way up the board over the last week he's not number 43 so that Bi-Lo window is shut Bobby Portis uh quieter in this ball game but he's been kind of a double double type of guy since Jae Crowder went down he's a goal Pat connaughton played better he's been to me I wouldn't trust him in a 12 team or schedule play I guess you could try to wedge him in there if it was a good enough schedule more like 14 16 team kind of stuff but he's at least on the map now we talked about this already the Spurs is a team that I just cannot bring myself to care about I know Victor Woodman's insane I like looking at his numbers but the rest of this team is a total crap shoot when it comes to whether they'll be efficient in any way portray Jones is barely getting to play these days he's probably a drop all the way down to a number 170 I think you can drop Trey Jones because I think he'll probably like if you jump on him if Sohan misses time he'd be the he'd zip in their his point guard I still feel like the Spurs are kind of tanking on purpose but maybe I'm wrong  Zach Collins is a go when bananas ago when vassell is healthy he's a go Sohan is not efficient enough for me to play nightly keldon Johnson is someone you're probably playing because so far this year he's been just efficient enough to stay inside the top 100 but also every time he has a big ball game like this you try to sell for anyone inside the top 90  Thunder I guess the only note on the Thunder I didn't mention in their other ball game was that Jalen Williams who did hurt himself with a hip strain is probably now even a bigger by low  because the Steel's haven't come around yet for the Warriors Steph came back sooner than expected they lost this game in overtime because another team forgot to foul up three at I still don't know why teams don't do this but Andrew Wiggins woke up 31 points for Wiggins he didn't grab a single Rebound in the whole damn ball game but at least he scored and he hit his shots  do you play him I don't know maybe but you certainly make sure he's on a roster if this is the Wake Up Call Chris Paul always does more when Draymond Green is out so enjoy these little streamer days we told you that when Steph came back they would not need the scoring of Dario charges as much and that would be more Kevon Looney Etc and ah  Looney 6.16 boards he's probably a stream now with Draymond out as well and then Klay Thompson continues to be  old but he's a hold he's an old hold I don't see how you how you don't  let's quickly look back at Friday any teams there that we missed I feel like everybody played over the weekend this time  next Wizards all right we will talk about the Wizards were they the only team that didn't go over the weekend know the Clippers didn't go over the weekend either  Wizards Clippers Hawks  I think that's it  I  can't talk about the Wizards they're making me so mad  Denny obvious and obvious hold tyus Jones is a hold Daniel gaffer's a hole kuzma's a cell anytime he has a good game Jordan Poole he said it man leading up to the season you knew the bottom could fall out on Jordan Poole  and it has  he'll be better than this at some point I don't even want to buy low on him though I don't know that the upshot is worth it  if you buy low on Jordan Poole do it and then when he gets hot try to sell again it's a flip your house flipping  oh my God the Wizards what a mess  be a lot cooler believed 31 minutes again as I mentioned I don't think that his Fantasy game is all the way there yet he's more of like maybe he could be really good in a year or two kind of thing or maybe later this year if he gets to run the show and have the usage but right now I just this that's why I've been a little bit lower on him  oh was a Hawks game Hawks lost at home to Philly on Friday let's see if we can pull that up for the YouTubers there we go no you're not dropping on Yoko Kong one I know he's up and down a little bit as long as Clint capela is healthy he's gonna be up and down but Donovan You're Gonna Keep Going jail and Johnson yes Trey young yes said he'd pay got hot here for a couple of days he's more of a schedule play and I think that's all you really got to say about the Hawks right and then the Clippers um  they look better in this one James Harden it a game-winning four-point play  he had seven assists with Russell Westbrook coming off the bench hardiness will likely Trend up he probably moves more towards a top 30 valuation with the new lineup Kawhi Leonard looked much better in this one he decided he was going to go do some stuff himself and then Paul George really hasn't missed a beat so it's possible that that was the end of the Buy Low I feel like there's probably gonna be a little bit more by low available  and then Russell Westbrook is probably gonna Trend out of having fantasy value only played 17 minutes in this ball game we'll see how long he's actually cool with that  I know he volunteered to come off the bench but really like  do we think Russ is gonna be chill if he plays 17 minutes every game  I personally don't but  hey I've been wrong before  take a quick look at the games coming up here on Monday night before we wrap up the show again I don't think we're doing questions today because it's running long and the show started late anyway nuggets nothing Pistons Jalen Duren is a game time decision that's good news so maybe we get him back those ankles are a little bit concerning though mentioned earlier in the Pod Derek white Al Horford or out for the Celtics so does that mean that Sam Houser gets an extra shot or two I don't know maybe he's been playable anyway until he cools off for the Hornets Gordon Hayward is the guy you're tracking I still think we got to give him at least five games of bad before buying that it's permanent he's had two bad ones so that means another week basically  for the bucks nothing really I mean I guess we could say Bobby Portis is watchable Pat connaughton sort of watchable but not really  Wizards it's everything  try to watch the Wizards games if you can I know it's it's hideous basketball product but  try  Knicks it's Josh Hart  I guess if Grime sits you could watch Dante even chenzo 2 I just I don't think I have the stones to play him  I don't know how many good dominant I don't know how many good Demon chenzo games in a row I'd have to see before I'm like yeah go ahead use a road okay on him  Timberwolves nothing Clippers same old stuff you know the hardened thing Spurs nothing really King's nothing really Pelicans Jose Alvarado basically what does he do to the Pelicans rotations because I've been so in love with this Dyson Daniels stream and I thought we had at least another week or two before someone might come back and ruin it but it's possible it might be getting ruined over the next few days we shall see  I'm sure some of you enrolled or are gonna be like Dan would you play dice and Daniels here knowing Alvarado's back I think I still would tonight but depending on how many minutes Alvarado gets in this ball game that might change my opinion for game two of him coming back  yeah  hit you with a lumber there  yeah  the heat nothing really we know Duncan Robinson is the Go Alex Caruso on the Bulls is a go  Rockets I don't think there's really anything there I got a lot of Jabari Smith Jr questions but it's not something that I've really changed my stance on which is  he has the possibility  of fantasy value but I always like to draft guys where I feel more confident and what they are already doing and I know that that keeps me from looking like the smartest person in the room because I've never gonna be the guy that is out in front of somebody's big leap  although I guess you could say that I was kind of out like that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna take a guy who's moving into more opportunity  like I'm trying to think of you know Shay last year now that's not an opportunity one trying to think of who on the old man Scott was an opportunity jump this year  I know chat was the young guy that doesn't matter like I'll take a guy who's moving into more opportunity I typically don't take a guy who's opportunities either shrinking or staying the same but I need him to just magically improve his Fantasy game and so that was why I didn't end up I don't have to worry Smith Jr on any of my nine basketball fantasy basketball teams this year none not one but if I did  I probably just have to wait it out  I don't really see another path with that I mean you could drop him but he's really only like  a half a steal or a half a block or one and a half shots per game  or is free throw percent improving to high 70s and set of low sit like he's not that far away from fantasy value I just don't think it happens quickly or even at all  but you'd feel silly if you dropped him and then all of a sudden it was like oh Jabari Smith Jr is taking two more shots per game and it steals and blocks went up from 1.1 combined to two and it's free throw percentage went up to 75 like then you'd be kicking yourself still honestly if you dropped him you probably wouldn't really care for a while  if he does figure things out I don't think it's gonna be super fast  and then we just we literally just talked about the Warriors no dream on green for a couple more ballgames so is it time to play Andrew Wiggins and Roto  probably  no probably need to see it again  what about Klay Thompson yeah probably throwing him in there because at least he's not going to hurt you in both percentages the way that Wiggins could  and then Ludy who I think I'd rather play head to head than Roto but if you badly needed rebounds that's the direction you could roll on that one and that is your everybody's been resituate I'm sorry I know you guys put a lot of them in the chat room and usually I do them but it's already almost lunch time here on the Pacific coast and we're running super duper late today when
