or less I'm Dan Besse thanks as always for joining us on the program please do like rate and subscribe if you're enjoying all this bonus content we've been throwing your way especially for those that are in your head playoffs or fighting to get in to your head to head playoffs follow me over on social media at Dan best Bruce d a n b e s b r i s  all right let's get straight into it it is Saturday's card March the 9th we've almost wrapped up here play off week one for a lot of folks or running into playoff week one for a lot of folks or whatever it happens to be hopefully you're still in good standing  let's go through this the same way we've been the last couple of days first the horrible schedules and this is frankly where you need to be in is to figure out if there's anyone on your team that you probably need to get rid of and the worst schedule is right now are frankly  I'd say not quite as bad as the last couple of days but still pretty bad  the Lakers and the Timberwolves are your terrible schedules starting today  and it actually doesn't get all that better for those clubs even if you extend it Beyond Today Timberwolves for instance they go two games over seven days today and they also go two games over seven days on Monday of next week  so what you can look at here is it's kind of an opportunity to maybe get off of the Timberwolf player Timber Wolf early  so you're not competing with other people and if you have a movie you can use now it's saves you from having to use one first thing next week same story for the lake Lakers this two teams have basically the same schedule it is the same schedule over the next nine days they play Sunday that's tomorrow they play Wednesday and Saturday of next week  Timberwolves have a slightly better schedule to start the following Lake week the Lakers schedule actually is just horrible all the way until March 22nd they play almost not at all one two three four they have four games do the Lakers over the next 30 days yikes so one game the rest of this week two games next week and then one game the first four days the week after that that's about as bad as it gets for Fantasy purposes for reality it's great he's Lakers are going to finally get some rest after they get through this Minnesota game maybe that'll be good for them Minnesota who plays the Lakers on Sunday the difference there is that they have a back-to-back Monday and Tuesday the 18th and 19th not next week but the week after that so there is sort of a light at the end of the tunnel for Minnesota but at least over the next seven days those two teams are terrible so if you have anybody that's even remotely Fringe on those clubs meaning you Mike Conley frankly lately has been kind of fringy  definitely Jaden McDaniels for Minnesota you know nazri probably moved above that Mark but certainly Kyle Anderson is outside of this sort of what's Fringe what's not kind of deal  for the Lakers the line on sadly might extend all the way down to somebody like an Austin Reeves definitely rui Hodge more these guys are not dudes you know kind of 50/50 names in there and if you're in the playoffs to gets a little Cutthroat so you might have to make that tough cut but two games over seven days is just terrible because there's plenty of teams they go four times over that stretch and so he had two games think about it from an Austin Reef standpoint because he's the name I said just now that you probably were looking at in you're like Dan are you serious like you'd really drop Austin Reeves he's 16 points four boards and almost six assists can you get half of that  is kind of what you're asking yourself can I get eight points two boards and three assists  and one three-pointer and half a steal and the answer is probably on the waiver wire  and then if you can get beyond that four games out of somebody else ends up giving you more than two games of Austin Reeves and I feel somewhat similarly on the Mike Conley front who has been slowing of late mind you but you know six assists 10 points 1.1 Steals and 2.23 pointers that's where he's kind of had the edge over in Austin Reeves lower turnovers as well can you find half of that can you find five and a half points and three assists damn right you can find that on the waiver wire  so in my eyes it's pretty easy call it's why historically when we've done sort of weekly lineups lock shows  two Gamers need to be top 50 or better and frankly top 40 or better makes more sense come playoff time but certainly even in the regular season you're not starting at two game or whose top 75 to top 100 that's what both of those guys are  I know that hurts to think about but it's the honest goodness truth those guys are not good enough to Warrant to start and so playoffs two games over seven days that's basically what you're looking at right now a couple of the teams with not great schedules but really you know it's kind of a Atlanta Miami New Orleans Orlando and Utah one two three four five teams so the Hawks the heat the Pelicans the magic and the Jazz have two games over the next six days  but their schedules tend to be a little bit better after that so you're kind of like you're you're grading out whether you can make it with these clubs Pelicans they go back to back after that Six-Day span they have three games in four nights in the middle of next week it's part of a three game week so it's not the end of the world Miami goes Wednesday Friday Sunday of next week so again it's basically what you're looking at here is one game over the next four days and you start next week kind of slowly that's to me where the issue Creeps in if you can afford to start next week a little bit slowly with those players it's not a huge disaster because they all still have three game weeks coming up but it is an opportunity if you have somebody particularly Fringe on them like if you have a fringy Atlanta Hawk or a fringy Miami Heat like a Caleb Martin for instance that's the kind of guy where you can go find somebody who has hopefully more like four games over the next six days and honestly there aren't that many guys that have four games over the next six but there's a couple Clippers being one of them and we're gonna get to the good schedules in a minute Chicago Bulls are another that's where again you can add two games with one weekly roster move those teams again were my Atlanta Miami New Orleans or Lando and Utah  now remember Utah goes into a great schedule at the end of that so if you're hunting on a jazz you should have done it three days ago when they had the worst scheduled on demand now that team with the worst schedule is the Lakers  all right so where do you pivot to the teams with the good schedules coming up right now are the Clippers Who start a five-game in seven Knight stretch including I believe back-to-back matinees so it sounds like they're gonna rest at least one of their Superstars which means their Fringe or guys have a chance to be kind of useful so before we get to the names let's just do a quick scroll through this streaming chart that you guys are looking at starting on three nine that's today the teams that you're looking at here and and you can see look for the ones where they that color change happens on three nine on the board you're looking at and those teams are Boston they have an okay schedule coming up here the Clippers with the other one that I just mentioned a moment ago they have the best schedule coming up there aren't that many by the way Portland is still sitting on a decent schedule San Antonio has a decent schedule and that's kind of it right now  Brooklyn too they've got a back-to-back this weekend but it slows considerably after that  okay  so let's change what we're looking at here on the screen for those that are watching with the video feed as a post to just listening in here are the names of the people that I think make a lot of sense and there aren't that many of them today because again you have more of a select number of teams that have that improved schedule you have more teams that have a bad schedule so you're probably going to be fighting with people for who you're picking up but for the Clippers Norman Powell and Terrence Mann both make a lot of sense I don't think I would extend my clippers stream to  the big men like Mason Plumlee or Daniel theis there's sort of too much hanging in the balance though five games in seven days you could probably make an argument for one of them but it's hard it could really fall flat on its face but Powell and man make a lot of sense right now those are guys that should end up on your roster if you're making a move today and I'm strongly considering it by the way fact that game might be going already that game already happening a game starting like as we speak right now so if you're watching live you might still have a chance to do it if you're not you probably aren't Dennis Smith Jr Dorian Finney Smith Lonnie Walker are the three Brooklyn Nets that are still kicking around on some Waiver Wires and then for this person I think the only guy you're picking up is Malachi Branham these days who's been good and then let me I guess I should have explained a bit more about the Spurs and Celtics there's no one on the Celtics to pick up and stream they have they don't use their bench really ever you're gonna get one out for day and one Kristoff for singing this day on the back-to-back maybe you get a couple of Al Horford's it sound like we're singing his might be question will even for the game before they're back-to-back Monday Tuesday but this is again why the list is so short  so you got the Clippers starting now the Nets who have the back-to-back and then you're going to have to get off of them and then the Spurs who you could pick up and ride through presumably Tuesday they do have a four game week next week but they have two games off after their back-to-back so if you don't really like the spur your playing we'll probably look at what you might be able to do starting on Wednesday of next week  bad news is there aren't that many great options there Dallas has a back-to-back of Wednesday or Wednesday of next week Wednesday Thursday the Pelicans have that three and four but it doesn't have a back-to-back built into it Portland finishes up their great scheduling spell Wednesday Thursday of next week but that's kind of it so you might end up getting stuck with your spur pickup through Friday or even Sunday and just hoping that you can take the four game week that starts quickly with the flexibility to maybe do something on that Wednesday if you really really wanted to or frankly even on a Thursday more teams actually have a better schedule starting on Thursday of next week then there are teams that have a schedule a good schedule starting on Wednesday of next week so just keep that in the back of your mind or you say call like an equivalent number of teams have a decent schedule on Thursday as Wednesday so this is a tough one to look for pickups today that's pretty much the list and again you've probably missed the Clippers side so you might be stuck  if you'd like to you can try to hang on until tomorrow  there aren't that many great schedule starting tomorrow however that move you into next week with a good position  because they're really aren't that many teams that go tomorrow Monday in fact I think there's there's one team that goes Sunday Monday  Cleveland that's it they're the only team that goes Sunday Monday so if you're gonna make a move tomorrow it's probably to a Cavalier because then you could hold him through Wednesday because they go two games the first three days of next week but they're not the only team that goes Sunday and then two games the first three days of next week the Indiana Pacers are Sunday Tuesday Wednesday  the Grizzlies are Sunday Tuesday Wednesday  and the King's our Sunday Tuesday Wednesday so you have a few other choices if you want to go tomorrow and have today that would position you to then make your move on Thursday of next week too probably a Washington Wizard or a Phoenix Sun those are the teams that have decent schedule starting on Thursday of next week so that's probably your alternate option if you didn't get in on a Clipper earlier this morning ah quickly a check of the chat room let's make sure that everybody is covered there yes we did have a piece of news today  and we'll probably have more news on the day goes on but right now the one piece of news we got is that bennedict mathurin is out for the year  torn labrum  which is not really all that big of a piece of news from mathurin but it is a reasonably sized piece of news for Aaron Nesmith who's been terrible lately was a little bit better in the Pacers last ball game because he had a couple of blocks got some rebounds got some assists in there he's still wasn't hitting his shots but at least he took 10 of them  now they have no choice meaning has no choice but to be like look nice you gotta figure this out I don't know what you're dealing with right now whether it's a lingering injury or it's just fatigue of a long season or whatever but you got to be the guy  so hold on in East Smith again for the Pacers they're scheduled starting tomorrow is decent for four days  and so someone like in East Smith if he got dropped is actually pretty good pickup tomorrow through Wednesday of the following week then you're going to drop them because they got two games over the next six days after that before pivoting back into a slightly better schedule on March 20th so that's what you're doing if you're looking at Nesmith and the Pacers but that's a shame for my points League team my points League team was riding a pretty good Benedict mathura and he either prior to this shoulder injury and now you you pivot  but this is another reason why long streaming is such an important thing because it ends up it you end up holding on to your moves until later in the week in a lot of scenarios and that allows you to deal with a situation when a guy gets hurt like this like we didn't know the bathroom was going to be out for the year but when he was out sort of indefinitely and they said he was gonna get reassessed in a week you drop a guy like that  he wasn't even good enough to give it a second thought in a points I mean forget category league but points and and you can find plenty of players that are a similar example on the category League side where they're just like kind of okay and if you start getting zeros from that dude  in the playoffs you gotta drop  you just have to do it so you need to have a move ready on what did Matthew and go down this week Wednesday like you need to make sure that you had moves available to be to get rid of them  go find someone else that's not giving you a zero I don't care who the hell it is whoever we've been talking about who's at a good schedule coming up  this is why long streaming is so important in the playoffs you cannot set all of your moves in stone on Monday I'm gonna make two moves today and one move on Thursday and one move on Saturday because I gets hurt that move takes precedence over whatever else you were going to do be judicious with them be smart and try to hold on to some as the week goes on  I don't know if we're gonna have time to do one of these shows tomorrow I'm out until pretty late so if it happens it's going to be like after the kids go to sleep at night that's not particularly helpful for you and the game start early so in all likelihood for tomorrow there will not be a streaming show make sure to follow over on social media at Dan best brisk because we'll do our streaming stuff over there tomorrow first thing in the morning  and then Monday we'll get a recap going we'll get you situated for the start of playoff week number two for a lot
