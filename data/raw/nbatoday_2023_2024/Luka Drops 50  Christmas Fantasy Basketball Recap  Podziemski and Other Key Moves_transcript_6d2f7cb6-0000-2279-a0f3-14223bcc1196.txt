welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  hope everybody had a lovely Christmas Day  we're back to somewhat I get it's not really normalcy is it  we got a couple days of normalcy then you roll into the New Year's stuff and then we hit normalcy after New Year's we're still very much in the holiday season the holiday spirit is strong at the moment like a hair or something hanging off the front of my hat that I probably should have noticed before going on air but it's too late to do anything about that now we're in it now  we're in it  figure out what it is maybe it's a my glasses  start to the show Dan  coming in coming in with a flourish here this morning this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation I am Dan Vespers we got five games to go over from yesterday we'll give you a quick little preview of what's coming up on Tuesday night it's a pretty good size Tuesday mostly because yesterday was a pretty small Monday on nine gamer this evening and good news all around everybody  Christmas presents abound  because know of course I'm not talking about Bruce Brown bring ruled out that one is not an impact situation  I am of course talking about the fact that three players that have been out a long long while are all due back tonight  I am talking of course about Jalen Duren who was the in the shortest absence of the bunch and I think is it about three weeks  I am of course talking about Jalen Johnson who's been out for over a month I am of course talking about Marcus Smart whose been out over a month  relevance not in that particular order Jaylen Johnson probably the most relevant then during the smart  first two obviously belong on Ross's the third one Marcus Smart  if he  I would say probably stash him a smart of course now coming back the  the Duran one is a little bit it's always a little bit frightening because his stuff is these these ankles that just won't stay right Jalen Johnson is coming back from a hand thing so I his minutes I think can ramp up much quicker you'll probably see him in the mid-20s right in the first game back and then he'll be sort of rocking and rolling by game tour game three the other two guys during and smart you might see them kind of work their way back into game shape a little more slowly and certainly with Marcus Smart  because he's been  he's been on a while  so for smart I would expect something like 20-ish minutes his first game back you'll see that move up to like 246 28 30 that kind of thing so if you're stashing smart you're stashing for it at least two weeks just get that sort of drop that into your brain understand that that's what's going to be happening here if you want anything idea of what he's actually going to be  and then the other two guys obviously belong on rosters just sort of grain of salt on Jane Lin Duran how fast do they work him back into things he might be coming off the bench here we'll see what Detroit does the obviously want wins but they can't afford to break during again because he's one of the only players they have that can actually help them get wins regardless it's fantastic news  I I was thinking about posting a picture and I might still do it later on today I have a team that has all three of those guys actually on it which it's like oh of course Dan like the but no not really you know like the fact that I've Jalen Johnson and Jalen during is not all that surprising those guys were very high in the brewski 150 I was high on Jalen Duren I rolled with brewski on Johnson as a late round pick because it's like well whatever you know what if this goes wrong and then of course it hit really hard so it's not that crazy that I've done in Johnston the two Jalen's it is a little funny that I also have Marcus Smart that team also has Zach LaVine so if we got news out of the sky that's exactly was gonna magically reappear he's not by the way but that would really you know like  Jeffrey or the dude's rug  not The Big Lebowski the little about ski that really would have died the room together  anyway I'm feeling good as a result and you should too because these guys have been out a while and the team that I have them on happens to be one of my stupid stupid head to head teams I again you guys know I can't stand it but I'm gonna play them I'm gonna always play head to head because I know you guys really want me to talk about it and so I'm gonna keep doing it that team somehow stayed afloat it was in second place when all of those guys went down and it's in fourth place now and only two games back of second place not much of a chance of getting back to First  not after taking a couple of losses in there but like last week I won five to four by and this is like the ultimate accomplishment I want five four last week  despite having Marcus Smart Jalen Johnson Jalen Duren and Zach LaVine all out for that Weekly stretch my opponent had one guy who was fully injured last week  and then made a trade in the middle of the week so it's hard to look back and see what their lineup actually looked like  I won because I won steals blocks turnovers and both percentages  that's called the thieving of a week I stole that week  what an unbelievably lucky turn of events but that's the kind of stuff you got to do when you got four guys injured on a 14 oh you're gonna lose the games played battle by a dozen at least  so you're only opening the percentages winning turnovers which should be pretty easy in that situation so then you're like all right I'm gonna maybe I can lose six three and then anything else is just gravy and I One blocks because I had Zach Collins filling in for an injured weapon Jama and he had seven blocks last week or something like that so these little things you find a way to slip through this is a discussion I think for another day but you know we're only we're recapping five ball games so I figured we could talk a little bit about sort of fantasy adjacent fantasy Theory kind of stuff  and that's one of it what do you do when you have half of your team injured you try to steal five four wins and you know squeeze out five four losses even and that's huge because it's at some point the the people you're playing against presumably if if Lucky evens out and it doesn't necessarily in one year but a lot of times it does at some point during the season you're probably gonna play a team that has four guys out and that's when you have to make sure that you spank  get out the big hand man  warm up the hand and deliver a firm spanking that week  take the percentage is you're going to lose turnovers when you're playing a team that has four guys out and you don't when the counting stats when everything that counts try to take at least one percentage and come out with a nice like 72 win  rack up the W's in the weeks you can  minimize the ls in the weeks you can't come away with a nice win and that was it I mean that was what my last like three and a half to four weeks were bit have been in that League  by the way I continue to think it's dumb  that like that's the way you got to play fantasy sports and head to head please but that is a thing you got to do  if you want to win competitive hand Head to Head League's  and you go through a stretch where  you know 30% of your team is hurt you're going to play teams where 30% of their team is not hurt  and you got to find a way to minimize losses  you just have to  all right so let's dive into things quickly here I went straight into fantasy talk about the guys coming back but I I've been doing such a bad job lately of burying the news in the show that I wanted to make sure I got the news out first so hello again at the best results over on social I am certain that you guys will come find me over there I know this to be true again I still can't believe that I've cleared 20,000 absolutely ridiculous it's all as stupid as deadly are that's even dumber but it's still very cool I didn't think that I would care but I do anybody that says they don't on Twitter is a liar I will sheepishly admit that I very much do so thank you to everybody for following me over there Discord link to hang out with sports ethos folks that's in the show description make sure to check out Sports ethos.com and Ethos fantasy BK is the news feed over there someone was like Dan what is really the advantage of the news feed like is it faster than Underdog no it's not but what it does do that Underdog doesn't do is provide analysis  and game recap stuff  yes Underdog's gonna get you the starting lineup in a game faster than eat those fantasy BK but they don't have analysis they don't have end of game stuff  you know that in game yeah both both feeds do but Sports ethos blurred feet is going to give you end of game  what do you do with that information that's where they have that big Edge  and the other feeds that put out that type of stuff wrote a world wrote a wire I think Sports heels is faster than them  and frankly the analysis is better but  that's why you gotta follow those bad boys over there let's get into the recap part of the show though because I'm sure I'm forgetting something oh

happened yesterday on Christmas Day what a glorious glorious time 9 a.m. Pacific time you could put on the TV you just switched the channel once every two and a half hours basically and you got basketball all day long Nicks finally got their revenge on the Bucks who had beaten them nine consecutive times  bucks put up a pretty good fight nonetheless but the Knicks just had a little bit more in this particular ball game the whole like  and I struggle with this as well when do we play Bobby Portis because he's very much part of my stream while warm thing and he's been warm lately  so porches has been a play top 50 over the last two weeks  we know that won't last forever he goes for these types of runs top 50 70 to 80 range for a couple of weeks then he falls into that like 150 range for a couple of weeks  as long as he still getting minutes which he is right now or just got another 31 in this ball game then he needs to be played  so it's not even necessarily a stream while warm it's more of like a stream while he's seeing significant playing time kind of thing but then he cools off his minutes all so it's in a sort of a feedback loop is also shrink because ease out there to hit shots and rebound and so if that's stuff isn't happening  then is made of style back and if it is in the confidence is there then it keeps ramping up in this sort of ebb and flow in the back and forth that's what the stream well warm  type of player is  meantime Malik Beasley has  fallen on some slightly harder times the minutes generally outside of this Blog game is still kind of been there but we've seen the three pointers dip we've seen the usage dip and he's also a little bit in that same kind of category of like okay well  you know if he's not shooting the ball well why are we leaving this guy on the court for extended minutes  and the last little bit he hasn't been after shooting the ball extremely well at the beginning of the year and we wasn't going to shoot 50% from three for the entire season so it was always going to kind of come down at question was how far how long  I'm holding on Beasley he was good enough long enough where even this bad stretch has still left him inside the top 90 on the season overall  if it continues a whole lot longer than maybe we get out of the Beesley business but for now Roto you can bench him head to head I still think like you know yesterday's ballgame was bad yeah but overall he's still doing enough at least when schedules are fine  like I don't know what is Milwaukee schedule this week they got three games first five days of the week and they're off for a couple of days and they got four four coming up after the like head-to-head you're probably not moving on because the schedule is decent enough where there isn't a big harm done by holding on to this dude  and then wrote Oh you just bench him until he warms back up again if you like  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second

on the Nick side Josh Hart had one of his better ball games so to manual quickly but I'm not moving off of my position that these guys are scheduled plays only  the everydays or the all format guys are obviously Brunson who's been spectacular lately Randall who's come on nice after a terrible start to the year and then as I heart and shine who's feeling informal Robinson either two months or the entire year we don't even actually know for sure right now because Tom Thibodeau said he's still hoping to get Mitch Robinson back and eight to 10 weeks the team is applying for a disabled player exception  which is real I have no idea  I didn't know you could apply for that if a player might not actually miss the rest of the season but I also don't understand the collective bargaining agreement all that well warriors were able to hang in there with the nuggets for a while just couldn't quite get over the hump nuggets are very much in a state of cruise control this year because they know they're good enough to win most of their ballgames whether or not they're trying all that hard they're 22 and 10 while kind of messing around a little bit and you can tell they're messing around because they're only 10 and 8 on the road  nuggets are always going to be a good home team but we saw in the playoffs that they can win anywhere  this is what a regular season does to a team after a championship run they're still winning ball games because they're total too damn good to lose them  but you're getting not the greatest efforts from Nicola yokich who's right now A Distant number three in fantasy way behind Shay gilges Alexander and Joel embiid the nice thing for yolk at is that he still basically playing it every ball game I think he's missed one so far this year which you know better than his compatriots  but all of note nuggets have played 32 games this season and a lot of other teams are at like 28  so if you're thinking about schedules stuff things are actually gonna get kind of clunky for the Nuggets here in the not too distant future and I bring this up because Jamal Murray is another guy who missed some time with injuries only played 18 of their 32 games yeah he's number 44 now he's worked his way back up  where he was supposed to be  but he missed the part of the Season where the Nuggets had a super heavy schedule  I don't usually do Buy Low and sell High guys for like team situation it's usually more player specific but like  the Thunder of only played 27 ball games the Nuggets a played five more games than the thunder right now  doesn't that seem stupid  Rockets are only at 27 all so  point of reference like there isn't a great match for Jamal Murray on the Thunder because the Thunder really are kind of like a two horse team right now Shea and Chet are the guys that have fantasy value but like  if you look at Cross the NBA try to find some teams that maybe are at 27 or 28 games played I'm sure you could find somebody who's also ranked near Jamal Murray maybe like an Auntie Simon's where yeah in a vacuum my probably prefer to have Jamal Murray Simon says I know is ranked a little ahead of him right now but look after he's played in ten ball games and he's had some truly amazing all right three-point bomb efforts across them even if the even if Simon's ending Jamal by like eight to ten ranks slots  getting well the person that maybe they won't turn them away let's say Simon's falls behind him let's say Jamal Murray ends up winning the per game battle Jamal ends up at 40 and Simon's ends up at 50  an extra five games the rest of the way out of the guy ranked 50th  he wins by totals  think about that the difference between five three game weeks and versus four game weeks from a guy ranked inside the top 50 that's not how the numbers shake out I'm sure it'll bounce a little bit more it's not a perfect like oh yeah there's another week where he has one extra game but that's a five game difference and we're 30 games into the season  basically a 10% scheduling advantage to some of these teams or maybe call it a schedule disadvantage for the Nuggets who played a lot  the hell were we talking about  I don't know that's kind of the only fantasy note on the Nuggets even worth bringing up because you know they are a start the starter situation over there Warriors are more interesting because everybody's going goo goo gaga over trayce Jackson Davis and I like him too and we talked about the fact that it makes sense to have him as an ad just to sort of see what happened what you might recall from our discussion at the end of last week was that I said look Warriors had three games in four nights  from the end of last week they went Friday Saturday Monday said a really good opportunity on a head-to-head side to play Trace Jackson Davis and say all right like you know whatever I get three games in four nights it's gonna be good  Roto it was an opportunity to kind of evaluate a little bit  well now the Warriors schedule sucks  they go two games over the next week effectively  because it goes into Monday of next week and then they go four times in six days after that  I in terms of head to head  I don't think you can make that great of an argument to hold Jackson Davis  playing two games over seven days  put Jim ski yes he has been amazing his fill in Royal right now is as secure as anybody's in the NBA and frankly he may be playing himself into a rest of season job  because Andrew Wiggins played better in this ball game and so pajamas he just took Johnathan coming his medicine  he's become a priority here  I do think eventually he hits a bit of a rookie wall and that's okay you know he's a young dude acclimating to the NBA suddenly he's now playing gigantic minutes against gigantic people and he will probably run out of gas specially when a lot of what he does is sort of glue hustle stuff he saw it with us our Thompson  these guys rookies run out of gas they just do  but as long as he has any fuel in the tank but GS guy that needs to be rostered and started everywhere  Wiggins I'm not adding I'm not getting fooled again yet another good ball game here this is like the second good one over the span of a couple of weeks instead of one a month that's a slightly better rate I guess but who cares Klay Thompson finally had a slower ball game doesn't matter he's been good lately Steph was all so bad in this one did some Christmas hangover type of ball games and this again is the fear with Jonathan kaminga  he doesn't get as many steals or blocks as it seems like he should as a very athletic big wing  he scores okay but not enough to make it a big time advantage and he's bad foul shooter  that's why I thought all right head to head to get three games in four days kind of thing  two games over seven no  no  Celtics beat the Lakers Lakers are  Lakers are dabbling in a starting lineup that makes about the least sense of any lineup from any team uh outside of the Pistons all season long I haven't the first so  I don't want to get too far down the Lakers Rabbit Hole you guys know that I'm a very pragmatic Laker fan I like to see them win but from a fantasy standpoint I'm not gonna get fooled in anything with this ball Club  let's talk fantasy first fantasy Derek why does a first rounder for the last month 18 points on 11 assisted 31 assists they shot 51% from the field  Lakers only forced eight turnovers  which I'm gonna come back to why talking about some of the team numbers matter  Jayson Tatum finally had a good free throw shooting game  I bring that up because it's one of the big reasons that he's ranked in the 30s this year Tatum is number 34 which by the way is actually up to slots from last Wednesday when he was at 36  a lot of it is the fact that he's shooting 80% of the foul line 79 and change before this ball game and instead of 85 or 86 on high volume  that went from being a big positive for Tatum to actually a small negative  call it neutral if you really want he's not gonna score as much not with Drew holiday and Chris Southport sing us around doing stuff  rebounding numbers are still good three pointers are still good but they'll be a little bit lower Steals and blocks are a little bit lower  a sister still fine  that free throw number if it starts to come back where it's supposed to be he moves up around I don't think he's getting into the first round per game this year though but if you can get Tatum for a second round I think I probably would still do it  now on the Lakers side  I've been saying on the show that I think Tori and Prince is an all formats dude and I stick by that he's been very warm from three point land he's playing gigantic minutes because he's the only guy that the Lakers trust to knock down three-pointers at least among this sort of non  key guys  so keep Tori and Prince  hatchimals seeing an increase role he was a plus five he was actually the only Laker who was a plus in plus minus in this ball game  that's not enough for Fantasy purposes but he is gonna take a bunch of shots because the other Wings can't score  I don't know what the hell the Lakers are doing  and up until  up until this ball game  I as a Laker fan was a little bit of a Darvin ham apologist like yeah you know he's like  he had a lot of lineups where he was missing pieces and  there's a lot of situations where there was sort of figuring out how Stuff fit together  but they basically have their guys now know Gabe Vincent for a while again because it sounds like he's probably gonna undergo surgery and miss another two months that's turning out to be a real crap dink of signing but let's not even worry about that  at the beginning of the year as you guys might recall the Lakers and this is gonna have a fantasy bent to it so stick with me here the Lakers had D-Lo and Austin Reeves and Tori and prince in the starting five with LeBron and AD  and that line up wasn't really working because they were able to guard anybody  okay fine I think you could argue that those are the five best offensive players on the Lakers the prince versus really hot tomorrow thing is debatable I guess but basically five best offensive players um  and they got off the slow starts because other teams were beating them up  on the defensive side  that all right well we can't start Reeves and Russell together these two guys are not good rebounders they're not great defensively let's get one of them out of there let's take a cam reddish in  I think there was somebody else first actually if I recall and then then it switched over to reddish because Vanderbilt was out I think Vincent maybe he got us started and I think he was out already I don't remember exactly  so reddish got in there and that actually worked for a little bit because he was sort of a long he was creating steals they put him on guards to try to slow down you know posing teams  primary Guardian Prince would often take sort of the primary wing and Anthony Davis could handle everything was going on the middle and that worked for a little bit  for a little bit  and then the Lakers decided that D'Angelo Russell was the problem and moved him to the bench  that  but didn't bring  Reeves back into the starting five and instead they brought Jarred Vanderbilt into the starting five because they're like always still need more rebounding but now you've got two guys in the starting unit  that aren't big men  but also can't really stretch a floor to wear an opponent cares about them  it is the most nonsensical lineup decision that I've seen again outside of the Pistons this year  if you want it rebounding  it had to be hachimura  or you had to take out cam reddish who doesn't rebound yeah I know I want him to guard the opposing guard you might just have to ask Vanderbilt to do that  so the reason I bring all of this up is I don't think this starting unit can possibly stick there's just no way that the Lakers brass is this dumb to do this for more than a couple of ball games  they beat the Thunder but it wasn't because of the new starting five it was because LeBron hit every three-pointer and scored 40 efficient points and then the rest of his team started scoring a bunch around him and frankly d low in the second unit played pretty damn well in that Thunderball game  and he wasn't bad in the second unit in this ball game either he doesn't rebound and he doesn't guard anybody but he's gonna score in a second unit against opponents that are not as good defensively and frankly can't punish him as much on the other end Boston  their deep enough and their rotations are good enough where there's always someone out there whether it's Derek white or Drew holiday or Jalen brown or something they'll they'll find a way to attack him but most teams are not going to be that good  so fine if you want to leave the Angela Russell a second unit have had it  but if that's the movie you make it has to be Austin Reeves going back into the starting five because the whole point of benching Reeves was that there were like well we need some scoring punch in the second unit and we are getting obliterated on the glass and defensively in the starting unit so let's separate Russell and Reeves and now they're back together in the big on the bench  it makes no  it goes against  all for why they bench Reeves in the first place but then didn't bring him back in so  I say all about all of that about the Lakers to say this unit is not going to stick they were horrible they were down 12 to nothing before the ball game even started and the game was even the rest of the way after that like yours came back and tied it Celtics went back up by eight or nine like Lakers came back and tied it and that's how it was just swung back and forth between Lakers down 10 and tied but they fell behind right out of the Chute and never really made up for it I think they led by two points at one point in their  you cannot be that bad on offense to start a ball game you cannot have Jarred Vanderbilt and cam reddish on the floor with the starting unit you just can't do it  because if your issue was rebounding which I get it they're rebounding has been very very bad reddish isn't helping their  all of this is to say I think Austin Reeves might even be a buy low because it feels like he's about to get moved back into the starting lineup and get 30 plus minutes of ball game or do they just throw Dlow back into the starting five probably not  based on the way that he's been kind of floating a little deals been kind of playing with his head in the clouds the last couple of weeks and he knows that he's he's set his much I'm holding both of those guys  because they're Simply Better by a lot then someone like a camera at ish  now hachimura is the guy that you're sort of a little bit of right about of but Gabe Vincent is out for two months again so I know dealers getting dropped in a lot of places and I get it but if you watched the Lakers rotation's these don't make sense and I can basically promise that they're gonna change soon no Joel embiid unfortunately Paul Reed picked up four fouls in the first seven minutes he played  he managed to at least  get 10 minutes in the second half but it was a bad foul Trouble game 17 minutes played five battles for Paul Reed  would I play him if he'd misses another ballgame I probably would although Mo Bamba had a much better game here  the shame of it is that Paul Reed was a plus 12 they're just a better team when he's on the floor but he didn't he couldn't stay on the floor in this ball game and that's why I think I would probably give Paul Reed another look as much as you guys all want to kill me for saying it he is the better reality player than Mo Bamba and I think Philly knows that I think Nick nurse knows that  mean time Tyrese Maxey laid back kind of his first egg almost of the entire season he'll be fine Kelly oubre is a fantastic feeling at the very least one at high usage guys down so that then he finally gets some shots and then melted into by his Harris those guys are are Trucking along to buy us after a hotspot and a cold spell he's warmed back up again  hold onto Aubrey that's what I've been saying hold on until we really know what he is it seems like the answer to that question right now on Kelly is that he's a fill-in that one the teams fully healthy he's probably not going to quite do enough but they're not healthy right now so no reason to move on until they are Kayla Martin got hurt early for the Heat and that opened up a little bit more room for Duncan Robinson who played 34 minutes  if Jimmy Butler and Caleb Martin are each out for the next ball game for the heat you're definitely streaming Jaime as Junior who is filling in for Butler admirably right now  and then you're probably streaming Lowry and Robinson Duncan Robinson those are the probably  if Martin or Butler is back I might go back to just not streaming any of the fringy he to see what this new iteration would look like because someone's out for Miami seemingly every ballgame the question is we need we like we need to know which guys are out what combination of players is out for us to know which guy to stream  and it seems like it's a new  you know combinations and permutations problem from math going all the way back to high school mathematics I like to see each permutation one time before I then deploy a streamer level dude and so now we saw from the previous game when it's Butler that's missing jaquez is the guy that gets his start he's the safest of them Duncan Robinson has been playing well but his minutes fluctuated when everybody else was healthy well Caleb Martin went down so Robinson's minutes moved back up into the 30s and said of the 20s and that's enough for him to get it done Kyle Lowry they're gonna need him to move the basketball he'll still get some threesome steals some assists went all of these other guys are down  what if they come back what if Josh Richardson is back for the next ball game that again further complicates matters  so start with as and we'll work our way down the board from there luckily we don't have to worry about it tonight Miami doesn't play again until Thursday of this week they're actually offered two days in between ball games  Dallas beat Phoenix 12814 Dallas led by a bunch Phoenix came roaring back but then kind of ran out of juice Luca with a 50 point monster of a basketball game made all 12 of his free throws eight threes 15 assists four Steals and three blocks Luca jumped all the way up to the number five slot passing both Tyreese Halliburton and Kawhi Leonard that's hard to do at this point in the year to jump over two guys at the top of the board but this was that kind of ridiculous level ball game Tim Hardaway Jr is a stream while Kyrie Irving is out that one you feel safe with Derek Jones Junior got 18 shots did not see that one coming he was good enough in this ball game but you guys know my feelings on Derek Jones Junior and Dante Exum I still feel like each one of them is sort of ripe for a fall off and exit had a little bit of a fall off in this one will it be Jones Junior in the next one  I don't know maybe but he kept his starting job even though Grant Williams and Derek Lively were back in there I guess Grant was back in the last one Derek Lively's back he had 20 and 10 hopefully nobody dropped him if they did check the wire see if you can scoop awesome Center I doubt it  and then over on the Phoenix side she met you had 23 and 19 as the backup center for Drew Eubanks Phoenix is like look you Banks you're terrible and he's been quite bad in both games but it was you don't get as a bookie who picked up for Eubanks in the previous ball game and it was made to in this one I don't know who the hell is going to be the third string Center in the next ball game Who outplays Eubanks maybe I'll just be use of Norwich back from his personal absence  so I'm leaving that one alone  I do think Grayson Allen and I've been saying this for a week now I think Grayson is a 12 team mobile Bradley Beal is out and then he made good on that with an 8-3 pointer game here so start Alan start Durant start Booker and that's as far as I'm going with Phoenix right now by the way Devin Booker is down to number 29 in nine cat  don't mean to alarm anyone that's on a per game basis  and that's still with Bradley Beal not having really played at all this year  pleasure that's  so I'm not like  trying to celebrate this I just  a bunch of people were in my mentions a month into the season when Booker was number six and I was like yeah like he's he's destroying so far but  we hadn't seen the team at full strength  and frankly he was playing over his head in both percentages and assists and steals  and some of that stuff has come down  by the way the fact that he's  only number 29 while averaging 275 and 8 is kind of insane that's how incredible the top of the board is in fantasy this year but  it's the truth he was drafted at 1314 I said I thought he was gonna be back in the in the 25-30 range and that's where he is right now it's not because he's not a great basketball player who puts up large fantasy numbers in a few things it's because I thought that there wouldn't be enough in threes steals blocks turnovers rebounds  no they're not bad  but they're just not quite at that Elite or even at like a break even level to where this stuff that he does that's very very good  can counterweight enough to be in that top 15 I mean think about what the guys have to do to be a top 15 player this year the numbers are extraordinary  Donna Mitchell is basically Devin Booker plus a crap ton of threes and defensive stats  hard to get up near the top it's very difficult Tyrese Albert is averaging 25 and 12 assists a game  like how the hell do you get in the top 10 right now  Scotty Barnes 21 points nine boards six assists two threes almost three defensive stats  Chad Holmgren 17 and 8 with 3.6 defensive stats in a 5685 split  freaking impossible Kevin Durant is number 13 now averaging 36 and 5 and a half with almost two defensive stats per game on good present images how the hell is that not good enough to be a first rounder this year  anyway  so yeah Booker's down to number 29 now he's a third rounder which is  exactly where I said he would be on draft day  just took two almost exactly two months for it to get there  but remember he missed two weeks so the great leveling for him happened two weeks later  great leveling man it levels us all  mid show reminder again to check out our buddies at manscape.com promo code their ethos 25 me on Twitter at Dan best briefs  and do take a moment to like rate and subscribe and I know that I am running dangerously far behind on replying to YouTube comments you guys know what the holidays it's been just a little bit of a tougher time to get back at everybody I will do my best to do so today again if you're trying to get a hold of me the YouTube comments is the best place to do it that's where it you can post stuff after the show is officially uploaded so when the live stream finishes that's the place to get a hold  of a very quick look at what's coming up here on a 9 game Tuesday and then we'll wrap up the show or Lando is in Washington there is a whole lot to pay attention to their other than whether certain guys are in or out up Wizards looking to try to keep this one competitive Kyle kuzma I believe was listed as probable at the latest marker and there's been  a no update today to do a quick glance over to make sure I wasn't missing anything since we went on air 30 minutes ago  Brooklyn Detroit Jalen Duran's return curious how many minutes he gets my guess would be about 22 24 something in that neck of the woods Utah  Jordan Clarkson put up some big numbers in the last ball game he's a cell anytime he does that do we get more Chris done or just THD come back and ruin that fun otherwise you know start Kelly Olynyk if he starting if he's not don't  say until we got an event one banana update he was available at shoot around today participated so presumably he'll be playing does that sort of re begin the Zach Collins drop storyline or does he somehow hang on Atlanta getting Jalen Johnson back what does that mean for saddiq Bey for Onkyo Kong do we not find out immediately because DeAndre Hunter is out for a couple of weeks that might sort of mitigate whatever Jalen Johnson impact would have on the other fantasy players on that team Chicago I think you're starting the starters for the Bulls right now although we are starting to see a little bit of the bottom coming out for Kobe white and he's still gonna do more than enough in the in the popcorn stats but the other things are leveling  he wasn't gonna shoot 50% forever that was wild but yes obviously start all those guys Pacers we've seen some good stuff out of Aaron Smith lately I'm expecting that to continue know Bruce Brown so Andrew nembhard might be a very short-term fill-in for some points and assists but his Fantasy game is not particularly robust  Houston I would like to see tari Eason at full strength again it looked like he was really coming on I think that continues  Memphis Marcus Smart likely back but like on a minute limit New Orleans this might be the last herb Jones stand for me I need to see a good ball game out of the dude I think we're at like six bad ones in a row and I'm extending my patients as long as humanly possible but Trey Murphy seems to have mostly taken his job Minnesota cat status that's the only thing you're watching there and then what that would mean for Nazarene Oklahoma City there may be no Josh Gideon in this game so perhaps you get a little bit of an Isaiah Joe citing Jalen Williams also has a cold he's questionable if both of those guys are out you got to think somebody on Oakley Oklahoma City would step up might even be Ludo I hate his Fantasy game Kings not much I think Malik monk is a game time call hopefully he'll be in there but it doesn't change the starters very much Blazers is I haven't seen an update on shaedon Sharpe in a little bit so maybe keep an eye on that one and then what it would mean for Malcolm Brogden Charlotte  nothing seems like Nick Richards is still your fill-in and then the Clippers Kawaii is questionable hopefully he gets back in there my guess is he sits because the Clippers can win this game without him  and at a certain point you start to make those types of calculations Clippers are 17 and 12 they're the sixth seed in the Western Conference even if they accidentally lost this game is still got a little bit of an edge  I just don't think they're all that worry  the West right now is  basically 11 teams playing for 10 spots unless the Grizzlies can get themselves back into it so  if you have a few game Edge on that you're probably not super concerned so my guess is that Kawaii sits out one more ball game but we shall see I think he's trying to play more games this year and would be good I think if for all of us if he did from a fantasy standpoint and that's your Show Ladies and Gentlemen thanks so much for watching on this day after
