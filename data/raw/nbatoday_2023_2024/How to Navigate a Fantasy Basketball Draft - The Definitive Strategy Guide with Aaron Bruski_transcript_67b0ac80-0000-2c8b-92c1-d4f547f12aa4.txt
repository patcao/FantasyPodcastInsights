welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  for this day I haven't decided if I want to just let that music roll out or if I want to start talking over it there's a complicating Factor people in that when I edit this audio down for the recorded side of the Pod the non-tuberculous  there's a bumper music that's the same song that edits onto the front end and so if that's playing in the background on the YouTube audio the same song plays twice at different points  whatever nobody cares welcome to Fantasy NBA today everyone it is I'm pretty sure Wednesday six days from the start of the NBA season I'm your host here on fantasy NBA Today Dan best person I am joined by the founder of sports ethos the big dog Aaron bruske bro good it's day it's daytime good day to you  I'm hello hi

yeah can we be a little grown up about it just fast forward you you could either wait five minutes  or you can fast forward yes fast forward I'm not offended if you're watching it live aren't you yeah I will go good with it yeah don't bother me I mean podcasters they know you're doing it yeah that's why they want mid-roll man nobody wants you to advertise for them right out of the chute that does they don't want that they want it right in the middle when you're in the meat of it by the way Aaron is on Twitter at Aaron bruskey the website  Sports ethos.com ethos fantasy BK on social go check that out immediately and as I just said nobody wants to do a promo at the beginning because nobody's listening I'm gonna do one anyway go check out the fantasy pass over its Sports ethos it's got the B150 it's got projections it's got a draft tracker tool it's got Panda sleepers in it now that bad boy is outfitted gotta loosen the belt buckle there's so much in that dummy and it's six bucks a month All Sport also includes football and baseball that's for it that's right and that's going up favorite one right now well you might as well you might as well win basketball and baseball yeah I mean I think they're fun too baseball's fun you've got somebody telling you what to do that's the ogee face you would like Joe Rico that's the original flavor and football are you all play football somebody's dragging you into a football draft I still get dragged into football drafts I know I dodged it this year get the all-sport I mean that's a stupidly low price that's true some of you watching this in live it's eight a lot of people watching this after the fact it may have already gone up to nine whatever get it fast don't wait to watch and listen to our shows that's the lesson here the thing I was gonna ask you brew by the way have you watched shrinking on Apple TV  no I haven't watched anything I'm stuck in the middle of a Better Call Saul oh I've been there for a while I'm actually say anything no I'm not I'm not gonna because I am also so that show had I think three or four seasons before writers strike like a few years back not the one that just ended and there was a gap between four and five maybe I might be getting that wrong someone a writer out there is going to yell at me and I deserve it but I'm just finally cycling back through that one too you and I are both watching Better Call Saul wait the hell after the fact this is lovely well yeah so so at my house we got a tenant unit and this is tenant you know got a couple beers under the other day and started limping off like wait lady wait not I think you say I will completely immediately know and I think I know it and I know that's it cuz you're in the middle of it right now so who knows something there could be in the middle of it anything I say will tip you off yeah I don't tip me off and see I'm just gonna shut up I don't want to say anything no no nothing at all done just talking about it so good man that's all that ladies man 420 who wants to be mad at us you know I hope that that's Tim Meadows talk by the way basketball all right so let's navigate to draft 420 yeah I thought you would talk about the late man I'm not gonna get sidetracked by a ladies man discussion because you know that's my thing with Bogman  me and Bob's man we go back and forth on ladies I believe it I believe it when I see it that you can stop talking about the ladies I can't so called fish sandwiches so you don't want to fish  we did it anyway all right okay so here's what we're getting into on Today Show how to navigate a draft this is a big big picture item that I think a lot of folks are actually struggling with it's something that experts novices each have different areas where they scuffle on draft days and so in my mind I was trying to go through okay what did things that I struggled with when I was first starting out what are things that I'm struggling with right now Brew I'm sure there one or two things that even you're like trying to knock on the side of your head like don't do that thing that always gets in there I'll tell everybody the thing that I struggle with right now is specifically when I'm drafting anywhere near the end of a round I know I'm getting like right into the weeds quickly here but I want people to know you're not alone with things if I'm near a turn front or back end turn on on a snake draft  I struggle with this idea of  well if I take this guy here he doesn't have the amount of value that I'm used to getting if I take him in the middle of a round but sometimes you just have to be comfortable slicing off  six Slots of perceived value if it's a player you believe is  out in front of where you have them and I I still struggle with that I get to my turn or I get to my pair of Selections in these drafts and I'm like I don't want to take that guy because I prefer to take him at 40 4 or something like that and it's my pick at 3637 and on principle I'm not gonna do it but that's dumb right tell me I'm dumb you have carte blanche what when you say based on principle is immediately dumb mm-hmm but if you do it based on principle it's down that's dumb yeah but I know I'm being good I mean driving on the ends it's very difficult I don't like it I think it's that's why auction drafts are great  for that specific issue I really I think the only Silver Lining there is you do get degree of control over how you go about that second pick because you get to really if you're the second to last pick really and it just  kind of really sucks but if you've got one or two GM's on the outside of you heading into that turn you can look at their lineups and determine you know I think just Gonzo on centers and then you're looking at a center and you're like okay well I shouldn't take that Center first I'll take that Center second because they don't need a center pretty easy stuff right there  you go to take your shots and and I think in that spot more than anything you really do got a game out your draft  like you've got to understand what the pockets of value are and that's something I'm probably 30 just deep now um you know of drives actually care about and  by the way the draft tracker is amazing I've done one no way I've been able  you've done 30 and I've done one  I know I know it was yesterday it was doing over there it was a keeper draft I draft as close as I can to the start of the season  I know you have really important ones around that time as well so it you know stuff comes up guys get hurt I think who Jared Allen is going to miss the beginning of the season right isn't that a thing like these are why you draft latte yeah he might be back thinking yeah anyway done matter that's not even the main point there what about you let me start with you on this one and then we'll go to sort of the laundry list is there something that you even after multiple Decades of this of being an analyst of like staring at this stuff all day all night every day and doing you're probably almost into the thousands of drafts if you not might actually be in the thousands of fantasy drafts what do you still struggle with  steals  steals constantly that's weird why I mean because  yeah no I mean I think the market doesn't understand the value of steals they're everywhere I mean  so basically  I end up playing against myself  so much because at some point in time Stills will be there and so when you're looking in terms of pure value sometimes you're going to end up taking somebody a little bit later  or taking a guy that you have ranked lower you know X you have a lower expectation for however you want to put it and you're taking them because you know you're going to get those steals later and it took me forever to really stop doing that I still do it and  and I I find myself drafting these kind of weird inverse you know in verse teams where they're completely not who I think is the best at that draft slot  and it's fine because I know I'm going to get those deals so if we're measuring in terms of pure value yeah I'm going to take a little bit of loss on that stuff but  if you do with the other way and you're going to lap the field and steals or you know buy some stupid amount you're also not doing it right that way so  that's that's my personal thing  and I think that's more function of the market you know and of anything than anything else if these guys were correctly ranked then I wouldn't have that problem um so that's a big one and then  League  settings that's absolutely everything positionality one Center versus two centers  that's I think the first thing you got to look at at a draft is it one Center or two centers I see a lot of people banging on on two centers I actually like it I think it  it creates a scarcity and it creates a need to make a choice early on in a draft am I going to take care of this  or am I going to look at this list oh Center's that I have that I know I can get late and and rely on that yeah and if that's something I've been kind of going back on  yeah I was gonna say cuz like yeah you hold a nice hang yourself out to dry that way if you don't get them you're you're screwed there isn't there isn't a way to come back from that if you get to the end you're like oh crap I didn't get the two I needed  that's well and the centers are interesting yeah go ahead because  it's like on one hand if you can nail down Center's it helps your team so much and somebody different ways so they and a two Center format and I think it's even true in a one Center format because it just depends on settings of course but like  big man stats  are good is the summary  of The Point  High field goal percentage good blocks good boards  and then if you're not killing yourself on free throws  this solves so many problems for your team so even in one Center format if you can get power forwards who do that you know or whatever the case may be  I've always found that that's a  it's a good thing for your team now  is that gonna help you when  say that that kind of players not available or shouldn't be taken I should say in like until like the 50 60 70 range  and in there and you're like well you know I got this player he's like a top 30 guy you know should I go for a center  Nail this thing down get the right stats set that I would like  and leave this 30 on the table here this 30 ranked player  on the table not the in and out of the draft that I think it's fascinating whether it's a snake draft or it's an auction draft you just constantly are being put on some very strategic decisions in real time um with the fast clock interesting things happen  again the draft tracker like without a tool like that I don't know how you compete  and in this case with the draft tracker I have that we have I should say  you can go so fast with it  like and that's so important if you've got a clock that's a 60 second clock I mean some people get crazy and take that thing down even lower  to keep up with what's going on  you've got to have a fast tool you can't have something that's going to be you know taken five years to reload you can't have to be like scrolling up and down the page doing all this crazy stuff  you know data all over the place you need something that's quick and succinct and then you can start to Zig when others zag I mean great example I think was in a draft I'm drafting with what I would call an intermediately  and a guy that I haven't taken anywhere and I think he's a good player  Yakima portal  you know I'm on the turn  you know so cool that sucks but whatever I'm sitting there looking at my team and I'm like I got so much free throw Advantage right now  and I need rebounds so bad and everything else is great you know it's gravy  man I'm gonna take yaka Pearl  or the first time this season because I know I got five guys behind them that I can say in the coming rounds and you know they're all very highly valued so you make a decision on the Fly I'm gonna take a guy that  he's not ranked as high as the other guys  I don't particularly like him you know because the free throw issues you know in a lot of drafts  but here I am I'm taking it and and you just got a zig when you need to Zig and zag when you need to zag and I think strategically just kind of gotta be looking at what's the value in each category what do you have and it's just shifting all over the place  so that actually takes me to one of the questions that I think probably is useful for both novice and intermediate maybe even expert players as well is  at what point in a fantasy draft are you now starting to look at  more specific team needs versus just strictly higher ranked player you said yakap early he's going in the 70s and a lot of drafts is that the time to start filling in the gaps on your team or is it early on one of the greatest I know this is just like a walking out for the draft tracker but seriously it's it's been a game changer for me personally I answer usually about 10 drafts a year  and and this year and I even got medical issues that keep me off a keyboard I'm in like 30 this year and I took it on because I was like  I can  you know this thing's allowing me to do that  to answer your question  the thing will it's got a bunch of different settings one of them is you can have it set to show totals for the entire year  so yeah okay six rounds seventh round I made my plays they've all kind of been let's just say they were by the book and they were all great plays or whatever you know I feel great about it then you look at your team and you're like man  I'm gonna get a one in rebounds if I don't do something about it you know if you're head to head and you intend to punt rebounds whatever it might be  that's another story you know that's a strategy  but a lot of times five or six players come off the board you did a good thing you got what would be five or six top 30 players you know you're just kicking ass great job now what are you going to just throw this thing off the rails because you didn't get ahead of the need for your team when you could make a difference and how you know when you're looking at totals say you're just completely down in rebounds so just keep using that as an example in your life looking at these totals and you're like man there's like three or four guys on the board that get  over 300 rebounds in a season and everybody else is getting less than that or and they're all really bunched up at these super low numbers and you're like and there's only like five guys left in the draft that can actually deal with this deficiency IHOP  then you go all right  three of these guys I know I can get  around 12 whatever you know so I those they're my safety blanket  these two guys I got to make a choice  I gotta go on them right now  or I'm looking at the other side of the equation and this tool will bring all the players that you should be looking at right up into your line of sight  and  it's like are those guys worth it  so pass up on what might be my only chance to effectively win this league because if you're going to go down heavy in a category and get a one in it  you might as well then punching it from the beginning and so you do need to look at it almost existentially in round six or seven or eight if you do end up you did a good thing you dropped it all right guys but for whatever reason the deficiencies are what they are and you only have two rounds to address them because it's impossible after that point to do so and a tool like the draft tracker just makes it stupid easy to see where the where the lines are where the cut lines are so to speak and your decision making process so  you're just evaluating at that point can I sneak in another high value guy or do I got to go for the thing that absolutely matters right now  so it's that's why I love this sport you know let me leave fluctuating based on who people draft let me dial you back a little bit early in the draft even one of the things that I know comes up in this same discussion is after like two rounds or even after one round you can have sort of a wonky view of how your team Stacks up against others because like whatever you get in the first round in the second round you're going to be very very good and and however many categories and like it does feel like the days of traditional big small pairing in the first and second round or kind of over well maybe I should ask you about that is that over now because there's like  who like Joel embiid is your traditional making the first and  it's still exists and he's shooting threes and right yeah I get  I get I get questions about it all the time I get people asking me should I pair this guy with this guy I'd say half of the questions I think are good questions in the sense that they are actually the right question be asking the other half or to me like no I just take the best player you know because whatever whatever you're thinking here is not you know the juice isn't worth the squeeze whatever your idea is but ya know it's you find  people are doing that and then  you just have to know what is what like  sometimes like you get two of the highest assist players in the league  yeah you're probably okay in that category the rest of the way  you get two of the highest block guys  early on you might be good the rest of the way you need to to really think about you know how that all Stacks up and it I don't know if it comes into play with like your third or your fourth selection but it definitely comes into play soon  and if you don't have some degree of of knowledge about what you're doing at that point in time you will end up wasting value  so it's just about not wasting value and tracking where you're at between the categories that's that's the way that you keep from doing that  and then you can even find more pockets of value once you get to that spot because you might take a guy  that's got a pretty high 80P it's not somebody you would normally take and then you're going to get the guy that you had highly ranked after that  and it's maybe not a move you you would have made if you weren't open to the idea of taking somebody who you had had ranked lower  and kind of comes back to that ego thing it's like okay I think this guy's better I think he's got a better value I've got a ranked higher in the B150 man this player right here you know and I gotta take him like 10 slots early over 80P  that's that's like embarrassing you know I'm supposed to do that the other way right that's the key to my team right there  so you really got and it's happening so fast  you have to be able to kind of check yourself and be like yeah no I'm gonna take  Bobby Portis  no  Bobby course why sitting there  you know he's got his 130 ADP or whatever and I'm like man I got this guy 110  just because that's the one that if it slips through  yeah fair enough okay let me ask you more about that stage of the draft you might need his retails  so for novices let me because I think some of the stuff we're covering right now is is a little more intermediate and expert understanding like how value works and where you attack certain guys let's say we're more of an obvious level player kind of getting in and trying to make sure that they have a good draft is it more important for a novice player to win the draft or to not screw it completely up because I think the answer might be the latter  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game its neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the

plus not available in all locations  where they playing against let's say it's mostly other novice yeah novices may be a couple intermediates floating around in there do they have the draft tracker  do they have to be 150 the novice and so serious question because like  yeah get some help that's phase one thing if you if you yeah you know if you have a draft list that's good  you know if you're if you're  a novice walking into like if you're a novice and you just got a list from  a big box site  I don't know I would I would think you you might be like okay so the idea that you can just not screw it up  what does that mean that means like don't drop injury prone dude pretty much you know is going to fall apart  you know don't draft  Head Case guy whose guaranteed to blow it gee I wonder who he could give those things about  yeah basically I think that's I think that does sort of sum up the question a little bit should I should someone just learning I mean presumably if they're brand new they're going to be competing against someone with a little bit more experienced than them but it does feel like they shouldn't dive straight into the deep end I would go off the top of the list and  I mean if you have a draft tracker then you can at least just  if I tell you this one thing watch this feels  that's your thing watch us feel because they  they're available  they're everywhere so are you saying wait on them  make sure I'm understanding this right I'm saying just keep an eye on it  like if you if you're gonna lap the field in that category it's too much  I think is a novice if you take one thing from this sort of kind of wonky discussion  take that one thing  if you're trying to not draft injury-prone players  maybe look at our draft guide and get a sense for who those guys are before you go to drafts and put a little Mark on your sheet  you know before them if you have a B150  you know  or  some good wrinkles I don't know what you know  that might be but like then I think you can just go from the top of the list  and wrist be damned like  take an injury program guy because you're going to have other players that back in love do you there's been um  man I've been trying to push back on this on on social a little bit by the way talking to Aaron bruske at Aaron brewski on social um there's been a push to  I think  look and you and I have talked about this a little bit on a previous show but I think this is actually relevant for both intermediate or both novice and intermediate maybe not as much for expert level players because they probably already know how they feel about it and I don't know that you and I yelling at them it's gonna change it either way  I think there's been a push lately  to  not look at totals ranks as much and I I just I feel like  folks have tried to oversimplify Fantasy in a way that doesn't actually work because anybody that's listened to my show for the last half decade knows my number one job I'm trying to make fantasy basketball a little bit easier for people listening here is the weed I get it we don't all have two three four hundred hours this is what analysts we're spending our time on so hopefully you don't have to basically let me present this to you in a way that is easy for your brain to process we're gonna try to go find values in a way that doesn't require you to do 9,000 hours of digging but so I get it on paper the idea of trying to simplify the way that we look at these things  but I just don't think that's a way that's reasonable to do I think that totals make a lot of sense in certain areas and per game makes sense in certain areas as well where you can kind of look at one or the other or both  what does a novice or intermediate fantasy player need to know when they're looking at total's ranks per game ranks is it as simple as is this guy injury prone or not or is there more going on than that  yeah I think it's are they injury prone or not  that question is sort of the difference in a nutshell between a per game  and a totals rank  and it's  I mean if you're looking at a novice  and trying to help them be better kind of thinking of a guy can't remember his name I can but I can't say it  his philosophy was he just changed freaking good players like you know I'm misplacing a word there  what did he meant by that is kind of like  stats be damned I just want the best player players out there so that's a that's a piece of advice that it's not optimizing the assets at all  but it is a pretty good piece of advice in the sense that you know if you're if you look at nine categories or eight categories and just like whoa this is too much you know you could come back to that you know pick good players I know breaking news on the show is a good players and you win  but  ya know I don't know why there's a pushback against totals like even in a head-to-head lie this is what we talked about the other show it's like  so we're gonna say that this per game rank is is more relevant and we 22 versus weak 23 versus weak 24 versus weak 21 versus weak 20 okay I mean we're just guessing right at this point oh hey I got a great way to incorporate a gas  into some sort of evaluation method how much is the guy play  I'm just stay on the floor yeah  it matters oh yeah totals rank do you that sounds amazing bro do you bro do you agree with me that  it's not a hard line or anything like but there is some spot along the path between player ranked number one and player ranked number 200 where the pendulum swings more towards the per game side like I think I would for me I think I would rather have a guy who's a little bit more injury-prone who's like the number 65 ranked player versus a very durable guy putting up  a hundred range type of production on a game to game basis but as you look more towards the front end of a draft for me like the guy who's the number four per game Guy versus the guy who was like the number 12 per game guy if you're number 12 dude is playing 10 11 whatever extra games  at the end of the year that guy ends up being more valuable so then totals become the more  relevant ranking do you have any idea of where that that pendulum swing is I think for me it's somewhere like between 60 and 100  yeah this is I know you play a lot of games Catholics so games cap versus just straight up you know let her rip you gonna have a higher requirements of value for a guy to be effective in your league so you're looking at 100 is not working for me 75 is my cut line and so when you talk about adds and drops that stuff matters you know I think I've been trying to spearhead that movement for years is tell me what you're talking about when we're talking about adds and drops you know there's a lot of different formats and a lot of different specifics that matter there  I think the cut line on this discussion is basically kind of backs into that it's what's going on with the waiver wire  you know if I can replace you with five other guys  fantasy basketball industry discussion here I can replace you with a bazillion players then yeah give me the guy who's got like no needs but if he plays for 15 games  you know that they're going to be spectacular what if he happens to play six or 70 you know give me that guy  and generally in drafts that's kind of happened in after 100  you know that on the side  yeah that makes sense hunting upside and it's always it's question of the probably the last piece of this is  what does it do to your roster decisions to have risky or injury prone or longer developing players on your bench yeah that's actually one of my questions by the way you you take in the next segment and rolling it right in go for it have at it sweet it's it's what does it do to your decision making to have to  you know maybe you got a guy that you're playing for three games a week and you don't want that you know because you have player x on a bench who's got a weight and get better  or whatever the situation may be and you might find that not this year but like a Monty Morris of yesteryear you know who's just hanging around 120 150 but he's reliable and he's just gonna be there and you know what he's gonna give you  that might actually play better you know then the the snazzy young player  that's just not there yet  what about all that stuff I'm sorry I didn't mean to jump in on you there I thought I thought I thought I caught the end of the sentence but I think we might have about a one second leg on this one what about this year specific to the board I don't want to get into individual players necessarily but just the way the board is constructed in for instance the the industry mock the fantasy NBA Today industry mock  the I think five one two three four five I think there were seven centers that came off the board in the first four rounds combined which by the way that's quite low for a year where everybody's talking about how many centers there are but then to no one's surprise I think there was something like 12 that came off in the next three rounds so things like that bro now that you've done 30 drafts what sort of draft Ark do you think makes sense this year should folks be trying to Target guard stats early with the exception of a few you know unicorns yolk itch MB guys like that that are obviously gonna go with the top of drafts is there a right or wrong strategy like if you get your bigs early now you don't have to be a part of that run in the middle rounds I know there's so many ways to skin a cat but what feels like this sort of  path of least resistance is the way I'll frame it for this season in terms of how to collect your stats  so I think with like one Center versus two Center League's  I almost find the question someone Irrelevant in the sense that  you still need to win those big man stats categories whether or not you're using them out of a utility slot  or maybe they also qualify a power forward so how its basic roster construction you know I've played in a couple weeks that have zero position requirements and they're just like how about it just started the way you want 10 utility slots and starters and wow exactly and  and that's  one way that's going to cat but it's like  I like position eligibility because I think that  weeds out people you know you can take advantage of it and you know sort of the who works the hardest will win blah blah yeah if you don't have a position eligibility to not really lend itself to hard punting because someone will just take like 14 point guards  if it works yeah maybe yeah it works  I mean that's the key question is is what can you actually pull off you know with that strategy  but yeah I know I think with the center question  it's a fun one because  you kind of have to ask that question at every stage minus like first second third round I think you're at that stage you tick in the player you like kind of maybe that's a question that's a hybrid tiebreaker kind of question say you got four guys are available  that would be on your short list of players you view them all equally one of them as centered eligibility like that's the guy because I want to get the center thing out of the way  another thing there are a lot of gourds out there just flat out there's just a ton of guard stats  I don't want to say that it's like  you can just sit there and wait on it I don't think you can do that I wouldn't say that the problem is that pronounced but there are a lot of guards out there and then necessarily I think the forwards Market is  kind of annually a little bit dry and it's the same situation with forwards and centers is like  okay do I want to get really crushed in either of these areas  and if not okay I gotta take somebody who's lower value than I would have wanted to take you know I'm not winning by three rounds  on the sky  but it gets me out of a problem of having to pick from the bottom of the bucket  later on with these guys and how much do I like the back ends players in those buckets  so you get a cross a player that might alleviate the pressure  in those areas maybe got to take them early  maybe I've got  you know like Drew holiday you know staring me in the face you know at some  very advantageous place to selection selective I got another guard just sitting there waiting and it's like  I don't know if I want to do that because  I I don't want to wait on the players that I consider in the the bottom you know the back end of a bucket  and you just kind of constantly cross reference that  is this player who could solve this need are they reliable you know if I'm gonna take a haircut on this are they reliable are they going to have an upward trajectory or is this like very risky you know and if it was very risky and I didn't like the playoffs take another you know give me another garter forward you know whatever the case may be  that's why this sport is great I mean out of 30 drafts every single one of them has been different  do you oh I didn't say anything yeah no well certain things remain the same every draft has been different do you and this is going to be a hard one I'm trying not to I'm trying my best to ask this question without  putting anything out into the universe first of all people you guys need to go get the B150 if that wasn't immediately evident it is the list that has dominated the industry for what do we at now like 15 years what did you start to be 150 at NBC slash Rotoworld it was just Rotoworld back then  it was 08  no 1,009  so we're 2009 so we're approaching 15 years there are a lot of other top 150 lists floating around out there if anybody wants to know where that started actually was it Evan on the football side  no yeah I was having yeah Evan was the inspiration for it yeah and thank you Evan Evans one of the greatest he's a love those guys over to ER he gets up the OG I just you know what I love about that crew over there they're all the old road crew and even the ones that moved on in the TV and all that everybody just worked their butts off and they just weren't like in it for whatever you know three seconds of YouTube fame or hey we're on YouTube right now oh this is YouTube I thought we were just talking to each other know that is how these usually go I love those guys  and yeah what 150 was an Evan thing and then I was like no I should do one for basketball yeah the first one I looked at it the other day it was so it was like  just the smallest amount of not work but like you know it's just like this rickety thing you looked at your first one  yeah way back in the day oh my God like a list of players can we see a list of players in the night  I wouldn't I do you have it oh my God this would be the most amazing Easter egg ever the first B150  oh I  please dig it up and I will put it at like the very end of a future YouTube video and it'll just be this special prize for anybody who makes it all the way to the end of me yelling into the void for 45 minutes  because that's my existence for the most part okay so what the question I was you don't need to find it right now the question I was going to ask before I realize you want to journey man I know but I like this that I really want to see the first B150 I think that'll be absolutely freaking amazing um so the reason I prefaced it with all this was I don't want to try to get you to say like who the targets are that you're doing at the end folks need to go get the B150 if they want those but do you find that there's a particular category or if you that is easier to get in the very late rounds is steals I think you said was one of them are there others that you feel like you can make up easier at the end of a draft meaning things that you'd need to be more concerned with earlier and middle  personally I'll throw my own you can make up yeah yeah go yeah I was just say personally I found that after you pass  there a couple of interesting Center is that like between 100 and 100 and 110 and 80 people's once you get past those you get into some real boring plot or types which I mean sometimes that can handle it but like you don't want to find yourself in a situation where you need to draft Steven Adams in a non punt free throw team so I found centers to be a really weird position this year because there are ton but between like 40 and 105 and there's just a few at the beginning and like none at the very very end what's that sort of  house that how does that I want to say Ark again but I already used that expression earlier on what is it do you find that's kind of hard to to squeeze out at the very end giggity I think percentages are so funny because so many people just fade percentages in every respect they're like don't care  it's not a thing don't need them whatever you know I'm punting this or player that's you know good in percentages but kind of bad everywhere else like that boy is not worth anything  percentages though as you get to the bot the bottom of your draft and the back of your rosters like players just simply aren't gonna play enough to impact your percentages  so at the end if you're chasing their you're chasing you know you're you're kind of screwed there  but I think the traditional ones are  I mean I think Steels are available and that's that's just that's more of a take on the market itself  but  you know a lot of years threes  are available  late  I've been noticing that they haven't been as available late  this year compared to previous years so I'm more interested in looking at that deeper but it's usually it's the points it's the assists and and typically the blocks so those three things  and you know it's been interesting conversely this year I've been able to find those late hmm more so than previous years they're not there  you know it's not just like sitting there waiting to be had  I mean some years it feels like after like round nine or ten you can't get a point and you can't get an assist yeah just flat out there's a couple of them this year can't do it  yeah you gotta I don't know I mean  you gotta be comfortable going old with a few of those things but nobody nobody wants to walk down that path with me  here you know what man there are a lot of values late I am drafted in to the 220s right now 230 is 240  with guys that are  hitting like a one Thirty One forty one 50 ring guess what's coming up everybody that you get me a perfect segue 30 deep is coming up bro 30 DPS coming up yes that's the Heavy Hitters man oh I'm excited can we uh you know what I'm not excited about is freaking my panda door oh my God he says that tongue in cheek though panda is our has long been our secret weapon here at sports eat those two-time winner in what five years he's destroying that damn league and he beat me in the finals of that he does the best player previews in the industry and it's so not even close yeah it's not close any player preview written anywhere else is never going to be as good as what Panda does so he's just 500 players being and that's why he was 30 deep because the rest of us are dicking around it picked 3040 he's like this is my guy this is my guy this is my guy  he and I share Intel so it's like there's no secrets between the two of us  and it's so it's like it's really fresh I'm sure he has the same thoughts it's like  I just know when Panda's got two picks between me and whoever I go there's two yeah you're not the board yeah you're not gonna get you guys just guaranteed no and we're talking in the context of 30 did you know there are like 30 picks or 50 pics even you know they're gonna happen but between the time you go and you get your next pick and so I mean you know that going into it I'm like  thinking if not for panda  I'm gonna get this player and every single year he just snakes me yeah anyone want to get any wins and then he win yeah  I really thought I had last year too far down that rabbit hole makes me feel sad again that I got to the finals and lots of panda that's coming up that's gonna be fun you've got your I know you don't want to talk about it too much but you've got your big League's coming up this weekend right  yeah yeah high stakes and again literally the draft tracker has opened it up for me to be able to be in more jobs than I've ever been in  so it's exciting  I love it I feel like I've you know you you prepare for a test and you know you're ready and you're not worried about it you just go ahead and take the test you know walk out you just know you did a good job that's a feel right now Andre limos amazing you know just asset for this team in general but working with him on this stuff as discussed in previous shows being able to rely on him for the data entry but also the basketball analysis he and I have been able to bounce all sorts of ideas that we would have just never gotten to if I was doing it on my own and yeah no I feel like every stone has been turned it's good we're ready I love it any other thoughts on helping a novice navigate a draft before we put a little bow on this bad boy  you gotta have a draft tracker I mean that's just outside of that  I would say  if you've got a good list  see if you can invest in some non guards early  because you're going to get good guards no matter what so if you've got a tiebreaker  go with non guards yeah I'm actually inclined to agree because that does sort of fall into what I was saying after pick whatever what did I say 11015 the number of centers is a little tougher at that point but there are I found guards and almost almost all of my  late grabs even ones that people hate old guys young guys the whole thing they all end up being guards and wings at the end so yeah I think I'm think I'm very much on board with that as well frenzy is the wonderful the Magnificent the svelte skinny is all damn hell Aaron bruske on the other end of this thing do you even recognize yourself when you look at the YouTube videos after we've recorded them  no no concerned people  you know they think I've lost too much weight yeah I mean one grandmother do you need me talking with me do you need me to be your Jewish grandmother
