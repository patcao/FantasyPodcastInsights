welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  well guys I've got good news and bad news  good news is  I think my cough is a little bit better  bad news is  the healing process if you can call it that has resulted in some pretty significant laryngitis  so I give you all full permission to laugh at me when my voice cracks like a prepubescent iteration of old man best price that'll be awkward young man best press I think is actually your host today  of fantasy NBA today I am at Dan best person so social media but again I'm going to be keeping my words to the bare minimum on todays two shows  first thing this morning we've got a cell High episode I put together a fun one today for you I think yesterday's Bilo we already saw one player cash in on it and that was Jared Allen I know the Cavaliers game when it over time but he also had foul trouble on away their Alan remember in yesterday's show we talked about him being ranked about 1:15 he's now in the 90s already after a big scoring ball game we know what's going to happen here  he's still only averaging 28 minutes of ballgame when that gets up into the low 30s that's when he pushes his way past that 60 some odd barrier and hopefully you guys were able to make some moves quickly on yesterday's Buy Low list today we've got a cell high list of five names one of them is actually the same as a name from last week and I think we'll have a few of these as we work our way through these types of shows throughout the season because sometimes you can sell high on a guy and sometimes it doesn't kick in immediately  sometimes it does you know we had the Brook Lopez sell or Buy Low last week and that cached itself in very quickly but like for instance JJ kind of didn't so let's see what we've got cute up here on the cell High show again you guys can laugh at my silly voice as we work our way through I'm totally fine with that but we've got shows to do today and so damn it I'm going to do them there's the graphic for those that are joining on YouTube Welcome to folks watching live watching after the fact listening on traditional podcast channels please do take a moment to like And subscribe in whatever fashion you're taking in this podcast you can see here on your screen I wrote the word week five in massive massive font just to get everybody ready for what's coming next which is slightly less massive font and the first sell high on the list is the king  LeBron James who's having an unbelievable start to his season he's right somewhere between 12 and 14 depending on what site you're looking at I think Yahoo had him at 12 last night basketball monster hasn't been 14 yesterday ball game actually probably pushed him down just a little bit because he did not have to play in the fourth quarter of a blowout  but either way  LeBron's been unbelievable so far and he's been largely healthy he played through the leg injury in the game where it happened and then didn't even miss a Beat  think he's played in all fourteen to the Lakers game so far  Anthony Davis has two oddly enough but I don't know he came out part way through a ball game and then sort of wasn't in self in the next one but we're talking about LeBron right now LeBron is averaging 25 and a half points so far this year uh 25.7 2.33 pointers 8 rebounds 6.6 assists 1.6 steals 0.7 blocks on 59% from the field 70% of the free-throw line and four turnovers per ball game and I know what you guys are thinking when you look at those numbers none of those numbers feels all that unsustainable for LeBron when you compare it to other Seasons he's had in his career in fact it's actually lower scoring then each of the last two seasons in LA  the main reason to consider LeBron a sell high is because this is the best percentage he has shot from the field  or three-point land  well in three-point ladies having the best season of his entire career from the field actually this is all the best season he's had is it in his entire career if that number were to stick  the closest he got was his final season in Miami where he shot 56.7% from the floor so 2% points higher than that and the best 3-point shooting gear he had in his career was the year before that in Miami in 2012 where he shot 40 and a half percent on 3.33 per ball game that's significant because right now those seasons in Miami it's important to note that he was taking 17 and a half to 18 shots per game and only three and a half to four of those were from three-point land this year he's taking 16 and a half shots per ballgame which by the way that's the lowest number for LeBron  in his career  yeah let that sink in for a minute  and of those 16 and a half shots five and a half of them are from three-point land  so right now and look I get it LeBron is a Powerhouse near the rim he's always gonna have a very high 2 point field goal percentage but right now everything is just very very high  and this is not me  trying to double down on what might be a bad take it does seem like LeBron from an efficiency standpoint might just be a little bit better this year perhaps because he has some folks on his team that can help him a little bit but we also have to realize that because he's actually doing less than at any point in his unbelievable basketball career  the numbers will eventually reflect that  and you could say oh Dan I think it's free throw numbers gonna come back up but we can't really Bank on that because he said plenty of Seasons where he's shot around 70% at the foul line he's had plenty where he shot 7374 78 70 or 66 so it bounces around for a minute it has throughout his career the one thing with these percentages we just  like the chances of him going up to 59% after not being really anywhere near that for a decade is so unbelievably slim that we have to fade this notion  his minutes are also down much as we may like to laugh about the fact that he had to play 40 minutes in an overtime game and he played 40 minutes and in a win earlier this year  they're trying not to play him in the fourth quarter basically anytime the Lakers have a substantial lead or substantial deficit if a deficit he'll play the beginning of the fourth quarter or if they make no Headway they'll get him out if it's a big lead like yesterday they're going to try everything in their power and not have to put him back on the court and it worked you know yesterday he played only 24 minutes I think about the blog went over Memphis he only played 23 minutes  LeBron's rotation's  if you look at the way the lake Lakers bringing him in and out of a ball game actually lend themselves to him being  having a lower minute count then the other stars on the team  folks picture this nightmare scenario you're hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of beer Wine and Spirits then get them delivered right to your watch party compare prices across multiple stores in your area find the best deals on Game Day drinks and get back to armchair quarterbacking from you guessed it  your armchair  download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's d r i z l y.com today must be 2001 plus not available in all locations  and whatever you definition you want to use for stars is fine but because LeBron's to come out at about the six minute Mark of the first and third quarters and then come back in either right at the very end of that quarter or at the beginning of the second quarter depending on you know when they actual game breaking is he doesn't he starts the fourth quarter on the floor and so if the game is a blowout  they're just not gonna put him back out there to start the fourth  and that's what you got yesterday so Anthony Davis got 29 minutes because he typically plays the entire third quarter or up until the last like minute and a half of it that's why his number was a bit higher LeBron's rotations are designed to keep him off the court in the fourth quarter if at all possible  and so when you roll all of that together I like to say when you roll it all into one burrito  the stuff with LeBron like 26 points per game is going to come down when the efficiency starts to come down  one point six steals is the biggest number he's had since 2014 that's a number that's likely to come down maybe not as low as last year where he had a career low point nine but it's likely to come down to something like one point three the way it has been in the past and we can say well you know he's he has gotten to one point six one point seven before you know when he did that when he was playing 38 minutes a game in Miami and Cleveland  since his minutes have been in a little bit more check the steals number has been down at one point two one point three so I expect that to drop blocks is probably sustainable for him this is pretty close to where he's been throughout his career at points seven turnovers in the high threes feels normal and just like not having the basketball to start to play as much as he does right now means the assists are probably going to be in the sixes this year so what does that mean you should be looking for and that's a long explanation as for a guy who said he was going to try to budget his words well  I think if you can get somebody back in the top 20 you do it  and I think LeBron has a big enough name where you can probably get someone back in the top 20  someone maybe more sustainable in the top 20  who might that be Kyrie Irving is number 24 right now he's someone that's going to climb the board as the field goal percent continues to tick up and frankly as everybody else starts to slow down if his stuff stays somewhat constant I think you'll see him slowly inches way up the board  you might be able to get lamelo ball I don't know if you want Carla Anthony towns he's those guys are 26 and 27 probably attainable maybe you're going a little too far back  Lowry and in is right next to LeBron in the ranking he's someone you might be able to grab do I think bam out of Bio is likely to take a small step back maybe in blocks but you could probably get bam you might be able to get Scotty Barnes now that he's sort of slumping a little bit  think about what you can lock in now if the best thing that someone's gonna give you back is you know a Dr and fox who I also have as a cell High guy that maybe that's not the path maybe you just ride out the LeBron thing but there are a number of players around him I believe on the board that will stay ahead of him as the season goes and then again with these trades you just trying to lock in a little bit lock it a little bit of value  and go from there  next player on the list who I just mentioned is drn Fox he's currently ranked number 18 in nine cat and our Target for someone coming back in a deer and Fox Trade is anybody inside the top 24 so I don't think you're going to be able to aim quite as high as LeBron because Fox is coming off a bad ball game and all I feel like people maybe don't fully trust that he's this good yet  and to foxes credit he is extraordinarily good at basketball  but we all have to be acutely aware of the fact that he's more than doubled his three-point or output at any point in his career previously he shooting  as good as he ever has from the three-point line he's also taking 22 shots a game which is three more than he has ever done in the past even though his minutes have stayed pretty much exactly the same and that's reflected in the rebounds and the assists pretty much being the same as they have been  also with Fox and I guess this may be at sticks but his steals are extraordinarily high so far this year at one point eight per ball game that's a number we expect to drop off a little bit as well and when you roll it all together again you were rolling this up again you expect the three-pointers to dip like how can you possibly take nine three pointers a game and keep his field goal percent as high as it is right now  all of these numbers seem likely to dip field goal percent number of three-pointers per game  steals is likely to dip turnovers are actually extraordinarily low right now for the RN Fox so those might actually tick up in the wrong direction he's having an unbelievable year but I don't think he's gonna stay inside the top 20 and so if you can get somebody maybe a half round behind him like some of these guys we were just talking about a band out of Bio a Kyrie Irving I don't think you're gonna get lamelo but if you could get cat I would if you could get someone like a kawaii letter it might be worthwhile who's a little bit of Lilo right now probably not going to be able to get Damian Lillard but you could throw it out there and just see what happens  maybe you could even get a Jimmy Butler in that mix these are all reasonable targets and like with Butler the thing right now is that is a sister really low figure those will probably continue to slowly work their way up the board but these are guys that I would consider offering up Darren Fox 4 who I think they slowly kind of passed one another and I think you ought to be able to do it because he's put up some very big numbers so far this year  third name on the board is Herb Jones he's the repeat offender on this list but you know what when he's been good for another week that actually means that you are getting closer to being able to cash in on him we talked the last Thursday with Josh Lloyd on the show about what you could get for her and he was like honestly I don't know that you're gonna be able to get much for him because people don't trust that this is what he does now  and that is probably still the case but slightly less so  because every week that her continues to smash is a week of proof for people who didn't think he was going to be able to sustain it  question is of course how long before people fully Buy in right now he's a 12 points basically I'm rounding up two steals one point six blocks four point three boards and about three assists per ball game on a career best 51.8 percent from the field career best 88% at the free throw line and he's getting there more often than he has in the past it just doesn't seem like all of this stuff is likely to stick especially when you consider the fact that almost half of his field goal attempts are from three-point land right now he's making almost every two pointer he takes he's 2.8 if you want to do the math 2.8 out of 4.4 from 2-point land so far this year everything is way way up and if you compare it to earlier season or earlier career numbers the Steels I mean maybe he could be a two steal a game guy we know he's one of the best defensive players in the NBA the blocks of more than doubled any previous season so that number seems very likely to come down along with field goal percent  along with free throw percent but and maybe a Cisco come down a little bit as well but that one's definitely not locked in stone  yes losing a block per game or point eight blocks per game that does make a pretty damn big difference for him and the field goal and all that stuff kind of going the wrong direction but what he has shown so far this year is that he's going to be a playable fantasy asset  so I think you should be targeting somebody in the 50 range or above  even if we think herb Jones dips just beyond that the thing is I don't know so herb is the I don't know guy on this board today I don't know if you're gonna be able to get a top 50 guy back and if you can't then I think I would probably just keep riding her because at that point it's better to roll the dice see if he continues to go at this clip for another week and maybe we'll talk about him again a week from today and say okay well now you can aim for 50 or higher because people are gonna be are gonna believe it a little bit more  before we get to the next name on the board want to remind everybody again to please do take 10 seconds to go subscribe to iTunes Spotify or our YouTube page it is very important that's the big thing here you know the more you guys hit that button the more we can continue to invest time and resources into putting these shows out and information it's also fun frankly on my end to see the number tick up little by little every day so scroll on down hit that button make sure you like the page on your way out as well and come find me over on social media at Dan best price or just Google search Dan from Sports ethos and the Twitter feed should pop up right near the top  next name on the board is a new one for this week but I have talked about it on the podcast before that's the owners who is currently ranked right around 40 depending I get on what board you're looking at you might be slightly in front slightly behind I think basketball monster hasn't been 39 and Yahoo hasn't met 41 or 42 well there's a lot going on with him that doesn't feel like he can keep it rolling  we've always known that JV can be a pretty decent fantasy contributor without a truckload of minutes he was able to do that in Toronto long before he moved to Memphis where he started to put up the really obscene numbers but like if you go all the way back to the Toronto days he was playing about the number of minutes he's playing right now in New Orleans which is about 25 26 minutes per ballgame and he's putting up 13 and 9 with 0.4 Steals and you know 1.1 blocks or whatever it was on Mid 50% shooting and all of that is pretty darn close to what he's doing right now with one very obvious exception he is at a career best 1.7 blocks per game the only time he ever got close to that was to that was in a 19 game stretch right after he got traded to Memphis in 2018 when he was given carte blanche to be the whole offense took 15 shots a game and he played 28 minutes at night and he scored 20 points with 11 rebounds over that month and a half post trade deadline and he blocked one point six shots because he was just going buck  wild wild  anytime he's been in this 25 minute range anytime an entire season he's been a part of his highs been one point three so it would be pretty astounding to see him suddenly jump up by almost half a block over his career Mark especially when you consider that the minutes are not up  and frankly might Trend down depending on the health of Someone Like A Larry Nance who's due back Trey Murphy's do back Zion is Miss games here and there and that's helped Valentine's as well CJ McCollum being out is actually helped Valentine's because they've needed a little more offense in his stead I think we can expect jv's minutes to probably Trend down from 25 down towards 23 or 24 and I think we can pretty safely assume that the blocks are going down from one point seven where I was wrong was to assume that he'd be outside the top 100 I think JV has found that gear again that he had back in his Toronto days where he can put up you know top 70 to top 100 value in 25 minutes a game but top 40 is asking too much so if you're going to sell on Valentine's you want to aim for somebody in the 65 Ranger higher because I expect him to dip into the 70 80 90 100% And you'll want to try to lock in a little bit of value above that with a lot of factors that are pointed towards him going the wrong direction and if you want to take a look at a few examples in there of somebody near 65 that might be worth trying to get with him Nicola is interesting I don't think you'd be able to get mikal Bridges but he's down right now because of the low steals count so far this year who else is in there you probably could get an injured Jalen Duren although you might be asking for trouble there nurk is a possibility Clint capela is a possibility I don't think you could get Freddie Van Glee but if you could I would definitely try to go get him as sort of a miniature by low a lot of really interesting names you could try to pry away from somebody with Otis Valencia I would suggest you do it and here is our final name on today's show before I go rest my voice for a couple of hours Kyle kuzma I mean yelling about this one on the Regular Show for all a long time and I've been yelling about it on Twitter and so now I'll put him on his own actual moment here in the cell High show he's number 76 and 9 cap at the beauty of Kyle kuzma is that you probably don't need to trade for to get someone back that's lower than him  people are going to want kuzma because he's taking 20 shots of ball game  he's scoring is high that's what people look at so you can use his high points total to go get yourself somebody ranked and nearby that probably doesn't score as much but has a much better future over the course of this year  and that's not to say that kuzma is going to do less as the season goes on in fact this may just very well be his job from now until the end of the season but what we do know about kuzma is number one the shooting is above where it's ever been he's at 47 and a half percent career 45% shooter you expect that to come back down especially with the exceed exceedingly high volume  free throws are much higher than he's been at any point in his career and I get it sometimes guys get better at these things but for someone like kuzma who's been in the NBA for what almost a decade now a little less than that I guess these things don't just both fix themselves in one offseason  the other stuff with him is all pretty sustainable you might see the turnovers come up a little because he has handling the basketball so much special coming off of that 13 assists game the minutes I don't know what to do with those Washington so bad I mean maybe they tick up the tiniest bit but I wouldn't worry about it because the usage is as high as it's ever been the thing is here  because there's so much volume involved in what he's doing any slippage on percentages hurts his ranking a lot  remember he started the year shooting 49 50/50 one percent and that's when he was like a top 50 guy it's come down two to three percentage points and that slipped him all the way to the mid-70s late 70s that's where he is now another percentage point he slips another 15-20 slots it just doesn't take that much to move him  so the nice part about kuzma is that you don't have to aim low when you're trying to get somebody back Jalen Williams is ranked 87th right now I know he's dealing with a hip injury but that to me would be a wonderful Bi-Lo sell High pairing if you could pull it off Brandon Ingram is probably a slightly safer not that dissimilar version of Kyle kuzma you could try to aim just a couple slots in front of him and get someone like a Keegan Murray who's only shooting 30% and as basically nowhere to go but up the rest of this year D'Angelo Russell feels like he's pretty locked in the 60s and 70s this season that's someone that's probably pretty safely there let's see who else is nearby I don't know if I go for his teammate Daniel Gafford the minutes have been two up and down Mitchell Robinson who yeah he's gonna kill your free throw percent but he's been on his way up since the field goal percent finally came around you might be able to aim even higher you might be able to get somebody we just talked about vouch a minute ago you might be able to get voucher if somebody's afraid about of  Chicago blowing things up you could probably get I don't think I'd go for John Collins because I feel like he'll slip one Walker Kessler comes back but I don't know if he slips as far as kuzma does so maybe John Collins that'd be a pretty easy one to get I think I'd work my way down to him on the board maybe a Michael Porter Jr since he's been slowing down but likely we see the free-throw field goal percents come up for mpj a lot of options you could attack with kuzma because he's scoring is so high he's a great sell High because his points are big that gives you an opportunity to trade for somebody that is  near possibly even above his rank because everybody over values points  all right folks thanks for bearing with me with my laryngitis version of our cell High show today I think we're yeah we're at the end of the line here now so I'm gonna put my face back on the board I'm not gonna be taking questions in this one I'll try to take a few questions in our daily recap show that's coming up in probably about two hours or so thank you
