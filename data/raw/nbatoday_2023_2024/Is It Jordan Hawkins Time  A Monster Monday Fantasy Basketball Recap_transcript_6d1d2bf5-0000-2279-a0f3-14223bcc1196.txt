welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I told you it's a two for Tuesday and make you wait very long between episodes welcome to episode 2 on this delightful  Tuesday morning  back to back  we did our first Buy Low sell High show earlier today with Raphael Johnson that was fun hopefully we can do some more of those as the season progresses this is our Monday recap show I'd like to say it's a Tuesday look ahead show but there are no games tonight  it's election day in a lot of spots I didn't get any ballot so I guess it's not election day for me  but hey go vote if you're in an area where there's a vote happening right now  and NBA taking this first Tuesday off in November and you will I think is actually a really good idea  let's go  I think it's cool honestly I think everybody should have election day off but we'll see  doesn't seem that's crazy like you have to try to wedge it in around all the other crap that you're trying to do on a given day  I don't care your background who you're voting for whatever  have the day off  look at all these other random days off during the year why not this one where there's an actual like directed thing to do  well the NBA did it but like you for us we got a whole lot of Monday recap stuff to go over like a lot a lot it was a very big Monday  forget big Wednesday big Wednesday is so 2000 and 2020 oh wait sorry I'm you're telling me what now what's that fake producer that does not exist talking in my ear there are 14 games tomorrow  oh okay so Wednesday still big okay Roger that so there were only 12 games on Monday but we're gonna go over them welcome to the show again this is fantasy NBA Today Show two of two I am at Dan best persons  that's the my location if where are you at I am at here Dan best briefs d a n b e s b r i s over on social media I expect you all will find me over there because I am a bit of an addict social media is so damn important for fantasy basketball players so important because like legitimately while we're on air on most of these shows news is breaking about what players are out and for how long there's there's just there's no time where NBA news isn't happening and yeah I mean like this morning sure I'm doing back-to-back podcast so yeah as news breaks over the last two hours I can just say it I can repeat it all to you but then I'm off air for 20 some odd hours where how am I gonna get you guys the information I need to get you  that's over on social so definitely come find me over there if you don't want to follow 15,000 different people don't because it's a hellscape but at Dan best person at ethos fantasy BK to follow the sports ethos news feed I'm so quickly here at the front end I keep forgetting to do this like early in the show I want to make sure that I get these thoughts to you I'm throwing the Discord Link in the chat room here early popping that up on screen for folks that are watching on YouTube it is a good one in the description I made sure of that this time please do come join us in Discord um there are awesome premium services in there for folks that have a fantasy past if you just are a free sports ethos user there's some really nice just general NBA chatter going on especially as we add you know 15 20 30 people to the Discord every day it just becomes more and more populated with folks who want to talk about fantasy basketball and a cool thing that I've seen people do is when they ask a question for even on the free side they'll put two emojis basically for voting on it and they'll get you know nine ten fifteen twenty replies to it have just other people that are cruising through there and you can kind of crowdsource some of your fantasy questions so really cool a lot of really good ways to use that I hope that we will see some of you over there  but let's not waste too much time on all this other stuff it's not a waste Dan what are you talking about it's very very useful time spent but let's not spend any more waste or not waste not want not let's talk about fantasy basketball we're going to Dive Right on into it  we'll see how long it takes us to get through this thing you know the funny thing is and this is like I don't know if you guys remember this this Conan O'Brien bit but at the end of it or beginning of every show he would always say we got a great show for you guys today and then he'd sometimes turn if he had Andy Richter on at that point or sometimes he was solo he turned to a producer and say something like I have to say that  it's I like the bit I thought it was funny um that's kind of how I feel about this one like it was a 12-game Monday but they were only like two or three things mixed in to all those 24 teams that played so what we're gonna try to do on today's show I'm not gonna cover every damn name on the board that's just that's too much to do too many names we're gonna stick to the  valuation changes okay  so bear with me on that if you have questions you can throw them in the chat room I'll try to lightning around our way through those at the end of the show but let's go over some of the changes that emerged from yesterday's card change number one on the Washington Philadelphia side Philly beat Washington by 18 wizard are really really bad they shot 51% by the way and and lost by 18 because I had to look this up the six are shot 56% Deni avdija another solid ball game he's been better than I expected I'm still not like what you'd call it a true of the believer but he's very much good enough to be rostered and played right now Daniel Gafford was someone that we had talked about on the show as as somebody who you we really hadn't seen play normal minutes in a basketball game yet and he finally got them and he posted a really really strong Game 12 points 7 boards five blocks eventually Joel embiid him up but Gafford started strong and you know it's kind of performance that's gonna earn in more play he was a minus 4  so it was tyus Jones so was Kyle kuzma  so was Jordan Poole actually the starting lineup for wizards wasn't that bad in this one it was a lot of the bench weird configuration that we're getting spanked  and you know ended up being enough to take care of them but we did finally see a lot of the Wizards crack 30 minutes  praise the lord we finally got there and so then you got a slightly better game out of Jordan Poole who's Mas actually been quite good so far is Jones 12 points six to assist couple of steals a couple of Threes that's kind of the lines your hunting for with him hopefully he makes more than whatever it was five out of his 13 shots but overall that seems totally fine a Philly side the only notable things here at the Anthony Melton still at just 26 minutes that's a number that we really need to see get higher  I thought for sure he'd be locked into 28 but he's not even at 27 on the season he's shooting horribly a 32 and a half percent 67 at the free throw line those are things that are going to come up for him so he's not gonna stay as bad as he has been but I'll tell you right now in this Philly construct 25 26 minutes that's not gonna be enough for Melton he needs 28 so if he doesn't get there that's what we start to think about making a move but I'm gonna give it a little bit longer  also notable Nic Batum  17 brilliant minutes off the bench he was a plus 30 in his 17 and a half bench minutes  does that mean he's going to play a bunch I doubt it because his body can't handle that but what it did do was it rendered Kelly oubre so what obsolete yesterday Uber only 26 and a half minutes only five shots was really the key there he just he they didn't need him gunning hold on to Aubrey let's give this at least another week week and a half to see how it goes same story for DeAnthony Melton and then no other Real Surprises there Dallas bet Orlando 117 102 Mavs are off to a really good start this year I I admit I didn't have a good feel for the Mavericks coming into this season that's a team that from us a betting standpoint I pretty much always stay away from but they've looked good so far and the Kyrie Luka connection has been solid both guys posted solid games here Kyrie 10 assists he's facilitating more than expected people are complaining about Kyrie and I think he's ranked in the 20s right now like it's been a kind of a lackluster start because his shots aren't falling free throw or field when they do life gets really easy for him let's just like otherwise  I didn't expect eight assists a game well anyway Tim Hardaway Jr hit four more three-pointers at some point the bottom is gonna fall out on this one but it has an app and yet so you can hang on for dear life if you like Grant Williams not as good in this one he missed some free throws but overall kind of the same stuff which has I don't know why I said it with kind of a sad tone to my voice he's number 83 in nine cat right now and as long as he's ranked there he belongs on a team I know I know you guys are all wondering what the hell happened with Derek Lively 5,016 minutes that's kind of tough to overcome still was okay  it gave Dwight Powell some breathing room I think typically here with maxi kleeba out Lively's the guy they want in the mid-to-high 20s and minutes he's a hold Lively's a hold  on the Orlando side we came into this ball game wandering if Goga batsy or Mo vogner was gonna win the center and its battle with the note I said it on yesterday's podcast that this may end up just kind of a timeshare and that's exactly what it was yesterday Wagner 26 minutes to Batson's 22 previous game go go got the high twenties mole was it 19 or 20 and I do think that it could flip on a game to game basis  the faster stats set pileup guy between the two that was very poorly phrased by me is Wagner  Mo 19 points 5 boards a steal a 3-pointer in 26 minutes if he's seen 24 25 minutes he probably gets near the top 100 right now it looks like neither one of them belongs on a fantasy team though  because if they're really splitting it right down the middle that means neither one has any real upside markelle fultz was out for another ballgame as was Gary Harris so that allowed Cole Anthony some room to get loose for 19 points 5 assists to steal a couple of blocks good ballgame for coal I still have this weird fantasy crush on Jalen Suggs he only played 24 minutes here because his shot wasn't dropping and he was turning the ball over willy-nilly is the term I will use on today's show but he did have 10 points for boards 7 assists a three a steal and a block there's this  there's this outline of fantasy value with Suggs that we can't quite fill in with  broad glistening delightful colors because  he shooting 36% from the field but he's also averaging two and a half to defensive stats over five boards and over three assists from the off guard spot  I just I can't quit him yet even though I know I probably should I can't quit him  because when you can get boards assists steals blocks and up to this point free throw percent  and the only thing that's been missing is the field goal percent which would then drive points up as well it just it all feels like it's too close for me to let go of so we're going to hold on to Suggs a little bit longer and see what happens even if it turns out that it is a urine down the leg  Indiana blew out San Antonio you can pretty much just dump this box score don't read too much into either side of it Zach Collins probably a little bit of a buy low because it's free throw percent is weirdly terrible to this point as it are his turnovers weirdly High  on the Indie side I mean this is like oh what if somebody got 25 minutes in the front Court  not Myles Turner he only needed 21 of this blow out I was talking about oh we topping you got 27 someone came in and it was like Dan Rick Carlo's gonna give Obi top and 27 minutes I would put him on the add block immediately but we know it's not going to happen in so we move on to the next one  Whispering as I do so because it's super annoying Warriors beat the Pistons won 2009 Golden State six and two to start their year they were another team that if you go all the way back to July they were on my list of season win total over bats because I felt like they had a chip on their shoulder this was sort of like a Warrior's I don't call last hurray because Steph Curry still looks like he's in his prime but it's a little bit of a last Rock because you know I don't what's gonna happen with Klay Thompson age um negative press and they actually have a little bit of depth this year specifically Gary Payton the second he's he's critical for them off the bench and they've needed it because Andrew Wiggins has turned straight up into a pumpkin  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you your Force to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can

that's drizly.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  he remains a Bi-Lo and he remains a guy I don't want on my fantasy team both of those things are true meaning if you can go get him for like a waiver wire crapper you probably do it and you leave them on your bench until he gets hot and then you try to move him somewhere else that's the only thing I would do with Wiggins otherwise avoid  Chris Paul 176 he only play 21 minutes but again this game was well in Hand of the staff was the only Warrior starter to clear 30 minutes  I'm not even really sure why that happened I think it has to do with his minute pattern like his substitution pattern because nobody else did dream on 27 clay 28 they didn't need it  what I did like was finally seeing Chris Paul see a few shots go in that hadn't really happened to this point he still shooting just 36% on the season though and so you gotta feel that his numbers will Trend upward a little bit I remain somewhat concerned about how he and Draymond Green coexist as guys who want to be the facilitators probably have to see Chris Paul take a few more shots maybe this is more of like the Houston area Chris Paul where he's playing off of a guy like hardened there and off of Steph and off of Dre in this spot but they find ways to have him run the second unit and so when the second unit is playing okay Chris Paul will rack up some numbers pretty quick against other teams second units  over on the Detroit Side Kelly and Hayes had a big ball game but I very much don't care so Thompson's been incredible so far I'm blown away at how fast he's acclimated to the NBA and congratulations if he was one of the late rookie Flyers you took a shot on he's he's amazing Isaiah Stewart 17 and 11 and not surprisingly happened in a game with no Jalen Duren  so do you stream Stuart when Duran's out maybe otherwise he's not a play Marvin Bagley all so kind of a do you stream this guy probably not and then Cade Cunningham at five more turnovers that number is outrageously High I never thought he was gonna be a top 30 guy and nine cat this season you guys can go to all my season run up podcasts as Kate a guy that I was not drafting where he was going I thought he was going way too early but also he's not gonna be you know 190 range which is where he's at in nine cat right now that's the number that's gonna work its way up the board  question is what would it take to get him  and I think it would still be too expensive  Marcus Sasser 33 minutes he kind of came back down to earth I do think the returns of Jade and Ivy and Alec Burks kind of screws up the Marcus Sasser experience we've seen lately  and if you want to add him  understanding your probably then gonna drop him  I don't know I don't think we need to worry about it  Harden's first game with the Clippers went about as you'd expect when a team jams a whole bunch of Miss Matched pieces together on day one which was that some guys played all right some guys played terribly  the thing that no one ever thinks about when you're incorporating a key piece that's going to play Big minutes and have high usage is how is it going to impact the defense and that was a big time problem for the Clippers yesterday they had issues rebounding in a huge way Mitchell Robinson he has like the most offensive rebounds through two weeks for anybody in the NBA for like 20 or 30 years or something like that I mean he just annihilated them on the glass  and for the Clippers you know Harden  was efficient Kawaii was efficient Paul George was not Russ was and you're just gonna see issues 22 turnovers has to be the number that jumps out at you and that's gonna be a number that is probably somewhat high for the near future  and not just for heart because all of these guys are trying to figure out okay where is James gonna be how where are the body's gonna go who's running the offense are we taking turns is it hard and running pick and roll and getting it to the rest of us  they have a lot of stuff to work out  it's going to get better but it's going to be a little bit weird while they're on the way there which in my eyes means after about a week of this which I think you'll see a week of this you know they might have a game in there where Kawaii explodes or Paul George explosives or something like that but about a week of this you'll probably able to buy on hardened Kauai and Paul George so get ready remember I said it on November the 7th that in a week whatever it is we can have two weeks you'll probably gonna be able to get discount on some of the stars on the Clippers and when we get to that point let's be ready to jump at it Nick's side Josh Hart 32 bench minutes yay thank goodness oh my gosh we really needed that I know Quentin Grimes only played 21 and quickly only 20 so there's no guarantee that heart's gonna get 32 minutes every game but the fact that we now saw him clear 30 minutes off the bench and the Knicks were not surprisingly good when he was on the court let's hope that this solves whatever that BS was to start the year where he was only playing you know 24 25 minutes because 30 plus for Josh Hart makes him a must add must play guy  there's one of your little gold stars for the afternoon go ahead and make sure Josh Hart is not dropped to your waiver wire  the Lakers right back into injury hell and it only took two weeks to get their Anthony Davis left with a groin spasm I don't  without making any Luray jokes maybe it's time to do a manscaped ad read here hey and Anthony perhaps

definitely trim fingernails sitting at my desk and I actually trimmed this nail last night right as I was going to bed  anyway that's called the shears I believe 20% off free shipping ethos 2-0 so anyway Anthony Davis had a groin spasm  tried to play through it it went very poorly and that was really the stretch where the heat opened up a lead  the Lakers also could not stop yelling at refs and I get it the game was not particularly well officiated but like d low you can't get ejected that was too freepoint I think the Lakers gave four points to the heat on technical fouls alone from arguing LeBron got one or maybe that was a delay of game or the second delay of either way like  they were all get and that ended up being the difference in the damn ball game  Lakers rebounded a little bit better in this one not great bam had 20 and certainly once Anthony Davis was out that didn't get any better but from a fantasy standpoint you kind of like when a team doesn't have many players available because Austin Reeves had to play 40 minutes LeBron had to play 37 this is awful for him long term but certainly good right now fantasy wise Tori and Prince played 34 and a half D-Lo is a 29 before he got tossed he was gonna get to about 36 Christian Wood played 30 cam reddish played 29 I mean they had nobody left what's Dilo got ejected and Anthony Davis lost the Lakers were running a six-man rotation in this game  great for Fantasy very bad long-term for that club hopefully they get somebody back if they don't Austin Reeves is going to be huge they play again tomorrow in Houston if I remembering that right LeBron's going to have to be huge ads hoping to be back for that ball game but we'll see I mean Prince you can stream would you can play DLo you can play pretty much anybody that's available maybe not Max Christie or camera reddish but almost anybody that's available you know they're gonna get almost 30 minutes because you know Ruiz out and gave Vincent's out and jaxson Hayes is out and add might be out and who am I forgetting has like two other guys that are all ready for that team as far as the heat go Jimmy Butler had kind of a wake up game you knew it would happen against La he's up to number 38 in nine cat now doesn't mean this is what you can do early in the season with one big ball game at a bios Gigantor game moved him up the board a little bit he's up to number 92 off of every a very slow start to the season Tyler Hero has been solid and I don't know that anybody else really deserves your time in Miami Duncan Robinson 3. streamer but that's it  I had outside hopes of Josh Richardson carving out a role for himself because Kyle Lowry is not good at basketball anymore but also Josh Richardson it's not really good at basketball anymore  let's keep going we got a long way to go still Milwaukee beat Brooklyn 129125 Milwaukee tried to use drop coverage on defense so we talked about that worked really well in our last ball game and Brooklyn just went to work with a whole bunch of mid-range shots and sort of forced to Milwaukee to abandon that that's why Brooke Lopez didn't have a particularly good ball game here so don't read too much into that schematically this just didn't work for the bucks on the net side big game for cam Thomas he's just rolling right now McHale Bridges had a nice ball game Royce O'Neill had a pretty good ball game in 25 minutes off the bench but he's more streamer level while everybody other than Nick Claxton is healthy Dorian Finney Smith had a colder shooting game but still got a three-pointer six boards a steel block he remains a solid fill-in Ben Simmons a classic Ben Simmons game two points 15 rebounds for assists no defensive stats someone in the chat room was asking where is defensive stats went and I I just think it's the speed for him  I don't think he has the speed he used to so as fun as it feels like it's been for Ben Simmons he's actually ranked outside the top 100 right now mostly because he hasn't had defensive stats if he could get the steal rate up a little bit he'd shoot inside the top 100 all so maybe make you know more than a quarter of your foul shots but you know well we'll see how that all shakes out  Spencer Dinwiddie really bad ball game  I didn't draft him anywhere because he needs a ton of usage to be a fantasy asset and it just didn't seem like he was going to have that this year but he's also shooting 43% of the foul line so life will probably get a little bit better I don't think he's a nine cat 12 team this year for whatever that's worth I just don't think so Sacramento got blown out by the Rockettes you can throw this box score right in the garbage Chute because nobody did anything on the king's side they all were terrible for the Rockets I'll print shengwen nearly tripled his defensive stats have been kind of strangely low so far but you certainly can't complain about the assist numbers to this point Jalen green had a rare efficient ball game so he put up a pretty good one and then everybody else didn't really have to do very much so again Move Along  Boston lost in overtime the Timberwolves Timberwolves ladies and gentlemen you may remember I had them as an over bet back in July the receipts are there ladies and germs I thought the wolves are going to be good this year and honestly they've been better than I expected so far they've won three in a row  have not won on the road yet so we'll see if that comes around but fantasy wise nasri he's a goal all systems go right now he's getting 25 minutes a game he can put up really nice numbers in those 25 cat fouled out of this one so that helped Nas a little bit but he's doing it and I don't care about the whatever's going on around it Mike Conley fine enough didn't do very much in this ball game but he's a whole Kyle Anderson slowed down after having one better ball game and he's gonna be oh I'm a little worried that slow most gonna be someone who kind of bounces in and out of the top 100 all year probably settles into streamer mode if I had to guess but you know if you want to hold on a little bit longer and find out I'm okay with that it just sort of feels like that's what slow mo is going to be this season Al Horford filling in for Derek white played 36 minutes and did very little in them all he was a plus seven in the minutes he was on the floor and a game they lost by five so six of one half dozen  I think  I think you can probably stream Horford when any one starter is out for the Celtics you know  regardless of this  crummy line  he just does a little bit of all things and so to me that feels like something you could probably utilize if you want to go back to the Minnesota side Jayden McDaniel said 20 points on 18 shotts the problem with McDaniels and I at  he's gonna be better in reality than he is in fantasy because he can get you some threes you can get you some Steals and get some blocks  he doesn't score reliably he doesn't rebound or a sister reliably and his percentages aren't a good enough to float you in anything so like we all just wish that somehow he'd be cut loose to do other stuff but it's just not gonna happen on a team with Anthony Edwards cat gobert  there aren't so that and Conley frankly and slo-mo so they're just aren't rebounds or assists or shots for him most ball games there was in this one but  that's a one-off  I love having him in 30 deep because I got him at like pick 140 there so that's gonna pan out great for me but  nine cat 12 team  how about that Jalen Johnson huh and I would land a lost this game but who cares 13 and 12 5 assists three steals in a block he's been a revelation  so dick Bae was also very good Off the Bench so both those guys are still hold DeAndre Hunter I think we can probably move on from the Heat or the the  heater has ended  so Hunter back to stream level and he's on a cold streak right now  Thunder nothing really of no lewd had a big ball game but we know enough about his Fantasy game to know that that's just not gonna last all season Shake came back early from his injury he was originally listed as out and then ended up playing a great  oh man did the Bulls need this blowout win Kobe White had a better ball game but you know who cares  not me he's number 184 after a good ball game usually after somebody has a good one you hope that they get to like a level you're like oh maybe I'll meet know  no that's the bull side literally the only thing I wanted to mention on the bull side Utah  I'm gonna say it again  and I'm gonna repeat it until people stop arguing with me about it  what's he gonna say  he's gonna say Taylor Horton Tucker and Jordan Clarkson are not nine cat 12 team players  I don't care how specialized you need your team to be  they do more damage than good on a night tonight basis  THC you need to be punting both percentages for him to get it near the top 100  Jordan Clarkson you didn't need to punting like half of the categories for him to get near the top one hundred  they're not nine cat 12 teams  people keep arguing with me oh I need Clarkson for know you don't I had Jordan Clarkson in the League last year a roto League  and I was like languishing in fifth place I dropped Jordan Clarkson to my team immediately started climbing the ranks because I gained points in field goal percent and I basically didn't lose anywhere  and he's much worse this season so far you know some of that's going to come around for him like he's gonna have some games where he shoots the ball better but when the dust settles it's not going to be good enough  you know who likely will be good enough when the dust settles  Walker Kessler who pushed himself up to number one 45 with this positive showing  we just need more minutes we just need him to get to those starters minutes on a game to game basis and everything will be totally fine  and I do think it's going to come around buying now after 15 15 and 4 is going to be a whole heck of a lot tougher than buying on Kessler before this ball game but I still think you can get him someone on the cheap and I would say go for it  and the last game of the night probably had the most interesting fantasy note of the entire evening and that was Jordan Hawkins who put up 31 points on 19 shots in the first game without CJ McCollum it was a loss so grain of salt but it was also a loss at the hands of the fighting Nicola yokich but good Lord I mean Denver  what a machine that team is yokich somehow is only ranked fifth in fantasy on a per game basis I don't even really know how that's possible I think it's because he hasn't been able to hit his free throw so far but we know that'll come around Michael Porter Jr is off to a tremendous start and you can expect a lot of that to continue with Jamal Murray out for what they're saying is not days so that my  Tea Leaf reading there would suggest weeks kcp  y'all can hate on kcp all you want but I have been plenty of places and he's number 61 and 9 cats so far on the shoulders of two steals per game very good percentages half the block and two threes per contest I'll take it thank you very much  Aaron Gordon's a weird one I almost never talked about him because I hate his free throw percent and it's at 50 this year but he is inside the top 90 so far because he's shooting 58% from the field and he's over a steal and a block per ball game wow I mean I think we've seen enough RAM Gordon over the years to know that that's probably gonna taper off so if you can trade him for someone else ranked near 80 that has better staying power I would consider it maybe you could go try to get Nic Claxton for a stash for a few weeks  I don't know just throw it out there  Reggie Jackson got his first start with no Jamal Murray 7 points for assists that is  a check in the wrong column for him I don't think that he's someone you have to race out and start certainly streamer level and head to head if they're scheduled were in a good spot but you know games cap Rodeo I don't think that it makes the mark but certainly on the Jordan Hawkins front so let's let's pause and just take a moment briefly to talk about what happened with the Pelicans  the  the report before the ball game  was that  the Pell's  who set it I think it was a really green quote  right  yeah I think it was coming the head coach I think really said that they were probably going to be doing a little bit of matchup stuff  meaning you'd have some games where there's a little more Matt Ryan some games where there's a bit more Dice and Daniels a game where they maybe there's even a bit more Larry Nance Jr uh just to sort of and not that those guys necessarily all feel indirectly for a column but they can move bodies around they can have brain and Ingram play some sort of point forward if they had to they don't need a an old-fashioned point guard with McCollum out although it certainly does help but you know they ran a bunch of their offense through Zion yesterday for instance and a lot of times they'll run it through Ingram  Zion with nine assists and 0 turnovers was very impressive I don't know that I would call either of those guys and Elite passer  I don't know that I would call a column in Elite passer but he's a little bit better than those dudes  so the pallets are good they're gonna have a little bit of feeling out to do  and in the meantime you know they got this young dude who's just on fire  so in my eyes you have to pick him up  and you know we saw when he was feeling in for Brandon Ingram that he has a relatively strong Fantasy game that is to say  like the percentages are not there yet and that's the thing that you're going to be worried about because young player  rookie  shooting 39% from the field 73% at the free throw line but he averaging 27 minutes a game this year 13 points for boards to assist a steal and three three-pointers it's hard to completely ignore  so I think I would add him  there's gonna be a little bit of a close your eyes and pray kind of thing going on with the percentages you just you'll hope that  they don't I aren't as bad as they have been  games cap Roto what I throw them in immediately  no especially again on the report that they may use Dyson Daniels in a different matchup things like that so games cap I don't think I'm using him right off the bat but head-to-head I think I probably would because it doesn't  I mean yeah I guess it could hurt you if the percentages are that awful On Any Given night but if he's gonna rack up a bunch of counting stats which  we've talked about variability a bit more this season on the pod  those are things you want to try to collect  so that's your Monday recap a lot of questions in the chat room oh

how about you do it as well  and all so and did anybody come into our Discord from the link I posted actually it looks like a couple of you guys did find the Discord link that's fun too  look at that things happening in real time  here's the Discord link again for those that are watching  him I will clear my throat  take a sip of water because two shows at Rose a lot and let's see how many of these questions we can get through the question one uh my league rarely trades who do I drop for a streaming spot between Derek Lively Malcolm Brogden and Jalen Suggs  Brogden fits my team the least because I'm punting a cysts that's probably Suggs unfortunately again I have this little crush on him but he's he's not a 10 team right now  hey Dan is it crazy that I'd rather keep chat if someone offered women Yama I feel like chats blocks rates are similar he has better percentages than women  well when you say keep I assume you're talking about a redraft just sort of one to one on this thing I think there is a very real chance that chat beats when Yamaha this season in straight nine category ranking's if you need more points  when banana is likely to get those for you  chat is likely to have better percentages at the end of the year and that's why he was on the old man squad you even though he's very much not an old man it's because he has old man ability guy who is going to be higher ranked Than People expect because his percentages were good  I'm pretty happy with the fact that the only young dude I had on the old man squad was Chad Holmgren all the man can you guys believe us our Thompson holy crap should I trade Brandon Miller and bennedict mathurin for Jeremy Grant and Klay Thompson in a dynasty League uh  no because I think Brandon Miller's probably the guy unless you're really in win now mode you probably want Brandon Miller from that group in Dynasty Klay Thompson is very much on the tail end of his career Jeremy Grant is not that far away from it  and he's on a team where he's gonna probably get shut down again if they can't move him  his Claxton for my rust and Lively is that too low that's what I mean maybe he's getting tired of stashing why the hell not it's probably not gonna get it done but you could try  it's Christian would an ad yes  what happened to Ben Simmons defensive stats oh this is the question that I was talking about before he's just not as fast as he used to be better than they are right now but they're not gonna be where they were  is Klay Thompson a Buy Low  yes because at some point here Steph is not going to be able to go  full Thermo nuclear and every single ball game and they're gonna need clay to step it up a little bit now a lot of the issue is just been that he hasn't taken as many shots as last season I think that's a number that probably comes up for him a little  so yes short answers slight by low  would you trade Trey young for Kawhi Leonard  yes but I play a lot of nine cat games cap Roto  and if it totally messes up your team build then maybe not like Trey might be beat him in totals on but Kawaii is going to win the head the per game battle there  Jalen Williams for Jaylen Johnson a Jalen swap I think I'd rather have Jalen Williams on the Thunder that Jalen Johnson I love Jalen Johnson a lot I like them both a lot but I think I'd rather have Williams  Dan how would you rank these three players in nine cat Roto Jalen Brunson DeMar DeRozan Zach LaVine I think I'd go actually right in that order  and would you take Michael Porter Jr over any of them  no mpj would be the back end of that for me  we dropping Jeremy Sohan I never picked him up I told you guys this percentages we're gonna break you  so yeah you can drop him  is Jalen Williams a Buy Low a little bit Yeah so the one thing that hasn't really come around for Jalen Williams yet is the steals right he's only at 0.6 everything else is exactly where you need it to be the hope of course is that 0.6 steals goes up to more like one point six and that's how he jumps from 100 range to more like 50 and anything beyond that is gravy so yes if you can get him for  70 I think I would do it  Mo vogner versus Goga nah I don't think you need to do either of them  or Lena has a good schedule this week so to that end Head to Head side you could do both Rodeo I don't think I'm doing either one of them  dad help please I need to drop a player to activate the air and fox  Devin Booker and Derek white well bad news for you bud Derek White's the only one that's probably playing in the next ball game the my closest to drop player is our Dorian Finney Smith moving her Tim Hardaway Jr tyus Jones Jordan Hawkins Ty Jones you're not dropping Wagner you can drop  Dorian Finney Smith you can drop  Jordan Hawkins you could drop I think I'd probably hold Tim Hardaway while he's on a heater definitely tie his Jones and if you prefer Dorian Finney Smith because he's probably also quarter of a safe floor guy there  guys I have the weirdest thing happening there's this fan in my bedroom and I don't know what my kids pushed on it but I turn it off and then after an hour or two it turns back on  and now I'm freezing  should I drop Xavier Tillman for Josh Hart or Kobe white yes for Josh Hart  if you have a chance to trade Jalen green for a power forward who do you target I don't have the first flying clue guys because Jalen Greene isn't inside the top 200 so  you get a get I don't know I have no idea what that dude is valued at in the in the general landscape I can't help on this one  is it the right decision to trade Tyrese Maxey for Kyrie last week  I know Kyrie's Gonna Miss games he's capable of being yeah um yeah I'm good with that I'm good with Kyrie over maxi  should I trade lamelo ball for dejounte Murray in a points League know  what's the rest of season outlook on Dame  he was a borderline first-round pick but he doesn't look the same with the bucks he wasn't a borderline first round pick he was a mid first round pick I think he gets back to at least top 20 probably higher so I wouldn't worry  in illegal with a very deep bench would you stash Moses Moody with the Wiggins weirdness and likely High injury wrist on the Warriors in general or would you stash Obi toppin  well  I guess the question is if you need them doing stuff right now then topens doing more right now if this is all about someone you can just sit on your bench forever then it's Moody because then you're like okay well now I'll drop him in like if clay takes a game off or if we can take the game off or whatever you get the intermittent bursts of better per game numbers from Moody whereas the top and like you're going to get something it's not going to be great but you're going to get something every day  should I drop Tillman or monk for Jordan Hawkins yeah I think you can drop Tillman not that Hawkins is going to be a rest of season guy but I don't think Tillman's gonna be arrested season guy anymore either  weekly 12 team head-to-head league with an open IL plus slot would you stash Alec Burks or Amon Thompson we'll go Burks I think he'll be back sooner I think he'll produce quicker  I didn't get the chance to ask in the earlier show but what are your opinions about two-for-one trades like combining a sell High guy with a player you want to get rid of for a higher ranked player I like them but as everybody gets better at playing fantasy sports they become tougher and tougher to pull off so  you're gonna have to feel like you're giving up more than you're getting back  like significantly or you're not going to be able to pull it off the problem with two for ones is people send like two top 70 guys and they ask for a top 40 guy back it doesn't work that way you need a guy over performing  who you think is gonna fall back  and pair that new up with a safer side player and ask for that top 40 so I like them they're hard to do  Dan would you trade Jalen Williams to get as our tomson in nine cat Roto  no it's a little bit of a cello on Jalen and a bit of a buy high on Thompson so no I like them both a lot but I don't think that's the right pairing should I try to sell high on Gordon Hayward yes you freaking should he's number 60 and he hasn't gotten hurt yet  none of those things will last  who would you even sell Hayward for yeah I mean that's the question you could probably get  like a Conley or  maybe  Grant  maybe you could get d low he's ranked like 25 slots behind because his shot hasn't fallen that much yet  if you get DeAngelo Russell for it maybe injured Terry Rozier now that won't happen  buddy Heald who's managed to get inside the top 100 despite only playing 24 minutes that might be an interesting one see if you can go get buddy hield for Gordon Hayward because hayward's gonna go down and he'll like he's in his worst case scenario right now other than being held out  hey Dan what's in attainable and reasonable alternative to DeMar DeRozan kind of scared for the Bulls and I want to get rid of him while his value is average now you don't need to do that it stick it out man even if he gets traded he's gonna go to a place where he has a big role don't don't panic on dmar he's already on a team with two other guys that want the basketball so I like  it's probably not gonna change very much  dude I have giddy Dinwiddie and Keegan Murray in nine cat no clue what to do with them anymore well Keegan Murray you're holding on to because the kings are just flat out bad without dear and fox but he can still number 110 and he's shooting 35 and a half percent so far this year so Keegan Murray is very much a Bi-Lo  Josh Getty was someone that was on my bus list if anybody was watching this show during the damn pre-season so you're stuck man you can't really sell low on him you gotta hope that she misses three game's giddy goes big and then maybe you could trade him in for somebody that's got a safer floor and then didn't witty they just not enough usage there he's probably a drop he's the only drop of the three I think  should I start Yakima portal or Mark Williams tomorrow I don't know man I didn't even look to see you there playing tomorrow yet this is it you need one of our DFS experts let's see Charlotte is hosting Washington oh that yeah I mean I don't think I need to even look at the other one who's Toronto played in Dallas uh yeah give me Mark Williams  should I drop Andrew Wiggins in a points League know  no  do you think Xavier Tillman's gonna come back with a starting role yeah probably but I don't know that that actually means all that much  thoughts on kcp without Murray was playing well before but the seven assists were nice last night um you know we saw last year that kcp actually was worse when Marie Orion was out because his shot quality got poorer  we'll see I mean I'm still in on Casey and I have been since day one nothing has changed that  should we hold Dillon Brooks yeah he's  hot as hell man it's hot as Bakersfield in July  he will cool off and at that point you can probably punch but  right now he's hot  should I drop Drew Eubanks for Daniel Gafford yes thoughts on D Anthony Melton then we covered him earlier in the show right um he's a hold for me right now I want to see how this whole thing shakes out but it's minutes don't get up over 28 and eventually we do have to we would have to move on but not yet what are your thoughts on scoot Henderson  yeah I mean  so uh don't draft ball handling rookies typically is my rule there and the fact that he got dropped is really interesting it's a 14 team or I think you probably stash him because at some point this year he's gonna be really fun but it might not be until January or February so you're probably adding here and it's gonna be rough for you but if you don't I'm guessing somebody else will  should we be concerned with Jalen Brunson and Darius Garland's shooting percentages know these guys are who they are Brunswick shooting 40% that'll work its way up Garland has been awful 42 that's actually not going to change all that much Garlic's turnovers are at 5.3 that's the number that's going to come down a lot he was getting overdrafted because he gets assists but Garland was like 50 range last year and that's probably where he worked back to this season all so  would you drop Max Drew's for Jordan Hawkins I would not  do you think DeAndre ayton is a cell hi yes I would I think if you can get anybody inside the top 30 you do it if you can't you probably hang on because I think is probably gonna be inside the top 50 40 five range this year so the target there to try to beat that number Larry Market in a buddy hield for Zion and capella who wins well if you're punting free throws the Zion and Capella's side wins and if you're not the other side wins in a landslide  the only way the Zion Cabela's side wins is if you're punting free throws because otherwise Lowry's way out in front of everybody is the best player in that trade  Tyrese Maxey rest of season uh really does feel like he can be a top 25 player  he's having a ball and ain't nobody coming for his minutes right away maybe they do make another trade down the line to get a usage guy but  if he's rolling top 20 for a couple of months it's going to be hard to knock him off of that perch  so yeah top 25 I think is very reasonable for Maxi maybe even a little bit higher than that  guys you don't have to post the same question 15 times I I see them okay if it's in the chat room I see it  should I drop screw sags or loonie for Nas Reed  sucks or loony  let's go loonie  Jordan Hawkins or Jalen Suggs 10 team her points League  give me Suggs cuz I like the Hawkins one is tied to the CJ McCollum stuff a Suggs is not really tied to anything so let me we'll go that one  do you think DeMar DeRozan is cooked what he's number 48  people watching the same stuff as me you still at 214 assists  field goal percentage down a little bit right now but he's at Fort 1.4 steals to Mars fine guys he's inside the top 50  do I trade Trey young or Paul George for wemby or Barnes  well Barnes is a is a buy high right now if you're buying on him because he probably comes down from there  I mean if you you're not gonna get women for Paul George Whoever has one banana is not giving him up that's just assume they're not trading him  they're not trading him  did we decide it's Hawkins time yeah why the hell not talkin' time  he got this thing up soon Keegan Murray rest of season outlook let's go  90  I have Melton Hawkins Jaden McDaniels on The Wire any of them worth dropping Keegan for know I think I'd stick with Keegan someone dropped Wiggins in my points League do I just stay away points leagues I think I might consider it  is Tyler hero a cell High  yes the Steels are gonna come down  scoring also probably comes down a little bit yes sell High who can we get for cam Thomas  honestly I don't know I don't know you're not he's number 26 but nobody believes that's where he's gonna stay you could probably try to get somebody in the top 70 range  that feels like attainable  is trading Williams selling low yes  as another should I sell high on Camp Thomas I mean yes but also I really have no idea what you're going to get  how sustainable is Dennis Schroder is production this year I you know  he's number 52  I assume it's three pointers are going to come down but it's free throw percentage probably gonna come up maybe the assist come down a little bit I'm going to say somewhat sustainable it does seem like he'll be a nine cats start guy all season long where that sits exactly I don't know for sure but he is a cell hi yes but he's also I think gonna be decent all year Melton Brooks herb or Bogdan I can pick up two  give me Dillon Brooks right now because he's hot and Herb Jones and then Brooks cools off herb and Melton  should I try to make kuzma for Austin Reeves are they about the same  same  should I drop Bruce Brown  for Jordan Hawkins or Jalen Suggs or Max druze  maybe Max Drew's or maybe nothing I don't think that's gonna change your team very much  Tatum and Trey Jones from Mikhail and OG and CP3 the Tatum side  Melton or streus  right now it's Max Drew's believe it or not  Dame or Damien or Donovan Mitchell sorry Davey on Mitchell Dame or Donovan Mitchell rest of season I think they'll be pretty tight actually this guy's probably both end up in the in the 12 to 16 range somewhere near there so whichever  whichever maybe Dame by a tiny bit but whichever every Simon's rest of season well we need to get him back first but then hopefully top 70 after that  is it worth adding miles Bridges  I'm personally not doing it I don't care if you do I'm not gonna judge anybody I just think I can win without him  yes if you are feeling Cutthroat you can do it I just I don't really want to bother  would you try to sell PJ Washington with Miles Bridges coming back yes  should I drop this is a shallow leak someone dropped Jayden Williams I'm assuming Jalen Williams should I drop go bare dealer or Van Vleet Dilo would be your weakest of those guys  thoughts on tari Eason when he comes back I don't think he's quite inside the top 100 when he comes back rebounds and steals if he can get a bunch of those he might be able to get there but it's if he should I keep herb Jones yeah certainly with McCollum out let's see how that goes and heart rest of season of his minutes stay high well he was in the 65 range in 30 some odd minutes last year so  let's say 85 or better and that's that two shows back-to-back that's a lot of shows I need to stop talking guys find me over on social at Dan Bass Pros like rate subscribe go check out the fantasy pass at sports
