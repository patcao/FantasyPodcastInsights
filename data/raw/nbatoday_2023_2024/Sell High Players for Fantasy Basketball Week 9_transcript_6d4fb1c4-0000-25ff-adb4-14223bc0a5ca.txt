welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  good morning everybody rolling early again today on our cell High special episode for week 9 of the NBA season I am Dan Vespers and this is fantasy NBA today you can find me on social at Danbury d a n b e s b r i s or just this is the easy way just Google search Dan from Sports ethos or Dan from hoop ball and that'll pop right up there we've got a quick recap coming up from what we've had on our previous couple of sell High shows and then we'll dive into a handful of new names here and admittedly this becomes I want to sort of preface the cell High show where the first five or six weeks of the Season you can do it exclusively on the only thing that people have seen so far which is honestly an easier way to do a sell High show because when all someone is seen is the data that's out there it's much easier to convince people or you don't have to do it maybe the numbers do it by themselves that that's what that player is going to be as we hit we week seven eight nine you start to build yourself highs and buy lows on things that are happening within the season in certain smaller chunks of time and so that's basically what we're rolling on today and most likely going forward outside of little things that creep in trade rumors shut Downs injuries things of that nature  you can of course come hang with all of us in our Discord the link is in the show description I would also encourage everyone who's watching the show or even listening I guess after the fact if you have questions for me about sell High players about other stuff use the comments tab after the show is fully posted that's something where I get email alerts I sweep through the YouTube comment section once a day or so and that's an opportunity to get a hold of me in a way that isn't lost in a vast stream of notifications over on Twitter it's week nine so again we are basically a third of the way now through the NBA season basketball monster has it as 32% which is again pretty much as close as you can get to that we've got guys coming back from injury we somehow managed to go through a day yesterday without any massive stuff but we'll get to that in our recap show coming up in a couple of hours after this one for now I want to talk about the players to sell in week nine I don't want to talk about some of the stuff that's been happening with our cell High board over the last two weeks  you guys might recall that Terry Rozier made our cell high list and he is still on our cell high list because lamelo ball is still out there still hasn't been  any sort of information on exactly when lamelo's coming back  we heard that maybe he was making some progress as like last week I think there was a he's getting closer little tidbit that popped up but that was all that was all we got so still out for we don't know how long meaning Rozier is still doing lamelo's job  he's having 23 points 7 assists Rozier shooting 87% the free throw line he's at 47% from the field which is above I think any of our expectations  and that's not to say that Rozier won't have a good fantasy season even after ball comes back but he won't be this guy  right now he's the defacto point guard so your sister through the roof  and I think the problem with the Rosier sell high and we talked about this last week as well is that everybody knows that it's tied to lamelo so you simply cannot wait until news breaks on lamelo's return you have to try to unload rows here now where it's really hard to do so because you want to be cashing in on what he's done all so  last week I think I said if you could get top 50 it was worth while I still basically feel that way now with another good week under his belt he's still number 208 you could potentially aim as high as 40 or 405 C about guys in that range that don't have a big scoring profile if maybe you could get those dudes back like a klaxon he's number 43 Anthony Simons at 46 is intriguing all the honestly it's possible that Rosie or beats him Myles Turner who's been in and out of the lineup and he's had some games with foul trouble and blowout losses so it's minutes or what artificially depressed these are guys that you could potentially aim for I don't think you're gonna get much higher than that maybe a Desmond Bane with John coming back if people have a total freak out that's about I think as high as you could go on a repeat rows here Shane sharp is completely fallen off a cliff and now he's hurt so that sell window is now closed he was one of our names a couple weeks ago you was gonna fall off when guys came back because he has efficiency stuff  hopefully you were able to cash in  Anfernee Simons was on our cell High board last week when he was in the 20s he's falling into the 40s already and you this is gonna happen because you had made all of his free throws to that point nobody was going to shoot 100% at the foul line he's taking I think he was taking like 22 shots now he's under 20 by a little 19.8 but that team like I guess with sharp hurt maybe he gets a slight bump again but you kind of knew  that was Simon's who I like mine you I don't people read too much into whether a cell High board means I do not like a player that is nothing to do with it it's whether I believe that they're ranked is going to move up or down I still think Simon's probably Falls a little bit farther his Fantasy game is  somewhat limited he's not a big steals Guy he's gonna score his sister kind of high right now I don't know if those stick and you're gonna get some free throw stuff out of him I think there's a chance he could fall a little bit farther but because he's scored so much so far this year you can probably aim for someone in that same range as Rosie or like in the 40 to 55 window and it probably will work let's get into some names for this week  I actually surprised myself I didn't mean to turn the slide already but I did it so screw it we're gonna go ahead  we've talked about this dude  on  our recap shows throughout the week both Monday and Tuesdays recap show I believe and sell High guy number one is Cam Thomas  and I know what you're thinking Dan campus is ranked outside the top 100 on the season how is this a guy that I'm going to be able to sell High well because again people aren't just looking at the overall season number in week nine people have visceral reactions to what they've seen particular players do recently and cam Thomas recently has been a monster  because he's one of those guys that runs extraordinarily hot and extraordinarily cold and there's really no in between for him  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last-second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily

drizzly.com that's dri z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  and right now he's running hot  real hot when 15 for 24 in a game in Golden State four days ago  and went 12 for 23 and a game at Utah two days ago he has 73 points over his last two ballgames he has ten three pointers he's 9 for 9 at the free throw line but it's easier for people to forget that the previous I think it's six or seven ball games he was shooting at about 35% on extremely high volume  and all of Camp Thomas's value is tied up in his field goal percent  I mean that because when his field goal percent is up that means it's scoring is up it means his three pointers are up  and it all floats together and then the field goal percent comes down the scoring comes down the three-pointers come down the activity is a little bit lower he doesn't get steals basically ever his turnovers are going to be sort of medium  because he's handling the ball at tan he doesn't really rebound he doesn't really pass all that much so really everything is tied to whether or not he's shot is going in and right now it's going in and so whoever has him if it's you you're looking at it like oh sweet  this guy's gonna average 30 points a game  it's really weird the way that happens but I promise you if you stop and you think about it you're not going to be you're going to be two emotional about cam Thomas because of how hot and cold he gets but this is your moment because when he gets hot for three four five ball games in a row you know it's not gonna last forever he's gonna Bounce from where he was which was 130 range he's going to bounce back up towards 75 and then he's going to get cold and he's gonna fall back towards that 130 Market again and it's this back and forth the pendulum we don't know how long it's gonna take between each one couple of weeks here and there this is when you got a cash in  because people are gonna see that over the last week he's averaging 28 points a game people are gonna know that over the last two he's averaging 30 some odd points a game  and they're gonna want him  because they're gonna in their mind be unable to separate the full picture from the small section of the picture  so go see if you can get somebody in the 65 range for him which I think is maybe a little bit of a stretch but possibly doable DeMar DeRozan who I still think is a by low is a possibility in their tyus Jones who's been finally on the rise is a low in like a low name profile guy prior to last night you might have been able to even get like a DeAndre my Conley is a low turnovers iteration I don't I still think held in Johnson falls off a little bit but he's in that range as someone you could possibly get if you're willing to take a shot on Zach LaVine you could almost definitely get him for cam Thomas right now because Levine is like if Cam Thomas just shot 45% almost every ball game  he's like what you want Camp Thomas to be one at all levels off  you could buy low on Tobias Harris I'm pretty sure you could probably buy on Franz Wagner I don't know if I'm aiming quite high enough there Jeremy Grant is a possibility  there are a lot of guys that don't have those wild swings that you could use cam Thomas for right now and I would encourage it if possible  I just talked about Jeremy Grant as a guy you could use if you wanted to trade Camp Thomas but I also think that Jeremy Grant might be developing his own little sell High small pocket window I don't think this one's quite as severe as the cam Thomas sell high but I do think that because  Grant has looked so good in his two games since coming back from his concussion  people that have him rostered in this case it would be you because you're selling high are starting to think that this is actually what he's just going to do forever  but we all know we're all reasonable people we know that that's just not the case  he's averaging 26 points four boards for assists two threes and he's shooting 57% over the last week since coming back from his concussion he's at 91% from the free throw line we know Jeremy Grant isn't going to shoot 57% on high volume and that's really where this issue is if we're thinking about the entire season for Grant  in all likelihood and there's fears of shutdown stuff towards the end of the year but in all likelihood he's probably more of a 60 to 80 range type of fantasy player  I think right now he's at 77 and you know that's with a pretty good last week the game he came out early was sort of weighing things down a little bit if sharp is out that gives him a little bit more to do but Simon Says back so he's not going to do as much as he did the first go-round  meaning that  Grant who's again I 77 right now overall but because he's been so good the last week if you could aim for somebody just like 10 or 15 slots higher than where he is on the season overall I think this is a reasonable time to do it  and it's all the names that I just mentioned for cam Thomas other than his own name DeMar DeRozan would be an interesting one I don't think he wanted to do the Zach LaVine thing there because Grant is is consistent enough where you're giving up a performer for someone you don't actually know is going to work his way up the board Michael Porter Jr Conley again if you need assistance and not as worries about scoring a Kobe white who's been very hot I don't think you're gonna be able to get him not while exclaim is out because Kobe's going crazy Tobias Harris to buy low tyus Jones as we mentioned DeAndre ayton these guys all actually make a lot of sense as a can I use Jeremy Grant to lock in some 60 some odd range value and then I don't have to worry about the swings I don't have to worry about the injuries I don't have to worry about the shutdown if you target a guy who's on a team you think it's going to be competing towards the end of the season  again small margins here this is a small margins one Camp Thomas is the bigger margin where you can probably cash in on a hot streak and maybe get a two or three round bump with Grant you're really just trying to  sort of  throw his numbers in carbonite effectively you just want to lock in what Grant does with out any fears of the fall off so it's less of a sell high and more of a oportun sell moment because he's playing relatively well he has this little stretch since coming back from concussion Grant does where  he's been better than his overall numbers and people may have sort of Forgotten what the overall numbers are going to creep back to so can you lock in a less risky proposition in that same exact realm think the answer is maybe but you might as well give it a try Gordon Hayward is the next name on the list and this is one now that I feel pretty confident about saying we got to try to get something while we can because he's number one 180 overall but he falls into a similar boat as Terry Rozier as a guy who was putting up better numbers when lamelo ball is on the Shelf  as soon as we get any kind of report same like just thing the same deal as Rozier as soon as we get any report that lamelo ball is coming back all of these

way he'll be there in a couple of days  do it now stop waiting manscape.com go get something good people will be pleased you did  as far as Gordon Hayward goes first of all I would last couple of weeks he's been number 62 he's worked his way back up the page a little bit that's good the problem of course with Gordon Hayward is that we know it's not sustainable we saw it for a few weeks to start the year when Terry Rozier was out and Miles Bridges was out those guys were back other than the game in Canada lamelo is on the way when this team is at Full Tilt Gordon Hayward is outside the top 100 but as long as he's cruising along right now you can probably get someone just barely inside the top 100 in that 80 to 100 range that again  you're not going to be able to get somebody who has sort of eye-popping appeal but you should be able to get somebody who's a little bit more let's call it fantasy mellow  not lamelo not Carmelo just fantasy mellow  so if you're willing to take a shot on injured player you might be able to Target a Jalen Duren if you're willing to take a shot on someone who's at a shooting slump you could  almost definitely get maxed through right now because he's shooting like 30% over the last 10 days he's fallen 25 slots because of it but you know he's gonna get hot here in the not too distant future you could probably get Trey Murphy over in New Orleans who I you know I think we all view as sort of a top 100 or slightly better range guy Yakima portal might be attainable he's number 94 right now let's see if anybody's a little higher up Jared Allen has been kind of slumping maybe you could go that direction I doubt you could get boy and bug zdanowicz or Walker Kessler those would kind of be my favorite Derek Lively's hurt you might be able to get him right now if you're willing to take on an injured player for a couple of weeks but he's way better than Gordon Hayward rested the way the Anthony Melton you seeing the scoring come down as that team gets fully healthy again maybe in attainable player you should try if you can those types of guys this sort of low-scoring  but fantasy appropriate 75 to 105 range dudes that you just let you sort of know are not going to disappear when someone comes running back that's the Gordon Hayward move right now you're not gonna be able to go any higher than that but again can you lock it in I think there's a chance and if there is you should take it  and our last one and this is a hard one because I actually really like the player and that's tari Eason who's playing extraordinarily well right now loving me some tari East in these days  let me explain myself on this one because I want to make sure that folks don't  confuse me saying sell high with me not really liking the player because I think Tara Eason is going to have a good rest of his season  what I don't know about Eason is how perfectly locked in the minutes are  last two weeks he's number 70 8  in about 25 and a half minutes per game  and the last one week he's number 48 on 28 minutes per ball game  here's the thing though over the last week in four games Ethan's averaging 15 and 9 with 3.1 defensive stats he's a good steals Guy make no mistake he's very good steals Guy but that number is probably not sustainable  when you think about how many players in the NBA are over two steals per game this year the answer is three  two of them are extraordinarily low sample size guys in Marcus Smart and then Jama rant who played one game and had two Steals and the other one is Shea Gill just Alexander  so as much as we love to our Eason he's not gonna average 2.3 steals per ball game it's probably not gonna average nine rebounds per game either but I don't want to completely write that off so in this case we'll just talk about the steals alone and what do 2.3 steals actually means for individual week fantasy value  and right now what it means basically is that  he's over his skis  if you take away that big big impact Stat or just slim by a tad he drops back down towards that 75 range  so I think because he's been running so hot and because he's The Shining new object this is actually a moment if you want to that you could sell high on tari Eason that doesn't mean that you have to if you want to see how it goes and say man you know what I hope that this guy just gets 28 minutes a game the rest of the year and I hope he's just a top 65 guy and I feel like such a smart dude for picking him up after that first or second good ball game great if that makes you feel better in your heart or your brain or whatever that's all totally fine  the reason I bring it up right now is that this is  your perfect opportunity if you wanted one to cash in on the value of the unknown  everybody in fantasy loves The Shining new object and right now tari Eason again much as we adore him I love him on all of our teams I want to make sure we got him in as many places as humanly possible mad at myself that I didn't put in a big enough Fab bid on him to get him in all the Yahoo Publix I'm in  yes love him but so does everybody right now because he's new and he's fresh he's putting a big numbers and people have an inability in their minds to understand how big a player can actually be  players have convinced themselves that anything is now possible for Easton that he's just gonna like magically be a top 50 guy the entire season but think about how often there are waiver guys who actually roll top 50 the rest of the way when there isn't like two guys out on a basketball team it's unbelievably rare almost never happens almost never happens because fantasy analysts are all very good these days we see these things prior to the season starting everybody's rostered so  these get that type of stuff just doesn't pop up now are there guys that pop up that run 75 80 85 kind of stuff yeah  that does happen regularly  so I think right now because Eason is so shiny and new and people really don't know how high he can go  you can Target somebody with rest of Seasons safe appeal  in that 60 to 80 range and I think you can get it  now don't give him up for somebody who's not fun  okay that's the rule here on Easton because I think he's going to be kind of a fun player to roster  how fun I don't know but some fun  but if you can get somebody who has that rest of season safe  reliable appeal  in this 60 to 85 or 60 to 90 range you do it  start high work down the board  could you get Mike Conley cuz he doesn't score that much maybe you never know try it could you get  Jalen Suggs maybe mean he's like what tari Eason does but without rebounds and hitting some 3-pointers better free-throw lower field goal  could you get Derek Lively  I do it  could you get Jerry Grant probably not Drew holiday you might be able to get Drew holiday I think people that have them were pretty frustrated right now  could you get Jared Allen probably not  could you get an injured Darius Garland probably not but maybe  Jalen Williams Jalen Duren  there's some names out there  I think you'll all be very surprised at how  good people feel about tari Eason right now and what it might actually be the rest of the way so I think he could go top 75 I don't think he can go top 50 and so that's why I think if you can get somebody in there  well you again just lock it in  and this is a cell hide not in that I think his numbers are going to tape her off at times this is a cell High because of the shine the shine of something new is so is Illuminating right now and thank you I want to make sure that you guys thank you to everybody for actually listening through that because if I just put the name up on the board people are like oh Dan things Tower Ethan's gonna go bad I don't  I just think right now because he just burst onto the scene there's this extra glow that nobody else in the league has right now because no one else just burst onto the scene good call by the way if someone in the chat room Jalen Williams last year is like the only one in the last half decade that came off the waiver wire and then rolled top 50 the rest of the way without someone having to get out of his way to do it  although there were like four injuries on Oklahoma City that helped and then he carried it through  they were stupid injuries it was like Pocoyo Jeremiah Robinson Earl someone else they're like three guys that probably shouldn't have been in the rotation that all went down and that's when he started taking shots but that's about the closest example we can come up with  of a guy coming out of nowhere to be a top 50 play for the rest of the season  so chances are that Eason settles back in  and if we can capitalize on the shine that's what you do it right now  that's yourself hi show everybody we will be back in I don't know two hours something like that two and a half hours we'll have our daily breakdown show please make sure to come back and hang out with us for
