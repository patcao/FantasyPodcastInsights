welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  well I've got a little touch of the old  Ham laryngitis Mark are three year old finally gave it to the whole dang house I'm okay though a little bit of Tylenol  a whole lot of water and we will plot our way through this show I'll probably cough on your faces here and there but I don't think you can catch it through a podcast so  you should probably be all right it's all first reverse chronological lightning round Monday of the 2023 2024 and NBA season for those uninitiated which I assume is some small percentage of you  on Mondays first show we do of the day is it look back at all 30 teams  over the weekend basically each team's most recent ball game so we'll start on Sunday we'll go through the six games on Sunday then we'll go through the slightly larger well what was it 78 games on Saturday and then anybody that didn't play on Sunday or Saturday will take a quick look at their game back from Friday  then we'll pivot into a Monday preview  but this is not the week ahead episode of fantasy NBA today that's actually gonna be a separate one we'll be doing with Derek this afternoon pacific times that'll probably be around 2 p.m. I think or so Pacific should give you guys a couple of hours to set your lineups we want to go as late to the start or as close to line up block as humanly possible while also not doing it at the very last second because then like anybody listening after the fact is not gonna have an opportunity to use it but Derek will help us go through look at who the best teams are for streaming this week and and then at the end of that show I'll take a look at some of the players that are day-to-day questionable that type of stuff and and try to give you a couple of indicators on what to do with them on the weekly site but that'll be the second show today this first one is really about looking at the individual teams what they did over the weekend and how that Segways into Monday night's card  first things first this is fantasy NBA today you guys probably figured that out already I'm your host Dan best price at Dan best person on social media a lot of you guys have been finding me over there over the last few days specifically uh since Wednesday it's been  kind of wild actually I think the  I think it were added something like 400 500 follows in the last five days which is awesome I get a little bit obsessed with it but that all translates to more people finding the YouTube show and there's this sort of like positive feedback snowballing thing that goes on so please take a moment to hit the thumbs up button please subscribe to the show Even if you hate the fact that my voice is beat up today from kid cold laryngitis every little bit helps it really does whether it's Twitter Here YouTube traditional pod channels iTunes Spotify all that good stuff so let's get that party started here nice and early  let's do our first reverse chronological lightning round I love these shows because the content is just right there ready for me I don't have to do anything other than throw it up on your screen and you guys can work along with us I for YouTubers tried to make it relatively large I don't know how well that worked I bounce my face around on the screen yeah that's not gonna be all that great we'll go a little bit bigger that'll put some of the stuff off the side of the page but you know it is what it is Denver beat Oklahoma City in the first game on Sunday morning or lunchtime and they did it by shooting 60% from the field the Nuggets did there were no big surprises in this game  a couple of bench players for the Nuggets saw a ton of extra run because it was a blowout so Kristian Brown played 21 minutes Peyton Watson played 22  we've seen Reggie Jackson pretty consistently getting around 20 to 22 minutes but his Fantasy game requires a whole hell of a lot more than that  and this game was just over early largely because she'll just Alexander had his worst game in like three seasons  cost me a head-to-head matchup actually if you had a medium-sized ball game I probably win my weekend instead I got my butt cake because my opponent had Nicole yokich and I feel silly because I actually took one of those I took Shea over yolk kitchen this week not a not a nine cat don't worry about it I'm at that dumb they're almost no notes on this game at all other than like what to not read too much into and that is  everything because it was a blowout the one thing I would point out that's been kind of nice so far is that Michael Porter Jr is rebounding his butt off so far this season  dude had nine more boards today and I don't know if that's a Bruce Brown being gone thing but mpj is averaging 14 and 11 so far this year and almost three three pointers a game he's actually turned himself into a little bit of a different kind of unicorn not that the defensive stats but a bunch of three pointers on good percentages and rebounds aren't that many guys that have that combo and I don't know if this is gonna stick I don't think he's gonna average 11 rebounds a game but if he's up you know get himself closer to 789 that could be a weird little bonus and he is inside the top 50 so far this year so good start for mpj nothing else to do with this ball game let's keep moving forward  Atlanta Milwaukee had one very obvious thing in it and that was Jalen Johnson and started inserted into the starting lineup that's awesome he was a big time Bruce he won 50 Darren so many of you listeners to this show had him already  and in talking to brew about Jane Lin Johnson I have the the privilege to chat with him whenever I want because I work for sports details  one thing that he had mentioned to me was that he wanted to make sure that Sports ethos was in front of everybody  so check every list  we want to make sure that we're the earliest on Jalen Johnson that was like one of the big things Derek white was the other one I think of those guys among the dudes that were getting pushed down Jaylyn I think was another I don't get to side tracked here we'll talk about those guys when we get to them but  in a lot of leagues that are less hyper competitive Jalen Johnson was on the waiver wire on the first day of the season and so hopefully you guys were able to do that scoop  from me yelling about it in our premium Discord or in the tweetstorm a few hours later or whatever  I don't worry about the minutes this game was a blowout but starter version Jalen Johnson is is wonderful songs he can stay out of foul trouble he's this incredible mixture of  high field goal percent does it some threes rebounds gets defensive stats this is the start of something really lovely  elsewhere with Atlanta because there are other stories here in the blowout okongwu saw and extra few minutes and that was good and we're still kind of waiting for him to have one of his do a whole lot of stuff in not that much time kind of ball games but also it's important to remember and I'll say this after every one of these games  he is not going to put up giant lines while Clint capela is healthy  El Congo is a 100 to 130 range guy when capella is on the floor  he does his big damage when capella misses ball games and eventually that's gonna happen this year but you kind of just have to buy your time with it DeAndre Hunter is off to a really good start this year and I have to say I'm surprised he's number 40 now admittedly it's a small sample size and he's shooting 56% which is an unsustainably high number there but if you remember I think it was two three years ago Hunter got off to a really good start before he got hurt and he was inside the top 80 That season he hasn't come anywhere near it since mostly because roles have been shrinking and field goal percent had sort of tapered off a little bit if the field bar field goal percent comes back this year he does have a shot to be inside the top one hundred and let's just sort of keep one eye on it  he's not all that heavily rostered  and I get it because like games cap format there's been so many reasons to be skeptical of it he makes sense to have on the head to head side because the minutes are there and so you know even if he has a bad ball game it's not doing damage to you in that same way  Sadiq Baez the other name I wanted to mention with Atlanta 13 points 9 boards three assists in a three-pointer came off the bench but he still played 31 minutes so he bought himself a little bit more time on Ross's with that  only real note on the Bucks side other than Damian Lillard having an absolutely horrible game is that Brooke Lopez is a severe Bilo right now brolo hasn't blocked a shot in his team's first two ballgames that's simply not going to last and if you're wondering why you played 21 minutes is because  they got stopped nobody played that many minutes the fact that Malik Beasley played 32 was kind of weird he had a better ball game here but  you guys can go ahead and Trust Malik Beasley as far as you can Chuck him I mean I just I don't think he's gonna stick long-term in the starting lineup because  he doesn't do much besides shoot a three ball and I think they're gonna need more glue guys and also Chris Middleton was resting this ball game  Warriors beat the Rockets 106.95 one thing that I said and this is before getting even into the fantasy side of things here one thing I said during the offseason while everybody was yelling at me that the Rockets were gonna turn this massive Corner this year is that there I said there's a difference between trying to be good and actually being good  so I think the Rockets are trying this year and a way that they weren't the last couple they were in tank mode but they're not good yet  maybe they get there as the season goes but they're not there yet  oh Warriors had dream on Greenback he was on a minute's cap so that's the low numbers there no reason to freak out about it Chris Paul minutes came down a little bit in this one is that because of Draymond Green possibly something to keep an eye on this game was all so pretty well in a hand it was sort of more blow outie than the final score would indicate and that's why the Warriors regular step played 31 minutes clay 29 Wiggins 28  so that actually tells more of a story than the final score would I think  if this game is tighter I don't know if that means more minutes for Chris Paul as draymond's minutes go up does that cap it anyway let's keep a close watch on what's going on there with the Warriors and then with Andrew Wiggins we're sort of at this point where we kind of have to ask ourselves is he just not  as good as he used to be  I don't know you guys know me I'm not a Wiggins guy but I also do think and and this is the whole two things can be true at the same time kind of deal  I don't like Andrew Wiggins from a fantasy standpoint I hate wings that suck at free throw shooting but he's also a by low it's two things at the same time  on the Houston side Jabari Smith Jr played better Alcorn had another fairly well-rounded line Freddie Van fleet was bad Dillon Brooks is probably gonna be kind of bad most of the year Jalen green is someone I avoided like the plague because of his issues  I don't know what to add really on this side just so it's just kind of waited out and wait for the team to figure out some kind of chemistry stuff together I I get the appeal of Jabari Smith Jr and I and this is  I think he does end up having an okay fantasy season but he's another guy that worries me because of all the things that can kind of go wrong with his Fantasy game  field goal percent could be bad for you throw is not a guaranteed positive  if you drafted him  I don't I don't know what you're doing listen to my show because I basically said I wasn't drafting him because I was worried that it might not click but if you drafted him  I have to try to put myself in your shoes this is an empathy moment for me because I don't have Jabari Smith Jr on any team I have  I think I have a couple of Freddie Van fleets that's the only rocket I've got anywhere and yeah that game wasn't great yesterday but if I Jabari Smith Juniors manager on a fantasy team  I think I just have to wait it out  hope that it pans out Joel embiid played on the the back-to-back here and he seemed fine 3515 and 7 two Steals and six blocks everybody was like oh no what's happening to pojo lmd he hasn't quite looked like himself to start the year well hello he's back up to number 11 now after this gigantic gigantic ballgame Tyrese Maxey by the way is number four in nine cat leaks right now hell of a start to the year Tobias Harris is actually been pretty good all so when we kind of knew that was gonna be the case with no Harden around he's number 31 after the first week  and we finally got a better game out of D Anthony Melton after a couple of Clunkers this was the kind of one that you're looking for with a few points some assists a nice steals numbers three-pointers mixed in  that'll do  you guys are not interested in my take on the guise that are generally roster do you guys are interested in my take on a guy like Paul Reed and a guy like Kelly oubre and unfortunately Paul reads A Drop  he's not playing many minutes he saw extra and this one because it was a blowout but typically he is in the 1314 range and that's just not going to get it done as far as Kelly oubre goes he did enough in this one they didn't need him as much and that's always going to be the thing here with ubre is if they don't need the scoring punch then his role is going to be diminished he managed to sort of Salvage things by hitting all six of his free throws and having three defensive stats so I think you keep them on rosters for now but just make sure you're aware that the bottom could fall out on this thing and we might see James Harden show up at some point this week  maybe  I doubt it but maybe  over on the Portland side we're getting a pretty good look at what the Blazers are with no Anthony Simons and they went from bad to horrible they got blown out DeAndre Aiden got eaten alive by Joel embiid so Time Lord saw a few extra minutes and yesterday's ballgame both of those guys put up what you'd call kind of low-end serviceable lines mostly because of defensive stats  I think Robert Williams is going to be around top 100 range this year John 8 is going to be better than he's been the kind of nice thing about eight and so far is that he's number 62 in nine cats after the first week despite having what I would argue is about the worst week it could have possibly had he still averaged 12 rebounds and he somehow averaged 2.4 defensive stats so there is this weird there's a disconnect happening with the understanding that he's been very bad from the field and his team's been so horrible but he's managed to float his numbers and as one thing comes down the other thing will probably come up and he becomes a little bit of a bylaw  Malcolm Brogden is a start while Simon Says out shaking sharp is obviously a start well Brockton or Simon's out Jeremy Grant is the start well Simon Says out Batiste I was a drop and no I'm not paying attention to Jabari Walker until he gives me about three more games of reason to pay attention to it  scoot Henderson is getting a lot of should I drop asks on Twitter  and I got to say it's the same stuff  like we've been down this road so many times people  but I'll repeat it because I know I have new viewers and new listeners every year  don't draft rookie ball handlers  if you want to draft a rookie and I put Chet Holmgren is on my Dan best for sold man squad list he's technically the only rookie on their it needs to be a big man with good percentages those guys are able to get over the hump because they don't have the things that weigh them down but for someone like scoot he's gonna have a ton of turnovers he's gonna have a horrible efficiency issues figuring out the NBA and it's just like right now it's as bad as it could possibly be he's like where is he's outside the top 200 it's not even remotely close to Fantasy value and so people that are rostering him are in full panic  and I get it  I get it you should be in full panic because you drafted a rookie ball handler after I yelled at you don't do it it never works  Alex Ridley who was on this show to break down his mock draft team about two and some odd weeks ago I think  he did the digging on this and you can find him on Twitter at ricklyn if you want to tell him I gave him a non guest hit shout out ball my kiss for me he did the Deep dive on this to look at how rookies do  in fantasy drafts versus where they end up performing and the result was what we've been saying which is going to have to rookie draft him like 115 or deeper because there's a really good shot they stink for half a year or more  and that's basically what's going to happen here with Scooby's going to be terrible at the beginning of the season and you're seeing it this is like maximum terrible  and then by mid-november he's going to be a tiny bit better and by mid-December he's going to look pretty decent or serviceable and probably by the All-Star break in February he's gonna be pretty good basketball player  remember Trey Yuen  he was unplayable in fantasy until February of his rookie year and then he was Top 40 the rest of the way  what's the play here if you have scoot on your team you're in real trouble because he ain't gonna get anything for him in his cell  and you don't want to drop him because he's gonna get good at some point later this year you're kind of screwed  sort of the sunk cost situation  sunk cost fallacy if I if it meant that you should drop him but I actually don't think it's that way I don't think you should drop him because someone's gonna pick him up and someone's gonna  pick those fruits in a couple of months if you don't have school you might be able to pick him up off the waiver wire in a week or two if this keeps happening or you wait and you trade for him and like four weeks and then you're stashing a month and a half shorter than they clown the drafted sorry guys called you clowns I told you not to though Lakers lost in Sacramento and overtime this is a really fun ball game by the way if anybody had a chance to watch it this was a highly enjoyable Darren Fox however did turn an ankle  he's questionable for the week ahead don't worry we talked about that on the week ahead show coming up this afternoon  he's very durable  I do think he tries to get in there for part of this week but again we'll cover that in the next show he was amazing in this one he I know he wasn't there and over time but he was the reason that the game even ended up in overtime by being as good as he was in the fourth quarter and then Malik monk had a big OT that's a push the king's over the winning threshold here Keegan Murray's been awesome he has indeed taking a step forward year over year Kevin herder finally at his first better ball game he'll probably be okay but I wouldn't expect much Beyond like top 90 to 150 115 range type of stuff out of him when the dust settles  demon is bonus was drafted as a very safe second rounder and so far that's exactly what he's been so congratulations nothing's changed for the king's ever fox has to miss any time I would think Malik monk sees a little bit more action David Mitchell will definitely play more but he's not really fantasy ready and then obviously we saw Harrison Barnes come crashing back to Earth the way we knew that he would on the Lakers side the big minutes guys in this one where Anthony Davis about another gigantic ball game D'Angelo Russell who's been  not shooting the ball well but from an opportunity standpoint a terrific early season grab because as soon as those shots start going in  if this opportunity holds he's averaging 14 and 7 with a steel and one and a half three pointers a game and if the shot start to fall that goes up to like 16 17 points and over two threes a game and the field goal percent isn't such a massive negative he goes rocketing inside the top 100  I think everybody's fear with the Lakers right now is Austin Reeves  by the way you can you can probably Play Tori and prints until Jarred Vanderbilt comes back I know he had that horrible game in between two good ones but he really does kind of fit what they're doing  anyway for Austin Reeves he just looks exhausted I think that Team USA stuffed him of his Austin Reeves strength he'll be fine but he is a prototypical by low right now because he's gotten off to a terrible start nothing is going in he shall one for 12 in this ball game and if he makes any of his damn shots Lake Lakers probably win so um yeah go get him if you can on the cheap we'll try to do a little bit of work on that over on the social media side which I'll remind you guys is at Dan best price d a n b e s b r i s go find me over on the Twitter's so we can figure out what you need to sell to get your hands on Austin Reeves  by the way we just got a Shams report in the middle of this one  Kings All Star Darren Fox is avoided significant injury but has sustained a moderate sprain of his right ankle and he is likely to miss some time  Foxx played through this brain down the stretch of 37 points in a victory over the Lake's on Sunday so I think that probably gives you the answer you want if you're playing him this week he's probably out for at least a week and so roll from that and go forward  the last game on the docket from Sunday night was the Spurs and the Clippers and look guys I got to say  I  I said a bunch of times during Fantasy Draft season that I was petrified  to deal with the San Antonio Spurs petrified  because I had no idea what the rotations were going to look like you have all these guys that have percentages issues if efficiency stuff going on and sure enough  through the first week the Spurs have one player inside the top 100 in nine cat and it's Trey Jones who's averaging 9 points 6 assists and 1.3 Steals and that's the reason is up there is because he's also have the percentages have been okay  Devin vassell is at 115 thanks to free throw percent that's kind of knocking him off the thing but also mostly because he's only scoring  Judy Osman  is the third highest ranked spur  Kelvin Johnson's at 1:56 percentages Victor we said 157 I like the Steals and blocks obviously but the percentages have been atrocious for him  Zach Collins who have kind of liked so far is that 116 and 5 with good defensive stats but if percentages have been bad and he has averaging four turnovers a game that's probably not going to stick but then you got Jeremy Sohan and down near the edge of the top 200  the this is the issue with the Spurs I know they might not all stay this bad but this is why I basically avoided them and this is why  ah  it's really yeah  um  no man San Antonio so on the Clipper side I don't know I don't even know what to say about this Spurs after looking at this stuff I avoid I avoided the whole team  I don't think I have a single spur on any of my fantasy teams I have nine teams I don't think I oh no that's not drives that Collins on a couple  and I'm assuming his turnovers come down they had 25 as a team yesterday that's by the way not very good  and I'm hoping that Colin's turnovers come down because if they do then he does creep his way towards the edge of the top 100 at least but man  for the Clippers Russell Westbrook had a classic West brick game where he did a bunch of really good stuff and then missed all three of his free throws but he does belong on rosters right now  if it's a zubats is off to his typical hotstar he also belongs on rosters and then you got Paul George and Kawhi Leonard doing the heavy lifting up top PG is playing like a man possessed so far he's number seven after the first week  2.7 steals a game sort of a big part of that for him I think he's I don't know that anybody's really all that closed except for like Donovan Mitchell's averaging three and some odd but PG's been really really good of course you're all just kind of waiting for the shoe to drop on when the first injury hits  but until it does  enjoy  by the way uh turning quickly back to that King's game because now that we know that fox is likely to miss a little bit of time  is there anything you do here I think Malik monk is probably rostered already so if you have him you probably just enjoy the Malik monk ride and  yeah I don't think you're picking up Davie on Mitchell though last year when he got some starts he really didn't do very much he needs all the other usage guys to be out too  he might have a game mixed in where he hits a bunch of three pointers but for the most part is his game doesn't really  translate to Fantasy all that well  let's turn back to Saturday on the board there were seven games on Saturday we'll try to move through these at a decent clip because my voice is really feeling the hurt right now but I do want to take a second to remind you guys of our sponsor right now and that is manscaped.com stick with me here for just a second manscape.com look guys I got the whole case out for you look how Sleek that is got a nice

that's actually really really good my wife uses it instead of her own nail stuff  and then this handyman over here is is pretty awesome as well  let's get back into the mix here with a look at Saturday and New Orleans doesn't have a whole lot going on other than herb Jones is looked pretty good through their first couple of ball games CJ McCollum has an unsustainably high number of steals happening right now  um and they you know they just look like a pretty good ball club which they were when Zion was healthy last year so no surprises there the only thing that was surprising for us was the first game they played Jonas Valentine's played 29 minutes and then not surprisingly and this one only 21 I think that's more what you're getting out of JV this year he was a hard pass on fantasy draft night and he remembered he remains a hard pass for me right now herb Jones does belong on rosters so make sure that he's picked up right now he's doing more than just getting steals so hopefully that sticks will see but at the very worst he has a pretty good floor because of the defensive stuff  on the next side after one bad game Mitchell Robinson is posted two good ones he's was one of the guys that I thought was going to be a really easy Center value on fantasy draft night I know he doesn't score at all but he rebounds field goal percent block shots all that stuff is really easy for him to roll into  Josh Hart did have 10 rebounds here but he only played 21 minutes that's not gonna be enough for him he is droppable Quinton Grimes droppable Emmanuel quickly bordering on droppable I don't think you can play them in Roto games cap formats I think you could probably give them a little bit longer on the head-to-head side because he had a couple of good ones before most of the teams sucked in this ball game I mean they almost scored they scored 87 points  but the problem with quickly of course is that his role on a night-to-night basis is not guaranteed  if we could somehow get him into the starting lineup it'd be a really easy call but he's buried behind some guys and he's gonna come in he's gonna be a high usage dude when he's on the court but I mean we're talking about 19 minutes in this ball game that's just not enough so  call it shopping block I haven't dropped him yet but quickly is in a little bit of trouble  Zach LaVine Signs of Life I'll say 51 points in a losing effort in Detroit he needed a Little Help from his friends tomorrow I had 20 points everybody else was pretty bad voices off to a slow start this year the Bulls as a team are off to a crummy start  which is worrisome because I do have some bowls and I need them to not blow it up in January February if we're actually gonna hit any kind of fantasy value this year Kobe White had a Kyle Lowry size stinker in this one to rebounds and want to assist and a turnover in 28 minutes  yikes my friends that's a big fat yikes  so  here's the thing about Kobe White  his game is not nine cat friendly  he can score a little bit he can rebound a little bit he can assist a little bit he gets no defensive stats his field goal percent is low he doesn't shoot that many three balls  and he's playing 33 minutes a game right now and he's outside the top 175 I think he's probably a nine cat drop  if you want to hang on a little bit longer just to see if something comes roaring back for him  have at it go right ahead  I just think you could do more with that roster slot in nine category leaks specially after seeing this terrible game and I don't want this to be recently biased because he was okay the first two but again there's always those big gaps in his Fantasy game  honestly right now I'd rather have Alex Caruso on that team who's not playing nearly as many minutes as white but has made a whole lot better use of them he's number 53 thanks to 3.4 combined defensive stats and oh a game winner in the only game the Bulls won so far this season you don't have to worry about the regulars they're all eventually get it figured out  yeah anyway Detroit who doesn't want to talk about Jalen Duren I want to talk about Jalen Duren he's number 10 in all of fantasy after the first week and that's only because he's averaging three and a half turnovers per game  which is weird for a big man in his role but guess what he's also averaging for assists per game  there's a lot going on with Jalen during that will not last he's averaging 18 points 15 and a half rebounds four assists and 3.4 defensive stats on 80% shooting  but I don't care  he's so much damn fun to roster right now that I like it like like don't even worry about the things that you know are coming down scoring is gonna come down rebounds will come down a little bit of sisal come down a little bit block so come down a little bit  field goal percents coming down a little bit  knowing that  if you can go out there and get yourself someone that is like a reliable 35 or better range fantasy player and I'm not talking about somebody who's inside the top 35 right now I'm talking about somebody who was drafted inside the top 35 and you know they're gonna stick somewhere near there then yeah you go do it but I also wouldn't fought you for just enjoying the ride  because he's been an unreal so far and he's one of the most fun players in fantasy and how much time have we spent on that we dedicated so much time on this show to talking about how fun it is to watch him rebound  and after every game so far I've said if there's a rebounding prop out there that has durian winning it this year I don't think it's that crazy  he's the strongest dude in the NBA and he's 19  that's her Thompson was pretty good in this ball game and he has a really cool Fantasy game  he has a lot of stuff that's gonna hold him back percentages turnovers things like the lack of three pointers  but he rebounds he says he steals he blocked if you can do those four things and you start to add the other stuff around it then the fantasy ceiling is just through the roof  Cade was pretty good not great 25 and 10 is good but a sort of a tray young 25 and 10 won three pointer no defensive stats bad  that turnovers  and then I said Stewart had 14 and 9 which is just enough to buy him a little bit more time on your roster Wizards gotta win they beat Memphis 1 13 106 Daniel Gafford left and came back I think he had a tweaked an ankle this always the thing with him but he played 28 minutes that's all we needed to see double double with two blocks Yay good Jordan Poole off to a really bad shooting start but he did get 27 points in this one so if that's what you were looking for when you drafted him have added but we're also seeing why the bottom can fall out with him 21 shots a game on 37% shooting and he's actually missing his free throws so far too he really can't get a whole lot worse for pool then these first two ball games  I drafted him in exactly zero nine category League's and I feel fine about that because of the way we knew the floor could come out  I did draft him in a points for Matt and I'm fine with what we've seen so far  tyus Jones  solid start nothing spectacular to this point but no problems top 40 numbers after their two games you'll take that  Corey kiss word had 22 points in 32 bench I don't think that's something we get a Repeat Performance nightly so probably ignore that for now  Delon Wright only 20 and a half minutes here but he still managed to do enough 7 assists two Steals and a block I'm sticking with the lawn you guys know I like me Delon Wright and so I'm not backing off of that because the steals the assists and frankly just the defense is stuff they're gonna need from him  from Memphis I was curious how Xavier Tillman would look against a smaller  front court and he didn't get to play as much I think some fouls crept in but it was mostly about matchups Wizards were going to space you out  and Tilghman didn't make a whole lot of sense in that particular build so  you know he had a great start to the year he played two gigantic front courts now I played a smaller one you can pretty much gauge what sort of Fantasy games you're going to get out of Tillman buy this size of the team he's playing against  does he belong on Ross's yeah I think he does  Zyer Williams at a nice game here 1610 with 43 pointers I'm not picking him up after one good ball game but he does deserve at least a sort of a sideways glance can you do it again  we'll see  John conchar played well in 22 minutes but that's not enough time Marcus Smart settling in with his new team so everything else is kind of about what you'd expect  Indie beat Cleveland on the road 12513 these are kind of a zombie Cavs so no one should be too surprised here Evan Mobley and Max strus were the only starters that actually played in this game Donovan Mitchell Darius Garland Jared Allen we're all still out  so you know grain of salt on the calf side I still think Max Drew's is going to be an incredible add this season and I don't think that I'm overselling it he's number 20 by the way  after three ball games despite shooting horribly 37% from the field on 17 shots a game he's just doing all the things  yes he had more usage in this one because Garland and Donovan Mitchell were both out we're not gonna dilute ourselves into thinking that this is the way it's always going to be  but he's out there for maximum minutes  they like his rebounding they like his passing  I think Stu says a chance to be a top 60 top 70 play this year and I don't think I'm going crazy to say that and I think the floor is 12 teams startable like I don't think that there's a worst case scenario that has him as a drop and this is why  and so I'm going to I got a rant a little bit here I gotta pause to rant about something I'm seeing this weird new phenomenon popping up in the fantasy space  suggesting that you should just follow the analysts that like make you feel good about your team know you should follow the analysts that are grinding  the analysts that are legit doing the hard work and there's a good number of us out there  but I'm seeing too many that think they can just sort of parachute in  see a couple of things and make calls on stuff that's not how it works you gotta understand how stats work you need to understand how math works  and you need to understand that  the people that we're lecturing to on podcasts and on Twitter are not in hyper beginner leaks people and Hyper beginner leaks are probably not listening to Fantasy pods or watching fantasy Twitter as closely as we're treating it you're talking to intermediate players  so if you're telling an intermediate player to drop Max screws and I saw that after his slow ball game  that analyst is not paying attention  they could still get it turned around  but that analyst is not paying attention  please I beg of you people  don't fall prey to this strange new sweeping thing that's happening where everybody is  everybody is exactly the same  and in fantasy analysis there are some absolutely brilliant analysts out there and I hope that I've had some of them on this show  but I'm seeing too many that think they can half-ass it and I don't like that it's leading people astray  if you feel like I'm talking to you  this is like the is this about me moment if you feel like it's about you work harder  because we see you we see that bad advice and we know you guys can all do better  so that's my pep talk  don't have acid  let's get in let's get in the freaking weeds here man let's do the hard work  that's how we're gonna win  that's my pep talk sometimes everybody needs a little tough love  as far as the calves go you're not picking up Isaac Coral you're not picking up Dean Wade Charis Levert is kind of interesting I know he did a lot more in this ball game specifically because Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland were out but he actually finished last year playing pretty well and the games he's played with Garland and a Donovan Mitchell even this year he looked okay  he has fantasy issues percentages tend to drag him down it's why he's number one fifty-one because he hasn't hit a shot basically to start the year but I don't think Charis Levert is totally dead in the water at least not yet  folks picture this nightmare scenario  you're hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you

to call you out there's a post in our in the YouTube chat who says who cares if people give out bad advice it's not that deep  this is my existence man  this is how I am trying to pay the bills around here so it matters to me  that's why it might not matter as much to you because you're just playing but to be on the other side of it I have to try to make sure that people are winning daily or they'll stop listening to me  I didn't mean to call you out specifically I think a lot of people probably share that feeling of like who cares is just fantasy sports I cares  anyway Indiana side Aaron neesmith had his  you know once a week explosion  he got himself a whole bunch of power forward minutes this is what we saw last year with Rick Carlyle he's going to mix and match  he has at this point Halliburton Myles Turner and Bruce Brown are the only three players on the Pacers guaranteed minutes on a nightly basis which by the way I know Bruce Brown had a bad ball game but he's a hold because the minutes are there but even bennedict mathurin only played 17 minutes in this ball game he got subbed out bye bye dude if you're not if you're not hauling your weight on this night you're done  so you got more Aaron Nesmith you got more Andrew nem hard you got less buddy hield in this one for whatever reason  I yeah when you hear a guy is on the trade block It's A Hard Sell to try to get me to draft him because I know they don't want him to get hurt there's no reason for them to play him super hard if he's not a part of their future if you have buddy hield you probably just stick it out I don't think you're gonna be able to get proper value right now and just hope that he gets moved to a place where he has a better role  Philly beat Toronto on the front end of their back to back but we already talked about them so let's talk about Toronto precious to chewa heard his groin I'm able to throw that up on the screen for YouTubers so you can see that  no ogn know be in this ball game so Gary Trent got the start and he was fine  Gary Trent is very much a I haven't made up my mind yet on this guy guy yaka Pirtle try to see it through  press it to again heard actually helps Pearl because he was a guy stealing some backup center minutes gradey dick played well  but that's as far as I'm throwing that one and then it looks right like right now like the biggest Miss I've had so far this season is not believing that Dennis Schroder could get off to at least a good start because he really has gotten off to a great start he's hitting three-pointers  no where the hell that all came from Dennis but he's number 75 and 9 cat with bad percentages right now and and that definitely plays  oops didn't see that one coming thought he was gonna do not what he did with the Lakers necessarily but you know Dentistry is long had holes in his Fantasy game he doesn't steal as much as a guy who seems like he should because he's quick  he doesn't shoot three pointers or hasn't in the past typically a good foul shooter field goal percent is kind of fine but I thought we were gonna get some assists and some points and now that was basically it but he's added threes  and he's even at it a little bit of Steel to the mix so far and I don't know if that holds long term but it's holding so far and so to that end I've gotten him very wrong we'll see what happens though over the next couple of weeks does he kind of come back to earth or is this sort of new shooter Dennis neuter  not neuter with a t whatever it's bad nickname Minnesota beat Miami 106.90 this is a zombie Heat team with no Jimmy Butler know Caleb Martin know Kevin Love and Kyle Lowry was still terrible so luckily we can move on from that only interesting story in this ball game I thought was Nas Reed who got 28 and a half minutes despite nobody being out for the Wolves this game not being I mean it was a blowout so NASA a little bit extra late but he was playing a lot regardless  and we know that he can put up massive numbers in limited time  and Notre just one of those guys that I was like you guys remember if you listened over the offseason I was begging someone else to sign him and give him a whole bunch of extra minutes  but he came back to Minnesota  if you know he played 24 ish minutes in the first game for the wolves and then 28 and a half in this one  if I don't think 28 and a half is something we see nightly but 24 25 would actually be enough for Fantasy value for him so I'm gonna go ahead and call Naz Reid a pickup in most formats  and then if you want to wait and see how it goes on the games cap side you have that luxury if you'd rather just drop them in there you probably won't get burned too bad  head-to-head I think you can start him right now  no massive notes on this ball game I avoided most of the big men stuff going on in Minnesota because I really wasn't sure what cat and gaubert would do  with towns the percentages are going to bounce back so he's not gonna average 15 and 10 he's taking 19 shots a game that's actually the important part for him so very much a Bi-Lo on cat  I'm it would take a lot to get him so that is why I'm a little hesitant to call it a Buy Low and then with Anthony Edwards He's number 66 presumably the field goal percent will get a little bit better the field the free throw percent will get a little bit worse so he'll work his way back up into that 30 some odd range probably  Kyle Anderson is a whole Mike Conley quiet hold  let's keep going  Phoenix blew out Utah this was Kevin Durant and the Durant you remember when the Wizards were known as the Jordan airs I wish that we could use that terminology for other teams because Kevin Durant was missing both Booker and Beale again the almost beat the Lakers with just KD they were able to take care of a pretty bad Jazz team who I don't know the jazz beat the Clippers they have some stuff there  but Durant was good this looked more like regular Kevin Durant and if this game wasn't a blowout it really would have been something special Eric Gordon finally had a better shooting ball game and he's sort of your close your eyes and play hymn streamer when both B and Booker are out  Jordan Goodwin is streamable in both of those guys are out Grayson Allen I'd be a little bit more cautious with because he doesn't typically get a whole lot of usage  and then Yusuf nurkic who I don't know I think feel like people got a little bit out over their skis with him after the first good ball game I think he probably settles into that 100 valuation range  which isn't bad but I feel like people wanted more and everybody was like Dan what about Joshua what about he wasn't gonna shoot a billion percent  forever you need that was coming crashing back because  they're just isn't a whole lot else there and at some point I hope we'll get to actually see this team play with their stars together so we can get some data points on that but you know not yet  on the Utah side Ochi abaji got hurt you can see knee contusion there he played only six minutes Walker Kessler another bad one only 23 minutes here and he's gotten off to a really bad start he is both a Buy Low and also a maybe he doesn't get all the way to where he wanted him to go he was getting drafted near 50 which I still think is a pretty okay spot to draft him because I think he's got a chance to beat that  right now you could probably get Walker Kessler for like maybe somebody you drafted in the 80s that's over performing I don't know who that list is I'm just going based on a couple of Twitter polls and all so  the body of work so this is a quick little tangent on on orchestrating trades  and then I know everybody has questions about Chianti George who will talk about in a second here on the Utah side  the longer that Walker Kessler stinks to start the year  the less you'd have to pay to get him  one bad game too bad game three bad games is what we're on right now okay the person that drafted him near 50 is thinking you know what three terrible games I am kind of worried about this I would give him up for  top 75 guy who's playing well  the S2 more bad games you might be able to get him before  top 80 some odd guy who's playing poorly at some point there's gonna be like a lower limit to this and nobody's dropping Walker Kessler but if he if he looks this bad for another week that's when you start you go back to your draft whatever League you're in you go look at the draft results see who got drafted in like the late seventh round see if they're having a really good start to the year and flip them out there and I'm not talking about Jalen Duren because I think you can actually aim higher with Durham I'm talking about somebody else in that range who's playing pretty well not like break the bank awesome but someone that now with you throw them at a walker Kessler manager and say Hey you want somebody who's not a big question mark I'll take your question mark off your hands that's the way that you don't give up all that much and hopefully have a shot at some upside that's that's how it orchestrated by low  I think we can safely call Taylor Norton Tucker a drop thank God because I was getting tired of wandering Jordan Clarkson we've had this conversation a thousand times he doesn't do enough in nine cat to Warrant a roster spot he's outside the top 200 right now everybody so  saying it for a year and everybody keeps yelling at me and I don't know why they keep yelling at me about it  great game for counting George though 27 minutes 12 points 7 boards six assists to steal at a couple of three pointers nice little well-rounded action there  I'm of the mindset that  you can probably make the move  because as we've already talked about it on this show they are two or three guys we were kind of waiting on to see what they were going to be I think I would rather take a shot on somebody who has a better fantasy stat set whose role is a little bit less certain that someone who we know has a crummy Fantasy game like a tail and Horton Tucker whose role seems safer but his Fantasy game stinks or even Jordan Clarkson frankly or Kobe white if you want to go back to some of the games we talked about earlier  if you know somebody has a bad Fantasy game and you know they need like 35 minutes on the court to hit some kind of value why not go for a guy who doesn't need that many minutes and you say you know what we'll ride the bumps we'll see what happens and if it doesn't get there who cares because the guy I drop wasn't helping me anyway  now we play the age-old game of  I do this every week and many of you I'm sure are gonna laugh as soon as I say it who played on Friday but didn't play over the weekend  I never look at this ahead of time I don't know why I always forget to look  at who didn't play but we know somebody didn't play because Saturday was what seven games what did I say seven games on Saturday six games on Sunday there was a back-to-back in there so  you know there are at least four or five teams that I'm going to have to look at here so let's just play the scrolling game  Denver Memphis we talked about Denver and Memphis Detroit Charlotte we did not talk about the Hornets Gordon Hayward is an ad at least until miles Bridges comes back but Heyward looks much more spy this year than last season there was just something it was like playing in molasses last year  he didn't look that at a shape to me but maybe maybe it was that  but he looks ready to rumble and maybe the Hornets coming into the season told him hey we're actually trying to win again this year it's not a Tank season get you get your bleeping legs underneath you and he's good to go Brandon Miller looked really good in this game 17-6 and two you know his role is not guaranteed on a night tonight basis but they did spend their number two pick on him and the beauty of being a rookie that doesn't have to handle the basketball all that much is that you can get to Fantasy value a little bit easier  so I would say he's another kind of upside play to take a shot on if you want to add Brandon Miller if you didn't get drafted throw him at the end of your bench Rodeo Games cap you don't play him you sit on him you squat on it for a little bit Mark Williams was bad he was in foul trouble though 2 points and three boards on 5 fouls see if you can buy low on him  I doubt it because he started the year with a good ball game so people are like man I got a good one I don't care about the bad one but maybe somebody's thinking is this gonna happen every night and the answer is no uh but I will remind you all that running up to the season when people ask me of those later centers which ones do I like the most I said Gafford I said Duran and then I had Williams behind them because I thought you know what I'm a little worried that PJ Washington plays some small ball Center on the Hornets  he got himself ejected by the way uh probably not a huge concern there I think Williams is going to be fine but if you were hoping for like top 50 top 60 you might have been stretching it a little bit he'll be a solid second Center  top 100 top 90 sure why the hell not  all right what else do we got on this thing Nicks and Hawks we  talked about  did we talk about the Hawks  or did I write about the Hawks know we talked about him yeah we talked about the Hawks I'm playing a very silly game right now we didn't talk about Boston but there's basically nothing there because they've got Derek white dominating Jalen Brown off to kind of a slow start Tatum awesome porzingis awesome and who am I forgetting oh Drew holiday he's been pretty good too  Oklahoma City Cleveland we talked about Houston San Antonio we talked about I know there's a few more teams here at Chicago Toronto we talked about  Brooklyn and Dallas we didn't talk about Brooklyn or Dallas we just got word earlier this morning that cam Johnson is likely to be out at least another week to week and a half  so that means cam Thomas time continues ladies and gentlemen  he took his spot in the starting lineup and he ran with it now if Cam Thomas gets cold be very afraid but he's got that starting gig right now and  he's gonna score a bunch  really good start to the year for Ben Simmons ride that out Spencer didn't witty bounced back here he belongs on rosters there was no Nick klaxon in this game either so Dorian Finney Smith got the small ball started Center and everybody hoping to stream day Ron Sharpe got kicked right in the Nads  this is all so a really high scoring game I'm not adding Lonnie Walker I'm not adding Dorian Finney Smith I'm not adding really so Neil and games cap formats if we find out Nick's in his out for a few more games maybe you look at Dorian Finney Smith maybe but even then you could get caught with your pants down because dude played 32 minutes only took eight shots and we got kind of lucky that he made four three-pointers Camp Thomas Ben Simmons Spencer Dinwiddie Mikhail Bridges those are probably the guys you're playing right now while cam Johnson and Claxton are hurt  Mavericks we haven't had a good game from Kyrie Irving yet which is kind of nice I don't think you can buy low on Kyrie because he was already going kind of low um  but if you could I would because you know he's coming around as soon as Luca decides he's not going to go thermonuclear  I also warned you guys Derek Lively is an ad but the minutes are gonna bounce around and there was no Dwight Powell in that first game because of a flu so pal came back he took 13 minutes Maxi Cleburne played 26 Jason kids gonna mix and match at that Center Spot  and Grant Williams is someone I do want to track a little bit I don't think that he's an ADI had five fouls in 29 minutes of this ball game  I think there there's an outside shot he gets inside the top 100 outside like 25% but at least keep one eye on him in case that does happen  Clippers Jazz we talked about magic we haven't talked about yet Jalen Suggs and Cole Anthony tend to have a tough time he'll existing they each had an okay game here so that's something I guess I have trouble playing either of them in a game's cap format head-to-head you could probably play both  you're not adding more Wagner despite the nice ball game he went eight for eight not sustainable Markle faults is a little bit of a by low but at the same time he's really more like a top 85 9 cat guy so just make sure you know what you're getting into  and Wendell Carter Junior is someone that I drafted precisely zero places because I don't like centers who don't get defensive stats  no he's not going to be as bad as he's been he's outside the top 200 he'll Claus way back right near the edge of the top 100 just like he did last year in the year before and blah blah blah blah blah  not a guy I'm targeting what a Carter Jr  but if you can get him for like a 120 type plotter then maybe you at least upgrade your plotter a little bit  whatever  Portland we talked about Warriors Kings we've talked about and that's it ladies and gentlemen  but it's not our look ahead we still have Monday to look ahead too whoopsies yeah we're looking at the basketball monster board because it's the easiest one to fit on a screen  let's look at Monday real quick I don't know if we're gonna have a ton of time for chat room we'll go lightning round on those as fast as humanly possible here's what's coming up tonight though as we get near the hour mark and my voice is really struggling Boston nothing  um I don't well I don't not really paying attention much on the Boston side in terms of  wizards  well keep an eye on Gafford he looked better in their last ball game and we'll keep part of an eye on Corey kispert for the Bulls Kobe white we just talked about I'd love to know if Alex Caruso can lock in some minutes a little bit more long-term  he seems to get hurt though so that may be the thing kind of holding him back for the Pacers you're just watching all those Wing rotations for the Nets we just talked about cam Johnson being out so cam Thomas  Hornets we just talked about Gordon Hayward and Brandon Miller are the two guys you're watching there for the Blazers DeAndre eight and his kind of your by low otherwise we've already talked about Malcolm Brogden being a place and sharp as a play  Jeremy Graham blah blah Raptors I still am having trouble believing that this is the new dentist shooter that he hits like three three-pointers a game at numbers gotta come down  so what is he going to be when this all settles Gary Trent yakka Turtle the other guys you're watching their nasre on the wolves  Jalen Johnson saddiq Bey DeAndre hunter or the three guys you're keeping tabs of on the Atlanta Hawks as we try to move through this board relatively quickly here on the lookahead portion ah for the Pistons I mean I hate to say it because you guys know how much I adore Jalen Duren but he is very much  uh a sell High  I know I say it and I just feel bad as I'm saying it  but it's the truth he's a sell high right now because it's not gonna get any better than this for Jalen Duren and  I mean you could probably get a third rounder for him right now  or you roll the dice and hope he does it for another week and then aim for a second rounder anyway let's keep going um Thunder nothing Mavericks Derek Lively versus Dwight Powell versus Maxi Cleburne Grant Williams who just talked about that  and Kyrie off to kind of a slowish start for the Grizzlies Xavier Tillman against this smaller front courts that's the thing they're playing a smaller front court now Memphis dealing with Dallas in this one Zyer Williams is worth tracking I don't think you need to add him yet  but the Warriors Andrew Wiggins is he bad now or is he the biggest bile of all time or is it somewhere in the middle probably in the middle Draymond adding minutes I assuming he's playing in this ballgame what does that do to Chris Paul that's the biggest thing for me herb Jones on the pills is my thing I'm watching because he really has looked good so far to start this year for the heat sounds like Josh Richardson might be back we got that news earlier this morning does he become kind of a big point guard instead of Kyle Lowry because he ain't going anywhere with Kyle Lowry as the full-time point guard he's just too old he doesn't have any juice left man  keep one eye on Richardson  it good really it could happen for the Bucs Brooke Lopez by low for the Jazz Walker Kessler by low  probably some drops there we talked about tht and Clarkson nuggets nothing Magic  love to see Jonathan Isaac's Menace get to 20 but I don't think it's happening and then sort of the Cole Anthony Jalen sucks stuff we just talked about and then Mark helps he's started do for a better ball game  Lakers Austin Reeves could not throw a stone in the ocean I know you guys love when I say that dumb expression  he's been horrible so far he is presented his was one of the reasons that you drafted him and they haven't been there  but they will be  that makes him a Bi-Lo and I think that's it for the lookahead  let's see if we can get to a few questions from the chat room here there's a lot of them and we're already over the hour mark so we're not going to get to even close to all of these guys let this be a lesson to my lovely live viewers to please get your questions in fast  although to be fair most shows won't be an hour long weekend recap so most of the time we'll have 10 15 minutes for questions today we'll do about maybe five or six and then I'm going to go rest my voice until the afternoon  Christopher Scott is asking for an update on Devin Booker with the note I'm playing a weekly lineup for the first time this year and it's sucks I have no control anxiety levels are through the roof it's awful not being able to move guys in and out when they get hurt or sit yeah I mean you're not wrong but  we'll talk more about this type of stuff on the afternoon show  so that's my my teaser there Chris sorry I'm not answering it on this morning's one because I have a bunch more prep to do before the afternoon in terms of everybody's schedules and when the games are happening and who's playing who and all that good stuff so there's your teeth to come back and watch again this afternoon let's see if I can zip through here how David says how long do you think we have to wait until kongu will be startled and Roto so you could get away with it now it's not he hasn't been a complete disaster he's number 129 in nine cat  which again that doesn't sink your team you know 9.4 Boards of Steel 61% shooting it's not good  but you could legitimately start him now and it wouldn't be the end of the world or you could just wait until capella goes down I don't think I'd wait that long I think you probably play him and just take the low end lines on unless you're falling way behind in your game's cap  Delante says what do you make of keyonte George is he destined to start sooner rather than later this does feel a little bit like analysts pleading for a thing that's not gonna happen as fast as we want it to I still think he's a speculative add though  that's keyonte George  DJ says need rebounds who's a good trade Target I have lamelo Trey young and Darren Fox to trade not sure which one to trade away  I don't know maybe those are trading away pretty big name guys Fox just got hurt  rebounds near the top of the board I mean you could sort of blows up your team build to trade those guys but you know if you wanted to trade like a Trey young for an Anthony Davis at the top or lamelo for Anthony Davis I don't think I could kill you I would say DeAndre ayton is your target for rebounds because you can buy low on him and you could do it with guys that are far worse than lamelo Trey young or deer and fox  if Lively this is Kenneth asks if Lively post monster numbers how realistic is it to Bi-Lo on Aiden probably not all that realistic sorry I think you're gonna need a little bit more than that  Ryan says eight cat Rodeo would you drop any of Jakob Pearl Markle faults Brook Lopez or Jeremy Grant for Jalen Johnson or Xavier Tillman  no I don't think I would  Wayne says hey Dan Anthony Melton was dropped is he a pickup my back end guys are Dylan write Dennis Schroder on Yoko when do Carter Jr need assistance Steele's help  well if you need assistance deals you're probably not dropping Dylan right are you all though he would have been my call here it's probably one Del Carter Jr which he's gonna get picked up because he's going to be a top 100 Guyanese  six of one half dozen I guess do you want to go meltan over Dillon right as slightly safer steals Guy  oh well Roto ball says I messed up my draft I took little mellow at 9 instead of Damian Lillard I try my best to get Lillard or just ride with it I think you should just ride with it  uh Wayne T says I dropped Derek Lively for on Yakko kangwoo is dropped over the weekend was this the right move yes that was the right move very good  Zoe Lala says the B150 had Rudy gobert number 125 now remember that's by totals  so go bare might be in the 70s at the end of the year on a per game basis but if he misses 20 ball games that's how he ends up low I'm not that low  I'm not high on gobert I think he probably does finish in the 60s 70s range um I'm not quite as low as Brew was on on Rudy I think he doesn't trust his health I trusted a little bit more than that so I think he probably does end up inside the top one hundred so that's a an area where we I think agree on the per game side and disagree on the total side  young says who's the one drop  in out of this list in nine cat Rodeo faults Wendell Carter Kobe white Derek Lively Gordon Hayward it's probably Kobe White  it might be Derek Lively  ABS as finally made it to the live show who's the better streamer for the magic this week Suggs vs Mob Wagner versus Colin Anthony I probably trust Cole Anthony the most out of those three it's a little bit of a toss-up  and a son says do you think Fox plays this week I think we got news that he probably doesn't from Shams a little bit back just in case you missed that  should I drop Kobe white or Jeremy Sohan for keyonte George I think I dropped Kobe white I think I drop either of them frankly I want the guy that has an interesting stat set might stink but the other two guys are hurting you right now  also didn't witty versus Kobe white I'll go Spencer Dinwiddie  doo doo doo doo keonte is he a rookie ball handler yes sword  sword art they have a bunch of ball handlers on that team I don't think it just gets turned over  is Nikola jovic and Adam over Grayson Allen this has to be a deeper League the answer is  maybe I don't think either one of them is I don't think that helps you very much though  whose a good Target if I want to sell Levine after the 51 points targeting assists and percentages  so  you're going to need more to get to Darius Garland but there's your assists guy there aren't that many other assists guys in that same range but Zach LaVine is actually going to be pretty good for your percentages so I don't know that I would move him after one good ball game you probably want to probably want to just sit on it  hey Dan would you drop Tillman shade and sharp or Melton  for okongwu or Walker Kessler I would indeed drop Tillman for Kessler  and I don't think I would drop one of the other two for a Kong whoo right now I think if he's on the wire in your league he's probably gonna stay there until we hear anything about Clint capela  you guys think save your Tillman can push 29 minutes against the Mavs tonight it's a little bit more of a DFS kind of question but my guess would be no because the Mavs are gonna spread them out Lucas gonna drag every Center out to the perimeter and it's gonna be hell for Tillman  trade Maxi high before Harden comes back no I don't think I would trade Maxi because I think if eventually Harden's gonna get traded anyway so I think you want the Tyrese Maxey that could go top 25 top 30 even if you have to wait through the some crapper James Harden games  yellow momma keonte Kobe white the Anthony Melton choose two players all go Kiante and Melton everybody else is higher on Kobe white than I am he makes more sense I guess on the head-to-head side but  the the field goal percent the lack of defensive stats like he's not gonna score 20 he's gonna be probably average in scoring at the very best he'll be maybe slightly better than average in a CIS and then sub-average and rebound like I don't care about a guy that gets me 15 for and five if there's nothing else I need more than that in category leaks  then there's the question here and it's something we talked about a little bit early on who's the pickup on the Kings if you know if with Fox going down for a little bit of time it's not Davey on Mitchell it's probably just more Malik monk Mitchell's gonna play more but his Fantasy game doesn't really Translate um that is unfortunately as much time as my voice can give I'm
