welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast it's happened to people  it's Wednesday  March 27th  baseball season starts tomorrow  which I'd say this every year on the Wednesday before the Thursday before of Baseball season starting and I have no idea if even one of you out there gives a crap but I do I don't play Fantasy Baseball I just like baseball I like watching it I like watching it as a fan I worked in minor league baseball for a decade as a play-by-play broadcaster and assistant general manager I just have a lot of connections to baseball and it was the first believe it or not it was actually the first sport that I fell in love with as a kid my mom  everybody assumes that like kids who love sports get it from their dads which is not actually the case my mom is the big Sports nut of my two parents my dad may he rest in peace was the most neurotic sports fan of all time I've never met anybody as neurotic as my father about sports and so okay example of how my of my father's Neurosis my dad used to tape he really only cared about UCLA so we went to undergrad um you really only cared about UCLA Sports and he would tape UCLA basketball and football games  not to necessarily watch them later but to check the score  on however you know whatever year it was you figure out how you check the score newspaper end of night Sports recap on ABC or whatever and if they his team won then he would go back and watch it if they lost it he wouldn't even watch it wouldn't even go back and watch you wanted to know how the game ended before watching it to  spare him the fear of sitting through a close loss  anyway so my dad traveled a bunch when I was a little kid so I was mostly at home with my mom during those years and she would you could buy tickets online this was like the mid to late 80s  so she found this little a Dodger Stadium they used to sell tickets to the game at little stands in the parking lot and she found one there was like this little all kind of secret one that never had a line you could always just go there and talk to the person forever and figure out all the stuff and she'd buy these little she'd pick you know four or five games throughout the season and we'd sit way up if any of you guys have been to a Dodger Stadium but there is an upper upper upper deck at that joint that is just like you're scraping the freaking clouds and when I was a kid it was like four dollars to sit up there  now it's like  it's like 45 or 50 to sit in these crap crap seats that are so high up and we'd go to a handful of games every year so I fell in love with baseball first because it was more affordable  and my mom my mom actually loves baseball and basketball too but we didn't go to them any basketball games I and and you guys heard we talked about it with Ryan Ward on the show from really this week I fell in love with basketball when I was like 10 11 that's when I started to care about whoops  so baseball was always a thing and so this day before opening day for baseball is actually a very exciting for me I love it  tomorrow gets rolling  games all day it's gonna be a blast so a happy almost baseball day and a happy fantasy NBA Day to you all and NBA Today festy NBA today day  I'm Dan best purse this is a sports ethos presentation fun show today we got a visit from the doctor Hall of Famer Steve Alexander that's coming up here in about 45 seconds he and I are doing battle in the 30p finals the original 30 deep  the industry Titans a fantasy basketball from the last 25 years of fantasy basketball I can't believe they let me into this thing but now I think I've kind of made an impact I've made the finals two years in a row and I'm almost definitely going to get my butt waxed in the finals two years in a row first by Panda here from ethos  the beat down came from inside the building and this year I'm gonna get clubbed by Steve Alexander  I know the indignity of it all I got a win one  and then we'll go over yesterday's card which is pretty short one um a couple pieces of news today before we get to our chat with Dr a Mitchell Robinson has been upgraded to questionable and is expected to play for the New York Knickerbockers this evening as they take on the Raptors in Toronto what we don't know is what the ramp up is going to look like and we might get that information as today unfurls a little bit my expectation would be for a guy who's been out for almost the entire season with a brutal ankle situation is that they're probably not gonna be pushing him too hard my guess would be 12 to 16 minutes here in this first game back so if you if you're thinking about doing something on the head side I wouldn't unless a very weird situation arises uh in that like  I have I have one team where I've Mitchell Robinson's stashed in an eel spot and have for a very long time and if someone else gets ruled out in the middle of today then you know I might as well just drop that guy and put Robinson in my lineup because like you don't want to take a 0  otherwise you know it's not like you're  it's not like you're you're doing something you're not picking him up in head-to-head rodo I think you can make a pretty good case to stash Mitch Robb because he was the starter before he went down and I've ever used to believe that that's the end goal for them is to get him back to that point and frankly 24 25 minutes of Robinson is enough for him to make an impact on the fantasy side and that could very well happen over the next seven to ten days  I don't know how slowly they're gonna bring him along for the next they have a back-to-back Thursday Friday next week and Thursday Friday of the very last week he almost definitely won't play in that back-to-back or half of it I should say so let's say you know 15 ish minutes today then like 18 and 18 maybe again and 20 and then 22 and one after that back to back so maybe you get like four or five pretty good Center games out of him on the Roadhouse side and I think that's probably worth it the other news of the morning this is a great morning for guys coming back Donovan Mitchell is expected to be back on Friday for the Cavaliers so the carriage Levert experience is basically over milk one more game out of him and you know if it's head-to-head you probably just have to ride it out but Roto this is your last chance there Drew holiday is he practiced I think the hope is that he'll be back  by tomorrow for the Celtics we don't know for sure but if he was a practice then you'd think he's probably coming back Celtics can rest guys if they want but they don't have another back-to-back until that last last week Thursday Friday right now starting tomorrow they go every other day through Tuesday April 9th  so and they weren't resting guys in the non back to back before this so with holidays it's an actual real injury he comes back Payton Pritchard  is probably done all the I guess we have to wait and see if if Derek white is back all so good news on Drew holiday good news on Donovan Mitchell good news on Mitchell Robinson Library Market is expected to play again for Utah I played in their last one but there's always a question mark there so really good news on the injury front a lot of guys coming back and with that this feels a great time for me to once again try out this technique I've just figured out how to do which is to drop a pre-recorded video into a live video so let's sit tight here and let me figure this out  my tech skills are through the roof right now I'm recording hits in video and audio at the same time  although I think I may have actually forgotten to turn on the audio part of the recording now I'm recording in video and audio at the same time I can do this really I can't very excited today to bring on the person who's about to I was gonna try to use like the kids lingo but I would mess that I would totally mess that up I was gonna say that you were gonna Sun me I think sunning someone that's like a thing right the kids these days with their words the great doctor a recently inducted into the Hall of Fame is now going to wipe the floor with me in 30 deep so I think I'd have him on the podcast so we can clown on me in person see what's going on man how are you son and somebody's anything like like a Victor woman dad block I think probably so he just stands there and doesn't jump and a guard tries to throw it up over even he just grabs it and takes off that it looks like a dad with his five-year-old with the playground  hadn't heard it called that that's actually that's absolutely brilliant and wonderful yeah because that's like as a as a whopping five foot eight adult that's the only person that I can do that to is my seven year old son who that's what that's what it's like watching women Garden that's like 511 or six to yeah or even like some of these six six six seven guys for him it's out of control I'm gonna need one me to continue to rest for you if that's okay just can I like submit that to to HR for approval can we get one to sit one more ball game  I don't want to talk about that I'm  so my only hope  so so yeah first of all before we get into 30 Depot you have any idea what this is  that is a very large stack of papers and I'm assuming it's just people that want your autograph for the Hall of Fame  those are brackets  it's my  it is my hand graded 130 person NCAA bracket pool oh Lord what have you done doctor hey what have you done with yourself literally the dumbest thing I've ever done they need you need to say get somebody to set up some sort of online submission process that can take care of this for you this is your whole day is there something like that is there is there a website out there that could actually run that for me probably I mean there's a million man I know Live friends viewers if you'd like to set up a well I mean obviously you could like have them do it through a thing but if you want your own there's probably someone watching or listening that could just set that up  like well Dr Ray bracket when I started this pool when I moved here there were like 15 people in it and half of them were just you know older country folks that didn't have cell phones or didn't have the internet  and we were like we're just gonna make this paper and cash and that's the way it's going to be we're going old school and that was 20 years ago and now there's 130 people in it and it's still old school and every year I'm like no I'm not doing this next year we are going online you can pay however you need to pay but for some reason I keep getting sucked back in because I write this crazy email after every round you breaks down all the standings and makes fun of all my friends and people seem to really like that but oh yeah it's those ridiculous I don't even have time to make fun of people anymore I'm just trying to get the information recorded and like nine hours and it's it's awful  you need a steward some sort of like some sort of Ward to help you with the the paperwork here that way you can focus on the clowning email because that's what people are all in it for let's be honest I need an auditing team you do all right you guys heard it out there I mean or you will it's a recording So eventually you'll all hear it you guys want to help Steve with auditing brackets hit us up I bet you we get somebody to come out of the woodwork here and help it's too late we're down we're down to the down Nitty Gritty it's easy grading now man that's that it's that Thursday Friday oh initial hit that that's the one that's the one man  oh where is insurmountable amount of work I did you there goes your there goes your midday nap man you're cooked I'm still recovering from grading all night Friday into Saturday yeah bye let's start 30 talking to of course the great doctor a at Doctor a with a K in there you're looking for a month social media uh Steve you somehow drafted just this team like it's very hard I feel like I need to backtrack a little bit so if the first of all 30 is the original Mega industry 30 team fantasy league it's been hosted for Outlaw you you and Bruce started this one like I think Bruce Jenner started this league together and like 2006  yeah and it's got all the heavy weights from the last 20 to 30 years of fantasy basketball I'm very fortunate that I was allowed into this thing I think somebody dropped out like six years ago and I was able to sneak their spot so good for me I have not made the finals in two consecutive years I lost to Mike pasador fellow Sports ethos in last year and now I'm most likely gonna get my ass kicked by you this season uh the thing about 30 deep before we talk about what you and I are staring down here is that and people that haven't played a 30 Team league probably don't have this sort of feeling in the back of their their head yet but once you get past the fifth or sixth round you're you're sort of debating between whether or not you take some sort of wild long shot or someone you're like I think this guy's gonna play like 22 minutes of ball game and like get 80 games under their belt and just see if I can kind of plug in a thing and now here at the end of the year all of a sudden your Rashawn Holmes and your Payton Pritchard are each playing full starters minute it's right at 30 deep playoff time your team was already a top seed before those guys started doing anything  how on Earth what what hope do I even have to win two out of three weeks from you like my only hope is that when Yama misses the entire week I think  I mean cam Thomas and women Yamaha well let's start let's talk about our teams sure so my back court  turned out to be really really strong I got deer and fox it was like my second pick I think after women Yamaha I think I think women yeah I'm at 16  I ended up with the Aaron Fox and then I got Kobe white late like I don't have draft results pulled up but like something like 120 130th and Kobe white has had a great year for the Chicago Bulls so my point guards are fox and white and that that's that's tough to beat in this league because  it's hard to get to really good point guards if you don't take them early  and then I took a flyer on cam Thomas  and he's nothing but points but when he plays he racks him up  and then Austin Reeves  for the Lakers nice little  mid pick for me and then it's so well rounded because I only have women Yuma but I took  that Colin's who when we sits that Collins is pretty good and they played together for a lot of the year as well I picked up Reshawn Holmes somewhere along the way and I don't know how or why but he became relevant like  eight games ago a couple weeks yeah at the perfect perfect moment I'm by the way I'm looking at the draft results now your mid your mid draft is uh just destroying in a way that like so you got Kobe why at 126 and Zach LaVine was out what three weeks into the season so that one immediately became a monster you got cam Thomas and 186 and then immediately he stepped into a bunch of stuff Payton Pritchard you drafted at 2:35 and all the sudden now he's a Goliath and like you said we picked up Rashawn Holmes Austin Reeves you got it at 66 Darren Fox at 36 we have third round reversal and that Zach Collins at 1:15 so like  you got this this reasonable base and then you rounded it out with hits in the 5th in the seventh now in the 8th and the pickup like yeah I mean you know I your middle you add paper you had Payton Pritchard with no Drew holiday to Kobe white and deer and fox and like that that's that's gonna be tough that's gonna be like if I'm healthy this team is is almost impossible to be I think yeah yeah that's what I'm staring down the barrel of my only hope and I don't people I even want to say my team my team is fine so it's weird to say that about a team that's that's in the finals right now my team is fine I do what I always do in 30 deep which is I draft generally older guys that have fallen too far and it works basically every single year I'm in the top I mean the playoffs because they're gonna be like decent enough I'm generally never gonna have a terrible team so Kyrie I got a 14 demo at 47 Brook Lopez it's 77 Chris Paul at 104 Jaden McDaniels at 137 kcp at 164 Alex Caruso  one ninety seven was probably my best pick in there and then Pat connaughton to 224 my starting eight for our playoff battle is my top eight picks from draft night I don't know that I didn't pick up anybody all season long and I basically didn't drop anybody all season long My Hope was that someone like a Trey Lyles who was hurt to start the year would do some stuff and he did now he's heard again and Kevin Love was kind of a flyer but like I took a bunch of older ish dudes that were getting drafted a little bit too late and again I just kind of floated my way to a solid regular season record I I was the one seed for a while and then Kyrie got hurt and I fell to the three but I've plowed my way through the playoffs but my team just doesn't have any of that upside of my like seventh eighth ninth round guys just dramatically turned into monsters two weeks ago so I have no idea how how do I have a shot what I needed was for Rashawn Holmes and Payton Pritchard to stop being awesome for you but that doesn't appear to be something that's about to happen unless Duality comes back for the Celtics or it's it's funny man so many people in this league are making moves like all the time they're picking up guys dropping guys picking them up and they're literally like these scrubs from the bottom of the earth that have never even heard of like like that dude that's playing for is it the Pistons right now that that guy that's got the impossible name to say hello yeah i don't even I don't even Tomball or something I I butcher it every time I need to go and like I got to listen to their broadcast team do it what I'd love is for every team to send out a pronunciation guide to the world so we know that we're getting it right like who believe was one that took a while before everybody knew that where the accents were on that but yeah like I don't do those pickups right time for them I made one move in 30 deep this year was on November  27th we're not only  I dropped Joe Harris and picked up Rashawn Holmes  and it's and it's could not have worked out any more perfectly got traded still didn't play around just he just wrecked Joe Kaiser last week in our final four matchup like Sean Holmes had had such a great week last week he's off to a great start against you this week yeah 14 and 15 with a steel little block on great percentages he's crushing people he has 45 rebounds in his last three ball games  this is a guy gonna be lucky  yeah I'd be lucky in 30 feet man I mean honestly I think you'd probably still beat me even if we're Sean Holmes wasn't going nuts right now but I feel like I would at least have a like a fleeting prayer of getting through it without an injury to your team I right now my prayer as I as I look at the standings is I gotta win both percentages I don't really I don't think I have any shot without winning both  steals  threes  turnovers is probably like my best path or maybe assists turnovers because I don't I don't think I've won turnovers in one matchup all year  yeah I'm losing I'm losing those right now but only because one being Camp Thomas sat out on Monday correct so that would flip but also if those guys played you'd be beating me in three pointers so that would also flip I would also be chasing you pretty hardness  if wimby and Camera playing yeah that would probably be around a tie I think I'm up nine yeah I'm up nine right now those guys together probably would have gotten pretty close to that I would think somewhere between like six and twelve oh yeah and on on paper man it looks like I'm gonna beat you but you know when be still has a big Red Cross by his name cam Thomas has a big Red Cross by his name  and I'll tell you what though talking about wimby I mean people sick of hearing about Wendy yet is he jumped the shark like Caitlin Clark or Dion or Kelsey and Taylor Swift I don't think he's there yet um no no but the thing about wimby is I took you with my first her second pick  in almost every League I drafted this year I was one of those things where it was like me and Ellie De La Cruz in baseball this year I don't care who is in the league and what else is happening this dude's gonna be on my team and that was my that was my  that was my windy this year and  he  carried this team all the way here and he had helped I mean it's a well-rounded healthy good team but when be  I will take him with the number one pick and every draft I mean next year I don't care I got him at 25 this year and you'd go number one next year  I will take him number one yes Mmm Yeah I don't think you're alone by me  I will take him over yokich I will take him over sabonis I will take him over SGA I'll take him over Luka  I feel like we're building a green eggs and ham poem right now can we do this yeah would you take them over Luca would you take him over I'll figure out a rhyme I wasn't ready for it there no yes you are correct I will take him take him over anyone Sam I am  yeah we're  all right Doc before I let you go uh Silly Season stuff besides Rashawn Holmes is there anything you're looking at here over these last two and change weeks of basketball that hasn't already shaking itself out I know it's a big open-ended question and the answer might be if that but is there any like is there any way to really prepare for what we've seen particularly out of places like Memphis although now they got Bane and back or Portland where they're going full like Julie roster now  anything else to do with this point besides just react and set your lineups like 12 seconds before the game start yeah you just gotta watch the you got to watch the news feed you gotta Watch The Wire uh Luca was a game time called last night I panicked  I went SGA in my DFS lineups instead and then beefed up a little bit with Keegan but  Murray it didn't really work out but yeah anytime a player on a good team is playing in a back-to-back you have to be very worried about it  because Denver and Boston have no reason to run their guys out there every night they are done they're at home they're coasting they're better than everybody else  you can just gonna sit out some games  and PJ's going to sit out some game is Jamal Murray's already missed a couple Boston's gonna see two guys every night the rest of the way I think  this Delano Banton kid in Portland I picked him up like a month ago and a couple weeks and  he's like the silly Seasons superhero at this point like he is  he might be the silly season MVP he's been so freaking good  and then the other thing about this season that strikes me is who knew the Donte divincenzo and um Grayson Allen  were not only going to be  Ballers and like impact players and championship winning caliber fantasy players but has anybody ever seen those two alone in the same room together are they the same dude it's just a Just For Men hairstyle away between the two of them  yeah and they're both just white Ballers I mean I don't know man I can't I I can't get my head around the fact that Grayson Allen has been yeah good all year even playing in that stacked lineup and then they even chenzo has had these explosions and has been worth having all year then next team that we might see Unleashed a load of unknowns that might be worth picking up might be Washington I don't know but it seems like this shutdown  the shutdown thing is not as  prevalent as it once was like the fact that Desmond Bane and Jaron Jackson Jr playing basketball right now Bob's my mind yeah that's kind of nice because Memphis had a stretch there where everybody was gone but now they've they've sort of pivoted back into a more reliable lineup in the last week and a half or something like that so it was almost like they had their Silly Season February to early March in of late March to early April it's very weird I mean at least a lot of head dead leagues if you end up three four weeks in advance you dodge a lot of this stuff that I think the thing that drives everybody nuts is like you know what you talked about with Boston and Denver the teams that are up near the top that are now resting Superstars where it's much more clear and Drew holiday might actually be heard in Boston so I don't want to take that one off the table but everybody else skipping a game you and I also have a lot of work left to do because  we're going all the way the end of the season with this thing we have we have this week plus two more weeks a facing each other and they don't have a lot of options on our bench to play and it's a weekly lineup league so you got to set it on Monday night and then let it go and you know everybody could sit out that last week for both of our teams so who knows what's gonna happen but I do know that it's an honor and a privilege to be in the finals with you and I like wish you luck and if I get beat by you I get beat by you and if I don't win my second 30 deep title I may never recover from it but at least I'm in the GD Hall of Fame so whatever damn right damn right well I think you've got this one in the bag I think I'm set to be the always a bridesmaid of 30 deep losing in the finals two consecutive years I don't know has anybody done that in the 30d history probably it's a ignominious is my using that right on her for me to have two people have won it twice Stroud and my gallery  or both won twice however one in back to back years so he was in the finals back to back here's but you I think you're the only non-winner to be in the finals Back The Years I bet you can't have done that I bet you can always get at 30 you and him both and have a good way of drafting 30 teams yeah I got to get over the hump though man I  I need some luck we may not that last week the silliest of the weeks might not matter if you just smoked me two weeks in a row here and then you you don't have to think about it but I will continue to watch I will continue to pray and I will continue to hope that I get a monster game tonight out of  I don't know Chris Paul gonna get more than 22 minutes from my team my teams going the wrong way it sounds stupid but if Wendy plays I don't know I don't know how I don't know how you're going to be me and when we just checks out he's already won the Rookie of the Year he plays for great job of it he's got it by my ankle if he just sits they shut him down we got a battle yeah that's I that's my that's my hope I'll be watching the wire and I can't say that I'm rooting for when be not to play but I kind of  no that's rule number one about fancy basketball dude you never root for injuries to your opponents now you do not you'll be punished Karma comes back tenfold and then you're then it's then it's a long long way out of that hole you don't want to root for injuries but no no injury just like a day where is there yeah I mean I wouldn't be imposed to it that's not rooting for an injury that's just being real yeah just like stuck in the snow or something aren't they in Utah or something like that I don't know if it's snowing there right now but you know just like getting to the arena bench now little unfortunately when he is is got a little better Minds a little head on his shoulders and the under eighteen little snow in the driveways not gonna keep him away from the NBA game I know damn it I know but a man can dream well yeah he is the Great Hall of Famer Dr a Steve Alexander as we do battle in 308 thank you as always my man hey good to talk to you I'll see you later  yeah that was the great doctor a d o c k e r a on Twitter Dr a make sure you're spelling it right if you're going and finding the man you guys already found him who the hell am I kidding but whatever maybe there's one of you out there that hasn't  let's segue now into talking about yesterday's card quickly a reminder to please follow many of you are watching on social media right now it's at Dan Vespers on Twitter and like rate and subscribe I like to try to do these shows as if there is one new listener every single day so if it's you  hi  welcome its really nice it's a pleasure to have you around  suck fantasy basketball let's talk box score Golden State whipped Miami pretty good yesterday they did not have Jimmy Butler and that played a role Klay Thompson back into the starting five  did that have anything to do with trayce Jackson Davis being out I'm gonna say probably not I think Brandon pajam ski they feel like he's kind of hit a little bit of a wall and Clay's been getting his legs underneath him here second half of the Season kind of like last year really so I'm going to assume that this continues trayce Jackson Davis who again did not play as someone you probably hold on to if you need big man stats and you can whether the free throw issue  he is  you know probably a little bit in that stat hunting department where you know what you're getting and you're getting a few that are very very good and you just have to be okay with the stuff that's not but Andrew Wiggins is the other question mark he's been very reliably in that like 13 to 17 points and like four to seven rebounds they just happened to kind of come together with a better ball game here 1772 blocks on good percentages I still think he's more of a hundred to 150 range Guy where you you play Wiggins if you need points a few boards and a couple of defensive stats and don't mind what he typically does to your percentages Draymond punt Points Guy kaminga yeah I mean you know we've got his issues as well Chris Paul has been trending down here lately I'm gonna call him a soft hold but he's not a you know where it's so close to the end of the year that you're not risking very much if you do end up dropping him for somebody doing more I'm okay with it but I'm gonna hang on a little bit longer as far as the heat go this game was a blowout so the minutes are a little bit kooky and then no Jimmy Butler left a minute it's also a little bit strained out of Bio played 39 minutes because the game didn't really get out of hand until the end but I mean you can look at the rest of it Rozier out of Bio those are the  two safe ones typically when Butler's out I met hockey is Junior has been good enough he was not in this ball game Butler misses another one I would probably consider as a stream hey what Heisman know Caleb Martin Head to Head maybe you know if you're looking at a scheduling spot Heat schedule is nothing fantastic that  plays what Friday Sunday to finish off this week so not particularly good so this isn't really a team where you want to do a whole lot of dumpster diving right now because the schedule stinks and because no Duncan Robinson means that the most obvious stream pickup isn't even there  Lakers Bucks I will never forgive myself for one decision on this game  is where you all have to say what decision was that Dan it was the decision to  not the decision to record the game I do that plenty because typically I record some of the ball game and then watch the rest of it once my kids go to sleep but the decision to only set the recording to go 15 minutes passed these scheduled recording time because this ball game went but to be with 30 minutes beyond the end of these scheduled recording time a wild double over tea a double over tea double overtime 19-point comeback win for the Lakers they were down 19 with like eight minutes to go but it was that was really something Austin Reeves was right in the middle of it Monster forth quarter he was everywhere hating clutch shots defending some in the water man woke him up was nice to see Reeves fighting on defense too that that has not been something we've seen from the Lakers all season long LeBron was out so you know really hachimura would have a slightly bigger ball game he did with 16 and 14 I thought you might get a better game from Spencer Dinwiddie but he sort of cashed in all of his shooting chips in the previous one  what I don't know and the reason I bring up all these names is who the hell is going to play for the Lakers tonight on their back-to-back  in Memphis which not the world's easiest back to back here Milwaukee to Memphis is not a super long flight but you know they got out late and it's not like the game is super late or anything like that you traveling ever so slightly East ever so slightly not by a ton but by some and then you know Anthony Davis played 52 minutes Dilo played 50 awesome recently 48 minutes didn't witty 40 to  Anthony Davis was playing through a little bit of a sword knee late in this ball game I think he got undercut a tad on a jumper so I have no idea who's gonna play for the Lakers other than where  pretty sure LeBron will be back for this one and it's not like they can just take an L right now the Lakers need wins because what with the other stuff going on in the Western Conference around them the Warriors have been losing lately so they've opened up a little bit of a gap between the nine and the 10 spots the Suns have the hardest schedule in the NBA and they're only up two games on the Lakers the Kings lost it got blistered by a Mavs team that now moves a game up they have a and they play each other again in a couple of nights  so you got this  I didn't think there was any chance the Lakers had an opening to get to the six seed  because again look they don't have the tiebreaker with the Kings so that's a big part of it but all of a sudden now they're like sniffing it  and more than anything they love to get into these 708 instead of the nine ten because at least it would give any of those teams King's son's Lakers Warriors even if you want to extend it up to maths it gives any of those teams an opportunity to lose twice before getting punted out of the playoffs as a supposed to you know right now Lake Lakers Warriors play in that nine ten game whoever loses that's it  at least the kings in the Suns if you lose that battle right now you play the team from the nine ten bracket  those teams gotta win a couple to get through  that's a big I mean the seven eight is a big jump from the nine and the six is obviously another gigantic jump from the seven eight but I think the Lakers are looking at the sun schedule and thinking man we got a shot down play this team by two games but we can't afford to lose any so if anyone can go for the Lakers I would expect them to go  but this is I mean you're asking a ton off of 50 plus minutes the previous night that risks and injury  so if somebody's out you might get another good one out of how much more you might get another serviceable one out of Dinwiddie and I would just sort of keep that on your front burner as  the the streaming spot to watch for the night  for the buckos Bobby Portis played 30 minutes he's been pretty good lately but you know look he and Malik Beasley are both going to Trend down here with Yana's in Middleton each playing and the Bucks not having a back-to-back this week they do have one early next week so you might get sort of like a one game pop from Beasley and I know he was better in this ball game  ups and I just realized that I forgot to start the recording back up that's problematic so we're gonna have to  download this and digitize it oh nuts  there's no hope ladies and gentlemen there's no hope oh that was a mistake um so yes I mean you know you're gonna hold those guys through this week but then just keep an eye on stuff for next week Brook Lopez blocks are way down Bucks have changed the way they play defense but it's not like you're gonna do anything with him he's still their starting center and he's still has that big time blocks upside but it's gonna be probably not a great end of the season for Brooke and something to very much keep in mind for next year if they're not just exclusively dropping him into the paint every time on defense  then the blocks numbers are just not going to be as high  okay see with the win over New Orleans Shae Gill just Alexander injured his quad in this ball game it doesn't sound like a major thing  but they are on a back-to-back now home to take on the Rockets team that's been surging so keep an eye on that if you'll just Alexander sit out  do you maybe look at Lou Dort one nine one night play or a Josh giddey One Night play I think the answer is maybe I'm always a little bit reticent to drop these guys into a lineup not knowing exactly what you're going to get out of them Head to Head it's an easier called and Rodeo but you don't want to use a roster move on it there's just sort of a lot of shots that get distributed among other people and usually Dort takes enough of them when she's out for he's you know top 100 125 range and kitty would probably be in that range as well so you could probably do it if your stat hunting what they provide  for giddy it's typically points or not points because we rebounds assists that's sort of usually the kind always scored a bunch in this game but we have to talk about what usually happens  and then for door it's mostly points in threes when he's doing sort of the fill-in job  so again category hunting think about it but make sure the status on shape before anything else happens  Jose Alvarado  left this ball game early which is a shame because I have him on a couple of pelicans midweek light day streamers situations  you know Pelicans  first of all I mean okay so you've got these fringy dudes that you're playing because they go Tuesday Thursday Saturday but on top of everything else you've got a owners Valentine's you played 11 minutes in this game and we've a fully we've officially bought him down on him you can drop on JV mostly because there's just not enough season left where even if it got turned around it would really hurt you all that bad but you'll hold him through these this you know the Tuesday Thursday Saturday thing because what the hell else are you gonna do Larry Nance Naji Marshall Alvarado if he plays these guys are all perfectly playable for the good schedule this week but typically you're just going with the main four in Roto keeping one eye on Dance because typically if he's gonna play 30 minutes he usually puts a fantasy value he just didn't in this particular ball game you're watching the minutes you're not watching the end result of each individual ball game  and then Dallas blew out Sacramento this game was it was over relatively early all the Luca and Kyrie eels each at least did get over 30 minutes so that kind of salvaged it let's say salvation pretty good ball game's in 30 some odd minutes Tim hardaway's had two good ones in a row  I don't care I don't Daniel Gafford only 22 minutes here part of that again was blowout related he's a hold for the Mavericks they had that back to back to start their week and you know now they go into a couple days off they still have two more games this week so it's not like it's the end of the world if you wanted to hold head-to-head streamer level guys on that club but as far as games cap players it's just Luca Kyrie and Gafford and finally for Sacramento if you're talking about games cap you got Fox you got key in you got some bonus Malik monk has very much slowed down when he hits these these quieter stretches these poor shooting stretches that's when you got to be really careful I like the minutes are still there and you know with Kevin herder out it's tough for me to say like don't play Malik monk but I don't think it'd be the craziest idea in the world to just wait until he warms back up again if you're going games cap style and then key on Ellis finally you know the other stuff 10-4 and two but no defensive stats a little bit weird there I'm gonna give you know with Roto I'm gonna I'm gonna play Alice where I badly need Steals and blocks or even where I kind of need Steals and blocks is he has the upside to get a crap ton of them and he'll usually hit you one to two three pointers a game as well head-to-head Sacramento all so still has a couple games left this week so if you're streaming them before you might as well just sort of see it through because no one has one game and nobody has four games left this week it's all Tuesdays and threes so there isn't much to gain on the head-to-head Side by making a move Roto  again with Ellis your category hunting with monk you're kind of category hunting too mostly points  and some assists  not sure either of those guys I mean Ella certainly has the potential to be inside the top 100 is because of how crazy the defensive stats are Monk Is much tougher for him to roll hard inside the top 100 if he's not scoring a ton  but it's again it's very hard this time of year for me to definitively say someone is in and someone is out if they're even decent then some teams need Ellis and some teams need Monk  I prefer Ellis  because I prefer attacking certain categories and not you know again like where he hurts you is mostly points monk has the potential to hurt you in a lot of places  that's why that that lower floor  scares me a little bit more  but again either way  there are plenty of opportunities for both of these guys to be relevant and monk has been pretty good for long stretches this year he's just in a little bit of a slump right now  I don't know hopefully that made sense  those are listening after the fact  that gonna take me a minute to get this thing edited down because I forgot to record the audio  what a dummy  if you have streaming questions  we will answer them on our streaming show a little bit later on today and I think I can finally promise that the streaming show is going to be quick  because  this is a terrible day to make roster moves how's that for a great teaser for our streaming show that'll be a probably a 10 to 15 minute real quick burst right after lunch Pacific time but for now  we take our leave please remember if you're new if you're not new like rate subscribe  please specially this time of year want to make sure that I can get my claws into you all of you so you come around and hang out with me again next year big thank you to Dr a the man  the legend a true legend a fantasy basketball that term gets thrown around  Dr raise a legend  he's in the freaking Hall of Fame  quick check in the chat room before we wrap this thing up I'm not gonna do a ton of questions here is it safe to play Al Horford from now for Thursday and Saturday um  so if you're talking about against a games cap the answer is I don't really know because it sounds like Drew holiday might be back and if Derek White's back all so the net pushes Horford back to Sixth Man role which isn't bad you know he's 100 to 150 range as the Sixth Man as a like you know top 60 as a starter so safe know but you know worst case scenario he's still you know like top 140 ish range so not awful  some notes on Dr a Johnny writes one of the first fantasy Hoops columnist I followed a legend  please ask him if his son is still in the Navy oh I'm sorry buddy so this is actually a recorded segments that I just played might have tricked a few of you guys because I threw it up like it was happening live so I didn't have a chance to ask him questions and real time so apologies on that front  Dr a Hall of Famer hope you and your family are doing well much love and respect from indoor awesome thanks bud great stuff Dan I followed doctor and Rick Campbell is show the ogs that's right camel is also a legend  is when be playing today we don't know yet  injury news is coming out like every 12 minutes right now so you just stayed glued to it and you'll get it even since our stuff at the beginning of the show um let me did participate in shoot around but he remains questionable John I think caming his questionable Jayden Ivy got downgraded a questionable Jalen Duren got listed as available so he got upgraded trayce Jackson Davidson's questionable Marcus Sasser just got downloaded no sorry upgraded to probable with an illness and this is going to be happening all day so just watch the injury Watch The Wire it's gonna be straight nuts Hill Dan do you think hitting on all your late round Flyers is more important than getting the optimal first few rounds since they are kind of similar up there a great question Steve know in 30 deep the answer is all of it is extraordinarily important you're just not going to win unless most of your stuff is working in traded like a typical redraft 12 team her  not screwing up your first few picks is in my opinion the most important part because if you don't get a good first and second rounder there's very few ways to make up for that getting some nice hits in the fifth sixth round range that's all so very helpful but those would only cover up part of a disastrous first rounder and then like if you get a flyer in the 13th round that turns out awesome that's great but if you had a bad first round or at Almost Doesn't Matter your Seasons just cooked  do you think Mitch Robin has a better chance of being a League winner or a big trap I'm gonna go big trap my friends I think he's gonna come along slowly  is there a Marcus Smart timeline nope  need to drop one between Alvarado nausea and Larry Nancy it's probably Alvarado since he got lightly injured anyway we'll see Anyway come on back around everybody we can talk some streaming a little bit later on again I think it'll be quick today because there isn't a whole lot going on on that front but you never know thanks for watching thanks for listening shout out again Dr a d o c k t o r a on social media the legend the myth he's the man and he's gonna kick my butt oh well better to be destroyed by a legend  all right see you guys later
