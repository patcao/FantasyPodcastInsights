welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  so I bring the music down to zero because I think I've explained this before it's the annoyance and like I feel like I want to pull the curtain back and this is something that I'm sure no one ever thinks about besides me  but I fade the music all the way to zero  before I start talking on on this show  because I can't separate the music audio from the gas and I don't want to accidentally mute you and then when I Port this over to the traditional pod side  my editing software is going to put that music at the front and back end of the show and so if it's already playing and it puts it again then people listening to the Pod will hear it in some sort of weird double round iteration and so on this one show  I fade all the way out to nothing but anyway good day everyone happy afternoon to you now this will be showing number two on this delightful Monday beginning of week four in the fantasy season I'm Dan Bass Pros and for the week ahead episodes I'm joined as always by the great Derek ball at ball b ball on Twitter he bows to you as that was a little tip of the head because you know we're chest up here on YouTube to those listening I felt like I needed to do play-by-play of it I am at Dan Bass Pro on social and Derek before we dive into the meat of this thing how was week three for you how's everything going in your fantasy seasons  well we've been great I mean my teams are on a roll every team I have this week has been winning so I guess I'm doing something right it's a nice change of pace for me I kind of got bit by the injury bug the first couple of weeks so I'm feeling good going into week four it definitely helps to counterbalance the the mood of that's caused by this whether that I'm dealing with now we get a blizzard and Ottawa today and like but everyone in the world I am struggling with daylight savings time I'm tired of it mmm daylight saving time I have done many a rant on on this show over the years and I figured I wanted to pull up the weather locally here just to try to make you feel bad can you see that number  oh I mean I'm gonna just pretend that I don't know how to convert from Fair height to Celsius and believe it at that what is room temperature in celsius 25 21 21 so we're we're basically that it's 950 plus 32 I remember the conversion from math class but I don't know that I can do it while talking about fantasy basketball on are what's a all right so nine-fifths a fifth of that would be 4.2 times 936 plus 1.8 is 37.8 plus 32 so about 70 right 69.8 that I get that right you know it's funny we work with numbers so much and I am honestly one of the worst people you're ever gonna talk to about math I love numbers I love I love just toying with them I think I've told this story on the show too because at some point you've told every story on it pod you've hosted for six or seven years or whatever this has been now when I was a kid my mom took me to the mall and we were shopping for a present for somebody I don't know someone we probably weren't all that close with so we ended up in whatever it wasn't the Discovery store yet I think it was whatever it was called before Discovery Channel bought the store that has like all the miscellaneous gadgets not Sharper Image not the fancy stuff like the the goofy little Gadget store and she left me in front of it was just like a TV with a VCR hooked up to it because I'm gonna date myself VCR showing a movie or show called math Magic's and I haven't for some reason I've never googled this  mathematics I don't I doubt it's still exists apparently the second hit is something at education world.com it was a it was just a guy that was playing with numbers and he was like this is how you very quickly do multiply two digit numbers in your head this is how you square two digit numbers this is and like I don't know what I was I was probably like nine or ten and from that moment I was just like yes this is how I was a map yeah basically that was exactly it was just like let's put like a little tree here this would be lovely hap it's a happy math and so now I'm teaching that to my now seven year old son of like yeah he's sitting on the toilet he's going to the bathroom and I'm just like all right kid figure out how to square 22 for me and so he's like sitting there trying to do squares and everyone else in my family is like why are you doing this to your kid and I'm like he's loving it he loves it if you don't burden a child with math if you make it entertaining like Mr mathematics did for me then throughout the rest of your life you can convert celsius to fahrenheit live on a YouTube podcast anyway um I  had one other question I wanted to ask you before we got into this week ahead and that is who do you think's been the most annoying fantasy player to have so far because I think it's Mark Health faults  you know what I think I think you've got a point if you're gonna argue for Mark helpful but there's just two names that are frankly bigger that are drawing more attention I wrote about him both in my article this week and you've talked about them both I think on your most recent pod got to be some combination to James Harden or Jordan Poole because they're the ones that cost you some of your earliest and most valuable picks and well we've all heard the news they're not living up to the hype right now yeah I mean Jordan Poole has a pretty damn good case for I think my beef with Mark Hill false is that he missed three games I just dropped him into an eel slot then he came back and now he's gonna miss it at least another two so when Yahoo publicly and again I don't know why I'm holding two pens I'm still holding two pens and I'm waving them around on are like a loony bin get rid of one of those yeah I've gotten one game out of him and I haven't been able to use him for an eel slot so I haven't been able to replace it my basically taken six zeros one game he played and he wasn't very good that's why I'm annoyed with faults like Paul has sucked  but at least he played like at least it's not zeros  you know well whatever that really matter there's no right answer to this question all right look  so Derek's gonna be I need to impress you okay I came a little bit more prepared this week again you can find Derek on Twitter at d-ball b-ball he writes the week ahead piece it's Sports ethos available in the fantasy pass along with so many other things start to at just six bucks a month go check that out at sports ethos.com  we're gonna go through this week ahead we're gonna go through Derek your Twitter thread as well that gets everybody set up for the week but I actually did a little digging and figured out a few teams that and this is before I read your piece  a few teams that I thought seemed like pretty good ones if you wanted to make moves today are those teams Chicago Milwaukee and New York absolutely unequivocally I think those are my top three targets for today but I mean there's only so many good options so at least I know going into Monday that there are actually Some solid backups if you don't get Chicago Milwaukee in New York all right so tell me a little bit about the Battle okay so first of all the reason I picked those is because they have four games over the first six days this week but tell me a little bit about the backups what if you don't get anybody good what if like the only guy on those teams floating around right now is freaking Pat connaughton and you don't want to go down that path  well so here's the thing the big thing for me is that when you're streaming not everyone's doing a long stream I tend to give advice as if you are long streaming but really if you're looking at making short-term moves there's no functional difference between Chicago and Milwaukee New York and the next ones that I would recommend which would be bossing Cleveland Sacramento Toronto and Washington so quite literally every team that's playing on Mondays actually gonna give you some good value for a multi-day stream you got all of those teams I just named they're playing on Monday they're playing again on Wednesday so no matter who you're adding from any of those groups you're still getting two plays out of one move before you can move them before you can move on from that player again on Thursday Thursday is where you start to see the difference between Chicago and Milwaukee New York and the Boston Cleveland Sacramento Washington Group because we're picking Chicago Milwaukee on the fact that from Wednesday to Saturday that's a 48 period and they play three games so really it's functionally the same until Wednesday to have any of those teams but if you want to get the best possible targets for a week-long stream you're right Chicago Milwaukee New York if you don't like any of the eight teams playing tonight would you take a look at any of the teams going back to back Tuesday Wednesday because they're actually are quite a few of those I think there's like six or seven teams going back to back Tuesday Wednesday  yeah absolutely for me I think especially with the way that the schedule Falls this week I think this is one of the best weeks to actually go early on one of the players that you want to prioritize if there is a guide you really want to get for a Tuesday game even if you do have space on Monday I don't think it's a bad thing to go for the right player because there's only two games on the schedule this week that are actually what I would call Boosy game days there's two days a 10 game day and Friday and 11 game day every other day could be a value added play so as long as you're getting a player on Monday or Tuesday that's going to give you as much value as possible on those weaker days I don't think it matters which one of those two you go with and frankly you're not going to have a lot of great options on Monday if there's only four games going on you might have a wider pool of high-value players to choose from on Tuesday yeah and there's no guarantee that even with 10 games tomorrow that you're going to have an overloaded schedule right like you if you have guys that happened to be on the teams playing today that means that your Tuesday probably isn't overloaded you might only have eight or nine guys going and so then it does make sense to add one into tomorrow plus with the way the NBA goes you kind of have to assume like one out of every 10 of your players is probably gonna be a late scratch anyway isn't that the truth yeah now this is the time of year especially with certain teams that we're starting to see this happening with increasing frequency just want to give a quick shout out to anyone who's struggling with Miami Heat players lately you guys are definitely going through it same thing for anyone who's dealing with the Memphis group I mean there's just certain teams are really really struggling right now and without a clear rotation behind the stars that are getting in it really does leave managers kind of in a tough spot thank you this is a great week to be playing with your with your injured reserve because there is just so much flexibility on streaming  okay so let's let's dig in a little bit more on these early week options is there a cutoff at which you'd say like this guy just isn't worth it who are the guys that you think actually make the cut for schedule stream level players on some of these clubs we've been talking about right so I mean it's there is a little bit of give and take with the lift the list that I put up on Twitter here you'll see I think you've got it up on the screen right now my tweets yeah so you'll see on Monday I've got targets like Alex Caruso Kobe white Emmanuel quickly Jae Crowder Josh Hart Malik Beasley Quentin Grimes Patrick Williams now not all these players are created equal don't take them all as an equal recommendation here you'll see in my comments very often I've got teams that are managers that are in 14 teams 16 team leaks guys that are in League's where maybe people aren't paying attention so I can never really speak to who exactly is available in your League's but as a general rule I'm looking at players that are around a 60% ownership rate or less and among that group of the guys that I just named I'd be targeting if healthy Kobe White's my number one guy to add this week I actually made him to cover photo for the article I think he's doing really well he's really settling in his starting point guard in Chicago although to be fair I don't know a point guard is the right designation how he fits in the offense regardless he's a productive player  I've heard you talk a lot about Josh Hartley and that's someone who I'm also keeping an eye out I actually added him in a spot this morning I'm not entirely optimistic for how that plays gonna work out but I think he's got a really strong history of being a good producer of kind of uh we'll call them hustle stats we kind of the less appreciated stats he doesn't really score many points or get many get many trades but he's kind of productive everywhere else or at least he has been historically and I really like that kind of value on my team especially as a streamer because really you're not getting a lot of really good points or trade streamers and in the waiver wire anyway right now so I think those two are the main ones that I'm looking at and then for the backup teams I was looking at you'll listeners will recall that I did talk about Boston Cleveland Sacramento Toronto and Washington I am watching Gary Trent Jr I am certainly not adding him right now after being dealt for one game missing that game and now being questionable for today the reality is that he is playing for a team that might give him a good opportunity to collect have you doses of Steels and trace on a four game week so I am going to be looking at him if he has healthy I'm probably gonna be considering in the lot of leaks other guys who have just been really solid and reliable lately I'm talking about cares leverty of Dia and Max drew some of the other names that are really standing out to me as really solid reliable  standard League guys that I'm probably gonna be looking at in a lot of spots hey has Carousel Levert potentially moved ahead of streamer land I was having a conversation with myself because that's all a lot of my shows go early this morning it's seems like he's actually kind of settled into a pretty good role in Cleveland folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of beer Wine and Spirits then get them delivered right to your watch party compare prices across multiple stores in your area find the best deals on Game Day drinks and get back to armchair quarterbacking from you guessed it  your armchair download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's drizly.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations yeah well I mean if he keeps up at the pace that he was setting for himself this weekend and I mean you've got to keep them and the truth is that for as long as he's playing you know as he has lately he is absolutely a whole not a stream do I know for a fact that that will continue for the rest of the season know a lot of that could depend on how how healthy Garland and Mitchell are and depending on the minutes cap for Allen things can change if Mobley ever gets a little bit more more confidence on offense I could also see some touches going away from Levert but at absolute worst he's a great guy to have at the end of your roster right now I would hold him over a course of multiple weeks he is a guy that I might be considering to to trade as a as a sell right now just because I have seen some some of his more recent years both of which were in Cleveland he hasn't really held a held up as a seasoned long standard League guy but he has in moments been very relevant so I think we might be in that period of relevance now I'd be putting feelers out to see if he is someone that other teams might be willing to trade for if I can get another top 100 guy in exchange for him I'll probably use that as a way to just kind of seal the deal and make sure that I've locked in the top 100 guy rather than guessing asking the question right cares Levert a top 100 guy's right now yes he is absolutely I hold on to him for sure but I'm not gonna sell him as as the Savior to all your problems for guard stats yeah yeah not EA gonna be that I still remember it was like 10 years ago that rode a world had was trying to make the hashtag going over vertical uh go Trend and every time I saw I was like I don't think we I don't think he's going Levert go guys like he's gonna shoot 401% from the field and 72% from the free throw line and unless you're going points League then I guess he's he's straight Levert through the roof before we get to next Point here because I have some more questions for you again want to remind everybody that you are listening to Derek ball at d-ball b-ball on social media I am Dan Bass Pros and please take a second no matter how you're taking in this content please like rate subscribe that's a big deal we get to keep doing more shows the more growth we have the more I can pour into this sort of like a hey should dance time be invested in this or something else show the love and I can keep investing more time in this and social all that good stuff and bring you guys more content from Smart humans like Derek sit and over there across in the great white North okay so let's say you're long streaming and for folks that maybe are not familiar with it because I've talked about it on the Pod for a really long time and I I think I kind of did I come up with that term I think I came up with that term right the long story you know what I'm gonna validate it I can't say for sure but that's how you said it confidently so yeah okay that's good that's what you got to do in this life anyway so say some crap with confidence and everybody will just so long streaming is um where you're it allows you to stream more roster slots because you're not just grabbing a guy for one or two nights typically you're looking at more like four nights sometimes six if a team plays five games in seven days that's kind of like your optimal Zone if you really want to go nuts you can even hunt down a team going you know six times in nine days seven times in 10 days things like that you don't see to happen all that often because the NBA's trying to limit injuries and get players into games more these days after the trend they're on Direction but what this does is it allows you more moves as the week goes on you're not just dreaming one roster slot on Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday you might do roster slot 12 on Monday and Thursday and you might do roster slot 13 on Tuesday and Saturday or something like that and you're adding multiple games per move made against the player that you dropped so with that in mind Derek I ask you how many moves are you comfortable  using on Monday or Tuesday of this week because we do kind of also still have to think about what happens as the week goes on absolutely so I mean what you're gonna have to decide really early do you want to be a long streamer or do you want to be a short streamer because that will impact every future move you make now I tend to be one of those people right now I have been dealing with injuries and a lot of my different leagues so I do actually have a little bit more roster flexibility so for me I'm looking best player available and I'm just going to take them to the Finish Line if one of those best players available that I that I pick up this week I mind you I will be streaming too on Monday Tuesday if one of those players doesn't work out for me I'll hold them till Wednesday because I want to get two games out of one move and then from there I will be able to make a decision still to maybe transition into a short stream for a better player that might be able to add more games for me as well the key is to get your player the guy that you want the player that you think is going to be the most productive early on for me and then I think you figure it out from there you can respond to a situation if you have the player but if you're wishing that you got the guy and or planning to get a guy and he's not there when you need him then you're really is back to square one without having gained anything so I like to get my guy early and hold on to them make that decision after the fact let someone else pick up my scraps I decide that I don't want them anymore but ya know for me I I think I'd be prepared to use two moves in the first couple of days I'm not really looking at doing anything on Wednesday if I'm being honest because there's just so many different paths to have already got two games from a streamer by Wednesday so I think it would be important if I was one of those managers playing to make a move to get at least one moved on Monday Tuesday that will allow me to have had two games by Wednesday I'm not planning on making a move on Wednesday there's eight games already my lineup's going to be relatively filled and there aren't any back-to-backs to explain so there's not really much of an incentive for me to move into move into a Monday or Wednesday Thursday stream what I'm more likely to do is to take one or both of those players that I stream for the Monday Wednesday period and flip a month Thursday where you have another kind of Avenue into value-added streaming for me that's the day where I'm going to start to really look heavily at the Oklahoma City players because Thursday is first off it's a two-game day but also Oklahoma City's on a three and four so that's three games in four days heavy heavy value really really great advisable stream for almost any almost any manager and the thing that I really like about those three and fours is if you're going to weigh a three and four period against maybe two and three which is something that Golden State and Miami all so offer from Thursday even if I have a comparably worse player from Oklahoma City if I get three games of that comparably worst player they're probably still going to be more productive than a bench player from a team with two games so those are things that managers are going to have to pay attention to because yes you know you might look at for example I've got case in Wallace as one of my preferred streamers from from the Thunder this week I might look at him versus a player like a Dario start  search you got a rookie on a team stacked with guards versus a veteran who has actually been on a bit of a tear lately and I would actually probably advise you to take the rookie not because I think he's going to be a producing Sarge and any individual game but I think just the cumulative impact of having three games of Wallace's production is just going to Simply outweigh the low volume cumulative production of Dario saric for example  yeah and so I the other thing is when you're talking about that Thursday move I assume you're you saving one for Saturday Sunday to attack a particular category or are you trying to use them up Thursday Friday so as a rule for most weeks I'm only really trying to bring one move into the weekend it's possible depending on what's out there you might have to certainly I wouldn't keep I wouldn't be having three or four going into the weekend assuming we're in a four roster moves League the reason being that I'm always looking to get two games from every single stream and your opportunities to decline as the week goes on so if I'm at Friday and I have multiple moves to use I might be planning to use them both on the Friday because I know that if I don't get those two games out of a single stream by Friday then I have exactly three options on Saturday to get me that last possible good streaming opportunity otherwise I'm just going player for player and then it's just whoever has the best players gonna win because we're not adding anything on the onto the score like I was saying before with the Wallace times three versus the search times two if I got players going shop for shot with each other it's just simply going to be the best player that wins and I don't want to put myself up to that kind of it's gonna Head to Head League I want to just keep on stacking numbers so really I think one move maybe two going into Friday by Saturday you shouldn't have anything left if you ask me you might have you might have touched on this who are the teams that have the really good Saturday Sunday schedule I think I think I checked and there were like three or four back-to-backs in there yeah there's three of them and and really if we're being honest I think functionally it's gonna work out to be too because I've already talked about Oklahoma City a little bit they are already a good long stream from Tuesday they are in excellent stream from Thursday and so if you expect to get Oklahoma City or anyone like really anyone from Oklahoma City that's going to be worth streaming they're going to be gone by Saturday so you really can't plan on them being there you really just looking at Dallas who's actually they have a back-to-back tub Tuesday Wednesday they rest for two days and then they go back on another back to back so you got to be picking up someone from Dallas off the waiver wire when someone short streams I'm in the beginning of the week they're gonna clear just in time for you to pick him up on the Saturday Sunday and mostly weeks and then you've got  Memphis and then frankly I mean I could recommend any number of players that have to know who's healthy and who's not right now and frankly if even some of those players are available in some of your league I'm seeing some stuff online about how players like Jacob Gilyard aren't even in some in The rosters of some family fantasy leagues and here he is putting up really really considerable value  but yeah I'm looking at I'm looking at those two teams with a heavy preference for Dallas just because frankly I have an easier time trusting their players with higher name value those teams that have back-to-backs over the weekend I believe all three of them have pretty awful schedules after that I'm assuming then you'd advise going into next week those are probably your Monday drops  yeah so I'm just as we're talking here I'm just having a look at it Memphis after their Sunday game they got another two game rest and then they had into a three game week so there's really not a lot of value there Dallas they two games rest and then they had to do a two game week so yeah for me unless someone really hit hits okay yeah exactly same thing so really it's it's a move where you really just taking them for two days you're not really swinging for the hills here I wouldn't plan to plan to stay with any of these players for a long time but that's okay though because if you got I mean if you got the thunder on Tuesday or Thursday then you got enough out of them in that absolutely and it's kind of nice to know which guys going to be the one they gets dropped on Monday there's a certain this isn't comfort in that provided you don't have a ton of other guys that also have really bad schedules that coming week right yeah that makes sense absolutely I have a question for you about overall schedule and I stumbled on this while I was looking through some of the streaming stuff  the Clippers at the end of this week and the rockets I believe well each have had two two game weeks already I think those teams will then have  something like two or three more games remaining than a lot of other teams in the NBA would you ever Target guys on those teams because they simply like basically at that point you're looking at like a 70 game schedule well I guess it'd be less than that look at it like a 66 game schedule in the traditional fantasy or like actual basketball world and then someone came in and was like by the way I got two teams that are going to play 60 nine games the rest of the week or the rest of the season those guys would be more valuable by like a factor of 5% that's seems not insignificant am I making too much out of nothing well I mean yeah you definitely got a point there with the with the Rockets and the Clippers in particular I still think it's a little bit early to be thinking about the end of the season with them yet because they do have in week seven both of them have another two-game week coming up sorry to break it to you geez and the rocks are actually heading into consecutive three game weeks so once they clear that week seven hump you're absolutely right they're just green all the way across they're either not plus value the whole way through and I think this really plays in well for the for the bills of both teams because you talked about the Rockets a it's a new team that starting to gel together be you've got a team that's filled with young prospects that are kind of developing their game as they go They're gonna have hot streaks and cold streaks and frankly the lineups still shaking itself out so by the time we ate comes around and they're just plus value the whole way through I think teams are going to have a much clearer idea of what to expect from those teams are from those players and I think they'll have a much better idea of who to Target going forward as far as the Clippers Go I mean we all know they're they're not exactly a popular team right now they're not performing very well their players are I mean everything just looks ugly out there but I don't think this is gonna last I think you've just got too many talented players on the floor and eventually the stats will come eventually the winds will come and I'm probably taking that time to to evaluate exactly how things are going to shake out with the Clippers before really committing to heavy to them having said that with the way things are going right now with players like hardened with players like Paul George and Russell Westbrook I don't think you're ever going to have a better opportunity for a Buy Low and you know in that we're agreeing on what's going to be their great schedule coming up I think it's worth putting in some feelers for those players now and accepting the fact that you might have to take some losses in the short term yeah because they're going to suck for a little bit longer although I got to admit Derek I thought they were going to be bad I didn't think they were going to be this  bad like neither did I that this is this is ugly man they just got smoked by a bad Memphis team that's like all out of sorts and they went in and they beat the Clippers I was in LA wasn't it I think it was but you know what at the end of the day this is giving me my favorite NBA moment of recent memory oh it was one of the one of the lead paragraphs in my article but just when the Brian demiris diss track on James Harden dropped I could have been happy I'm just this is just a message for anyone out there who's trying to get who's trying to farm some content who's just trying to get some extra likes and get some extra post that video and I will give it a like I will give it a matter where it goes I swear I've seen it 300 button every time it's my favorite thing to ever is it still up I thought the original might have gotten taken down oh I'm not I'm not sure if I've ever seen the original but you know how social media is yeah run just films reacting to let people can you can you tell people what you're talking about because not everybody is has seen it or knows what you're talking about absolutely so Brian demarais you've never heard of him and you probably will unless you're a Maps man you probably won't hear of him again after this he is just a play-by-play guy or some other kind of TV color commentator for the Mavs the Mavs play the Clippers on Friday and before that Clippers game tipped off this guy just absolutely went in on hard and he just everything we've all heard the negative comments people have said about them I won't rehash them all here but you know various things about commitment to teams and you know wanting too much money or maybe having a misconception of type of player he is at this stage in his career all of those things I mean he literally just tied it all up in a boat three minutes of just unfiltered granting live on air and it is the definition of a viral video haven't heard anything back from Harding yet but certainly if he was responding we're not going to see any evidence of that and his game  there was no Revenge game after that since it was comments have come out we have seen anything better at Heartland the Mavs post game or pregame post game guy Revenge game that would be that'd be a very yeah it was it was a lot man I don't think I would have the stones to it specially to be on the other team like just collaborating the guy on a club that you're about to play that was that was that was audacious by the way I need to throw this comment up on the board I don't know if it's gonna make you happy or sad but boom from 9 years you know what I don't even hear it people told me I have an accent before I couldn't tell you what it sounds like I think I sound normal but I guess next to someone from California the place of the true I think neutral accent oh no so I've been told that the neutral accent is Omaha Nebraska that that's why a lot of companies set up their call centers out there because no one can tell Omaha Nebraska exactly because they sound like everyone all at the same time not out here man we Californians we say we say things like bro and we're very we're very cool and laid back and I want to punch everybody who talks like that but let me tell you I'm from the Toronto area and you don't even want to know what the Toronto accent is anymore so I'm glad that you heard the good version of it what's the difference between so I know that like French Canada that's obviously its own land and then you've got Central which would be what like Manitoba type area Manitoba Saskatchewan yeah so I have I have some relatives that are actually around Winnipeg or maybe many of them have passed away so I guess used to be near Winnipeg so that one I'm familiar with and then and then you've got like West Coast British Columbia what are how could I tell the difference between a Toronto accent and a British Columbia accent well I mean I think it's the the difference between maybe a let's say a New York accent we're fairly close to each other geographically and culturally I would say Toronto and New York are pretty fair approximations of each other and maybe someone from Seattle I think actually there they're the closest analogs for each other makes sense in any context yeah and just generally speaking you can always tell when someone's from Toronto if if you know that someone else listening to them is from another part of Canada they're probably going to be scowling shaking their fists Toronto and aren't really popular elsewhere in Canada see this is so this is the stuff I need man like I know that Canadians are probably like making these faces at each other because Americans we do this thing we all laugh at each other's actively apologized afterwards yeah you that's true we don't we don't apologize we just laugh and then we walk away that's that's the difference there I just always wanted to know if there's like because like I can tell Central Canadian accent because we got the Dakotas here and it's like you know I don't know if anybody grew up watching Bobby world the cartoon from the 80s that Howie Mandel did which was all like I think Minnesota Dakota accents that like we know that one in the states but like an American I don't think could ever tell you the difference between a Toronto Canadian accent and like a Vancouver one even though for you guys I'm sure it's like yeah I picked that up in four words right like yeah I mean we're not we're not really as bad for regional accents as some other areas of the world I found if you go out east absolutely I mean I'll say I'm in Ottawa so just you know a couple of kilometers miles for you to to my Easter yes you're gonna hear people speaking a lot differently than I am right now and if you go even further east from there you're going to have you're going to hear some really really crazy what about the new fees stumbled into Ireland what about you know what they actually very often you'll hear someone from Ireland themselves saying saying that the accents the closest thing that got to home when they come over here really that's yeah I mean they're they're a world under themselves out in the maritime got a lot of family from out there  absolutely love it out there and they they feel completely unique to the rest of Canada that's wild and aren't they like a half hour ahead and of a full hour  that's just a one one Province yes that's not that is not okay that needs to be dealt with post-haste let me see if you like savings time actually is the one that made this rule for for that Province yeah it's like you know what we're gonna have a little fun everybody can go to hell so inconvenient for everyone excuse me as I cough into the microphone let me see if I can find a question here  eventually this but this cough is gonna finish me off  so I can get any like weekly I want lineup questions people I don't want this like add subtract kind of thing um oh here we go should I bent should I bend this is Ty should I bench tyus Jones this week  well let me just see here what do we have for a schedule for tyus Jones on well you know what it's if you're doing a weekly changes league and knowing I think he's what a game time decision right now  yeah they're only not up to date on his injury status but if there's three game week and I think he was he was showing up as a potentially injured player for tonight so he is kind of trending down right now if you do have another option at point guard I don't think it's the worst thing to prevent Jones he's not an overly productive player having said that if you look at the team that you're playing this week and I had league in particular and you know that you are going to need to win or you might be able to win assist and I don't think you're going to have many better options at point guard that Jones even if he is struggling this isn't a question but you're getting all the compliments in the chat room today shout out to DARE for having the best handle d-ball people I'm I misinterpreted that I'm gonna just go ahead and say I didn't know that you've seen the handle a basketball before but I I appreciate it very nice very nice Dad joke City looking like I'm looking like Kyrie Irving out there that tell you I'm saying you said you got a dog not human children right that I remember that right two dogs yeah there you go so the dogs have turned you into dad jokes Center I love it I love a good dad joke Derek you get the heck out of here I kept you longer than I said I would because I wanted to learn about Canadian province accents I don't know what the hell's gonna strike my fancy I like I got my voice back this week so I'm asking all sorts of weird crap he is Derek ball at d-ball b-ball I'm gonna go through some of the other questions in the chat room all so give you guys the thoughts on a couple of weekly lineup decisions injury stuff like that Derek until next Monday my good man  Dan and fans it has been a pleasure we'll talk to you next Monday and good luck in your League's this week he is Derek ball at d-ball b-ball it is a sweet sweet handle I gotta say like Andre is not wrong in the chat room Andre Martinez there saying that he's got a good handle so here's we're gonna go through real quick well I just pull up the Yahoo list of basically like the top 200 players and anybody that's got injured tag on them in any way we're just gonna quickly look through and see if they're worth starting Devin Booker already he was doubtful going into yesterday's game they got a three-game week that's a little bit more  back loaded but I don't I don't see how you can possibly roll the dice on that I know they got two days off before the game on Wednesday that's dicey man if you throw him out there and you get one game out of him or none  you're gonna regret that Forever by forever I mean for one week so I think I probably err on the side of caution sounds like Darren Fox is going to be trying to come back as soon as possibly Wednesday we might get him in there tonight the latest was that he is trying to get in there for this ball game  but you know he's coming back for the Lakers because that's the way things always work so I think he'll get at least three out of Darren Fox he is a goal for me guys that are out a long time I'm not even gonna bring those guys up LeBron he missed Lakers last ball game Lakers are off today but then they roll into a home back-to-back against the hapless Grizzlies and then we just talked about the Kings I think you see Braun for at least one of those two games maybe the back half against Sacramento and then on the road Portland back home to take on Houston and what ends up actually being kind of a Revenge game for the Lakers getting smacked by the Rockets last week with no Anthony Davis I think you get three out of LeBron so he is a go Dame is probable you can go ahead and throw him back in the mixed cam Thomas is out probably at least another week I think you can probably bench him so that's not a bigger one Trey young is questionable due to personal reasons which hard know exactly how that's going to shake out Unfortunately they have a three game week that's pretty front loaded three games by Friday and then they don't play Saturday Sunday or Monday  I think you probably get two out of trade this week which is just barely enough for a dude inside the top 50 and that makes him a go  herb Jones he is currently questionable for tomorrow's game against Dallas the Pelicans could obviously use him they've lost five games in a row including all three that herb has missed and the last two that he was in put up some pretty good games before going down he's rolling kind of near the top 50 the question will tag is is unexpected I think I'd probably give him a go not that two games out of herb Jones would be enough but the fact that they go tomorrow and then they're off for two days and then they play Friday Saturday means you're almost definitely going to get to so he's probably good enough for me  Gordon Hayward is probable so he's good to go Jalen Duren missed the last ball game he's dealing with this ankle soreness which is actually not that dissimilar from stuffy dealt with last year and that's annoying it was something we hoped was more of a they're keeping his numbers in check rookie season and not the sort of big stuff  I might be inclined a bench him it's only a three game week if he misses tomorrow's game he's down to two and I don't know that two out of jail Endura is actually enough for a weekly format folks so he's kind of a coin flip if you're feeling saucy you can go for it blah blah blah  I think I probably bench him in just play it safe  Ogden and obese questionable raptors have a four game week so I think you're probably starting him anyway if he's questionable today you like likely get him for some measure of days Alex Caruso is I think downgraded to doubtful for Chicago they still have three games after that so he's probably a start if you're in a weekly format if you're in 14 teams in larger than he's almost definitely a start 12s kind of a little bit iffy I haven't heard anything about Terry Rozier in a while I think he's already been ruled out for tomorrow's game so go ahead and keep him on your bench um who else are we working on here that's speed up right now oh Nick Batum I think may have gotten ruled out for the front end of a Philly back-to-back which makes him a much tougher sell and head-to-head leagues Ben Simmons is already ruled out for tomorrow that really shrinks the week for Brooklyn I think they're now a two gamer with him missing Tuesday so Simmons should be on your bench on your bench Malcolm Brogden keep them on your bench I don't expect him to be racing back anytime super quick and try to get back when he can but I don't think it's gonna be lightning fast until we get anything on Walker Kessler he's definitely out Mark he'll faults is a bench he's off to a bad start regardless and in my opinion the most annoying player to own and fantasy so far this year and that is your very fast player injury report  let's get a couple of questions in there again please do remember to subscribe and like the show before you complete any other part of your day  choose two out of Levert Melton avdija and keonte George I will go  hmm these are this is a pretty good one actually hey I'm gonna go mmm let me go meltan with the ubre injury so Dean Anthony's in and then I'm debating between avda and Levert  I'll go Levert and just hope that something sticks and I know I might pay for that because obvious got the much higher floor between those two dudes and then counting George I think he'll put up a bunch of assists but I don't know that it's gonna be a whole lot beyond that I like him and I think he should be rostered in most leagues but this particular person Nate seems to have an abundance of riches  Nick klaxon hasn't been picked up why on Earth was he dropped should I drop Marcus Martin for him yes  Cam Johnson and Jordan Poole both on the waiver wire worth it if I'm dropping Gordon Hayward  I think I'd rather have Cam Johnson  I don't know about Jordan Poole man he's been hurting more than he's been helping I don't think I'm leaving or not I don't think I'm picking him up right now um yeah you probably go Cam and then with pool I don't know he's he's a tough one to roster  should I move Jalen Suggs for Jalen Johnson is tyus Jones a drop tyus Jones is a hold and yes I would rather have Jalen Johnson over Jalen Suggs but I like them both though  how do you decide if a player is 10 team worthy well so like for Roto  I try for 12 teams to only play guys that I think are going to be giving me top 100 or better numbers which is effectively you know if you're talking about 10 starting slots on your team  13  players total  this is for Yahoo leaks 12 teams so that's what 1506 right total roster players roster and in my opinion you want to be like at the 23rd Mark so for a 10 team or with 13 slots to 100 30/3 of that is indeed like kind of around 9 8. 0 0  do we buy Dame with Kyrie or do like keep Kyrie  okay either way Dame feels slightly safer just from the like I think he's gonna try to play anytime he can thing and we don't know that with Kyrie but so far everything's looks pretty good this year he's playing when he can Mr couple games early Dave was missed a couple games lately I have no problem either way on this one  I don't think it changes your team Outlook all that much  Trey Jones or keyonte George I'll go Trey I'll go tray over Kiante I just think his his Fantasy game translates a little bit easier than the young fella but you know George is the dice roll if you want to shoot the moon why the hell not I just think there's a better shot that trade Jones is a 12 Team playable guy on a day to day basis  I want to trade JJJ who should I Target I don't need any more blocks well you should wait until JJJ as a big ball game before you do anything with him because he's off to kind of a slow start in the blocks Department I think he's under two right now  and so that's why his ranking is what he's like in the 30s or something like that am I getting that right Jaren is no he's in the 40s because he's at point for Steels and 1.8 blocks and last year he was at four combined so it's like halfway there don't sell on JJJ right now wait until he's goes on a heater and then you go try to get somebody inside the top 20 top 15 but I don't know that you would get it right now  Jeremy Grant for cam Johnson which way do I go on this one  oh Cam Johnson lower shut down risk Maybe I think Jeremy both of these guys are a by low actually in my mind  Skylar Mays Nic Batum or keyonte George and nine cat Roto in Roto it's maze until someone comes back for Portland and then it's Batum  someone's trying to get me on the phone so I better wrap this thing up quick  tyus Jones Bruce Brown the Anthony Melton Josh Hart how you rank them Melton over know uh yes Melton over ties Jones over Bruce Brown over Josh Hart  should I add John Morant we don't have eel Plus  points League yeah I mean you gotta we're like halfway to him coming back home almost  he's a monster and points League absolute Behemoth so yes  voucher Nick Clarkston six and one half dozen  Clarkson might be ranked higher in nine cat at the end of the year but he'll take your free throws while giving you big time defensive stats which will give you more scoring probably more rebounding more assists more threes but he's not gonna help your field goal as much and he's not gonna hurt your free throw as much and so on and so forth  should I vent tie oh we did this one I actually probably would vents tyus this week is Chris Paul and drop territory no he's not that bad he hasn't been quite that bad he's in like the 120 range and he's still shooting 37% even if you just tick that up to like 44 that he's very much a playable guy how much do you think Miles Bridges will hurt Gordon hayward's numbers I don't know some let's say some it's unclear if who loses out but I do think it'll be some  are you starting keonte head-to-head yes rodo know  Dan what are your thoughts on Miles Bridges and the effect it has on lamelo the rest of the team the Hornets win projection so it probably does make them better much as I don't like the whole situation in general he will make them better lamelo will probably be happy about it it probably takes away from Gordon Hayward it probably takes away from PJ Washington it probably takes away from Brandon Miller and he'll probably be a top 80 play at some point  do I sell shade and sharp at a points League  depends what you get but the answer is probably yes if only because right now he's doing everything because everyone on the Blazers is hurt besides sharp and Jeremy Grant  and is the next Kobe MJ or T-Mac  I mean he's really really good if that's what you're saying I don't know if he's gonna be that good but he's pretty good  hard in her Franz vogner give me Harden  punt points threes and free throw League where Cade ranks 440 and Aaron Gordon ranks 20 is there any world where that trade makes sense aha um  no  because if you have Cade the other person isn't punting points threes and free throw percent so they're gonna value him the way  everyone would  so if you're gonna trade Kate and you want Aaron Gordon back ask for a crap load more because everyone else is gonna value Cade way more than Aaron Gordon  now for you for your team getting Aaron Gordon is a really big win but just realize you can get way more than that okay don't negotiate against yourself because of your build  its Clarkson must roster now that he can Reliant keonte to handle the ball it does seem to help him a little bit I'm still gonna say no but it's gonna make basically everybody in Utah a little bit better  any advice for the two game playoff week for players like Luca Anthony Davis or lamelo ball do we try to trade for players who have a better playoff schedule to offset that if so when  yeah that's a really tough question guys the unfortunate truth is that there are going to be some of those Blended in there it but I don't know that you can trade those guys without messing up your team build so I'd like to say yes but I think the answer is probably not now if you have more fringy guys mid-round to late round guys on those two game teams those are the ones I think you should probably try to get off because  those are guys that are going to be taking up a roster slot where someone on The Wire playing four games would probably be more valuable than them whereas like two games at Anthony Davis is still going to be way better than anyone you could pick up playing for you need to pick up somebody playing five or six games to beat what ad does in two  and if those these are the dudes on your team this is the build you have  you're sort of stuck  is mpj a cell high do you think this will continue  so here's the thing by Michael Porter Jr this is kind of what we all thought he was gonna be before he missed what was it the year before last almost the whole season with the back injury which was good percentage is good scoring slightly better rebounding tumbling face first into a little bit of defensive stuff but just like generally good remember he got drafted around 20 to Seasons back he didn't come anywhere near that because his back blew out and he couldn't shoot but that was the hope so him being in the 40s I think is something you can expect could continue  County Georgia Nic Batum had to head you're going George because the tombs gonna get days off as we're seeing Roto it's peetam  Halliburton and Miles bridges for Nicola yokich in it points League yeah I mean you basically do whatever you can to get yolk itch in any format ever um Halliburton right now is basically around his Peak  52% for the field 95 the 3rd throw line three three-pointers 12 assists per game you know a couple of those things are probably gonna take down a little bit  he'll get you believe it or not is well points probably come down for yokich rebounds maybe a little bit but also free throws are going to go up  assists could actually come back up a little with Jamal Murray out although who knows maybe that means he has to shoot more  absolutely you go to try to get yolk at you basically whenever you can that's kind of the rule in fantasy at this point do you think Jonas Valentina can be a cell high for Keegan Murray or would we need more I think you'll probably need more and I would try to do it because I think he can be really good I got offered Jordan Poole and PJ Washington for Miles bridges in a 14 team or would you do it  I don't even want PJ Washington really I think I would just take Jordan Poole for Miles Bridges because now you're getting someone who you feel is like a is an asset for someone that we have no idea what he's gonna be so um yeah go I think I would go Jordan Poole and I think I well 14 team where I guess PJ is closer to Value but I might just take PJ out of this and say can make it a one for one  Brooks you posted this like three times I answered this question can I date George or Trey Jones it's Trey Jones  Trey Jones  this is the best fantasy b-ball podcast out there the best briefs  someone told me this is a this is a Hebrew joke
