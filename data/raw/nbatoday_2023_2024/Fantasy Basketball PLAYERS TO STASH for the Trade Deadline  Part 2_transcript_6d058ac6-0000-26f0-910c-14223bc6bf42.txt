welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast a second verse same as the first little bit louder a little bit worse what's happening everybody welcome to another trade deadline stash show we did four on Saturday and I've had a slight change of opinion on a couple of scenarios and I thought we might as well do a little bit of an update here with the possibility of one more update before the actual deadline because I realized roster spots are at a premium trade deadline stashes by and large don't work  want to say that in the first 60 seconds of this show by and large don't work but if we play our hand right if we can figure out how to get in between the smoke  the little Embers of fire we might just be able to stash one or two guys that does and end up panning out post trade deadline

you can subscribe on Twitter like it on Twitter follow all that good stuff you guys know the drill at this point let's begin  I thought it would be kind of nice to begin by just briefly reminding everybody of where we were last time so these are the four names from our video back on Saturday  bilali on Yahoo Gary Trent Jr and Astor Thompson who and looking back on some of these names after now we've had another game or two under our belts since making some of these calls say all right well what do we think is actually going to shake out here and we've had four or five days to see how the news has developed on these players and on these teams as well  and a few things struck me on these four guys from last time number one it really feels like tyus Jones is gonna get moved in Washington now cool to believe has some very large dare I say gaping issues with his Fantasy game even when he's had playing time it's been  difficult I think for him to get to that point so not only do we need Titus Jones to get out of his way  I might argue we all so need someone like a kuzma to be out of the way or a Jordan Poole whose gonna be impossible to move because he's been awful this year who's my not impossible by the way but just something to free up a little bit more usage and maybe it's dennya maybe that's the player who needs to get moved who will be easier to get moved all though not like he's an old guy either we saw him listed as  a target for a few teams in Bobby marks piece that came out earlier today on all the teams trade deadlines stuff so again we're talking about a young player but you know Denny's taking nine shots a game and so if you free up those maybe one or two goes to cool to believe and tyus Jones is what kind of generally in that same rough area he's a ten shots per game  maybe you could piecemeal because cool beliefs already what six seven shots of ball game right now I probably should have had that in front of me because I'm doing a show talking about him he's at six and a half and if he could piecemeal another three and a half together from 18 or so that gets thrown back into the pool now we're starting to get somewhere because he's not particularly efficient he doesn't shoot the free throw well it's three point shot is coming along but it's not there yet it's the defensive stats and the potential to step forward  so I still kind of like him on yet go Kong I still like a lot because of Atlanta moves Clint capela you're in great shape moving Deonte Murray might actually believe it or not because DeAndre Hunter will come back and you'll see him featured later in this show  Atlanta is a team that may be retooling here and we've seen them play Hong Kong longer minutes and if they start to think about maybe just taking the team in a different direction not even necessarily a blow up but just a how they use the pieces Direction okong was a guy that can take a big step forward Gary trans junior is someone that I think I'm moving down in my stash rank board we've seen that even when he's playing here lately he's not getting enough shots for it to be truly statistically relevant we need in between 10 and 15 shots of ballgame because he needs to hit a bunch of Threes get points free throw trees sometimes and steals that's the other big one and if he's not shooting just existing on the court is not enough for him for Gary Trent Jr because he doesn't rebound and he doesn't assist  so it has to be shots  so he's moved down my board and as her Thompson who  I think even as I was talking about a month on Saturday show I may have mentioned this this idea that it may not be trade deadlines related for him it might be more you know team shut down related but if Alec Burks gets moved or let's say boy on which gets moved or just a few pieces get out of the way there's a possibility that the Pistons might Lean Back Thompson's Direction a little sooner but it does also kind of feel like they need to get to that like let's see what we have point which is crazy that they're not there yet but the Pistons have been super weird this year and I don't expect that to change starting two weeks from today  let's get into some new names Santi aldama who made the honorable mentions board on our Saturday show and now he's graduated to the full-blown board which is a very weird way to describe a board but I like aldama a lot the only thing I don't like about Santee is that he banged the knees and he's out for at least one ball game he's out tonight the Grizzlies are in Miami taking on the heat they're back home they got a game in two days and then they got a back-to-back going first thing next week the 28th and 29th hopefully he can get back in the not too distant future for a couple of reasons reason number one is when he gets full minutes he's pretty interesting from a fantasy standpoint  there are issues he's not a great field goal guy because he steps out and shoots the three and he gets a little trigger happy on the court and he's not a great free throw guy although this year he's at 62 and and his young career he's actually in the low 70 so there's a distinct possibility that we're getting kind of a low volume what the hell is this sample  both of his percentages are down this year which could also rebound you figure okay could feel goal come back up it was at 47 last year why wouldn't it get back up into the mid die 40s this year free throw at 75 last year why is it at 62 this season so let's say that his 23 minutes a game this year where by the way 23 minutes a game he's at 10 points five and a half rebounds 0.7 steals 0.8 blocks almost two assists and one and a half three pointers there's a really interesting roundedness to this stat set for aldama you just can't be this bad at both percentages and be a nine cap performer  but the nice thing is we saw him start in his last game before getting hurt against the small front Court mind you was Toronto  but we all know that Xavier Tillman is a possible trade ship for the Grizzlies a team that doesn't have that many right now Luke Kennard Tillman are probably the two guys where they can be like all right well whatever like do we really need these guys with all of our dudes heard we can just kind of retool a tad make a run at things next year maybe assets serve us better  than holding on to a guy  we don't know what Steven Adams deal is going to be next year either so is that a reason that they may be hanging on to Tillman hard to say we don't know what the Grizzlies are doing but we do know that if Tillman's out of the way then all dhamma has a very clear path and if JJ ever gets the plug pulled on the season which is probably gonna happen at some point here whether that's resting every two to three ball games or just taking the end of the season off for an unnamed injury oh aldama feels like a guy who's already stepping into a bigger role that's only going to get larger as the year goes on  he has a decent rebounding rate even though he's not a super strong dude he scores well he hits threes he gets Steals and blocked I mean starters minutes he's like potentially looking at a two three pointer one steel one block so four cash counters or more and that one one one one group he might be a two-one with boards with scoring with some passing we just gotta fix some of the percentages I don't have to be perfect but I like Obama a lot and he absolutely gets the bump up from honorable mention because there are a few paths to him actually getting to kind of that that next Zone  and Smith Jr is one that I kicked around a little bit on some shows earlier this week and some of that because it's not clear what the Brooklyn Nets are doing from a trade deadline perspective but what is clear is that Spencer Dinwiddie is  not happy  and also that  there are long stretches already where he's losing playing time to Dennis Smith Jr so it might not even take all the way through it might even take it might not even take a full blown trade to get this done but let's assume for our sake the reason we're holding on to Dennis Smith Jr is for a possible trade his minutes have been slowly trending up dinwiddie's minutes have been slowly trending down is that Brooklyn signaling that they're willing to look in Dennis Smith's Direction well  we need to get to a point where it doesn't matter  Desmond Juniors number 95 over the last three weeks he was hurt for some of those games so it's only eight games over that stretch but he's done it with eight points  eight but four and a half boards five assists almost two Steals and half a block on decent percentages  if that number goes up and we saw this last year in Charlotte he can absolutely pile up fantasy numbers  I mean even if you get him to like 11 points instead of eight that's useful  if you get him to one three-pointer and set of point six  boards can get into the five assists could get up to six steals can be in the one point five to two range blocks half a block or better there is a very  really there's a really nice again we're talking about well-rounded he didn't Obama both fit that bill if Dennis Smith Jr steps into a bigger role we saw with Charlotte he was posting between top 50 and top 75 value for a long stretch last year remember lamelo ball missed a ton of time Dinwiddie probably needs to get moved for Dennis Smith Jr to hit any kind of  Apex in this deal like he's probably stuck maxing out near 100 ranges as long as Dinwiddie is around but again he's in that same mold as aldama was about to be before he got hurt these are guys like oh Kong whoo that are actually giving you playable fantasy numbers right now even before any kind of something pops  which in my eyes might be the only way to approach the trade deadline  because if you're picking up these long shots dashes that are doing nothing for you over the next two weeks those guys have a chance to hurt your team  you don't want to take a couple of elves going into the trade deadline but Dennis Smith Jr is not gonna hurt you I'll do when healthy was helping especially on the head to head Side Road us a little bit of a different Beast you could afford to tuck somebody on your bench and you know not use them against the games cap kind of thing but like oh Kong Dennis Smith Jr aldama when these guys are starting in playing okay minutes you're getting numbers near the edge of the top 100 from them  less so from Santee because his percentages have been so very up and down but certainly more so for Dennis and O'Connell so these are guys that you can play on the headset if their schedule is okay or better as long as it's not a complete disaster schedule you can just hold these dudes and you can get numbers out of them and then just hope that things drop in their favor you hope that Clint capela gets moved or you hope that for the Grizzlies Tillman gets moved or for the Nets you hope Spencer Dinwiddie gets moved I like these guys a lot and you'll see at the end of today's show I added a slide where I ranked all eight of the names that I've brought up so far in order of how I like them stashed which I think was a request from the last one  Jabari Walker's the next name on the list and this one's a little bit of a mixed bag for me because I don't know that he's a true trade deadline stash in the traditional sense because he's already playing about 30 minutes of ball game over the last three weeks and obviously he's had a boost in playing time with shaedon Sharpe out  my thought process on Jabari Walker is this he's a long shot to really pop  because the other guys on the Blazers are young already so there aren't that many shutdown candidates on the Blazers and whatever shutdown canister might be which is basically Jeremy Grant is the guy you're hoping gets traded that would unlock Jabari Walker because he needs more shots and he needs to make sure like they're just cannot be competition for that power forward spot because when shaedon Sharpe comes back there will be  let's assume Malcolm Brogden gets traded okay that's fine that doesn't really help walk her all that much it leaves more space for him  if scoot comes in and gets additional run and sharp comes back  how many minutes does that leave for Walker well again I think we probably need Grant out of the way  but he just signed a new contract and a long one  so some team is going to want to have to give up a lot of stuff and be committed to Jeremy Grant for freaking ever  and maybe that team is out there  I find that someone hard to believe so Walker's on this board but probably fits the bill better as a long shot trade deadline win the long shot being that Jeremy grandkids moved but a shorter shot not so much a long shot that Jeremy Grant if he doesn't gets moved once again takes the last 10 to 15 games off because that's kind of been his Mo pretty much since he went to Detroit play the first 60 games of the year play a handful over the next five to ten and then don't play from that point on I have no reason to believe that that's going to change because Portland is a dumpster fire right now and they're developing all young guys and he's effectively like the only non young guy there maybe Deandre ayton  eh  and then you get this unfettered run and you get his 15 shots a game being passed along to Simon's and Scoot and sharp and some to Walker and that's what this is going to take he needs 10 or more shots per game to go along with those nine rebounds and damn it we really love like six Steals and points six blocks instead of 0.3 of each  that's where he's had over the last three weeks he's getting no defensive stats at all  so to me this one maybe profiles more like the Acer Thompson deal which is like yeah probably more of a March play than a February play but I wanted to get him on the board because in a long shot magical universe or Jeremy Grant does get moved  something could pop loose sooner on Jabari Walker  and then this one's I think flying a little bit under the radar and that's DeAndre hunter in Atlanta who look I've gone on the record many times is saying I'm not a massive fan of his Fantasy game his value is heavily tied up in having good percentages and scoring he's like a Harrison Barnes two point oh he's Aaron Barnes if the team he was on actually bothered to give him shots sometimes  he's also hurt and has been  not in frequently throughout his young career  but he's at 11 shots a game right now and he's at number 120 46% shooting 90 and a half from the free-throw line he's at 15 points two three-pointers four boards and not a whole lot else  the reason that DeAndre Hunter is on the board here is because we know Atlanta is aggressively trying to move Deontay Murray  and I wouldn't be all that surprised if they were quietly also trying to shop saddiq Bey  now I don't know that that once to be true we haven't heard much about it but it seems like a reasonable possibility he's not like a building block for the team for the future at least not in the way that I think they feel the Andre Hunter Mike can be more of a building block  so what does that mean well  let's take this sort of piece by piece on Hunter and say what what if what if does jonte Murray gets moved at the deadline we've already heard that if the Lakers are the team and D'Angelo Russell is the player coming back  there would have to be some other salary going in that Atlanta would like to move him along to a third team because they they want assets they don't want to deal oh okay great so that means that dejounte Murray's 17 and a half shots are largely getting split up between whatever salary filler the Lakers would have to include in such a trade and the existing pieces in Atlanta so  Jalen Johnson not that Trey young can do a whole lot more but Trae young Bogdan bogdanovich would be a very large winner in that study would be as a medium-sized winner but then it does kind of feel like DeAndre Hunter has a chance to even as a small to medium sized win  already sitting basically right on the cusp  of every day started ability in my eyes maybe just ever so slightly outside of that simply because of where his value is tied up  you add another two shots to his Ledger he's already at 15 points on 11th that's that's pretty good that's a fact of Lee a little bit less than a point and a half per field goal attempt so you can increase his usage by whatever it would take to get him two more field goal attempts you're actually talking about three more points could DeAndre Hunter really be an 18-point per game guy down the stretch yeah it's just it is a stretch but that adds presumably uh call it another oh I don't know 20% to 3 so that's now 2.1 or 2.2  could it add 20% to assists even if it did it wouldn't change very much you're talking about you know the like 0.3 so who cares an extra part of a free throw would be a big deal for him because that's a big positive and then the negative and feel goal percent doesn't really change all that much but what it does do is it moves him from outside the top 100 to inside the top 100 and that's part of what you're looking for with deadlines stuff  this one is a low upside but a higher probability play because we know Atlanta is trying to move pieces meaning the odds that something good happens to DeAndre Hunter are actually decent  but the odds that it's good enough to make him a big difference maker yeah not all that high so he's not my favorite Target on the board but he's a very reasonable one as when you consider the fact that he is expected back in the not too distant future I don't have an exact timeline on that but news is starting to come out here this is 15 games he's missed now with this knee thing but you know he's being ruled out on like you know half a day in advance to a day in advance and of multiple days in advance so I would say peer around he's ill eligible right now so if you picked him up you could drop them straight into your injured list and you almost don't even have to use a roster slot in certain formats to hold on to him and just see if anything gets out of his way between now and February 8th  before I get to my rank Board of all eight names that I've posted on these trade deadlines stash shows I want to remind everybody once again please take a moment to go and pretty like our trade deadline Live program that's coming up on February the 8th starting at 7:30 a.m. Pacific time it's at 431 likes now so two

manscaped.com also again reminder I am at Dan best person on social media d a n b e s b r i s on Twitter Sports ethos.com is our website and now you guys get my eight stashes ranked  so here you go and you probably could have piece it together by the way I was talking about it and I had the hardest time here basically between three and six on Yoko Congo is my number one not necessarily because I think he's the most likely to step into massive value but because if a player gets out of his way and that player is Clint capela we know oh Kong will be top 50 and they're just like that's an unbelievably valuable type of player guys in the 75 to 100 range are fine but they're kind of like keep you afloat type of guys the 50 and above those are the dudes that really move the needle and when you fantasy leaks and so okongo of all the guys on this board probably as the best shot to actually hit that marker and then that's the reason that the two guys behind him here on my board Santi aldama is number two Dennis Smith Juniors number three and you could flip-flop those if you really wanted to I just think that Obama has a really clear path that might not involve the trade deadline because we might get through the trade deadline in Memphis might not have moved anybody but Obama still might be the starting power forward there in half of their ballgames and then if JJJ starts to rest more then he might be the starting power forward in 2/3 to 3 quarters of their ballgame  and then of course if Tillman does get moved to the trade deadline then he's basically a starter the rest of the way so they're just a lot of Pathways for all dominated go from being not a play which he wasn't as of like three games ago to you know play 50% of the time to 67 75% of the time and that's often enough in most formats to make a guy good and then Dennis Smith Jr who in my eyes is less likely because I don't know how easy it's going to be for the next to move didn't witty I'm thinking there going to try and he's been linked to a few teams if you read again that Bobby marks article uh but we know that Dennis Smith as a starter playing 30 minutes does like okongwu have a shot to be top 50 probably more in the 60 to 75 range  which is still good but not like a win you a league type of dude he's a give you a much better shot to win your weak kind of guy which I don't know that we can say about all the names on this list and so that's why Dennis Smith Jr is in that top three  DeAndre Hunter is number four because I think he has a really good shot to gain value at the trade deadline I don't think he jumps as high as the three guys in front of him but again if he gets into that 85.95 range  that's useful that's playable guy  be louder believe number five on the list because there's an unknown here we know there's a very good chance that he takes a big jump forward whether it's just because of shutdowns or trades or some combination thereof  but he also has big big issues in his Fantasy game so even if he gets to play 32 minutes and get some more shots there's no guarantee he gets inside the top 100 because the free throw percent could be a disaster we don't know if he's gonna hit enough threes we don't know if he's gonna score enough blah blah blah and on and on and on  so again how does a guy who's like you know ranked near the top 200 take a giant step forward possibly yes I mean probably honestly but does he still get as high as those guys in front of him I think that remains questionable Jabari Walker is one I like as like a quiet reasonable play I just again I don't see the clear path to him playing more than he's playing already unless Jeremy Grant gets moved and that feels somewhat unlikely he's number six on the list Gary Trent Jr is number seven because it feels like he needs shots that are not about to magically appear in Toronto and as a Thompson is number eight because I don't think he's gonna get the big play until March which again that maybe similar case to Jabari Walker but Walker I think has a better path to just doing stuff right now so that's why he's in front and that's why Thompson is in the last slot on the list here of the eight names we've talked about  and that ladies and gentlemen is your second edition of The Players to stash for the trade deadline I'm thankful that you guys came back and join me for another round of it I'd like to get a Buy Low show going at some point in the next couple of days we'll see if that fits but it felt like this one was a little bit more relevant given the proximity the trade deadline just a little over two weeks from today again thank you so much for listening follow on Twitter at Dan Bass Pros find in Discord like our trade deadline live page like
