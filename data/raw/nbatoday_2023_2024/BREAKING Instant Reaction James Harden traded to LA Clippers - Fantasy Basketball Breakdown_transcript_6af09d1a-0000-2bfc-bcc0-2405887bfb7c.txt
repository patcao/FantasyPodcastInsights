welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  well  it happened  James Harden  is now a member  of the Los Angeles Clippers of Anaheim  I'm gonna hit sorry Clippers that's that's not nice  and  I mean we all kind of knew this was coming it was the place where he wanted to be it was basically the only team engaged with the Sixers in trade talks because basically everybody else in the NBA was like why the hell do we want an aging  trouble making James Harden  but for some reason the Clippers decided that was the thing that they want  a bunch of California kids together  Russ from La Harden's from LA  Paul George's from the Antelope Valley a little bit north of Los Angeles  Kauai where's he at Moreno Valley I think somewhere what's that like Southeast ish  I think that's out by  Riverside County  so they're all together they got their their SoCal connection back and it's a super weird one but our job here is to break down the fantasy ramifications so that's what we're gonna do first of all I want to apologize in advance because  my voice is an absolute disaster right now I  we somehow managed to hold off on getting all of the kids illnesses here for a while but then they all then it all came together in this one may go one and we're just doing our best to kind of keep it from from knocking out my voice is pretty weak so bear with me a little bit that said I am Dan best briefs at Dan best person over on social media I hope you guys will find me over there de and b e s b r i s  you know things like this where I could get thoughts out late last night before I went to bed via social media that I simply can't do on a podcast late night because my kids are asleep freaking 20 feet that direction so definitely come hang out with me over there  like rate subscribe you guys know the ordeal their chat room is open for those watching live I don't know that we're gonna get to a ton of questions on this one but if you guys want to talk to one another about basketball fantasy basketball whatever you can certainly do that over in the chat room so let's just get this thing going so here's the thing  well first things first let's do the trade the final  numbers on this if you want to call it that because Oklahoma City got involved after the fact for a pick swap  but you guys don't really care about that the main thing here  is that James Harden  and PJ Tucker  our headed to the Los Angeles Clippers  and if exchange for Nicholas platoon Marcus Morris Rob Covington and KJ Martin  and then draft picks there's draft picks moving around but that's not really important for our immediate fantasy ramifications  I thought what we could do to kind of keep this thing organized  is to break it down first by the players that are actually moving in the deal so hard in PJ Tucker going one way and then a whole crap ton of power forwards going the other way and then we'll talk a little bit about what players might be impacted that were not directly involved in the trade uh but instead by you know their minutes being moved  uh Etc  because of the players moving around them  now I also wanted to get this out very quickly so in all likelihood you guys are just gonna see my Microsoft Word open right now you know I could put it into read mode but I actually want to type on it while we're going so just sort of bear with me on that front yeah you get to see the top of it you can see that it's just an Untitled document  and I didn't know if we should go with you know print layout or web layout frankly doesn't really matter but you guys are gonna see my cursor and I'm gonna be adding to this as we go so this will be a nice way to kind of see it in real time folks on YouTube get the added bonus of kind of seeing it as I plop it on the screen and and obviously those that are listening you guys will  get to hear me talk about it  so first things first James Harden  he's member of the Los Angeles Clippers now  and his role there will be smaller than it would have been had he somehow managed to mend things with the 70 Sixers or for ended up in a place like Chicago and one of their Stars went back to Philadelphia but that type of stuff was just not gonna happen once he made a scene and once we found out that basically every other team didn't want much to do with them so from that standpoint James Harden's value takes a small dip  but from another standpoint this is a colossal win for hard  and that's how I'm actually gonna file this in this is a colossal win for James Harden because  he wasn't playing  in Philadelphia  so you know say whatever you want about his value going up his value going down with respect to what it would have been with the 76ers he wasn't playing  his value was a fat zero  and when I say fat I was a little worried that we were going to get James Harden fat mode his value was a big fat zero in Philadelphia he wasn't gonna play they were saying all the right things about him you know staying back to get training and blah blah blah but they were not going to let him into the mix he was  sort of a cancerous Presence at the end and I'm sure the players were all sort of friendly with him but I'm also certain I don't need to talk to somebody in the locker room to know that they were annoyed by it  because  he wasn't traded yet so they didn't have whatever piece is we're coming back they didn't have whatever picks were coming back and they also didn't have the services of the guy that was supposed to be their second best player so yes this was a big fat locker room distraction so he's gone now  is he going to be you know last year hardened was what he was like number 17 ish in nine cat and 3.4 turnovers per game I think in eight Gaddy was one or two slots higher not a big jump there but we got like two around the turn in eight cat is he gonna be you know number 11 if you're punting turnovers with the Clippers know is he gonna be number 15 16 in nine cat with the Clippers no probably not but even a large step back for Hardin still probably keeps him inside the top 30  more than likely he has enough Fantasy game left to be a top 25 guy 9 cat and better than that in eight cat  and  the beauty part is if you drafted in the final week week and a half before the season when all of the James Harden crap was exploding you were getting him in the mid to late 40s to sometimes even the 50s  the very last draft I did  I got James Harden at pick 57  almost the very end of the 5th round up knowing that at that point the downside just wasn't there he could have sat out almost half the season and he still would have been a value and now we're gonna get him back playing probably within the next week I would think maybe even sooner we'll see how the Clippers feel about his conditioning and his knowledge of their playbook and stuff like that because they have pretty good chemistry going right now  but he's gonna play he's gonna play Big minutes because they just  you know mortgage their last few first round picks for him  Clippers did manage to keep Terrence Mann so that was something  and so for Hardin this is a massive win because he's gonna play now  next player in the deal is PJ Tucker I think that is value stays the same  and we'll fill that in on our board here he'll likely play a fair amount with the clippers because as you see going back the other door action the Clippers sent four power forwards back to the 76ers so now they pretty much have none  I don't think that they want  Kawhi and PG playing a ton of minutes at power forward I don't think they want those guys taking that kind of beating against players that are as big or bigger than them  and so PJ's gonna play but also at the same time that doesn't matter so in fact we're gonna add that as well it stays the same but doesn't matter because PJ Tucker doesn't do anything when he's on a basketball court the days of him being even remotely involved on offense are gone he's an outside the top 200 guy so it's just not something you need to worry about that's a pretty straight forward one oh now let's get to the rear the weird side which is all the guys going from the Clippers  to the 76ers  Nic Batum Rob Covington Marcus Morris KJ Martin  I'd love to tell you guys that I know exactly how the power forward minutes are about to shake out in Philadelphia but I don't think that anybody really does until we see them play all together in their first game  so with that caveat let's make a few educated guesses  educated guess number one and we're going to move into the players that aren't involved is that Tobias Harris is going to keep his big minutes  okay will that be power forward or small forward we haven't decided that yet but that's locked in  educated guess number two Tyrese Maxey keep his big minutes so that's good for Tyrese Maxey because no one's coming in to take his job running a bunch of the offense at the guard spot he enjoy lumbered are going to be the two guys that run things  if we assume for our arguments sake that Joel embiid is going to have big starters minutes to buy his Harris is going to have big starters minutes Tyrese Macy's gonna have big starters minutes the Anthony Melton is going to start  but will his minutes fluctuate  the way they kind of have been  we kind of I think have to assume oh and I forgot to put one name on this board so let's make sure we add Kelly ubre to the mix  so far this season Melton has seen his minutes bounce around a little bit based on how good Kelly oubre has looked and that probably continues and for Kelly oubre will continue to be  a gunner Off the Bench  so that type of stuff I think we can assume we'll say relatively constant  relatively being the operative word  because you've got all these guys that just came in meaning  it's not good for the guys on the Sixers whose minutes were not completely locked in stone  so I think for D Anthony Melton  you know best case scenario this is same  and I'll change actually because I wanted you guys to kind of see what I was thinking here let's say best case stays the same  and for Kelly oubre all so best case stays the same  because there's just no way that this is a good thing for those dudes  more players coming in  it's quite conceivable that Melton keeps the same job he had and it's also conceivable that Kelly oubre keeps the same job he had but it's not locked in stone because now we pivot back around to the players that just arrived in Philadelphia Nic Batum Rob Covington Marcus Morris KJ Martin at least two of those four guys are going to do something  my best guess is that the two guys that are going to be doing something for the Sixers are KJ Martin and Rob Covington  Marcus Morris hasn't seemed healthy in a while he was more or less out of the Clippers rotation but tomb  also can't stay healthy but he's you know he's been a nice glue guy for them the last couple of years maybe they keep those roles generally in Philadelphia  but I'm going to say wouldn't worry about it for Marcus Morris and for Nick Patton  folks picture this nightmare scenario you're hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown

armchair  download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's d r i z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  let's just say  watch game 1 and see if he plays basically I think what we're looking at here now and I don't think Kelly oubre ends up in the starting lineup I think what we're looking at is that either Rob Covington or KJ Martin takes PJ Tucker's spot in the starting lineup  I personally don't know which one it's going to be  we can make guesses  but all they that's all they are is relatively educated guesses  so Covington could start  probably plays a little  we'll fill that in and for KJ Martin  other starter option  maybe at the three  so that's where I sit on those guys but we really can't know for certain until we see what Nick nurse is going to do the reason that we should pay attention to it though is historically Nick nurse plays his guy's a lot of minutes  so if he decides that KJ Martin is his guy then you probably wanted to make it as speculative add there but again I don't think we need to do it right now and I would also say that this then bounces back onto Paul Reed who I think we can assume assume he's still the backup center  I don't see how  Paul Reed now suddenly gets a ton of power forward minutes  maybe he gets a couple but let's remember that Tobias Harris still plays some backup power forward for this team so like they have now they went from basically two power forwards Tobias Harris as the backup for and PJ Tucker to five  there's just no way that life got easier for Paul Reed in this mix  I wish it did and maybe they're more willing to try it now with Tucker gone and all of these other options that they haven't really figured out how they fit in town but it's Log Jam City man the guy they cut was Danny Green they didn't get rid of a power forward they got rid of a shooting guard small forward in Danny Green  so they added four power forwards well three Net because they sent one out  and they sent out a shooting guard that wasn't playing in James Harden and they sent out a small forward that wasn't well that was playing a little bit and Danny Green so the power forward spot just got insanely log jammed in Philadelphia which is why I don't think you need to make any pickups on that side right now but keep an eye on it because if any of these four guys that I'll highlight on the screen the four guys that went the other way ah Microsoft Word throwing bubbles in front of my face but tomb Covington Marcus Morris KJ Martin if anyone of those guys starts and you're just like oh my God this guy just got PJ Tucker minutes right out of the Chute he played 29 minutes in the very first game  then you pick that guy up  or hell if you have dead weight on your roster when you find out who's starting for the 76ers maybe you can consider making a pickup and then drop him at halftime if that guy gets 12 minutes and set of 16  so if you options on how you want to play that side of things I just don't think that we need to do anything there right now  as far as the Clippers go with James Harden coming in and four guys going out that combined really weren't doing all that much and PJ Tucker coming in  there are in my eyes basically only losers  this is one of those god-awful famous fantasy trays where one guy is the massive winner that guy is the dude who went from not playing to playing and then basically everybody else is either staying the same or taking a hit Russell Westbrook was the point guard for this team  he takes a hit  because James Harden is going to be the guy running the offense a lot of the time and they'll have us I would guess coming in with a second unit  Kawhi Leonard loses a little usage  Paul George loses some usage  there's almost no way around it Terrence Mann  is he actually hurt question mark  If so okay  once he plays  not much left  and he eats his two Bots  maybe a tiny win  so perhaps I was not completely accurate and saying that everybody loses out because  zubats who had a connection starting to develop with Russell Westbrook gets another guy out there that's can run a pick-and-roll better than Kauai and better than Paul George and so perhaps that ends up as a small win for zubats or maybe it kind of stays the same because he was getting a little bit more a little bit better looks with Russ as the point guard there anyway so probably stays the same but at least we think we can probably argue that it doesn't hurt Zoo because they had in the past played batam as a small ball 5 they've played Marcus Morris as a small ball 5 and that just takes that off the table  but they still have Mason Plumlee so it's not like you know zubats it's about to fall into a bunch of extra minutes it's just that now when he's on the court he's probably gonna have at least one point guard with him so probably a very very small win for zubats again maybe it doesn't change maybe it's so small that it doesn't matter but at least he's someone besides James Harden where you're like well I don't think it's gonna get worse  so now we can actually throw Microsoft Word into read mode you guys can get a better look at it on your YouTube screen let's go back through these names very quickly here as we kind of wrap up the discussion and then I'll look over at the chat room to see if anybody's got a couple of pieces of input or two that we can throw up on the screen  your winner in this trade is James Harden he is the only one that's a guaranteed win  because he went from not playing to playing  and if you drafted him in the 40s and 50s you got yourself a big fat winner  I know I use that expression a lot I got it on the brain  the other guy involved in the trade PJ Tucker  not notable Nic Batum doubtful that he ends up with any meaningful role on Philly but could play some kind of small thing off the bench  Marcus Morris same general idea Rob Covington remember this is kind of where he got started he had his breakout in Philly oh so long ago six seven years whatever it was now  KJ Martin he's the young guy one would hope that he's the dude that emerges from this pack but again we don't really know for sure among those four guys let's keep a watch on Philadelphia see if any of them move sort of Above The Fray  Paul Reed I think we can just leave it where it was to buy his Harris this is generally good news for him all though perhaps if he's having a terrible game maybe they do give Covington or two men extra minute or something like that but I wouldn't be too worried about Harris Melton probably doesn't help him to have all these new guys in town but again They're all playing a much larger spot on the floor and the only way it hurts Melton or Uber Bray is if the Sixers decide to go kind of big Tyrese Maxey is not impacted by this at all he's been amazing so far this year and he will continue to be so I guess you can call him a winner because no guards came back in this trade uh Russell Westbrook taking a hit because James Harden is going to run some more offense for the Clippers Kauai Paul George they're just gonna have to do a little bit less Terrence Mann probably doesn't really matter all that much because there's just not much left as the expression goes meat on that bone anyway I mean even before this trade I don't think there was much meat on the bone but now there's really nothing and then he eats a zubats maybe a tiny win  I'm Gonna Leave This up on the board  I realize it took zubats off the screen when I threw it into read mode so maybe I can just shrink everything by a tiny bit  put it back into read mode there you go now we can see the whole thing  I wish it would stop highlighting stuff there we go so let's go to the chat room now let's see if anybody had something that we want to add to the mix Dave slicks says how long before and wants out of Los Angeles  I would ask you how long before Paul George and Kawhi Leonard won out of Los Angeles  yes what  all three of them are free agents at the end of this year none of them have signed an extension yet  Denver says I feel like Kelly oubre is the only winner from this trade from a waiver pickups point of view yeah I mean he probably keeps his job perhaps so about the same  maybe KJ Martin a sleeper yeah and that's the thing like we find out he's starting I think you probably pick him up because hustle plays easy looks from and bead  I be cool with that  Delonte who I'm guessing is a Sixers fan says good riddance  if you guys are asking me questions that are not about this James Harden trade I am likely not going to be answering them right now  Delonte is not happy about it Harden is the poster child for NBA needs to Tamper down player empowerment he may be the athlete I hate most across all sports  wow man don't like him much do you  ESPN posted a video 50 minutes ago title James Harden could be detrimental to Westbrook and the Clippers yeah I mean I yeah from a fantasy standpoint that's for darn sure  freaky says what was Kelly you raise highest fantasy ranking for a whole year I believe it was that season in Phoenix where they didn't have much going on around him he was like a top 55 top 60 kind of dude he ain't getting back to that anytime soon Habs says you know what's crazy I don't think this is a win-win is it me or is this kind of a loss for both teams I actually think this is a win for the Sixers because they get off the headache he was more trouble than he was worth lately this is going to take a weight off of that team it's done now I think perhaps they wanted to get more useful players back in a deal so there's perhaps a little bit of a letdown to that respect but like  the circus is gone and beat and Tyrese Maxey are going to just go at this point and hopefully some other guys can kind of grow around them  Joseph C says Rococo and then with a rocket ship question mark  I wouldn't Bank on it but if he gets the starting job I would pick him up just to see all that game goes and that's really how I feel about almost any of those four guys well  maybe not Marcus Morris maybe not but I don't think they can stay healthy enough to be on the floor lawn the whole time but like if KJ Martin Rob Covington gets the starting job in Philly I would pick him up before that game even starts  let's see here what do we got do do do do do have says I love Roco but let's be real he's not a great one to one Defender anymore yeah he's lost a lot of his speed but you know maybe Philly wants sort of like the big power forward he's playing power forward and not small forward I think he could handle it but we'll see Michael Gibbs says Tobias good net result no not worry about the clips coming in taking up his minutes not really no I'm not too worried about that  Brandon says should we Panic about Kauai now you're never panicking about Kawhi Leonard he's a he's a top 10 fantasy play I don't think it even really matters who's next to him he's just  he's good at everything and if this means that assists come down a tiny bit I'm not super worried about it yeah I mean it's not good for Kawaii but it's not gonna hurt him all that much  uh let's see here looking for this one says hotline bling says Cali boys are about to go crazy I don't know if that's gonna be good or bad but yeah things are about to get crazy  to to  James oh James Harden passing to Kawaii and PG yeah I mean you know like Russ is actually done an okay job with that particular job as much as I think you know Russ is game is is a little bit of a mess right now I don't think that the like where these guys get the balls going to be all that different  the what hard can do that rust can't do is space the floor Russ can't shoot so that will open things up a little bit more but I don't think it's Gonna Change like I don't think Kauai and Paul George about to get much more efficient in a way that they weren't before basically  let's see here is Paul read a whole after the trade I mean you could see if there's this wild magical world where he gets a start I don't think he's gonna play any more now than he did before but you could wait one game there's a lot of question marks with this trade so  what else we got in this thing Tyrone says I traded Garland for Harden before the season I'm actually okay with that now and today I traded Maxi for Jimmy Butler before the hardened news broke I'm good with both of those you look at this is a sad face here on this post  but I think you just turned Garland who was like a 40 range guy last year nine cat into someone who's probably gonna be a 25 range guy and you turn Tyrese Maxey who he's not gonna be a first round or all season long let's let's be real with ourselves you turn probably like a top 25 30 guy into a top 120 good traits  absolutely good trades  will Kelly oubre be impacted by all the new bodies I don't think it helps him to have them all around but I do think that I do think that like there's a chance that he takes a hit here and there and  so probably not great but also like I wrote above I think probably stays the same  Jake says you should put Joel embed on this list I could but I don't think it's job changes at all  shining Knight asks you think these folks will get traded away for a secondary star that's actually really good question the Sixers will probably try to move some pieces around and if they do we'll reassess at that point  well clippers end up with a leaner rotation a little bit maybe you know I I don't think that that's going to elevate anybody above the cut line that wasn't before though  would Harden return early to mid third round value I think potentially earlier than that actually  let's see what else we got going on here lots of good questions Lakers fans are crying right now I don't think that that's true actually  I think the Lakers fans see a possible implosion on the way in clippertown this like they could what if it works it works but where has the hardened thing worked since Houston  he's just been a mess everywhere he's gone  puts up decent numbers fantasy wise but somehow rubs everybody the wrong way every single time I don't know why this one would be different maybe it will be but  someone's gonna this is a you gotta prove it to me  his bones a good stream for the back-to-back yeah probably but like thing is they didn't trade away their guards they traded away their power forwards  if anything we can figure out if there's a Clipper front Court guy that might get to do some stuff but honestly there's just like between rust Kawaii PG and zubats there's a whole lot left  JP says Roco was a small forward we played for the Sixers before yeah I use about 40 pounds leaner and about seven years younger than he ain't a small forward anymore  Norman Powell and Bones Outlook there's still kind of stuck behind guys and it's probably not good for Norm  because they added a guard they got rid of power forwards  I can trade Garland for Hardin what do you think yeah I think I'd rather have a hardened  Paul Reed we've talked about him a little bit I think he'd stays the same I don't think this helps him in any way JP says Clips are winning a championship with that lineup uh  I don't know  bulk of the power forward minutes and Clipper Town will go to question mark um  probably PJ Tucker honestly  or maybe Kauai  we'll see how it goes  all right let's put a pin in that I think we covered pretty much every angle we possibly could thanks for watching everybody please like rate
