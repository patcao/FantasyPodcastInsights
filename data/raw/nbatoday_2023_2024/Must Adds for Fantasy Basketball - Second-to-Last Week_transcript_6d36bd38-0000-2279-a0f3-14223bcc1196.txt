welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right what's happening everybody  welcome  welcome welcome it's fantasy NBA today  start of week 24 of officially 23rd period  so the finals for Yahoo League's  it's second to last week  no matter how you slice it penultimate  is the word a lot of people like that word I find it just fine I'm agnostic towards the word penultimate  it's a good one though  means the second to last  and that's where we're at folks we got two weeks left of the NBA season were  90% of the way through  just a handful of games left for most these teams seven or eight that's pretty much it for everybody in the league  now talk about the stretch run this is it on the show today we're going to be recapping the weekend we'll go through all 30 teams just the way we've done basically every Monday all season long minus the All-Star break and we'll get you the ads we'll get you the drops we'll get you situated for how to attack this week and then later on this afternoon I am trying to figure out exactly what time that'll be probably one 30 ish 132 Pacific time we'll have a streaming show just like we've been doing last three or four weeks on that front to try to do them as often as I can we manage to squeeze out a couple of quick ones over the weekend  and we'll do that again today all these one will have a look kind of at the entirety of the week it'll be more of a weekly preview show and streaming analysis all rolled together  and again that'll be later on this afternoon and I got a couple of questions before we dive into the actual meat and potatoes of this show on why I've split them up and on you it was looking at shows from previous Seasons basically where I did shows  around this time of year where I tried to mash it all together and I found myself rushing unnecessarily to try to get it all together in you know 45 to 55 minutes  and on top of that I don't have a producer I am the producer of this show so when I'm off on a tangent a ran whatever I don't generally have the presence of mind to go look at the YouTube feed and see all the time stamp it because what would be really nice and the easiest way to do this would be to do one giant show but also time stamp where all the different things are happening but I don't have time for that because I don't want to listen back to the whole thing I don't want to listen my self-talk for 45 minutes twice in the same day  having helped me Hub and help all of you  to go say oh this is where Dan talks about this game and this is where Dan talks about streaming and this is where we get into the ads  so instead I just split it up  however long this first show goes It goes I'm not rushing it I do it at whatever Pace I want and then those that are interested in the streaming side they can get into the second show  and those are almost always going to be between 10 and 20 minutes long they're pretty quick one commercial break in the middle that's it so that's why I split them up it just sort of an organizational thing I think it's easier for you guys Rodeo folks can focus more on the first one they don't even have to listen to the second show if they don't want to I don't know maybe they do had headphones you guys can do both or just the second one  it's kind of an on-demand listening experience that was the goal here let's get into the weekend we'll go through the games in Reverse chronological order you guys know how this works by this point and then at the end of it all we'll play the game that I like to call who didn't play on Saturday or Sunday Dan always forgets but luckily late this season I've had the streaming schedule up on my computer at all times so I can very quickly pull up the four teams I already know there were 14 that didn't play Saturday or Sunday and make me look like less of a disorganized goof  Cleveland smoked in Denver let's just Dive Right oh by the way I'm at the investors on Twitter many of you are watching over there these days which is super cool although I don't think it all right it does quite as much for the the old advertisers bucket book give you know what I mean but many of you guys are watching on Twitter I would strongly advise those of you that are watching on social media to go subscribe on YouTube or iTunes or Spotify or something like that so you guys can get alerts because there will be shows in the offseason that don't go live on social or YouTube frankly there will be some we do that our audio only because in the offseason ain't nobody watching fantasy basketball stuff on YouTube I'm going to try to do as many as I can this way but it also gets super complicated when I'm like working off of an Excel file and it's getting really into the weeds  anyway all right okay okay okay okay okay okay  talk fantasy basketball careless Levert out a big ball game that won't happen very often with Donovan Mitchell back  there is concern that spy to get some games off here and there Cleveland has a back-to-back coming up at Utah at Phoenix if he's gonna skip either of them it would probably be the Utah half although it does kind of feel like they need wins right now so we'll see how that goes  so if I said to say that for Levert he becomes a little bit more of a  you know shot in the dark kind of guy you're hoping for some steals which you got in this ball game you're praying the efficiency doesn't get ruined which all so did happen in this ball game it stayed good  and then if you know if that works then you get a couple points a couple boards couple of assists for my dollar it's too risky Max Drew's now that he's playing again and his body looks better he again hit more than 50% of a shot though this time was only five of them I think I don't know that he's quite all the way above the start everywhere line he's probably gonna land in the 100 to 130 range which technically makes him kind of like a front Ender of the doesn't matter group so there you're targeting threes and just kind of like a little bit of all things but again these are guys  for those that need to be reminded that doesn't matter group this time of year are really the category hunting group they're one in the same  so if you're category hunting some threes extras makes some sense there only one in this ball game he'll also give you a little bit of some other stuff as well he's not quite as you know  you need to mention all mono dimensional  if that one anyway let's keep going  for Denver there's very little to talk about Reggie Jackson is feeling in for Jamal Murray he scored a bunch in this ball game um super Ricky fill in play again category haunting points in assists that's it that's what you're going for with Reggie and you can't be attacking anything else because he's almost never gonna give you anything else otherwise everything  same old same old for the Denver Nuggets  big news of the morning and I don't know why I didn't start with this probably because I had all these other things that I wanted to kick around in my brain Joel embiid might be back for Phillies next ball game on Tuesday which is going to dramatically change how the shots are allocated on this club but it's worth mentioning he's not gonna come in and play 35 minutes right out of the Chute you're probably gonna get 18 out of him and that first ball game so I don't think today's the day to make big adjustments to what you're doing with the 76ers other than obviously embed is now starting and mo Bamba and Paul Reed are now fighting for the backup minutes together  brutal if you have Paul Reeder MOBA you can probably move on at this point Reid has been barely able to hang on for the last couple of weeks on blocks basically but I don't know how many weeks in a row I've said I have this weird sinking feeling about Paul Reed maintaining fantasy value and he made it almost the whole way barely barely but now no Bamba know  heeled no campaign scored 24 points filling in for Tyrese Maxey but honestly between those two guys paying in Lowry with the other one who had 11 in 10:00 the assists and he gets steals  where as pain it's you're just praying he shoots the ball well from the field on whatever one game you're starting in and he did in this one but he usually doesn't  campaign is much better for points than nine cat  what I mean I could be back for that next ball game as well so I don't know this is a situation where you make a move ahead of time but if you're a cyst hunting Lowry would probably be the guy in that department you're not adding Nick platoon and you can probably play Kelly ubre for one more ball game at least while we wait for MB to get acclimated specially here with no indeed or Maxi Newberry was gonna get a lot of shots and he had himself a giant ball game as a result Toronto will be getting back both Emmanuel quickly and RJ Barrett for their game against the Lakers tomorrow as I mean that's just the way that it works if the Lakers are coming you're getting everybody fired up that's that's classic Man start your guys again these guys have been out for weeks and in the Lakers show up and they're all back in their Kelly Olynyk he's a start okay getting question I mean look the reason is his value isn't as high as usual is that it's being kind of artificially deflated by horrible turnovers right now but he's doing all this across the board stuff and like this is a this is a monster game without the turnovers it's a Goliath of a ball game even with them it's a damn good one Gary trying to score a bunch of points he's gonna hit some threes so get you a couple of steals he started his well Bruce Brown had a nice game but with quickly and Barrett coming back that's a know frankly Gary Trent probably slides back towards bareilly startable with quickly and and bear it in but I think Trent probably does still stay above that cut line  hello Clinic might get better he has actual like legitimate NBA players to throw a ball to get a sis he's gonna pile up assist right now ah you can keep an eye on Jordan wore Javon Freeman Liberty if you want but again with guys coming back that and gradey Dick same story those guys are just they don't belong even on your radar I think you'll start a Linux Trent quickly and Barrett and Barrett is points League only  Miami beat Washington no surprise there how they got there was a little bit interesting because Nikola jovic had a decent game Dylan Wright had a pretty good ball game hey would Highsmith at 10 and 4 again but guess what you know who doesn't care and has two thumbs  this guy  Rozier bam Jimmy those are the easy ones and Duncan Robinson's back so there's good news on the Dunkin' Robinson front  if he was abandoned in any of your League's go check around he don't have a particularly great schedule this week but certainly more so on the roadside and they play four games so at least you got that I'm guessing Duncan Robinson probably got dropped in a few spots if he did go ahead and pick him up he played well when he was in there and hero was out he's just been down for whatever it is you know we can have two weeks or so prior to that he's done a really nice job of doing other stuff besides just taking three pointers this year now the threes are still good  you still hitting three of them the Ballgame but that reason that his field goal percent is back up from 37 last year to 46 this year  is that he's started to take some two pointers again and it's not like it's not that big of a change but this is a guy Robinson was taking like 85% of his shots from 3-point land and this year it's like 70  it's small but it's notable  he's attacking more and he's shooting 40% from downtown so he's back up kind of where he belongs there but he's attacking more  and it's good for his field goal percent and so that it kind of becomes good for all the other stuff that's going on this scoring is better he's just under his career high which was set back in 1919 2029 2020 at 13.5 points is here's a 13.4 and he may be gets above that if Tyler hero doesn't come back this regular season  I know it wasn't a good ball game yesterday I sort of don't care on that front and again you're gonna get a lot of 3-pointers out of him regardless because the numbers are better for Robinson when he started  which is happening  now these moments  it's you know I don't know that he gets above like top 90 ish range but I would say generally good enough to start in most formats unless you very much do not need three pointers at all that's the way that this is like okay I'll let I'll let somebody else deal with this one if you don't need three pointers even the tiniest bit because a lot of his value is derived from that category even if there is some other stuff available as well  for the Wiz Khalsa was out was these heel instead of his shoulder this time we'll see if that changes the way that they're utilizing him this week Corey kiss bird got his 13 shots up missed free throws I mean this is like the free throw thing with kiss bird is super weird but look when kuzma's out kiss Bert is generally is starting played 401 minutes almost anybody in the NBA who clears 40 minutes in a ball game is fantasy startable almost  so kiss Bert might be an ad for the week because we don't know if kuzma's he might be darn we'll see Jordan Poole still going Denny obvious still going Marvin Bagley is back to starting with no Roshan Holmes so badly is very much an ad right now while we wait and see what goes on with Rashawn we'll see if that flip-flops at some point this week so kind of stay tuned on that if pool shuts it down at some point and he hasn't yet Jared Butler would be the interesting ad because he's been racking up assists in his limited work Off the Bench but we do need another guy or two maybe even out of the way for Jared Butler to be worth an actual fantasy add so for now Marvin Bagley is the ad kiss bird is a stream with kuzma out and then pulling off the idea just continue to kind of Rumble along and whatever clip you call a rumble  if he eats a zubats is your big man play like we've talked about for a week he's in one of his little warm-up grooves happens about three times every season for zubats and it's happening now otherwise you just start the stars on the Clippers  over on the Charlotte side of his Celia Mitch's Nick Richards just it this happened within the last oh Joel embed by the way just got ruled out within the last two minutes he will not play in the Sixers next ball game so it was close but not quite so embed is gonna miss one more Tyrese Maxey is questionable so he might be back for that one so you can continue to do what you were doing with Philly for at least one more game that again being tomorrow Nick Richards became its hitch each listed as questionable like some poker chefski doubtful for the Charlotte Hornets for the next ball game what does that mean well Grant Williams becomes an excellent one gameplay for Charlotte  uh they play today or tomorrow they played today  so you may not have time to make that move but if you can grant Williams sliding up and getting the center minutes has been very very good for his fantasy value so you go miles Bridges Grant Williams in this game with Richards questionable if you gets ruled out I should say  forgot to mention that whoops  that's assumed let's say Nick Roger Richards  I'm struggling guys that's saying Nick Richards is out for their ballgame tonight then you go Grant Williams otherwise Grant is more of a 3-point stream  Bridges Brandon Miller those guys are starters whatever mitts itches is an assists stream right now Trey man is kind of your little bit across the board hope for okay percentage is every night kind of play low floor kind of low ceiling  you guys remember at the All-Star break I said it wasn't excited about these dudes tremend Count Day George I tried to level off everybody's expectations of dudes that had never really put up  consistent numbers and they did it for like a week and then everybody told me I was wrong and now you know who's not wrong anymore ah there's a chance that Davis bertans would be a three-point play if Richard sits  and I mean look you can play Trey man if you want and get a few rebounds view assists in a steal that's fine  but he's in a category hunting  group of players along with most of these guys  not all of them but many  that's why this this type of show is actually kind of hard to do right now because so many of the options are just category Hunters  miles Bridges Brandon Miller those guys are plays Grant Williams would be a play in all formats of Richard sits if it's not he's category hunting threes and some boards on okay percentages and Nick Richards is hunting boards and field goal percent if he plays and midgets hunting assists if he plays and Trey man his hunting some boards and some assistance in a steal if he plays none of these guys is a guy that's gonna make or break your team  on the head to head side but again like you play these guys and if you're attacking certain categories that's what you get  really hot tomorrow he sort of got challenged by his team to go get some damn rebounds this happens a couple of times a season with rui where somebody yells at him hey you can't just stand there you're like six nine six ten go get a board he does it for a few games and then he kind of throttles back down again so you could probably play rui right now for points good percentages and boards but just understand that the boards might evaporate before your eyes as soon as their next ball game we just don't know when that's gonna disappear  D'Angelo Russell at 10,000 points in his NBA career congrats to D-Lo and for the Lakers you know for the for the moment you can start all five starters although I think we know that Ruiz the guy that tapers off here as as time elapses for the Brooklyn Nets cam Johnson is out he'll get arrested Dennis Smith Jr has been dealing with some hips soreness but he didn't really play anyway trying to watch for had a big one Off the Bench don't care Michelle Bridges can't shoot there's been a rough year for him but you play Bridges you play Camp Thomas you play Nick's in  I think Dennis Schroder  well with Johnson and Dennis Smith Jr both back out Schroeder is playable again when those guys are in the other cam cam Johnson and Dennis Smith  I just I don't think there's enough point guards stuff left not that like those guys are point guards or anything but they're just more dudes to share the basketball with  Cam Thomas being there is the one immediately that turned Schroeder from an everyday guy to a barely guy and then if you had more people to the mix I don't know that Schroeder gets above kind of a schedule play for now  short term cam Johnson and Dennis Smith Jr out you can probably go Schroeder in most formats definitely if you're hunting some points in assists you didn't do much else  and then when if or when the team gets healthy and again I don't know that they will because the season is is done Brooklyn's cooked  their counting it out here  I mean distributor even take a game off in there who knows but his other guys miss time then he elevates little by little and this is just another example of why it's so hard to do a show that's trying to predict the next two weeks when we just don't even know who's going to play the next hour  I don't even know if that was clear was my my feelings on true was that clear  I think he's probably around top 100 what if you guys are out and he's probably more like an assists points targeted guy when the team is mostly there Draymond Green huge ball game I don't wear the hell this one came from but it certainly didn't hurt him that Jonathan kaminga is out  the coming is out so Draymond is doing a little bit more trayce Jackson Davis his job is much more secure and you again you just sort of pray that he doesn't go to the free throw line very often  Brandon pudgy has first better game in about a week and a half you're not gonna pay much attention to that Chris Paul continues to Trend down  he's just not getting that much playing time right now and I believe frankly it's hard for me to say Chris Paul's a drop in most formats Chris Paul's a drop  now if someone got out of the way  okay  but they aren't right now it's just lower  and Andrew Wiggins had been trending way up and then late a serious egg in this ball game  I think you can probably hold a little bit longer on Wiggins you know I've been reticent to get on board with that one but he'd been playing so well that you kind of have to be like all right I guess we'll just see what happens uh Draymond we so with kaminga out we don't know how long that's going to be with comica out trayce Jackson Davis he was already pretty well locked in as a big man play with some nice upside if he doesn't shoot free throws that this firms that up and then you probably get a little bit more out of Draymond mostly because everybody's just gonna have to take a few extra shots and do a little bit more so those guys are both more firmed up or Draymond I had kind of downgraded to more of a punt points  like kind of category hunting sort of player he's probably a little bit above that now  Chris Paul's the real surprise clay your holding on to obviously stabbed and bring that one up weighs barely holding on and then Chris Paul probably not  San Antonio whenb Trey Jones and when he's back Devin cell it's the same thing as always repeat myself a bunch of times but you guys were out Nova sell no Sohan Kelvin Johnson was also out for this ball game and they amazing thing is that with all those guys out no one really stepped up to have fantasy value  giddy Osmond at 18 points but didn't do anything else that Collins at 13 and 8 Off the Bench but that was sort of lucky and then Julian champagnie was in my opinion probably your closest bet he played 38 minutes so I guess if all those guys are out again you can probably start champagne  assume you're gonna get a couple threes some boards and assists usually get some steals mixed in there Malachi Branham would be the points League try  but again I don't see how you use a bunch of moves on this team San Antonio has a bad schedule for first of all they play one game over four days to start the week and then all these guys might be back tomorrow for all we know  so probably a pass  Derek Lively left early for Dallas he was more of a category hunting schedule type guy  PJ Washington also schedule a level dude it's Luca it's Kyrie it's Gafford those are your plays on Dallas Houston lost busted up their winning streak and you know I you know I don't know that anything is necessarily locked in there now two games back at the Warriors  which is Sir mountable but not easy and I got yelled at on Twitter a little bit yesterday by sorted don't care  the Rockets were playing well  I don't want what I'm about to say to make you guys feel like they were not but it didn't hurt their cause that six of their wins over the winning streak came against the Blazers twice the Jazz twice and the Wizards twice and everyone counts they also played the Cavaliers with no Donovan Mitchell and I don't think Evan Mobley was even back for that ball game yet so the Cavaliers without two or aunts druce without three of their starters that was a win that wasn't super hard to get they beat the thunder without Shae Gill just Alexander which you know that wasn't an easy one they took him to overtime Thunder or good with or without SGA they're very good with him so that way was fine it just felt like the win over the Kings was kind of like the one where you were like oh this is a pretty good ball game  and then the other ones you were like okay yeah but  and now they played a good team and I got a beat and now they got the Timberwolves the Warriors that'll be a big one the heat the Mavs again the Magic in a row one two three four five six good team straight  if they lose another one or two of these the seasons basically over but I in my opinion this is where you find out if the Rockets you know soul out in Chene are really better or if this schedule played nice little helper role  ball game was over kind of early so a lot of guys got goofball minutes they played some dudes the normal amount but whatever I'm on Thompson had some foul issues he was still fine not great but fine keep an eye on cam Whitmore  if the Rockets get eliminated in the next two or three ball games you might see you know like Freddie Van Vleet take a few games off you might see Dillon Brooks take some games off when the team gets knocked out if or when the team I should say gets knocked out and then you'd probably want to take a shot on a guy like Whitmore maybe for the last two or three ball games but I don't think we're quite there yet  Chicago the Bulls I actually played kind of well down the stretch I don't know that it matters all that much they're the nine seed now and then they're not catching the Sixers but probably can stay ahead of the Hawks get home court in that you know winner take all and then another winner take all  no surprise is here  start the starters easy one  Minnesota  you're basically at the starters not Jayden McDaniels  my Conley not as Reed  gobert Anthony Edwards those the four guys are playing Kyle Anderson  affectionately known as slow-mo  had a few good games in a row and on the podcast I think on Friday and even on Thursday or Wednesday or Tuesday last week I said it a couple times I was like I really do think that he settles back towards a rebounds assist steals play um  because of games like this one where the Steelers are still there the other stuff disappears you know floats his value with defensive stats  you could probably play them in most formats  unless you're hunting threes or something like that so prop for slow mo you're probably good enough  very borderline 100 range would be my guess  fluctuating day to day week to week between you know 80 and 140  so slightly better than doesn't matter but not a game changer  Thunder game winner  speaking of game something Josh giddey had a triple double continue to play well here down the stretch but with shea back I don't think I can take that plunge now maybe get he's just in a Groove now it's possible it happens every once in a blue moon but  two risky for me so back to shade Jalen Williams and then Chad Holmgren had a rare bad one and for the dicks yeah basically playing everybody that they're gonna give 30 some odd minutes to and I say a hardenstein now with Mitchell Robinson back out tweaked his ankle again hardenstein got 29 minutes he's a behemoth in that amount of time he got McBride hardenstein heart Devon chenzo Brunson easy calls for the Knicks right now press is to Chua you can probably play with Robinson out if you need boards and some field goal percent and usually a steal so again category hunting is on the board but not in all formats  and Sacramento blew out the Jazz but who cares Utah's done they've pulled the plug on this season know John Collins in this game Larry marking in there you're gonna say sore so he's out for at least two weeks which is the length of the year at this point so what do you do well  you have Walker Kessler who's going to get minutes is John as long as John Collins is out Kessler's a play you got Colin Sexton who's going to do stuff because he's just gonna do stuff and then he got a bunch of question marks you got Bryce sensible who had 22 points in this ball game and you can look at him and go and if you squint hard enough and assume that none of the guys come back for Utah since about would probably make sense as a schedule type of play I don't think I'd go beyond that keonte George unbelievably inefficient in what he's been doing over the last few weeks he's been literally killing teams with his field goal percent but if you need points and a couple of assistance and some threes you could probably category hunt there a little bit and Taylor Hendricks is the one for me that actually is more of the question mark can he stay above the cut line my guess is probably not but it's not a guarantee Hendricks is a guy that is definitely a schedule level play so if you taught their schedule stinks to start the week but you know improves a little bit as you get later on in this one Roto know I don't have the stones for it  really only Kessler in Sexton and if John Collins plays with the guys that I would  play against the games Gap and the rest of these dudes you're very much just saying okay can I get one two three categories that I'm trying to pull together  for the Kings know Malik monk I think that happened over the weekend right we haven't talked about that on the podcast yet there is fear that he's gonna miss weeks and not days which means you got a whole lot of key on Ellis 5 8 and 3 with steel in a three-pointer this is kind of the floor for him so that's cool you're gonna get more shots out of Harrison Barnes but he's more of a  and frankly he on Alice's a little bit of a category Hunter as well but it probably more accurate to call Chi on Ellis just to punt points guy that probably does profile as above top 100 even if you're not punting points but very very impressive if you are Harrison Barnes category hunting points threes and percentages but he doesn't do anything else so probably not a top 100 play you know 125 ish with all these other dudes out and then I mean you know Keegan Murray gets to go Big Darren Fox and sabonis are already doing their stuff anyway but you know all these guys out that's good for Keegan Murray it's good for key on Ellis it's good for Harrison Barnes and oh Trey Lyles resurfaced  that's interesting only for my 30 deep team which is a lost I lost  its best two out of three in the finals I mean the finals against the great doctor a as you guys heard on a pod last week I lost the first week five to four and ended up pretty close actually  I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do  I need to win both percentages I think to stand a chance and  I don't know does that mean I dropped Trey Lyles in my lineup in my  30 deep  12 team members I think you'll Fox a bonus and Murray and Ellis I think all four of those guys make the cut and then Barnes is more of the  doesn't matter range so it's got to be a little more category related let's turn the clock back to Saturday it was not a particularly busy day and again I already know which four teams were gonna have to look at on Friday Boston beat New Orleans their guys were all playing for this ball game I don't know if they're gonna play in the next one because Boston has what's known as a gimme coming up tonight against a Charlotte team that might be without two more guys depending on who sits I think you'll probably see the Boston regulars play against the thunder on Wednesday Sacramento Friday maybe not Sunday against Portland  they'll try to get their guys some rest against the easy ones and Boston's runaway with the best record in the NBA so there's really no reason to push anyone but you guys know what to do if Porsche sits Al Horford is a start if Jalen Brown is questionable if he sits you probably get Sam Houser in there  and if either guard sits holiday or white you get Payton Pritchard in there  funny thing is Boston's at all these great fantasy assets all season long this is the most interesting they've been for a daily fantasy show because for the last like two weeks is the only time we really been able to do anything with Celtics all year other than just stardom blindly  Valentine's back down to 15 minutes in this loss anytime he plays an opposing big that can basically step out and stretch the floor JV gets run off the court and they run small small is a relative term because it's Zion its Center is not a small dude but he's also not a super tall guy  and so JV is very much a category hunt at this point some boards and some field goal percent typically but you ain't getting anything else out of them these days  but hey Dyson Daniels is back that surprised me I didn't see that one coming I thought he was just done uh that by the way if the team ever gets fully healthy would probably not be great for we saw herb and Trey Murphy take its before but I don't like those guys are playing too well nothing's changing what they're doing right now  oh Memphis you Desmond Bane back out and I think he's already been ruled out for their next ball game  Jaren Jackson is still trying to play  how many games is he at now  he's right on the cusp of qualifying for the various you know 65 Awards 64 okay well  you got one more in the tank but  he's been playing against competent opposition which is not happening tonight but it sounds like they want to get him in there so we'll see they've got a back-to-back later this week I doubt Jaron Jackson plays in both halves of that what's interesting for Memphis lots of stuff that's interesting not a whole lot of it that you can point to and go yeah there's a Thing Luke Kennard is interesting and also could be a thing if he starts  if he's just healthy the rest of the Hill sit back to back almost for sure but if he starts in place 30 minutes Kennard would be a go  JJ's a go if Bane comes back he's a go Brandon Clarke is watch list material I don't think as minutes get much above about 22 which you know historically is actually been kind of close to enough for him but I I can't recommend taking the plunge Jake laravia no schedule play kind of a rebound steals Target GG Jackson is more of a points threes Target who's gonna sink you in the other stuff  if somehow things pivot and they're like oh Jordan Goodwin we've got you're gonna start for a week while we use up your two-way game that would be interesting  I don't even know who this para kid is but he had five defensive stats so you can watch list and you can watch list Scotty Pippen Jr you can watch list the marsh Stevens on it who cares  who cares not I Jalen Suggs bounced back as expected he's been playing well down the stretch he felt like one of those guys that just needed to get out of the dog days of the season oh the season so long I can't play as hard as I want to play all year but now you see the finish line and the energy comes roaring back  Franz Wagner nine cat play Suggs 9 cap play Bon Carroll better points League guy Wendell Carter Junior is more of a stat Hunter  some points some boards usually feel goal percent  from a big man they won't kill you in  free throw percent either  and then everybody else anybody else you're looking at Cole Anthony's  guys are scheduled level  Milwaukee Patrick Beverley Got the Feeling start for Dame despite the busted hand he had a pretty good one surprise  I don't think anybody on the Bucks is scheduled to miss and upcoming ball game I'm sure they've got a couple of back to back so over the next two weeks and so Middleton will sit one of those out but that would end up just being good news for Beasley I think as long as Dame is around Beverly this was a this is a one shot and if you missed it you missed it which most of us did um and then Beasley when Middleton is out it's still more of a three-point play anyway so with Middleton sits in a back-to-back you play Beasley you get some threes that's again you're sort of stat hunting the rest of the time you're not playing him  team is healthy so Bobby Porter just goes back to being kind of more so on the outside looking in unless you're again hunting points and rebounds  good to see Brook Lopez actually block a couple of shots that was relevant  Hawks have a great schedule this week we'll talk a bunch about them on the streaming show Jalen Johnson is back baby check to make sure he wasn't dropped in your league he would be a league winning type of play this week and I say that because not only is he very very good at Fantasy but he also has a terrific schedule they play four games and none of them on the overload days so make sure nobody dropped Jaylen Johnson  and then otherwise I do still think you can probably play DeAndre Hunter barely more of a points and percentages stream  the math probably says that he's playable in most formats but I think maybe with Johnson vacuum slide him down towards  like a very good doesn't matter type of dude so then you got deante Murray Jalen Johnson Clinton Capo's the guys you can play in all formats because they do a bunch of different stuff and then Hunter is a little bit more of a fringy type where he's gonna profile a lot like Harrison Barnes with a bunch of Kings hurt  pretty similar  whoa I went to the wrong date everybody ignore  hey mid-show reminder I know most of you guys are watching on social media these days and that's okay please  don't  exclusively rely on Twitter to watch the show if I can beg you guys of that follow on some other platform preferably iTunes or Spotify because every show we do goes out on audio not every single show in the off season is going to be on video yeah YouTube works right now because we're doing all of our in season shows on video but that's definitely not a guarantee that it's going to continue from this point forward so traditional podcast channels is the way to go also from an advertising standpoint it actually helps us a lot more but that's your your not so subtle reminder there and of course to check out our buddies over at manscape.com their partnership with us will go on a brief Hiatus during the off-season but check them out use code ethos 20th those 2-0 guys get a couple of things here while we're finishing up the year I'm sure that'll lock them in as a partner again for next season 20% off free shipping at manscaped.com promo code there again is ethos two zero two teams we didn't talk about or sorry feel that  how many did I say originally four teams we didn't talk about Detroit is one of them I don't know when Kate's gonna play and when he's not gonna play they're going easy on his knee and their season's over I don't know and see modified techie I might be back  um it's amazing me to sign finished up his got himself a real contract  if cayde sits we saw met two play pretty well when he got a few extra minutes I don't like that he's an ad Kate sits you got Jaden Ivy gets bumped up from points League level to all formats level  and then guys like Malachi Flynn Evan Evan Fournier becomes schedule type of plays but basically at that point it's during Cade when the team is healthy and if Kate sits then IVs in but fantasy was a guy you keep it sorry met two guys can keep an eye on for Tech he was a guy you kind of want to watch the injury report see what's going on there Indiana was another team that didn't play over the weekend they had a good game against the Lakers going into it  nice Smith played better don't care he's hey not even really a stat he's not even really a category hunting guy he sits in that zone because he's sort of okay and a lot of stuff but he's kind of just okay at a lot of stuff so he's sort of like a do you need a warm body type TJ McConnell I know he's only playing 1920 minutes but he does this every game teens and points and a handful of assists you just didn't get any steals in this one in a weird twist but I'm playing McConnell basically everywhere Halliburton siakam Myles Turner obviously those are the the everydays and then you've got you know niece Smith if you're kind of hunting just a tiny bit of everything categories nem hard if you want to three ball and a couple of assist with those guys are  that's a reach man that's a reach  Phoenix and Portland where the other two so I can find where they were on this board here there they are  that's not them Phoenix they got their key guys in so that's who you play that's an easy one  and then Portland oh boy are they goofball team right now Deandrea is back they lost by 60  Scott Henderson was a minus 50 I just saw that I didn't even notice when I looked at that score back on Friday night holy crap oh boy anyway so it look if DeAndre ayton is playing you're playing him it seems like Simon's is done for the year shaedon Sharpe was was playing with the g-league so there's a chance he might just pop up but I wouldn't expect it  who can you play against the games cap on this Team 8 and yes  Banton is kind of a maybe  like Dan isn't he a lot like Gigi Jackson who you said no to and yeah button rebounds and assists a little bit more so even though you get the bad percentages stuff and turn over is there's a little bit more upside  and there's just nobody else alive on this team anymore because doubles back out  Justin Mania who were paying any attention to he's heard again Jeremy Grant is doubtful and he probably will be until October  and then you've got scoot is another sort of another question mark here Jabari Walker all is a question mark you've got all these these Fringe level guys and you're like okay well how much you used to do they actually need to overwhelm their bad categories and the answer is  about this much  so you got school if you're playing him you're assuming you're gonna get a whole crap ton of turnovers in the percentages are going to be a mess so points leagues have at it scoots of points League easy call same with Banton frankly I think Banton sits inside the top 100 the rest of the way barely sort of overcoming his inefficiencies I don't think scoot does  but again if you need some points you need some assist you'll probably get those out of him  if to money well no tamari Park ruled out for the year I remember they said he was out for a few ball games and they said the rest of the year so he's out for the season now as well he was the guy that I kind of like Chris Murray he'll probably do a little bit of many things and if he plays 42 minutes you could probably start him and just assume you're gonna get a few points and a three and some rebounds and assists and probably a steal in there it's gonna be very not exciting but if you just need to make up games basically in Rhode Island that's the play to go and head to head he'll be good enough in a good scheduling spot  and then Jabari Walker is points and rebounds only so that's a category hunting type of play all so  yes  all right there you go everybody 45 minutes deep that's all 30 teams again we will take a break and then right after lunch we'll give you the streaming episode This is actually starting to hurt my voice today for some reason I don't know why didn't do anything that should have my voice hurt  anybody with a  games capy related question in the chat room before I pull the plug  is Paul Reed worth an ad with the Joan bleed up I mean if you need blocks you can hang on for another ball game sort of the same old story here  do I drop Keon Ellis for Kyle Lowry that I don't think is a games cap related question  you know Philly they go Tuesday Thursday Saturday Sunday Sacramento Tuesday Wednesday Thursday no Tuesday Thursday Friday Sunday now I don't think I'm making that swap I think I'd rather have key on Ellis  some people saying thank you you're welcome  do you prefer Duncan Robinson over Max strus yeah I think I do I think I do  if vasilia Mitch's does not play who do you prefer in a points League Trey man scoot Henderson or Jalen Suggs I go scoot in a points League Just Close Your Eyes do the returns of IQ and Barrett turn a Linux into a streamer no no I don't think they impact him almost at all because frankly he'd rather  he'd rather only take six to nine shots of ballgame which I mean he did it in eight shots in this and yesterday's he'd rather be a facilitator so I don't actually care that much who's around Olynyk as long as he's out there and frankly he might even be better throwing the ball to better players  Dan why don't you care about Trend and Watford um  mostly because the Nets haven't really fully shut her down yet  once they do I may change my tune on that one I sort of reserve the right to he had 15 and 8 a couple of assists to stealing a block seven out of 10 shooting you know unsustainable shooting numbers there  I would love it if the Nets sat  Dorian Finney Smith  the rest of the way or if mikal Bridges finally decided that he didn't want his games played streak to continue that's really the problem is that you got an Iron Man and maybe he starts playing just the first half and maybe that's the way it goes but it's just that there isn't enough there every single game if he's not shooting it's you know 70% or whatever it is previous gaming at 11 5 and 4 with two steals that was good 24 minutes isn't enough though 29 if that actually happened every ball game I think I'd probably do something about it but he's on a serious heater he's shot 70% in three of his last four ball games  and we just know that first of all guys don't shoot that in the NBA watford's not a bad field goal percent guy but also he's hit some threes which is not really his Mo he's shooting 40% from downtown and he has what six threes over those fall four ball games as well so there's a lot of stuff with him that's sort of over it in over his skis in this limited sample size but if the minute stick at some point somebody gets shut down or whatever and he starts playing 2029 and of low to mid-20s then I would probably think about it so you know put him on the watch list if you like that's fine  what are my thoughts on markelle fultz I don't want anything to do with him he's not gonna play back to backs and he's not doing very much even when he does play  Bagley or Brook Lopez I'm gonna go broke both teams have four game weeks and if we're Sean Holmes shows up then this one becomes a very easy decision and that is where we'll put a pin in it until our streaming show in about two to two and a half hours from now that allow some more news to trickle in because it certainly has been even while we've been on air that's the way of the league right now you know since we've been doing this show we got like nine injury updates one of them being the big one that Joel embiid is not playing tomorrow  so please everybody take a second if you're new find a way to subscribe it makes a massive difference in what we do here at sports eat those so what I'm able to do  so on and so forth and someone just popped in with a question about Barrett and quickly on Gary Trent Jr wheel back baby roll the tape back we talked about that one earlier in the show not trying to call you out but we did that one already have a great midday I'll see you guys in a couple of hours thanks for tuning in to all of our shows these days again this is the last week where we're going to a days next week we'll go to one show per day except maybe for Monday and then the offseason we will once again return to Monday through Friday only  because Dan will need a little bit of a respite and yes working every single weekday on a pod that's a break from me hugs and kisses I'll see you guys in a bit
