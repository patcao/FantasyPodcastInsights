welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast good morning I got this figured out where we're getting there at least let me make that let me guess smaller for a second so you guys can see my ugly mug this is fantasy NBA today it's Friday not our usual Friday though normally we have a weekend review episode today today we will not be doing a week in review because  how many games were there over the last week well  yesterday pretty much so  can't do that but we can do a massive Thursday recap we had the Utah Jazz leaning even harder into it tank mode we had  all sorts of stuff Kyle Lowry making a debut oh I know your eyes light up when you hear a mention of big booty Kyle  in any case welcome to the show I'm Dan Bass Pros you can find me over on social at Dan best burst d a and b e s b r i s this is a sports ethos.com presentation I hope some of you guys checked out some of those new tools we've been talking about on the show and I will mention them at some point in the middle of today's episode but considering you guys had to watch me go get water why don't we just dive into the action a lot to cover from yesterday my voice is tired this is a really interesting week for me because  I'm doing six games of play-by-play this week I'm three out of six done  so the voice is tired  the spirit is willing  this is cool man this is the most  this is the most played by play I've done I think since I had a kid so seven years  really testing the pipes out this week  anyway let's dive in Detroit lost at Indiana this ball game was a blowout for a while Piston's made it I don't know marginally competitive down the stretch no big takeaways from this one Simona fonte oh still seeing plenty of minutes but just I think we've seen enough now to know that the fantasy profile doesn't really support a nine cat roster ship  if you wanted to try to wring out like a very low end points League type of activity there that's more of a maybe but also probably still a no that's our Thompson another quality game two steals three blocks seven boards five assists really nice well-rounded attack he did miss a bunch of free throws but you kind of just wear that because the rest of it was super nice so hold on to Thompson and go ahead and move on from fontecchio we're gonna try to buy the way make this one a little bit of a lightning round kind of show I don't want to spend you know an hour going through yesterday's box scores I also as we move over to the Indiana side wanna let you guys know I'm gonna try to get a show out on Sunday which would be more of kind of like your weekend review type show because that would have Thursday Friday and Saturday games on it possibly early Sunday activity and then  I guess that kind of replaces the the reverse chronological lightning round I guess I got to think this thing through it Indiana side no massive surprise is there but it didn't matter in is these Bots starter for Aaron nice Smith and you don't want anything to do with math and I know he had six boards and five assists in this ball game but he's more trouble than he's worth so just roll with the usual names which would be siakam Halliburton Myles Turner and then when niece Smith comes back you can play him as well Brooklyn changed coaches got the same result which was looking really really bad  like real bad  Nick Collison was okay Cam Thomas was okay Mikhail Bridges was okay and that's gonna have to be all right because everybody else was dog do Ben Simmons was awful  I mean I've told you guys how many times have I said on this podcast now I don't want anything to do with Ben Simmons I think it's gonna be a bigger headache than he's worth  I say it again  I don't want anything to do with Ben Simmons I think he's gonna be a  bigger headache that he's worth  well we also learned this ball game first of all Dennis Schroder did have some foul trouble but it doesn't seem like when the team is healthy which they basically were in this ball game that there's gonna be enough there for Schroeder so go ahead and move on from Dennis cam Johnson is the one for me that remains still kind of undecided I'm out on the other Fringe guys cam Johnson I'm waiting to see what his job is going to be in this Kevin Ollie says system we played 21 minutes this was the second game back from an injury it was another blowout but he did come off the bench and you know a handful of like just played 35 minutes in this game you know 28 point loss so it's not like all the starters played 23 minutes I just I don't know that there's enough I think we're in log Jam territory now so if you can and I can hold on to cam Johnson for one more week  it's possible that his role just is going to be diminished  shame of it too is that he was starting to play really well prior to his injury and now coaching change and we just don't know is he gonna be one of all these guys  who will Who will be  no there's a chance that things pivot hard here and that you know someone like a Dennis Smith Jr plays his way into a bigger role or he said Dorian Finney Smith yeah he had some foul issues as well but only 15 minutes like you can't play all of that on fouls could Lonnie Walker see an increase  I think there's enough up in the air with Brooklyn where we have to at least keep a close eye on sort of who are the fourth fifth sixth guys on this team  and then if somebody emerges and I just spilled water on my keyboard and I don't want to press any buttons because that could ruin the broadcast if somebody emerges for Brooklyn let's just be ready to pounce on him  and it might not be the Super obvious thing either because you never really know what a new coach is gonna gravitate to usually after they get smoked in their season debut yikes Toronto side again just keep shuffling along here Emmanuel quickly Gary Scotty Barnes and  Jakob Pirtle  are kind of your generally safer plays and even quickly like quickly had a big nice ball game here but by and large he's gonna be a much better points League guy than nine cat he'll be startable at 9 cap but you know you saw over the last two or three weeks he was outside the top one 40 and a lot of it is just like is he gonna do enough peripheral stuff and have okay enough percentages  question marks on this team Gary Trent Jr who had 25 points but nine of 12 shooting in the ball game but then again you know 25 points five three-pointers that's good but one board two assists in 31 and a half minutes is not  he had one steal he is going to sit right on the borderline and so every day we're going to look at these Toronto games and go man maybe we should hold Gary Trend and then the next one's gonna be like nah maybe we shouldn't hold Gary Trent  that's a class of players and I don't know what the best terminology for that class of players actually is but it's going to be a guy like a Max Drew's a guy like a Gary Trent better sitting right on The Fringe  and I almost feel like we can just call them the doesn't matter  they are the doesn't matter guys meaning it doesn't matter if you play him or you don't play them they're not really gonna Advance your team forward and they're not really gonna set your team back  but if you're in a head-to-head League you want guys that are playing and if you're in a roto League sometimes you need to just use a game against a game's cap like you can't you'd be nice if you could play all top 85 guys all season long but that's just not feasible in a 12 team or unless you are in the absolute pastry of the league you know you draft all superstars but in general if you're in a relatively competitive even even intermediate 12 team or you're at some point against the game's cap probably get a place somebody who's like a top 125 kind of guy  and that's probably what those types are the guys that I'm going to now most affectionately referred to as the doesn't matter  they're the doesn't matter  and yes I know the grammar of that makes no sense but you kind of have to fall with me each guy is a doesn't matter together they are the doesn't matter  not that don't matter  because that's even more confusing  but and there's and there's always a handful of players like this where everyone is in my Twitter mentions and the YouTube comments like should I drop this guy and it's like you know what  you know the answer is  the name of the group of players  doesn't matter  if you play Gary Trent every day for the next three weeks  you'll get a couple of games where like oh that was smart of me and then you'll get a few games where you're like I wish I hadn't done that and at the end you're gonna look back and you go I don't know what that was  and then you're gonna stop and you're gonna say  doesn't matter  I am being forced to think with my brain and not with my heart on Kelly Olynyk who for the moment is not really seeing power forward minutes alongside Yakima portal if they are they are few and far between and yeah he can pile up fantasy stats in limited minutes but 18 is not enough it's gonna have to be in the low to mid-20s at the bare minimum 22 23 preferably more like 2425 and what I can continue to pray for but not see happening is a reasonable path for a Linux to get to 25 minutes in and in like this is a blowout and he still was stuck on 18  and you know I don't know if Pearl ends up missing a game here and there that's the way if fertile ends up taking off the last few weeks of the season that's another way we talked about this as possible stash guys on the show a couple days ago  Olynyk as a stash makes way more sense than Olynyk as a play right now  I wish she was a play right now but he's not  I had a bunch of people asking me about gradey dick no not until Toronto officially pulls the plug and they haven't yet because they're bad but they're not officially and really not all that close frankly to mathematically eliminated the Raptors four and a half games back of the Hawks for the last play in spots so you know mathematical elimination is still a pretty good ways off  Nick's beat up on the Sixers is another game that was a blow off for a while Philly was able to kind of wiggle their way back into it a bit and so  the score looked like a pretty wide Gap but the next had to play their main horses a bit down the stretch to kind of lock it up and so you got predictably decent games from Jalen Brunson Josh Hart Dante Stevenson precious Ochoa but there are a few little sort of what do you call unknowns with New York I know number one is Isaiah hardenstein who played 10 minutes here and obviously isn't healthy  what I don't know is that  you know are we gonna get an actual minute count for him in their next ball game because this was extraordinarily low he played 11 minutes  I threw him into a lot of Roto games Capt League because there wasn't a lot of reporting on whether or not he was going to be playing a regular compliment and as we saw he didn't even come close to that  so if you can you probably want to bend heart and Stein until he's back up into the 20s if you're on the head side you're just gonna have to hold and hope that this thing sorts itself out quickly  as far as boy and Bug zdanowicz the other player that I think will get some questions from this game he had 22 points in 23 minutes but you should be looking more at the minutes than the points because typically he's not going to hit 63 pointers in 23 minutes he's probably not gonna get 13 shots in 23 minutes on days when he is not lava hot I mean the dude went a perfect six for six from down town in this contest he's almost never gonna get you three steals this was uh the outlier  this is the the trickery of a game so I don't think you need to add boy and bug donovick is fantasy profile requires him to be very heavily involved in a team's offense to actually hit his marks and it's just not going to be the case long term someone also asked me why I referred to di Vincenzo as some maybe a streamer honestly I just I don't know that even chenzo heart Chua bogdanovich Burke's I don't know any of those guys stays above the cut line when everybody's healthy on the Knicks but they're not right now so you know let's just sort of keep an open mind and and see which direction it flows  as far as Philly goes I'm not worried about Paul Reed 22 minutes here four fouls he just sort of got beat up by the Nicks he'll be fine he's been playing well he's been getting good minutes just sort of didn't in this one Kyle Lowry 25 minutes off the bench uh  not I don't know man dancing this supposed to be back for this ball game tonight for the Sixers they play again here on Friday night I'm guessing his minutes are going to be in very tight check but someone's going to suffer and presumably they'll you'll see less Lowry you'll see a little bit less buddy hield a little bit less of maybe some of the bench guys who squeeze in some minutes at the end maybe a little less KJ Martin  we'll see it'll be more important or more relevant I guess I should should phrase it as it'll be more relevant as Melton gets ramped up into the high 20s in minutes and he's gonna be very useful once he gets there I just don't know if it's gonna take a week or two weeks or whatever but this is your moment by the way to pick up Melton and just know that it's gonna be a painfully slow ramp up that will likely have a pretty nice light at the end of that tunnel  so Maxie Harris healed ubra read are the guys that I feel pretty comfortable starting on this team melted once he gets revived back up over on the road oh side I'm not adding Kyle Lowry I'd have to see a whole lot more than this to say oh yeah this is a guy who's gonna get to play a ton  guy just I don't think that's to be the case  or Lando beat Cleveland 116109 without Markle faults in this one so Gary Harris and Jalen Suggs with the starting backcourt sag's left early with a head injury He's listed as questionable I believe for the next one but I don't care I wasn't adding him anyway Vagner exploded Off the Bench so once again he put a dent into whatever you thought you were going to get out of Wendell Carter Junior who I've been very vocal on this podcast that I'm not using in any format  we're basically one Orlando injury away from Cole Anthony becoming somewhat interesting but 19 minutes ain't enough and Gary Harris know  Jonathan Isaac we're sort of still watching from the periphery to see if he can consistently get 20 minutes and the answer at least for now remains no  and the magic basically have one nine cattle guy and that's France Wagner  Franz is the only nine cat guy you can play nightly on this team on Carol's a points League darling and then everybody else is just sort of cannibalizing each other because they got whatever is like nine dudes all vine for three positions minutes  wop  over on the Cavaliers side every time I try to quit Maxi drags me back in this is a nice ball game for Max 184 and 6 a steal a block at a three-pointer  in the doesn't matter category  because again you can play them it's fine like he's number one 13 technical lead on a per game basis that's a startled dude  he's at 41 and a half percent shooting from the field and if that gets up near 42 or 43 then he's inside the top 100 everybody's like oh this is the guy that you needed to start and I listen I'd be fine with that I've been I've played a lot of Max Drews this season and I'll continue to play him in League's where I need to make sure I don't fall back against the game's cap and on head to head side he's been just sort of quietly useful all year and that's the true story and as I warned you all Charis Levert is very much a dropper roux  Phoenix was without Bradley Beal who I think they expect to have back pretty soon based on the kind of reading between the lines on the reporting in the meantime Grayson Allen obviously still a hole the only took three shots in this game which is a little annoying but he's been good all year Eric Gordon is more your fill in here as is Royce O'Neill  I prefer Royce's Fantasy game because it's a little more well-rounded Eric Gordon has been hot enough to be playable but you guys know when the field goal percent dries up it turns from fun to very sour milk real fast  for that reason I basically haven't been adding Eric Gordon because I just know it's coming  I didn't have Roi Soleil either because I don't I'm not super confident that he gets enough minutes every ball game  so right now for Phoenix the only what you call I guess like fringy type of player that I'm starting is Grayson Allen because he's been good all season long  Dallas in my eyes is the more interesting side here and not for good reasons either because Derek Lively got the start but only played 16 minutes for only played 17 minutes and Maxi kleber played 26 so now you've got a three-headed monster going at Center and that is disconcerting  I am very much holding Gafford because we know he can pile up fantasy stats and it only takes about 23 24 minutes to do so  I am probably moving on from Lively he needs in the 20s as well but is sealing isn't as high like if Gafford gets 20 then he's like a top 75 kind of guy and you know he got 26 minutes early this year so he was a third rounder Lively in like without Gafford around was only in that one 100 range so this was going to make his life more complicated no matter how you slice it and that pushed him outside the likely useful bubble  but again like  you know if you have a roster spot I guess you could see because he is starting I still I prefer to hold Gap or I think you can punch on lively  and in the very near term  I'm probably still starting Gafford which I know is maybe a bit over aggressive but whatever and then you know you got Luca and Kyrie in their Trucking Along on a Mavs team that is winning bunch of ball games right now and have won seven in a row they've now created a little bit of separation uh from the teams that are a little bit farther back more towards the the play-in bubble not all of them the Mavs are hanging out with the sun's the in the Kings the pells and this little grouping but the Lakers in the Warriors are pretty firmly in that lower half of the play in and then you got a whole bunch of teams that are either trying to lose or accidentally losing a bunch and it just kind of feels like the western conference is separating into different strata right now  I mean maybe that doesn't hold there's still two months of the Season left but  anyway Boston beat Chicago in a blow out and there is nothing to take away from this game from a fantasy standpoint both teams got nice production out of all five starters how's that for an easy one to recap  we can move on Clippers and Thunder this game was closed for like two and a half quarters and then Oklahoma City just blitzed him so he didn't get great lines from the Clippers side you got okay stuff but nothing specials Zoo Paul George James Harden quite letter those the only Clippers you're starting  over on the Thunder side case in Wallace had four steals but you're not adding him there Lou Dort had his like one good shooting game every two weeks you're not adding there it's just she Jalen Williams and Chad Holmgren those are your three nine category playable guys on the Thunder as his basically been the case since day one of this season nothing changes there either I want to take a very very short mid-show respite to remind you guys

best brush remember is the Twitter handle so definitely go check those out maybe get yourself a fantasy pass maybe get yourself an all-sport fantasy pass because the baseball draft guy drops first thing next week very very exciting time as we transition into baseball Joe Oracle and his amazing team have a ranked list they've got projections they got Dynasty stuff so you got the minors that's gonna be Super Rad as well and I'll make sure to Crow about that a bunch on Monday  let us continue Houston blown out in New Orleans Freddy van Fleet came back he played 30 kind of rusty minutes in this ball game I'm in Thompson at 225 and 4 with three blocks Off the Bench if you predict him with Van Vleet coming back  you might want to have a little up oh moment let's just see what he does you know I get the feeling that you know some of this was because of the game they're going to try to get Thompson more minutes but is it going to be consistently this many  that's gonna come down to whether or not Jalen green can actually hold on to his roster spot now they probably prefer a little bit more spacing which is green over Thompson but I mean I'm gonna just legitimately good and so sometimes you kind of just have to play the guy who's good  and Jalen green sorry not that good  so we shall see I would say hold on let's see how the next couple games go for Thompson if his minutes in more competitive games are lower than you could probably move on at that point but at least give him a game or two to see how that drops herb Jones is on a severe heater right now remember how the beginning of the season was rolling and he was a third rounder for like a month well that's happening again so make sure that herb is on your roster you had a seven steal game yesterday  that's a weak swinging kind of night for good old herb  Zion was Point design on here we'll see if if he plays in the in the Pelicans next ball game here coming out one thing and Brandon Ingram by the way sat this one out with an illness so that meant that Trey Murphy got to start all so and that's a good thing for him he had three Steals and three blocks Pelicans had 16 Steeles and six blocks in this game that's that  part of that is a Houston and then some of that is we know that  there's been some controversy over the years with pelley's home scorekeepers either way it doesn't matter Trey Murphy is a start when he's starting  herb Jones is a start right now because he is blitzing and so just basically play it on that theme  Charlotte won again they are absolutely destroying their chances to get a pick in the bottom four by winning four games in a row  they're 14 and 41 now what are you doing you dummies you're only a game behind the Trailblazers who are actively trying to lose harder than you  don't do it Charlotte don't ruin all your hard work of being awful all season long by being okay for a week  fantasy wise great Williamson six more three-pointers  he didn't do anything else  so  I can continue to call into question the odds of Grant Williams actually being playable the rest of the season because it's some point he's going to cool off or he's going to stop taking 15 16 shots a game and then all these you know four or five six three-pointer performance is with very little else is going to be an oh but in the meantime like I've said I've tried to soften my stance a bit on playing guys who are hot even if I don't expect it to continue and Grant Williams is in that we've called them the stream well warm guys on the show and there's quite a lot of players in that group and Grant Williams right now is a stream well warm  and warm doesn't necessarily mean that heating every shot he takes it just means that he's like super aggressive and in a way that I don't think is going to last all season long but as long as it's going do it and then hell maybe it'll last for two three more weeks or I don't know what a best case scenario even more than that and then you didn't miss out on the heater and then Trey man is the other guy that everybody's asking about 136 and 4 nice little well-rounded game was if fishing again that's gonna be the big thing for Trey man can he remain efficient  I still believe like keyonte George on the other side of this Ledger I still believe that Trey man and George are going to be better in points League than nine cat and so when they have nice ball games or a nice week or whatever it is that's an opportunity to try to go get a player who's ranked similarly to them over those two weeks or whatever it is  like I think both of these guys man maybe a little bit of a better shot than George but I like I don't think either one of these guys is gonna be better than top 90 and 9 cat  if you're punting for man it'll probably be field goal percentage for George actually probably the same thing maybe turnovers all so on the keonte side  if you're punting certain things then obviously they fit the build a little bit better but if you're just looking at it from a strict nine category perspective they're going to be overvalued based on Counting stats those are great guys to try to move if you're leak hasn't had its trade deadline yet because people are going to be like oh what could this be  and the unknown creates  sort of value bubbles  that expand it's almost like on in draft season where someone's like oh I like this guy and then another person sees that analysts say and they go oh I like that guy now and everybody tries to keep playing LeapFrog to draft them suit her and sooner and sooner and this type of stuff happens with a player like Trey Manor a player like Aunt Jorge who steps into a bigger role  and we have an idea of what their stats is going to translate to but until we all see it  there's that maybe it could be this kind of sensation  so could you go out and get a top 70 guy for Trey man right now I don't know  probably not maybe  30% chance 25% chance I would do it  same doors same deal for keyonte George people like all these guys are gonna be League winners because in their minds they get this thought of it's like  is this guy gonna average like 17 8 and 7 know that's gonna be the better games they look at keyonte George like always getting average 20 points and nine assists  no  And even if he does might be you know on six eighteen eighteen shooting a bunch of knights these things do matter  but I also worry that when I go on a rant like that then people were like oh Dan doesn't like these guys know  that's a misinterpretation of what I'm trying to accomplish here what I'm trying to accomplish is  if someone has a value bubble and inflated evaluation based on some good games and some unknown we should jump on that  now if you're just like you know what I'd rather just play these guys and hope that they roll at a top 80 90 clip or slightly better or whatever it is that's fine not gonna chastise you for it I just when I see an opportunity to slip in and squeeze some value out I'm gonna probably call you guys to it meanwhile poor Walker Kessler got benched again  that young fella just cannot catch a break right now Taylor Hendricks got the start for the Jazz they're taking a look at their young guy at 12 and 9 which was  decent  26 minutes um  I don't think you have to race out and pick him up I call them a speculative add in my tweetstorm last night that's pretty much where I still sit on Hendricks if you have a dead weight roster spot which many of us do right now then flip that spot for Hendricks see all the next week goes we don't know exactly how his stats says gonna translate seems like a pretty good rebounder seems like the field goal percent could be okay will we get some steals maybe we don't really know yet  he also made all of his two pointers in this game and one for five from three point land so how does that balance out  either way safe to say the Jazz have started Hammer blasting the tank button they're going to the young guys in a lot of spots with I guess basically the exception like a John Collins who had 18 rebounds so keep rolling with these guys hold Walker Kessler I don't think that he's stuck on 17 minutes the rest of the way let's see how that develops Denver blew out the Wizards the the actual story in this blog and there was Washington side they finally benched Jordan Poole and he took 17 terrible shots Off the Bench  like I you know I think Jordan Poole could actually be a points league play in this like come in from the bench and just shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot until your arm falls off roll  he remains awful in nine category leaks thank the good God we didn't draft that dude  he got the start and was awful  he is not a nine category fantasy player okay how many of you yell at me about it I'm not changing my opinion on it because so far he hasn't actually done it  meanwhile another double meanwhile Kyle kuzma without Jordan Poole in the starting five is like oh is it all me now yes Kyle it is all you he took 25 shots when for 31 13 and 3 with 63 pointers missed a bunch of free throws and the percentages are going to tank him but Kyle kuzma could prior to a shut down here go on a points League Run for the ages that I mean maybe there's going to be so much usage on The Nine Cats side that he can overcome the problems either way looks like he's a winner hold on to Marvin Bagley a little bit longer minutes were lower in this ball game I mean the Wizards just had no answer for Nicole to yokich Bagley was not going to be it so they mixed and matched and nothing really worked but hold on there and he actually did enough even in limited minutes in this ballgame and then the guy that I love to see take a big step forward we Corey kispert who got 25 bench minutes  if that gets up to 27 or 28 I'm probably then gonna add Corey but 25 is not quite enough put him on your sort of hyper watch list especially if kuzma takes a game off or really anybody in the front Court takes a game off because then Chris slide in and get more consistent run  Katie's Goldwell Pope came back from one injury suffered another one on related but you know there's his like two months injury stretch from Hell continues no I'm not picking up Christian Braun he had a double-double in 23 minutes but it could be brown and it could be Watson it could be Reggie Jackson it could be Justin holiday it could be Zeke nnaji there's no  clear winner for kcp going down but other little note on this ball game Nicole yokich were the 2119 and 15 triple double he becomes the third player in NBA history to have a triple double against every team he's ever played against and the only team he doesn't have one against of course is his own team the Denver Nuggets which is where he sits one triple double behind LeBron James and Russell Westbrook because they got moved traded free agent whatever and then went back and tripled against the team they started on  what else we got we're getting towards the end of it Lakers hung in there for about 20 two minutes and then the Warrior's mostly Steph Curry Blitz the Lakers to final couple minutes of the second quarter never looked back Steph had six three-pointers he's been dominant since Draymond Green came back  as far as the Lakers go I don't think you have anything you really need to look at here LeBron sat this game out so you know you got a little extra rui hachimura he was barely startable more D'Angelo Russell more Austin Reeves more Anthony Davis those guys all get a bump when LeBron is out a little surprised that Spencer Dinwiddie only played 18 minutes in this ball game he was also a plus six it is 18 minutes so kind of surprising although I think with the game may be a bit out of hand coach ham was just like you know what let's just try to save whatever we can for tomorrow which is now today or the Lakers have a must win against the Spurs you just can't afford to crap yourself against the teams you're supposed to be and I mean that's one of the teams this evening so let's spend our time in this game on the warrior side Brandon pajam ski continue to start for Klay Thompson he had 10 and 9 in 27 28 minutes which is good enough to hold on pods Jonathan gets cool off considerably he's no longer a cell High he's a hold until you get another cell opportunity  draymond's a whole Wiggins is a whole he's been much better over the last month or so and then step of course has been rocket boosting back up the board after his cool spell step is number 13 and he's basically one more big ball game from moving back into the first round on a per game basis  but what to do what to do what to do with Klay Thompson who had three points for boards and five assists in 28 minutes nine shots but just went one for nine he had a monster first game Off the Bench you have to hold  it's still clay and he still gonna play a bunch of minutes  what I do want to know is what happens to the Warriors rotations when Chris Paul comes back because apparently they're expecting back within the next 10 days or so they said that they're hoping he plays on their upcoming four game Road Trip which starts four days from today  so where does he slot in you know CP3 you know there will be a ramp up period obviously um but  who where was minutes come from clay pods  it's gonna have to be one of those guys it can't all come from these other sort of weirdos  and Gary Payton wasn't even in this ball game but Lester can yonis only played 14  Moses Moody played 19 I mean we gonna go hyper small like yes  but it does feel like clay or pods is gonna lose out there and we'll wait and find out  King's weathered the victor one banana Mega storm when be one assist away from a five-by-five ah love those five five when minyama firmly number 11 in nine category leagues right now wow what an amazing year he's had I thought for sure that the percentages would hurt more than they have he's begun to figure it out in record time uh Spurs at some point are going to be pretty darn good they're not pretty darn good yet Devin wassil had a big one here he and and Wendy have kind of been the only truly safe Spurs Trey Jones is cool to bit but I think he remains a hold  Jeremy Sohan was better you try to move him anytime he has a better ball game and I think everybody's pretty much giving up on Kelvin Johnson by now right  I know he had a better ball game here but I can give that the big old who cares  Kevin herder this was his sort of Last Stand I said look Kevin if you can't give me 30 minutes in this ball game I am now officially moving on and of course he immediately played 30 minutes she's like sorry Dan sorry I didn't hit 30 for like two three ball games there but I'm back  hurt her is a 30-minute kluber  we don't have as many of those anymore you used to be that young and Marvin Williams and this went on and on now you basically have Kevin heard her  when you start a fringe guys where if they get 30 they're in and if they don't they're out  Malik monk continues to ride his hot wave right now you can stream while warm it's the best way to describe that one I still feel more comfortable and head-to-head than roadeo but  you probably play them in both while he's this hot her definitely you could go in both while he's this warm and the Kings took everything but you know they got through it  and that's yesterday's card  that was anticlimactic ending to that recap uh questions on some of the news of the day yes you guys are all correct to bring those up in the chat room we're gonna get to the news here before we wrap things up on today's podcast and again hoping to get a show going over the weekend that kind of Recaps a few days worth of games things that you can make more of the kind of rest of season stuff Clint capela is set to return for the Hawks but on Yucca okongwu is out I believe the line was for the foreseeable future with his Towing injury so that's sucks if you're battling for a playoff spot when guys are out indefinitely you know what you need to do and it's terrible to say it but oh Kong Loop probably a guy that you don't have to stick to if you're battling for playoff position in the headset or hell even if your playoffs are starting capella set to have a minutes limit on his return so look for something in that kind of like 24 range but once he gets up to full speed if Hong Kong was still out it could be sort of a I can't believe I'm going to say this but it could be capella time  LeBron likely to play for the Lakers tonight that's the latest report from the Lakers that came out late last night and then we also got a bunch of injury news in the mid-afternoon yesterday uh largely related to the Memphis Grizzlies Marcus Smart is out at least another three weeks and then we'll be re-evaluated at that point so three weeks from yesterday would be March 14th meaning even if the Rio evaluation is like yay you're ready to go  you're still gonna be you'd figure at least a week-long ramped up so March 21st in my eyes would be the absolute earliest you'd see Marcus Smart and in all likelihood his reevaluation is probably gonna say oh yeah he's gonna take another few days whatever it is and then start the ramp up so you're probably if anything looking at like the last week of March maybe the first week of April and then what's the point maybe get him in for a couple of minutes and a couple of ball games I moved on from Marcus Smart a long time ago because he was barely a top 100 player even when he was playing this year I think you can pretty safely move on from him now they're just there aren't many reasons why I would think you'd need to hold on in a playoff format if you're in a roto side and and you can just squat on him then fine it doesn't really hurt you to do anything but you know the latest I had had playoffs could start would be March 25th  and that's all so probably about the earliest you could possibly see him  and the story is somewhat similar with Desmond Bane all the difference between the two guys by the way Bane it's not a real evaluation he is on track to play within the next three to five weeks which you know that's not exactly great news either but again three weeks goes to March 14th if he plays at that point then you got him in to get sort of revved up for a week and some odd before your fantasy playoffs start  so I think if you can squat on Desmond Bane I probably would do so if it's ruining your team to do it and yeah you got no choice but to move on you know like you know your team better than I do which is kind of the advice the best advice I can give in a scenario like this you know what your team can handle  I have a fantasy team with Desmond Bane in one IL spot and right now if anybody else gets hurt I'm gonna have to make a tough call who do I think is gonna come back first probably the other guy  depending on who it is and what happens I guess but  he's right on the razor's Edge  but even if Bane only comes back and plays 20 minutes on that Grizzlies team he would just go nuts for 20  so in my eyes you probably hang on you won't get him in back to backs it's going to be a pain but like  what if he comes back and rolls top 50 in 22 23 minutes a game and plays three out of four games in a week or something like that it's probably then better than whatever weirdo you could stream in that spot  so if your leg goes to the end of the regular season  you probably hang on to Bain if your league does not go on to the end of the regular season you probably have a pretty easy call on dumping both of these guys  hope that clears that up to the best of my ability it clears that up definitely go check and find out when your playoffs start uh I've lost track of what week is which here some of the chat room was like what about week 20 I don't remember what week 20 I think this is 18 so 1920 yeah I mean if your playoffs start that would be March 4th I think then this week 20 there's almost no hope of seeing either of those guys until the finals at the absolute earliest and almost definitely not at all  so if your playoffs don't start  the very end basically if you League doesn't go to the very end then you move on from both of those Grizzlies if you're League does go to the very end you probably hang on to beIN a little bit longer I still think you could probably call it on Market smart  and I think that was the big stuff from yesterday we I'm sure we'll get a whole bunch of news breaking today over the next little bit oh Alexa poker chefski got waived by the Thunder  remember when he was supposed to be like  the next Chris stops for Singas plus passing  yeah  it's tough when you weigh 118 pounds and you're seven feet tall you're just it's not gonna work  just kept looking at him like what is this dude gonna put on enough weight to actually compete in the NBA and it never quite happened wow de sorry Poco  your time has come although here's the thing what if he what if the Grizzlies pick him up  you know what if he ends up on a tank team  one man's trash is another man's gold  if Alexei poker chefski ends up on an awful team playing 29 minutes at night be ready  fantasy wise this is the absolute best news that could have come for pocu getting released I know doesn't sound like it makes any sense but this is 100% the best news that could have happened to Alexa play poker chefski keep one eye on him in case he ends up on a crapper team I mean in all likelihood he'll probably end up on somebody's G league roster but ya never know I mean what if the Blazers pick him up and shut everybody down well the Wizards pick him up and shut everybody down and someone just like poker go out there do whatever the hell you want for 29 minutes we want to see  we want to see is music to fantasy players ears  because I want to see  or  he you know rides off into the sunset  if he ends up on a team that's actually trying we can also ignore him  this is a we desperately hope he ends up on a team that's in full tank mode otherwise fat  away with you  big on  all right now we're done no show tomorrow my kid has his first Little League game of the spring session and then I've got two basketball play-by-play games immediately after in the afternoon so this is not gonna be time for me to do a game at all my voice is going to be shot to crap by the way if you guys want to hear more Dan I will be calling the USC baseball game this evening I think that's it six or six thirty Pacific time I gotta check my phone calendar I don't know where it's going to be broadcast but if you can't get enough Dan then that would be a way to hear me talk to myself for three and a half hours yes it's a lot I know again no show tomorrow hoping to get a show to you guys on Sunday obviously we'll definitely have one first thing next week and the following week even frankly towards the end of next week we're going to start talking about the long stream registered trademark Advanced Sports ethos.com fantasy NBA today the long stream will be coming up about a week from today we'll start to break down how to handle that if your Playoffs begin the following week drives everybody nuts that I do them all together so it's possible I might just do like a quick hitter you know five to ten minute episode daily on playoff long streaming  I don't know I haven't decided how I want to do it yet  seems like a lot of work though to set up a whole other show to do that when I could just jam it into the end of the regular one  but  you know we could put an advertisement at the beginning of the 10-minute quick hitter so  I want to line my pockets with four and a half dollars you know I do I can almost get a six inch sub for that money remember when you could get lunch for like four and a half bucks  those were the days it was going to go now  2000 and 222  all right everybody have a lovely Friday enjoy the pretty large car keep chugging let's get some more wins wherever we can and I will likely talk to you guys on this pod on Sunday in the meantime come find me over on Twitter at Dan best Bruce will do our duty business over there so yeah
