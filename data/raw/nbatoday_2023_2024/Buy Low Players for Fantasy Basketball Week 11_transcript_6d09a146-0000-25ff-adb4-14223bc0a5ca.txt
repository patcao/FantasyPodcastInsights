yeah I know everything's all out of order this week and I don't care  it's actually a lie I do care  it's been a complicated week in the best person's household  but  we persevere  the hacking cracks are howling something like that welcome to the Buy Low show for week 11 be it  Friday we try to do this one on Tuesdays so that the name actually matches the content of the show the nice thing about a Bi-Lo show is that  it doesn't have to be on a Tuesday it could be any day it just makes it harder to name that's a Dan problem though that's not a you problem so just take this one for what it is it's by low show for Stuff happening on January the 5th  as opposed to what would have been I guess January 2nd  and then you have four three two that's how counting backwards works  but the information is still accurate it'll still be good for X number of hours or days after I bring it to you you never know how long until I buy low player starts to kick it back into high gear  so sometimes you have to act fast sometimes you can linger a little think through your propositions in your legs but either way  we'll do a little bit of a recap what's been going on on our Bi-Lo shows I thought that was a nice addition three or four or five weeks ago whenever we started adding in the Hey Howard this stuff gone from the last couple weeks  and then I got a few new names some riskier than others some more predictable you might be able to see through a few of it gee I wonder what Dan what player Dan put in the thumbnail for today's episode  mmm that's a  that's a noodle scratcher  I think that was a Ned Flanders Asm  well as brain Benders go that's a noodle scratcher  I'm at Dan best for over on Twitter at d a n b e s b r i s this is fantasy NBA Today is sports ethos presentation  got a pretty cool announcement coming up on the Pod side that will probably break out that announcement early next week  it will not change the way that you consume the content it's actually just kind of a cool thing for us solidifying our growth in the Pod space in the industry space kind of a validation as it were for all of our hard work but excited I'm excited about that again changes nothing for any of you so I don't even know why I brought it up other than to say  should be cool so thank you to everybody that's watched that's listen that's like that's right it's it's subscribed us followed that's gone to the Discord all that stuff every one of those little things over the years adds up to these  steps that show takes forward  let's dive into the goodies if I can remember how to do it wait a minute there it is I got it don't worry  Tada Bilo week 11 here we go  I don't even know why I have this slide up by the way you know guys you don't have to do to make the slide work and streamyard I have to  all table my way through Windows to turn slides and and I know that there's a simpler way if I was using Obi Studio obs  I could just like flip a thing while still going but with this one that's why I keep looking down  look at me on air  let's do some updates here to get this party started last by low update  or latest if I could read my own writing oh Gianna be was on the Bilo board a number of times and he's been traded since the last time we looked this one over what does that mean for OG well it means he's on a team that's going to give him big minutes but he was on a team that gave him big minutes before his job doesn't change all that much between Toronto and New York he's still behind basically two players in the offensive pecking order  he still gonna be asked to do a lot on defense he's gonna ask be asked a bunch of corner threes to be efficient  so it doesn't really change our position on him he's number 91 now I think we had him as a Bi-Lo when he was in the 90s he dropped outside of the top 100 he's back into the 90s now he's bouncing all around he hasn't really solidified himself in any particular way so yeah I don't move off of my position  although I will comment that I think it's probably going to be more difficult to buy low on it and Obby  after the trade just because his name is in the lights right now hey he got traded he was the prize he was the guy I know a manual quickly go on the other way from fantasy purposes the one that gets the biggest jump but OG was the biggest name player involved in that trade so that's gonna be a tougher time to go pry him loose from somebody else still he was on our board so we got a track him DeMar DeRozan has been steadily climbing the board this was a very easy one to see coming mostly because it's free throw number was down his field goal number was down he was ranked number like 65 while shooting 44% from the field and 80% at the free throw line and that just always wasn't going to stick and people like oh my God he's actually watched this time it's like now he's fine even when guys slow they don't typically forget how to shoot free throws unless there's like some kind of Yips thing going on which didn't appear to be the case with DeRozan so it was all just a matter of time till he went on a free throw shooting heater  and he's on a free throw shooting heater now everything is moving back in the direction from whence it came his free throws up to 84 which still could go higher I know career he's 84 but three previous Seasons to this one he was at 87 twice and 88 so it could actually get higher than that field goal percentage is at 46 last couple years he's been at 50 50 409 503 going backwards so that actually could still climb higher  I'm inclined to believe it will and everything else is basically where it needs to be for him to move back into that 30 something rank board  right now he's at 47 so he's up about 20 slots from when we had him on the Bi-Lo list and I would call that one a pretty nice win so far  Jaylin Williams was one of the other ones on the list that wasn't really moving as fast as we were hoping he was sitting in that 90 range he seemed like a really easy Bilo candidate because he wasn't getting any Steals and that was going to be one of his calling cards last week he had a five Steel game hopefully you were able to buy low before that happened because now he's number 64 folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of beer Wine and Spirits then get

armchair  download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's d r i z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  and it's not just from one game he's been playing better for the last couple of weeks in fact it's probably worth looking up actually how is Jalen Williams been doing the last two weeks he's number 31 shooting 63% over that stretch yes obviously not a sustainable field goal percent but that's been a nice one and then Walker Kessler who you know as minutes are all over the map but he's blocking like three shots in 25 minutes a game right now he's top 30 over the last two weeks still only playing 25 minutes a game over that stretch believe it or not there's still room for improvement but he's been on the rise as well the one guy that has not really made any Headway of any kind is Cam Johnson  and it does buckle the mind a little bit I'll admit boggles the mind but at the same time look he's number 81 over the last two weeks hasn't been bad for him by any stretch but it's been bad for the Nets  somehow cam Johnson's been one of the few Nets to not get swallowed up in the crap going on out there because they've been really bad  you'll hear from Michael Bridges because he was on last week's show and he's going to be a repeat name on this one  but everybody's just getting it handed to them  except somehow Johnson who again hasn't been good but has been fine and when the sky is falling you kind of take fine  he's under this very little parasol sky's falling on everything all around him and he's like if I stand perfectly still under this very tiny umbrella I'll be all right  so yeah you could probably still Buy Low on Johnson I think you could buy low on almost everybody on the Nets right now and I might consider  doing that  a little bit more on the updates we had Bradley Beal as kind of the risky place or one of the risky plays  is that last week or two weeks ago he's back now  18 points three boards for assists a steal in a block since coming back those numbers probably well the scoring the rebounds the assist that probably Trends upward a little bit  I'm looking for Bill to be more in the 60 to 80 range this year  I just don't really think there's enough for him to do to climb above that area  but that was what when we didn't have a time table he made sense as a by low and then once you got a timetable it was kind of hard to do but I think that was one that probably worked out and then Jimmy Butler who I'm going to talk about again on today's show he was a name we threw out there last week before he got rehear hurt so believe it or not I mean you do believe it because you've heard me doing these shows before you know that means that something that I'm probably gonna triple down on it  but let's talk about the name the the man whose face Graces the thumbnail today and that's Karl Anthony towns and he's kind of the biggest non-risk buy-low name on the board this week because cat is down to number  4344 depending on what website you're looking at on the season and nine cat over the last month he's Number 96 over the last two weeks he's outside the top 200  and the big reason on cat having such a painfully low rank over these last two weeks  is that he's completely forgotten how to get a defensive stat  totally forgotten it  on the season you know those numbers are going to be lower because he's the power forward for that team he's not the center anymore when guys play center they get more blocks it's just simple as that as the power forward the last two years his blocks have gone down from one point one one point two one point six he had now they're 0.6 and 0.5 the last two seasons  steals are pretty much in line with what he had before no massive surprise there at about point eight per game uh but that block drop off with something that we always kind of knew was coming along with the fact that he wasn't going to be getting 11 rebounds a game when Rudy gobert's around  so who is the real car lightning towns  is he the guy we saw for the first month and a half for six weeks of the Season he was hovering around that 25 range  or is he the guy we've seen for the last four weeks that's been closer to the edge of the top 100  I guess the third choice then is is he the guy we've seen in aggregate  the biggest thing that jumps out to me  and you know some of it is some a couple of lower scoring games mixed in that's not stuff that I'm super concerned about he's still Karl Anthony towns he's still very good on offense he's gonna have some lower scoring games Minnie two three games lumps happened to everybody the thing that jumps out to me is that cat has not had a single defensive stats steel or blocks in December 21st  that's more than two weeks ago yes he sat out one game in Sacramento he's played in the other five he has not had one single defensive stat in those five games  and as bad as he may become playing Power Forward zeroes is a bit of an overcorrection I think the cat that we're seeing in aggregate is probably not all that far off from the Karl Anthony towns that you get over the course of the season  the nice thing about this slump for him  is that because he's been so bad the last two weeks in particular and really fairly pedestrian over the last month  is that you can get him for cheaper than he was drafted basically  he was drafted around 30 he wasn't a guy I was targeting there I was like look this is a relatively safe play like  he's probably not gonna be all that far behind that and he's not all that far behind that but he wasn't a guy I thought had a whole lot of room to beat his numbers as long as Rudy gobert was healthy and he was playing power forward and so far that's all kind of played itself out  you could probably get towns for someone ranked right around towns right now that 45 range maybe even a couple slots deeper if you're you know looking at some big name guys  from a someone who's rostering it was just getting frustrated with the numbers he's putting up  who are some names in that range that might get it done do I think DeMar DeRozan would be enough probably not by himself but it's worth trying bam adebayo is down to number 51 I don't know that anybody noticed it it's largely because he's his free-throw number has come back down to earth blocks have all so kind of come back down I've been Bam's having a good season and again if you're punting one or two categories he's been actually pretty outstanding but you know classic big man doesn't shoot the three ball at all free throws are met um great rebounding numbers he's scoring well so again like I think bam maybe giving up potentially too much if you're on the head side but Rodeo  yeah cat has a long track record of being a more well-rounded Rodeo player then bam out of bio  other names in that range that might be enough to get it done  I don't know that I would go Jalen Brunson but you could consider it  Anthony Simons if he has a big game of his scores like 305 and it's 63 pointers that's worth trying  out Prince been on a vicious run with some guys out for Houston he's moved up from 60 to 40 free throws of actually been a little bit better for him as well that might be an interesting one you know I kind of liked that one I think I kind of like the shingling one because he's been crazy hot lately  so someone's gonna treat him as like a top 25 guy when you know at some point the free throw is going to come back down and guys are gonna return and he's not gonna be like a 30 10 and 7 every game  and cats gonna come out of this little Funk and right now well one of them has been Lava Hot and the other ones been ice cold they've just barely pulled into sort of like a dead heat with each other but his cat warms back up and Shen who by the way again it's been very good all year but just kind of comes back to Earth and Falls might be back towards that 50 range you might be able to get like a 15 to 20 slot separation between the two that right now is two slots they're both right in that same area  I don't think Miles Bridges was getting done I don't think that I would sell on Jimmy Butler he's more of a by name and we'll talk about him in a moment  I don't think you're going to get enough for Evan Mobley guys like Gafford hero Jalen Johnson those guys are not don't have enough name power to get it done Myles Turner might get it done if you're willing to part with some blocks and I don't think I would go much higher than that  and then if you're looking down the board I don't think anybody has the name recognition to get it done maybe John Morant but we know is always going to be better in real life than in nine cat fantasy because low defensive stats percentage is generally hurt turnovers are super high but again if you're punting certain things then that kind of changes the calculation a little bit that's a feelings on Karl Anthony towns I want to go back to the well on Jimmy Butler with the next name on our board he's currently ranked number 48 which is basically where he was the last time we talked about it and instead of being able to say oh you know over the last two weeks he's like number 70 something over the last week and a half two weeks he's been hurt  and that's actually the word that I put on YouTube for folks that are listening after the fact or listening you're always listening after the fact if you're not watching I should say you don't get to see it but I just wrote the word of hurt right on the slide recently he's been hurt  he went back to Miami to get treatment on his foot and there's panic in the air which basically is the moment you know that you can buy low on somebody  because for Butler  again and like we've seen with his with the number of guys right now  some dudes just haven't gotten as many defensive stats this year as expected  he said a few games mixed in where you know he's left part way and and maybe you could argue that's clouded things a little bit but the butler that we know  hasn't really existed yet this year it and I don't think it's fair to say that he's a dramatically changed basketball players rebounds are down from 6 to 5 which I you know you could potentially blame that on just having a more well-rounded team around him a sister down from five and change to four and a half which again I think they've run more through bam they've run more through hero when he's been their turnovers are also relatively low  but the issue for Jimmy is not that there's been a big use of change sure you could point to the field goal percent being at 46 and of 4849 last year was it 54 which is probably not a repeatable number  the issue is that his steals which throughout his entire career he's been basically like a two steals per 36 minute kind of guy and this year he's at like 1.1 per 36  Miami hasn't changed things substantially in the way they're acting on defense he just hasn't gotten that many this year  and I'm inclined to believe that he will and on top of that everybody's super annoyed and everybody has a very good reason to be with the fact that he just hasn't been playing ball game played last real game he played was on December 18th  played 23 minutes in Utah on December 30th and immediately got rehearsed  which is like the Bradley Beal story nothing is more frustrating than waiting for a guy to come back for two weeks he comes back and he can't even finish the first ball game before going back down for at least one more week and Counting  and by all accounts it may just end up being like a month long absence for Jimmy Butler but you guys know  the stash rule which is for anybody that's inside the top 50 you got to be willing to wake wait as many as five or six weeks  meaning that whoever's got him right now  feels like he's been out longer than he has  I'm not trying to downplay the fact that he's been hurt because he's burned me I have Jimmy Butler in a few spots he was drafted near 30 I figured that was a pretty easy one as long as he didn't miss like 30 ball games and this last stretch does make you a little bit nervous on that front  but he's not on Pace to miss that many  and you know you can calculate it at the end of a month long injury and say oh he's on Facebook but yes but then he's going to play in a few games in a row one would assume and that's kind of what you have to go into this thinking someone I forget who was in my mentions or might have been in the YouTube comments that talked about the fact that  they I think someone's like they'd give them Jimmy Butler for  I forget who it was somebody that was like a bona fide 65 range kind of guy like a Devon vessel  or  or like Mike Conley plus someone else in that same area and I was like I get it you're frustrated and Jimmy Butler's been not good so far this year he's been fine but he hasn't been good  but you got to take Jimmy Butler because  even if you look back at two years ago not last year where he had the insane field goal percent season if you go two seasons back when he shot 40% which is still a number he could very easily get back to he was number 15  do I think he's gonna get to 15 this year nah probably not he's been  the low steals number has probably gone on long enough that getting it cranked all the way up to 1.6 to 2 might feel hard but getting Butler back to 25 is not going to be all that complicated and you can get him for someone right around where he's ranked right now that 50 range because people are pissed these hurt again so try tomorrow  try miles Bridges  try  Nick Claxton try Jared Allen  if Mark Williams was healthy try Clint capela try Vu she's back  people are gonna be wanting to get rid of Jimmy Butler right now and be willing to accept him with open arms graciously  because if eventually he's gonna be back and he's gonna go on a little run at some point  and even if he comes back in just keeps doing what he's doing that's still ends up as a prophet  and I got another repeat on today's show and that's mikal Bridges who's going down and I oh I messed up a number don't pay attention to the numbers on your screen you tubers that that she is wrong I duplicated this slide and then I changed the wrong one he's lower than that now he's ranked outside the top one hundred which is just insane to think he's number one oh one because there's been no defensive stats the field goal percent is low the free throw hasn't helped as much as it was expected he would he's scoring only 20 and a half points per game the expectation was that that would be a lot higher Brooklyn is the issue here the Nets are a disaster  I don't actually know what I think it would take to get Bridges again don't pay attention to the slide right now folks these numbers are wrong so I'm going to go to the next one before I even start talking about lamelo ball McHale Bridges ranked outside the top 100 he's been horrible for like the last five or six weeks in a row after a pretty reasonable and normal start  much like the way I feel about the Lakers right now something's about to pop in Brooklyn I don't know what it's gonna be coaching change rotation chain role change a Ben Simmons re-emergence I don't think that's coming  but at some point bridge is going to wake up  because right now they're at that like they're not playing Angry they're playing annoyed and that's bad for everybody but at some point somebody's gonna get pissed they're gonna start playing angry and then guys are gonna start waking up in some capacity whether it's just to go firing up shots or getting hot or whatever it is  and right now you could probably get mikal bridges for somebody in the 75 range with some name power like Zach lavine's coming back right now try it why the hell not Yusuf nurkic at 75 might get you Mikhail Bridges it's crazy to think but it's actually true  uh  who else we got in that range um vessel  Keegan Murray  in France Wagner wasn't hurt I had to throw his name in the mix  click capella if you're willing to give up a big man Staten Island Brown  who's all so way down the board mostly because his free throw percent that would probably get it done  I don't know that I see anybody else that would get it done by the cells  but they're a lot of names in there that people feel really strongly about because they're scoring and they'll see a rank that's higher and that might be enough to pull it through and finally  the last name on our board but before we tell you about that I want to quickly remind everybody to

month  we've heard nothing about a timetable  the Hornets are garbage  and yet  I think we see him back in the next two to three weeks at the longest possibly sooner  because the way the Hornets do things is that one day a guy's just out and the next day it's like always been upgraded from out to probable  of what  and it's gonna happen with ball I don't know when exactly but I do know that he had an ankle tweak and he has a history of ankle tweaks  but  they never really upgraded it from anything beyond the sort of original mess  he's been out since November 26th when he suffered the injury in Orlando so it's been about five weeks or so since then a little bit more than that actually  and the most time anybody ever really misses with ankle thing that isn't like a tear  is eight  so if you're at five and a half weeks right now basically you kind of feel like the longest this disgusting mess could go on is another two to two and a half weeks but the fact that there hasn't been any new news on him  in like eight to ten days right now  is number one  obscene  but number two  to our benefit  and this is one of those ones where you kind of have to move on it really fast because I could sign off on this show and  the News could break that he's coming back in like an hour  I don't think that's gonna happen but it could because that's the way the Hornets operate  the nice thing about lamelo ball right now all so is that first of all he's number 31 in nine cat before going down he was actually cooking pretty good after kind of a slow start to the year really really really really really really really really really big numbers in a lot of categories  obviously very bad internals not gonna help you and feel goal percent but positive and almost everything else  he's a Bonafide second rounder if you're punting one of the two things he's bad in which had to headers probably there's like a 50/50 shot you're punting one of those two things feel goal or turn over and you're hunting both he's borderline first round but even in Roto he's an opportunity right now  because I don't think you have to pay equal dollar he's number 31 Whoever has him is probably sick and tired of this nonsense  so try throwing out a name like Alfred sengun who's been super hot lately who else has been hot in that range uh Demar bam out of Bio demon is a bonuses have these 20 rebound games  but he can't shoot free throws this year I don't know why but that's the way this season's gone those guys might not be enough by themselves  if you think Desmond banking is going to fall off  with John Morant back that's a possibility Freddie Van Fleet is worked his way up into the early 30s  might get it done  Jalen Johnson plus someone else would probably get it done Jaylen Brunson might get it done  none of these guys really have the ability of a lamelo ball to be in that top 15 to top 20 discussion  and again the big reason why balls not there is because of one key weak category which isn't really the case for  like Jalen Brunson is a good example of that he's been great so far this year but the reason he's not in the top 15 isn't because he's kind of a punt guy in any one thing it's because he's pretty good in a lot of stuff but he's not like he's not really really good in any one thing he's not really really bad in anything else the way that lamelo ball is very very good in points and threes and assists and Steals and free throw and he's very bad in turnovers and pretty damn bad and field goal percent  and that's frankly a little bit of an easier player to build around for a lot of fantasy formats  so I think it's worth a try call me nuts call me a Riverboat gambler but if your team is an okay shape  if you're not like fighting for the sixth seed I think lamelo ball is a reasonable Buy Low Target and I think you could get him for a hot hot big name dude ranked between 35 and 50 and I don't know how long that works before they announce him coming back  and that  friends is your show  I am at Dan Bass Pro on social media I certainly hope to see you guys over there if everything goes according to plan today I'll be able to put together a nice weekend
