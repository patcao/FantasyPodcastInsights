welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast happening everybody it's Thursday  tired tired man I'm Baseline tired  shout out to Robin Mark for this sweet shirt by the way I'm tired I'm tired man  people always ask me you know I'm one of those annoying guys you guys probably could have figured this out about me at this point I want one of those annoying dudes when people say hey man how is it going  I don't just respond with good how are you  I respond with I you know a little tired  so and so happened kids got this  life's got that we're all doing the best we can and the people were like why did I ask this stupid son of a you know what how was going  I got way more than I bargained for  but look here's the thing and it's not just because this is not a development over like the last six years seven years could seven now seven years since I had kids and was cooped up at home and only talked to Children this is my entire life I discuss things way too much with servers at restaurants I talk to people walking their dogs I'm that annoying guy so big frickin surprised that I'm a guy who ends up having a podcast where I like to yell at people all day every day  not a big surprise I have exactly 44 minutes from right this moment before I have a phone call that I have to get on it is with the preschool director for my younger son so that cannot wait meaning we have exactly 44 minutes to get through the key stuff from Wednesday's card and I thought this thing through and I think the best way to do it is just sort of the usual fare which is go through the card and we'll try to move fast on things where we can move fast I don't know why I made that big yet and we'll slow down where we need to slow down  so  cheers let's get this party started I am Dan bastards this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos.com presentation you can find me on social at Danbury d a n b e s b r i s please do follow over there if you've been joining anything we've done over here trade deadline show Regular pods the MLB stuff baseball stuff that Joe's got coming out he's got some really cool shows that are having some big traction especially on YouTube please do hit a like And subscribe button do it do it now do it now and if you don't well I don't know what you're doing here  the Charlotte Hornets traded away all the stuff and now they can't be stopped they're on a Furious 3 game winning streak they're now 13 and 41  and they're chasing down the Portland Trail Blazers  for the 5th  no yeah fifth worst record in the NBA  I don't know what it means really I mean all these teams at the bottom want to make sure they stay at the bottom so the Hornets are gonna have to pull the plug on some of their useful players here shortly  but they've also done it without lamelo ball and I started with that because so look the Atlanta side is like not a whole lot of stuff the other Hunter has been showing  he's made some nice steps in the right direction  you guys have listened to this show a bunch of times you know my take there is I'm I think he eventually displaces saddiq Bey in the starting five I don't know this to be true but I think it to be true at which point babe becomes a drop baby kind of hanging on as it is anyway but I also kind of wanted either Murray or booked out of it or Bay or somebody to get moved to the deadline from this Hawks team that would have allowed Hunter to have a larger role so if it feels like a lot of these guys are going to end up kind of like right on the borderline and then the other note on the Atlanta side is that Bruno Fernando is filling in its Center because Clint capela and onyeka okongwu are both out right now so yeah I don't think you need to do a whole lot with with that obviously if Fernando gets  another start on what I suppose is now the other side of the All-Star break it landed Us in play today they don't play until the 23rd then you could look at it but I'd be a little surprised if one of those dudes wasn't back Hornets on the other hand I do think we want to stop and talk about because one of the players that everybody is asking about right now is Trey man  who had a monster of a ball game yesterday 21 points eight boards six assists two steals four three-pointers  on and this is the sort of big news of the day seven out of 13 shooting in three for three at the free throw line with only one turnover  those of you that are listening to this show know that I said Trey man was an immediate points League add right after the trade went down that was sort of never in question and I said you know what I don't know that I'm fully on board with the train Man 9 category  freight train right now  and my reasons for that were one  a big uptick in usage usually negatively impacts percentages which for Trey were already a problem  and yeah man I guess that was it that's sort of the one main thing and I guess number two was that was that the percentages were already a problem  right now with Charlotte he's shooting 46% from the field and he's made all three of his free throws which all happened yesterday he's also shooting 46% from 3-point land on two out of about four and some odd threes per ball game  he's also a 1.3 steals which you know that could potentially hold 2.3 turnovers is probably a sustainable number and then the giant rebounds all so feel a little bit outlier  so what I would say to you guys is this is the opportune moment and look  I have no problem with folks adding him in nine cat  but I would also suggest if you're leagues trade deadline hasn't passed yet this is a decent time to see what you could get for Trey man because  it is three games with the Hornets so far  he's above his career Mark by a lot in field goal percent he's above his career Mark and free throws by some amount he only like he took two I think in Oklahoma City this year and he made them he hasn't missed a free throw this season oddly enough he's way out over his skis and rebounding which for a young guy yeah I mean this is a thing that's happening because  well the team is not very good but also because his energy level is extraordinarily high right now  all so he had a nine assist game Blended in there with a seven so his sister at 7.3 I look at these numbers for man and if you're just like it so yes obviously his role is very different in Charlotte that it wasn't in Oklahoma City right now so we can't say that there's this like exact extrapolation of his permitted production one place to his permitted production in the other but the only thing is right now that are sort of on Pace on the permit side our points which is kind of what you thought he would get to in this sort of like 11 to 15 range somewhere in 30 minutes of ballgame steals is closed a little bit on the high side and three pointers three pointers two three-pointers a game is very sustainable for him that's a number that I don't think gets too wiped out because like if you look at what he's done so far really right on Pace for about two three pointers and 30 minutes  the things that are over the perimeter Mark and again want to make sure you guys heard the preface that  his role is different so some of this stuff is more sustainable than others but way out over his skis and feel goal percent and you can say Danny shot 50% in Oklahoma City this year yeah I mean  how many shots did he actually take  we got to look at a larger body of work which you know first two seasons in the ambition NBA he shot exactly 39.3% in both of them  do we think that there was a  basically seven percentage Point jump coming this year  on a larger amount of usage I mean anything's possible but unlikely  do we think the field goal percent went from 79778 somewhere in that neck of the woods up to 100 on likely  do we think the fact that he was on Pace during his forget early this season Oklahoma City because he didn't really play but if you want to take that one you could a guy who had throughout his young and be a career been on Pace for about four and a half to five rebounds per 30 minutes maybe even a tiny bit less suddenly jump to seven  unlikely  assist is one of the ones where I think you can sort of squint at it and say I mean yeah like he was only on Pace for about three to three and a half assists in his role in Oklahoma City that's a number that could go up because he's the point guard now instead of not the point guard but is it likely to double  I still think that's kind of an unsustainable number so we're seeing some stuff from man especially right after a big ball game this is the other Beauty part of it  on a sell high on a small sample size you definitely want to do it after a big one so that people can be like look guys  here's what's happening so far the question is and I can put a poll out on social media I have no idea what you could get back for him right now it might be a lot it might be a little I just don't know  if you want to hold and see how it goes that's fine because in this week in Charlotte he's sort of in that 60 to 70 range in production  but again he's like way out over his skis in a bunch of stuff  boards assists probably steals field goal percent free throw percent like that's a lot of stuff that we think could come back towards Earth a little bit so I got the question of why do I think he's a guaranteed win in points leagues and why am I not fully convinced the Nyan Cat That's those are the reasons  does that mean he's going to be like outside the top 150 and 9 cat no  not at all I think he falls somewhere in between where he is right now and like 150 range and maybe that's 100 which it's still be a playable guy and if you're hunting field goal percent then he gets a bump up and if you're punting probably free throw percent I'm guessing as this levels off that probably is a little bump not quite as significant  so yeah I mean okay but I have to do this podcast as if people are playing all nine categories  and I can  try to add all these little qualifiers to it but how much good is that going to do yet anyway that's why I stand where I am on that one Grant Williams is still kind of a maybe in my book he's all so way out over his skis for this team the the small ball Center minutes are good because that's gonna help his rebounding all so this particular ball game playing a team that missed a crap ton of shots helped his rebounding  I just can't take the plunge on Grant Williams we know what his Fantasy game is and we know that it's limited the next are down a few bodies that won't stop Tom Thibodeau from playing precious to chew a 43 minutes precious is a start Bronson is a start heart is a start I know it wasn't as good in this one Deuce McBride no Burke's no Jericho Sims 39 minutes and still somehow I know hopefully I say a heart and Steins back for for their next ball game  and then boy and bogdanovich was out for this one is  what did I call him a temp hold he's a temp hold until someone else shows bad like Dante even chenzo being out  Boyd image probably would have had fantasy value in this game had he been healthy enough to play in it but again like we're talking about  four how long it all seems very short lived they'll play again in Philadelphia on the other side of the All Star breaking and I don't know who's gonna be back but my guess is that I'm not going to be super interested in boyan  over on the Oreo side window Carter Jr left this game early but he's already sounds like he's okay so you know whatever like I was already super down on him he's a points League only kind of guy and none nothing changes there Jonathan Isaac actually got 14 and a half minutes on the second half of a back-to-back which I guess is a good sign as they very slowly bring him along I'll say the same thing again not an added head-to-head I've stashed him on my roto bench in a few spots where I'm not falling too far behind the games cap and I just want to see like how many minutes to Jonathan Isaac get the next time the Orlando Magic don't have a back-to-back  which by the way is in Cleveland right out of the All-Star break and then they have another back-to-back again  but I mean look if John and Isaac starts playing 24 minutes ballgame  we're gonna want to be there  Miami got a nice streamer game out of Duncan Robinson that one we kind of was coming hey would Heisman was and I met as each all so had pretty good streamer games off the bench  with everybody out for this game this team right now Dunkin' Robinson is the safe one I said Kevin Love would be sort of a long shot for Big Man stats and then he stunk  oh well  I guess could maybe get back around to Value he'd be my second choice behind Duncan Robinson if we wanted to  to take that path Miami only has one game from now until the following Monday not a good stream team for head to head if you wanted to try to get one more game out of Duncan Robinson that would be next Friday in New Orleans that's about as far as you go there how about buddy hield right now though holy smokes so the Sixers are pretty easy to handicap at the moment they'll likely get the Android DeAnthony excuse me Melton back on the other side of the All-Star break but he'll be brought along kind of slowly so I don't think there's a big impact coming immediately  Tobias Harris playing will impact all these other guys but buddy yields been  frankly ridiculous since the trade to Philadelphia he's a second rounder in his handful of games with his new team  and he's doing it on a lot of unsustainable stuff he shooting what like 503 502 percent on the other side of this deal or on on this trade  this is this is juicy  but it's also a bit of a cell high again I don't  exactly know what you're gonna be able to get back on him I think people know that there's a cell High element there but they might just be like well Joel embed is out for a really long time but at the same time like here's the thing but he'll does a starter does have top 50 appeal so I don't think that I would sell him for someone lower than like 6065 and I doubt you could get that for him right now so your best move might just be to ride it see how it goes and then you know hope you get a whole bunch out of him  I would by the way also stash the Anthony Melton if at all possible  the Bulls went big lineup in this one so you're holding IO soon I know it's game wasn't as good here but we got word even before the ball game started that they were gonna start on Andre Drummond and vooch side by side to deal with the Jared Allen Evan Mobley Cavs front court and you know it had its it had its moments Drummond was a plus eight in a game they lost by three so you know that part worked  but it's again it's not going to be an everyday thing you kind of have to look at the Chicago schedule see where this type of thing might get deployed they've got Boston not a gigantic team on the other side Pelicans are kind of big so maybe Detroit no Cleveland again so that you might get it what the hell is that that's like February 28th  when's the next time they play a super big team after that it's a while ah poof it might be just be there oh they got Minnesota on March 31st so  you know the drumming to start thing is  if he how many times you want to try to squeeze a game out probably not worth holding all the way through but you know if we can spot play it that's pretty good  for Cleveland I think we can officially like I think we had already done that but Carousel vert droppable Max Drew's in that same general idea every time I call him a drop ends up having a good ball game the next time around stress is gonna sit right on that borderline the rest of the way so there really isn't a right or wrong call on it if you play him every day it'll be fine it won't be exciting if you drop him you probably won't feel like you're missing all that much let's keep going here because again I'm on a timer today  I got 28 minutes in Indiana lost Aaron neesmith to a  there's an e been they they originally thought knee that it was shin and they think it was on a missed dunk attempt  Myles Turner was out and Jalen Smith was out so there was an Isaiah Jackson Mega sighting in this ball game and that was cool now if that happens again obviously we know what to do it also meant that there was more once niece Smith went down for Doug McDermott for Andrew Hart for Obi topping I'm not taking the plunge on any of those three guys I am however holding on Denise Smith because he's been very good and I'm hoping we see him on the other side of the break  sadness takes over Dan's brain here as Kelly Olynyk leaves after seven minutes in this Indy Toronto game  I mean look we didn't know for sure if he was gonna have fantasy value anyway so  like I can't in good conscience tell you guys that you have to hang on through injury to Olynyk  the advantage of course is that you've got the All-Star break so if he's back on the other side of it they actually have a back-to-back the first two days after the break so I had to head that would make a lot of sense Rodeo maybe we get some more information on him  but again back injuries are weird I don't know how long he's going to be out I do still want to see what his job is going to be with this team we don't know and he put a giant numbers in limited minutes in his first two games before this injury  meantime y'all Capo gets sort of unfettered run at the center position that's good for him Gary Trent was  playable I you know I thought he was a drop after the last one I might readjust Trent to kind of a we still need a little bit more information to make the final call there Bruce Brown I feel much more comfortable saying is a safe drop RJ Barrett is a cell guy anytime he has a bigger line quickly  he'll be fine but yeah I mean What a Sad thing we lost our Kelly Olynyk not that again I I didn't think there is a guarantee that he was going to be a monster I just kind of wanted to see what was gonna happen here and so that plan gets derailed  Boston got blown out by 50 or shoot me Boston blew up Brooklyn by 50 just throw everything out on the Brooklyn side Dennis Schroder got the start but he only played 18 minutes so I know everybody wants to make a move after a game like this but just don't  so hold them cam Johnson came back on a minute's cap he played 18 minutes he's a whole  yeah just a bad ball game and then Christopher sing us left this game early but it was all so out of hand and it sounds like he'll probably be fine for Boston when they come back and that will be in Chicago on the 22nd  Houston lost to the zombie Grizzly's its kind of the zombie Rock it's a little bit most of their guys I guess I'm in Thompson is a great filling for Freddy Vande lead Dillon Brooks I know it hurts any shot horribly in this game but he's also a solid filling for Freddie Van Vliet you got two guys that jumped over the cut line with Freddy going down  and that's the story in Houston right now from Memphis the story is extremely confusing uh they're in this sort of like everybody gets 24 mode other than Vince Williams who played 34 minutes even JJJ what Ellie had foul trouble but normally he's in the 30s even he only had 28 minutes in this ball game  My Hope of course was at Santi aldama could get a consistent 30 he played 22 22 is not going to be enough for him if you'd like to hold a little bit longer I'm okay with that but he is trending down in my mind because honestly I thought the job was just gonna sort of be safely his here and seems like the Grizzlies are more interested in just sort of giving everybody a little bit of run  to that end it makes almost anybody else on this team hard to roster outside of the guys that are gonna get 30 minutes every night which right now seems like it's just Jaron Jackson Jr and Vince Williams Junior  GG Jackson had a big ball game but he's more of a points League guy because of a very old souls in his nine cat game Lamar Stevens had a solid 20 minutes but you can't go that route John conchar same story but only 20 minutes Zaria Williams 22 minutes Derek freaking Rose 16 Jordan Goodwin who they just picked up off the scrap Heap 24 minutes  keep an eye on Goodwin keep an eye on aldama keep an eye on Kenard who played 29 and a half minutes and he was a play yesterday but might get the back-to-back off his minutes at all been fluctuating a lot and it doesn't seem like his body can pretty consistently handle 30 minutes  and it's possible that while we were hoping the Grizzlies would be sort of a silly season gold mine they might just be silly season chaos  we don't have to pick up a guy on a team just because they're in silly season mode we don't have to do it  and that may end up being what happens here with the grids  so just watch it all they've got another game tonight and it'll be rotations of whoever again  any of 43 and 15 I mean we knew the fact once we saw Daniel Gafford gone and obvious start to log some sentiment it's we knew things were better but boy I don't think any of us thought it was gonna be this level of better  it's a cell moment obviously when after a guy puts up a giant line like this but overall I just like trying to feel what the what the world feels about him not the world the fantasy world I don't think people believe this is sustainable and it isn't which means it would be hard to sell High  like I don't Denny's been  putting up these gargantuan counting stats but he's been awful at the free-throw line and he's done almost nothing defensively during this stretch all so it seems insane but over the last two weeks he's not inside the top 100  he's closed over the last one week thanks to largely this ball game he is number 26 while shooting you know high volume 62% from the field this is like a Jonathan kaminga explosion we know it's not gonna last but you can't get a top 30 back for him  could you get like  I don't know top 75  Maybe  I think I would aim for that if I was gonna sell out yet a nice like super consistent top 75 kind of guy not like a flash in the pan but you know maybe you could get Drew holiday  I think people are probably frustrated with him you might be able to get him back  maybe you could get I don't know do you want my Conley he's a low turnovers dude so if you want the big explosion guys then maybe you stand Pat  if you're just going on Strictly ranks you probably end up with a small win there but you know for obviously it's going to be high turnovers there's probably gonna be some free throw percent issues  but again if you can cash in on a game like this you generally do it no kuzma all so worth noting in this one so even Jordan Poole bothered to get involved  Jordan Poole is a mess tyus Jones what do you have 30 assists in his last two ball games that's pretty neat Corey kispert is is pretty consistently a stream when one of the high usage guys is out right now so that worked and Marvin Bagley doubled in 30 minutes so he's a hold so badly is a hold kiss is a spot play Joan's is a play pool is a and then Avia is a play obviously but can you get something for him  Trey Murphy had a nice ball game he's been starting to come on herb Jones slowed down a little bit I think you can play herb with Dyson Daniels out I'm not fully  sold on Trey Murphy being arrested season dude but again you Dyson Daniels throwing those 20 some odd minutes back into the bucket a lot of that has now gone to Jose Alvarado herb Jones and Trey Murphy like each of them can get four five six minutes a piece that ends up being enough for a guy like Trey who was sitting just outside of everyday play or herb Jones who's technically inside in everyday play but maybe needed a little bit more consistency  it's weird to think of a fringy rotation guy going down and bumping two rotation guys up but that's kind of what we've seen happen here for New Orleans  so short term yeah you can probably play both of those guys herb is the more trustworthy one because of the consistent defensive stats all got a really good schedule coming out of the break they played three games including a back-to-back next Thursday Friday  and that's where I said on those dudes  first got blown out  when but Yama did some fun stuff I got nothing on this birds for Dallas Derek Lively came back Maxi clebus at it out Daniel Bradford still got the start he had 10 and 10 with a block  gaffords the guy you like likely want their I would say hold both of them for the moment just to make sure  that's for lively we're talking about  and then Kyrie and Luke are the other guys here dealing with on Dallas so we can kind of zip pass that ball game Sacramento beat kind of a half-hearted nuggets effort good defense good defense Kevin herder trending down I had a better ball game here sort of across the board stuff but he needs 30 minutes we've said that I give him one more game he didn't get 30 minutes in the next one I probably move on Malik monk flip side of that he played 30 minutes buddy was really bad from the field and this was kind of what I was worried about using them on the Roto side head-to-head it's like okay whatever he had a bad ball game is previous few were pretty good I'm collecting stats but I I can't trust monk because defensive stats are not that high threes are not as high as they seem the field goal percent we always knew was gonna come off this this recent heater and the turnovers are pretty high he profiles better as kind of a punt head-to-head guy then he does a roto guy  funny thing is from a fantasy standpoint I actually kind of preferred it when her was getting 30 minutes and monk wasn't  because in 30 minutes with new Kevin Hart could be a nine cat dude in 30 minutes I don't know that monkey can be a nine cat guy we know he can be a points League dude  and so then yesterday you could almost argue you need either one of these guys was a super safe play  for Denver know Jamal Murray and no Casey p in this ball game you know we'll see if they play on the other side of the All-Star break if they do that and we don't have to worry about any of this and so you're not making a move until you know if they're back after the All-Star break if they're not back Reggie Jackson probably a filling level guy  and that's it  Phoenix in Detroit was a weird weird ball game because before the ball game even started  Isaiah Stewart punched Drew Eubanks in the hallways  the police got involved  so everybody was kind of on red alert for this game and Devin Booker oh he's John or something Kevin Durant said he was actually getting Booker was yelling at him but Devin got tossed it is what it is everything will be fine by the next ball game it's a specially crummy it's the worst thing for a game's cap when a guy starts plays like four minutes and then gets tossed or hurt because then you use the games cap on basically nothing ball game but it is what it is you just have to wins and move on  for Phoenix since we're talking about Booker all ready we'll come back to Detroit Royston Neil Eric Gordon both had an opportunity to do a bunch of stuff  but again here's the problem we don't know who's playing on the other side of the All Star break so for now you hold the studs you hold nerc I think we always kind in knew was gonna fall off a bit he's number 89 now still playable but it's been a slowing and Grayson Allen is also a hold but  Phoenix is another team that doesn't play again until next Thursday they have a back-to-back out of the break you know is Bill gonna be gone I mean we know Booker's gonna be back this is an ejection not an injury is Beale gonna be back we don't know  if he is the whole exploring Rose O'Neill Eric Gordon thing is feels like a lot of wasted effort so just keep them in the back of your mind we'll deal with this in a week basically  kicking the can down the road  LeBron sat out the back-to-back in altitude which seems fair for a dude who's almost my age I can barely barely get through a week where my wife is on an early rotation and they're saying LeBron here play this game then flight out to dude and play again he's like ah not guys I can't but the other Lakers stepped up Anthony Davis was in a behemoth dealer I'd 16 assists Austin Reeves had a big game and rui hachimura went absolutely Buck freakin' Wild just picking on the Utah front Court mainly  sort of this combination of you know it's kind of surprising like in my mind I was like man really got your more you must be just destroying some extraordinarily bad defensive player but he's mostly picking on like marketing and Colin's and then if they got switches then life got pretty easy for him but really a huge ball game he's a stream if LeBron has to miss another one because he's the guy that tends to get the sort of big big you should Spike along with Reeves and D-Low and add obviously but those guys are plays anyway  Spencer Dinwiddie 27 and a half minutes he's playing sort of like good teammate mode right now which is fine it's good for his efficiency but it's not gonna be enough fantasy stuff  it does feel like he's gonna get pretty consistently High minutes at least until someone like a Gabe Vincent or a Jarred Vanderbilt shows up I don't think Cameron reddish is going to put a huge dent into him he might  radish a little better defensively but didn't we so much better on offense that I don't really know how you make that switch if you're the Lakers idiotic but we've seen Dumber things in our life time's  so this is the you know remember for when LeBron is out there and you keep an eye on Dinwiddie just in case he's not a good nine cat dude but maybe there's a path to points League that's about as far as I'd go there can't a George got the start now he and Chris Dunn have flip-flopped keonte played 33 minutes and was efficient in them that's gonna be the big thing for him going forward can he maintain efficiency in this starting job so the good news here is significant I mean like it's it's very good news that George is starting the job being his means it's you know opportunity to try to grow and he should probably be added in most League's right now to kind of see how this thing develops  but all so don't get out in front of yourself don't don't like  put all your eggs in the oak ante Georgia just gonna be a nine cat Difference Maker down the stretch  he's going to be a points League start because again we talked about these guys with  young players and kante George's young player right is he was their first rounder out of what Baylor yeah Baylor this last season  but he's shooting 38 and a half percent from the field and just because he shot 56% last night and actually has been above 50% in like five or six of his last seven or eight games I believe that doesn't mean it's going to stick all that means is that he was lower than 309% before that and he's made to get himself back up into you know Freddie Van Fleet Kyle Lowry territory he doesn't get steals he doesn't get blocks he gets assists he gets threes  is it going to be enough  my personal guess  is that even if you give keyonte George 30 minutes he's still not gonna get inside the top 1009 cat so I don't think you need to go break the bank on him  if you're in a punt field goal format that puts some hell hole hell of a lot closer although again unless he starts racking up defensive stats  I still don't think that he's inside the top 1009 cat points yes  between George and Trey man you go trade man because it seems like his job is just slightly more secure although I guess the lamelo ball argument if he ever happens to show back up again  Jordan Clarkson he's in one of his very quiet runs so he can't do much with him there John Collins and Walker Kessler and Larry Martin we're just slowed and honestly Anthony Davis is just destroying people right now so don't read too much into what the Utah front Court got in this ball game  and finally and I still got 11 minutes on my watch now before I got a get the heck off the show the Clipper is came back beat the Warriors a crazy fourth quarter run Clippers I think one on a 17 to 2 I get that right 15 to 2 4th quarter run to turn a medium-sized deficit into a small advantage ah no big surprises on the Clipper side zubats played more in this ballgame because the matchup was just better he should probably be rostered Norman Powell had five three-pointers  not necessarily what you say filling in for Kawhi Leonard but from a scoring standpoint he filled in for Kauai  I'm not starting Powell he's like he's a fourth quarter monster but without an onsite I think he had three of his three in the fourth quarter in this game like if he doesn't do that this is a pretty crappy fantasy line  so I think I'd probably rather just  say yeah let go I get himself right no obvious pick up on that side for the Warriors Klay Thompson a very tough hold right now he's back in a funk and he's been kind of losing playing time not gonna say losing but  if he's not super hot he won't play quite as many minutes but hold him for now hold Andrew Wiggins hold Brandon pajam ski he was awesome and this ball game so you didn't really need me to tell you that Jonathan command gets come back to earth as we all kind of assumed he would hopefully you sold high and tried to get like a top 50 top 60 guy for him because the holes in his Fantasy game are slightly slowly here reappearing still a lot of fun for points the nine cat number is going to taper off after that crazy run but you know at least the Warriors have like a pretty reliable rotation these days and that makes our lives a bit simpler  let me do the thing where I make sure I didn't miss anybody I was trying to go really fast here and sometimes somebody brings up a name  in the chat room that I didn't talk about oh questions on trade Jones should I drop him for Trey man what should I do with Trey Jones I'm still holding Joan's I know he's been not as impressive the last handful of games but the nice thing about Trey Jones is that his game translates a little bit better than icats some of these other dudes he's right around one 50 Latino  hopefully the Steals and the assist tick back up a little bit the field goal percent ticks back up a little bit he always kind of profiled more as like a 100 range guy so  Trey Jones versus Trey man  that's so format dependent in my eyes if you're head to head and you're hunting field goal it's Trey man if your head to head and you're punting threes it's probably Trey Jones  if you're wrote on nine cat  probably Jones  uh  I honestly think they both probably deserve to be on rosters  in most formats because like with Trey man if he gets hot for a couple of games you could sell him there's always a reason to have a guy like that trade Jones you know similar thing like the higher floor  I don't know I don't think there's a you know one size fits all like my hats that I buy because I'm a dad I got dad hats I don't think there's a one size fits all answer that type of question  not at this time of year  this time of year is particularly difficult because you're like you're standing in a lot of ways  oh Danny was talking about points leaks oh yeah points so it's Trey man in points League's which I did say I think I popped that in there in the middle of the answer and I think that's probably it for today which is a shame because I'm seeing more more people are joining us live here right at the tail end of the show Friends I am on a strict clock today I got a big phone call coming up that's not that big but it's a it's an important one with my child's preschool director everything's fine just got to go over a few things but that means that we got to make sure we get off in time so on the way out I want to ask you guys again if you've been enjoying this stuff we've been doing please hit a like or subscribe button on something we want to keep growing everything we're working on over here come find me over on social at Dan best person go get yourself some sort of facial hair trimmer from my buddy over at manscaped.com  promo code there is ethos 20 eat those 20 over at manscape.com quick question on the way out Dan what should I do with Austin Reeves right now I think he's probably a hold I don't think people are gonna see the Giant game without LeBron and and think that it's anything more than a giant game without LeBron Reeves is going to be probably in that 80 to 110 range reliably because he's a high percentage is dude who doesn't typically get that many defensive stats so get you some points so get you some assists so get you some percentages and he's just gonna sort of coastal along as a playable 12 team her if someone will give you a top 80 guy for Austin Reeves you probably do it  but again like I don't know how much that really Nets you  and the guys that you be aiming for there probably don't really move the neat like you're not gonna I don't think you're gonna be able to get Pascal siakam and I don't know that you want her Jones it's very different  stat set  you probably Austin Reeves is probably really helping your team in percentages and that's probably one of the reasons that you have him rostered now if you badly need steals or something like that then yeah there are other guys around there that are ranked similarly that are much better at that category like  I don't know I just said herb Jones he would be one of them D Anthony Melton is he gets ramped like they're guys out there if you need to switch what you're targeting but right now basically anybody ranked between 75 and 110 you're pretty much just stat hunting like you can cluster guys now  there's a movement that I'm not fully on board with to say that like rankings as a whole or nonsense but understanding and this comes back to something I've talked about a lot and I really got to get off the show this is why I talk about ranking guys and buckets they are buckets of players not the top of the board like every two to three players is probably a bucket but as you get into like the 40s the bucket might be 10 players deep and as you get into the 70s the bucket might be 20 players deep  where they're all basically the same general idea for your team you just based on what stats they're providing  but look the 80th ranked guy is not the same as the 40th ranked guy it's just that the 40th ranked guy dudes on four or five spots on either side of him pretty close  to say oh this is the 40th is better than the 44th  but to say the 40th is better than the 65th yeah  yes we just it's understanding where the sort of  value curve flattens out for that how close are these players to one another  and in the farther you'd get down the board  the closer the players are bunched so the sword of  it's not a confidence interval it's just sort of like a window on either side of is this guy worth more or less than the other guy the answer is there the same is just a slightly wider pocket  but that made sense  one quick question on funky on the way we talked about him yesterday I think he has a chance to be a points League value based on what I'm seeing I don't think he's gonna be a nine cat guy and that'll wrap it up for today
