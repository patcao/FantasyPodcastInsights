welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right  so all-star weekend  wasn't the best  it wasn't the best  and  I you know I hate to be the grumpy old man  that's actually not true I love being the grumpy old man although on this particular thing you know I have this like I have two Dan's that live within me there are two wolves inside Dan  I am both  someone who likes to  present everything on this podcast in a positive like you guys know I don't like to do a lot of the like this thing sucks this thing sucks kind of I just not my it's not my persona  I know that that's  like that makes for better radio if I'm just constantly clowning on stuff but it's just not me  it's not me usually trying to see the positive in a lot of stuff as I bash my microphone stand into my mixer I'm trying to see the positive I try to make fantasy fun I try to simplify it so that we can all have fun together and  I don't want to say as far back as I can remember because as a little kid I didn't pay attention to all-star weekend I didn't I was a kid kids like how I don't remember what age I started to know the actual schedule of the teams I was following but it wasn't when I was a little kid it's probably like High School  oh this team plays on this day  I started fantasy sports my freshman year of college which is later than a lot of focus I get it  but that's all so 23 years ago now because you know an old man  and as far back as that so basically as far back as I can remember on on the  Collegiate side  the bit of hazy in there  I'll start weekend was kind of a holiday like a fun one not like a break holiday for me I loved it  my roommates and I would gather around our very large cathode ray tube television that thing at a big old butt on it you guys remember those TVs  and we had to you know two three of us needed to carry it into the apartment we pulled like 400 dollars together between four or five of us oh it was big deal man we went down to the local TV Mart I don't remember where we got it Circuit City probably Best Buy I don't want to existed in 2002 I guess that was at that point  we got a big old television we loaded it into our apartment we had a big ol  hand me down entertainment center that thing probably cost a grand total of $70 I don't remember where we got that joint Craigslist was just being a thing it's just coming around  we'd gather around  we would partake  it was college man I went to Cal what do you look at this look at oski on my hat what do you think I did during my college days and we would just get the night away  with NBA All-Star Weekend  we start right from the moment that those hilarious clowns on TNT would pop on our screens and his basically the same dudes now plus Shack minus Shack back then Shaq was playing  I was great we just laughed the whole night away Saturday in particular  even then we didn't give a crap about Sunday I'll start game was on in the background but we were doing on this stuff  we had a computer set up in the corner of the living room to the right of the entertainment center that we call Our Guest portal we're very nerdy  with cow what did you expect mess around on that  I had a roommate who was like you do  you know hi kid projects  when the All-Star game was on like in like finding it a projector on a second-hand Mart and bolting it into the roof of our apartment living room and then all so he went and he found  you know two very narrow four foot pieces of plywood I think it was and two very narrow 8 feet any fashioned screen out of it he got some white sheets at uh whatever the cheapest place was and you got a few of those even wrapped it around this thing so he created a projector screen that he hung through some I Loops both on the ceiling and the walls so that we could actually raise and lower it like a pulley system and it would sweep up so this is the kind of stuff to my roommates were doing during the All-Star Game well I was sitting there like well that's interesting if you guys congratulations on your achievement  all of this to say  I've been a massive fan of All Star Saturday I've worked a long time to get my wife to be interested in all star Saturday she's there's no way she's gonna pay attention to the games all season long it's too much she says why do you guys even watch the first 407 minutes these games and I say cuz it's freaking fun and then is you know some people only care about who wins that's fine I get it  but she likes the dunk contest she likes Three-Point Contest I work really hard to make that a thing and this year  this year for the first time since my sophomore year of undergrad again 2002  I didn't watch the whole thing live  I didn't watch the whole thing after the fact  I watched the highlights caught the end of the dunk contest live watched highlights of Three-Point Contest  that was basically it  and so it's weird to then go into a podcast where I'm gonna be talking about all star weekend without having watched the entirety of All Star weekend but that in and of itself is the point of this discussion  that I  act in best for us that's right my name is an at symbol at the front now  hosts of fantasy NBA today a sports ethos.com presentation this is by the way how I am introducing a show today that I  love her of all things basketball didn't care  there is no perfect solution to how you fixed this but I know now and for a long time I kept batting back on that that idea that it's completely broken it's broken  it's broken I am the easiest customer for NBA All-Star weekend and they couldn't even get me to care  I follow the NBA news  every second of every day and I didn't know the people in the Three-Point Contest  how's that possible  I follow every freaking tidbit of NBA news day after day after day and I didn't know who was in the Three-Point Contest  and I knew three of the four people in the dunk contest  you want to know who I knew was in it  Jaylen Brown  because they made a big stink about the fact that a player with actual name recognition was in the dunk contest  remember that keep that in the back of your Dome  because that's critical here  Stephen A Smith had a rant about how LeBron James ruined the dunk contest  and everybody's telling Stephen A that he's crazy  I have said that same thing not on this podcast but anybody that would listen to me since what year was that it was probably like 14 or 15 years ago now I don't know if anybody remembers this I don't even remember what team LeBron was on at this point mind you I'm a huge LeBron fan ever since Draymond kicked him in the balls  from that moment  Draymond kicked LeBron so hard in the nads that he stopped giving a bleep about anybody else  like real LeBron screw you all I'm done playing your stupid games I'm Gonna Be Me from that moment on I've Loved LeBron this happened before that  LeBron was Courtside some Dunk Contest I don't remember which freaking one it was how can I keep these years together and they interviewed him right in the middle of it on contest right smack like in between dunks when there's all that down time and they were like LeBron what do you think he's like this is great I'm having a grand old time blah blah blah I said if you things there were a lot of years there where every time they asked LeBron something he said how humbled he was by which is like dude I don't think you understand what this means yeah now he says it because he's breaking all-time records  that moment in that moment LeBron said maybe I'll do this thing next year  I wonder if there's anybody out there that remembers that moment as clearly as I do I think I was still in my college apartment when it happened so I think this was like as many as like 17 years ago  along the front of the enemy know maybe it's not maybe I wasn't in my college apartment anymore maybe I was in  it was in Visalia or something I don't think I was back in Bakersfield yet though so I don't think it was within the last  13 years  he said maybe I'll do this thing next year  you guys think he did it the next year  no  William in the chat room remembers this happening I remember this clear as a bell  clear is a bell  because it happened and I went oh  and then we all many of us that have us that remembered him saying it sat  baited breath for a calendar year  is this going to be the season  that LeBron brings the stars back to the dunk contest  no  and from that moment on there's almost been no hope  we had some really cool years with Nate Robinson against Dwight Howard  honest to goodness I couldn't tell you what year that was I don't remember I can I mean I can Google it right now when did Nate Robinson win the Dunk Contest uh 2006 nine and ten this is around that same general area those are fun  because you know Nate Robinson was what like five foot nine five ten something like that  he's dunking that's crazy by the way you know far away I am from being able to dunk  I do do is basically my height  and Dwight Howard had a couple of fun ones in there like when you put the sticker of his face on the backboard that was hilarious  but why did those work because you had actual Personalities in the dunk contest I'm Nate Robinson wasn't a superstar at the NBA but he was an extremely recognizable face  so you don't need like the highest paid players in the NBA to be in the dunk contest you need ones that people can associate with basketball  how many freaking people knew that Obi toppin had another at a brother in the NBA  Jacob toppin  I heard that and I thought oh is Obi wearing a funny Cliff Paul mask  I mean okay fine like yes I say that Jacob had existed but I know a lot of people were just like who Mac McClung  is actually a lot of fun  and you can make an argument that he belongs in these things because he can actually do dunks that other people can't  but like  Jaime jacquez Junior  we've talked about him 300 times on this podcast as Ooh can this guy have fill-in fantasy value when Jimmy Butler and Tyler hero are both hurt for the Miami Heat  that is not the profile of the player you want driving your Marquee event on All Star Saturday  I don't need the dunks to be perfect  I need the story to be compelling in any tiny fashion so shout out to you Jalen brown cow Brad gotta have my cow hat on for this one shout out to you Jalen Brown  for being an actual recognizable and NBA face that participated in the dunk contest and people are pissed that he made the finals of the dunk I mean like I don't care if he beat the other guys he needs to be in the finals of the dunk contest because otherwise no will have any idea what the hell they're looking at so how do you fix the dunk contest this is the easy one  get some dudes in that that anyone's heard of before  I've seen on Twitter people are like just turn it like the g-league dunk contest is better we don't actually care if the dunks are better we only care if we know who the people are I promise you  you could put four very famous people in the dunk contest and they can do one two three they could do six 12 I just tell 12 total dunks write 8 in the first round four in the second round I can do this math thank you do 12 dunks that are pretty average and people will enjoy it a lot more than whatever they're getting right now look at the freaking board behind me this fantasy draft from 2020 look at the first four rounds on this board and pick basically any four names from those  and you'll have a more compelling done time test  or which side is on this side frickin' Aaron Gordon  even Aaron Gordon is more well as well known enough and it was a very good dunker to be compelling  we need we need starters we had won NBA starter in the dunk contest  just give me someone out of a starting five  this one ain't that hard shout out by the way to Pete here's the YouTube link to LeBron saying he's doing the dunk competition that that ish bleep that pissed me off for a decade  I was mad at LeBron for 10 years after that moment  not because I needed him to be in it but because I needed him not to say he was gonna do it and then not do it  don't give people the idea that you're gonna go save the dunk contest because then we're always going to be holding out hope that someone like that was gonna do it he never had any intention of doing it by the way this is going to be my strong thoughts on Actually All Star Sunday because that's the very flip side of all of this stuff if you want people to care about the dunk contest you must put four people in it that we have heard of or at the very least three and one Mac McClung who can jump over Shaquille O'Neal which was a really cool dunk  but I don't how many I doubt anybody was watching it at that point because we were like what I care about Jaime hot Chez and Jacob topping sorry guys you guys I'm sure are you definitely better than 99.99% of basketball players in the universe but if I ain't heard of you and then most of the general public definitely hasn't heard of you  and this again is not the meant to pick on those guys that just happens to be the most recent example  if you want to do good dunk contest with people we haven't heard of they have to do the most insane dunks of all time and they have to do them fast  that's a very narrow eye of a needle if we're gonna shoot this sucker through it  or make the target bigger  I don't care I'm gonna point in a random like you guys don't I I'm bad at figuring out which arm is doing what this is my right arm here so it's mirror Imaging on the screen boom I don't know who I'm pointing at who's that Jimmy Butler it's not gonna do it his body will explode you will Jimmy Butler the dunk contest people will watch  well I pointed at Ben Simmons bad choice Dan meranti you don't think John Morant in a dunk contest would move the frickin needle  everybody would watch that thing you need to put a face of the NBA in the dunk contest if you want anybody to care and it's going to be hard because these guys don't want to get hurt doing a dunk contest  but if you want to save all star weekend that's your only hope for the dunk at least  Point number two  the Three-Point Contest that's my favorite event of All Star weekend I am angry because I didn't see almost any  Prix coverage of it  generally my timeline is filled with people talking about who's in the Three-Point Contest  I don't  know there's a big old push to get Malik Beasley in it right wasn't that the whole thing great  congratulations on getting Malik Beasley in the in the Three-Point Contest that was a needle mover  the Three-Point Contest does have stars in it because they know they gonna get hurt doing it  but they screwed it up this year because they didn't promote it properly  I don't know why  I really don't  I don't think that one really needs much fixing I think 3-point contest is fun as hell stop adding these stupid Mountain Dew extra balls because I want to be able to compare the scores now to what guys did 25 years ago don't change the rules the didn't need weird tweaks that we don't need a three-point ball we don't need a bright green three-point ball so the score is get goofball inflated and guys get two extra like  it's the same thing with baseball I don't need to compare 162 game Seasons to 160 and 150 game Seasons from Days Gone By I want this crap to be comparable  and I think that hard to just give dudes 25 basketballs  if there's a Moneyball there's a Moneyball if there isn't there isn't I don't care but let's keep the damn rules the same so we can compare Shooters now to Shooters then  how many balls did you make  it doesn't need to be we don't like  no gimmicks  stop with the gimmicks if you want to fix a 3-point contest remove the gimmicks continue to get stars in it because that part they've done a good job of these these shooters love to shoot and again there's really almost no risk of injury participating at 3 punt contrast other than their pride this one's an easy fix  standardized the rules  and promoted better  these are the ones you actually have superstars in  this should be easy  and NBA account just post clips of all of your best Shooters and say watch the Three-Point Contest that you know whatever it was five thirty Pacific time on Saturday night that's an easy one I want to talk about all star Sunday and then I want to talk about the thing the NBA did right actually overall star weekend  so all star Sunday is  a in my eyes  it's actually a pretty easy fix  which I know sounds nuts because no one seems to have the answer here  I have the answer  don't worry guys it didn't take me that long to figure it out so you know I don't need credit when they do it  the answer is well you have to your two paths you can go on  path number one is convince these guys to care  just any of us actually think you're going to convince these guys to care there isn't to play in the NBA that is his manic as the late Kobe Bryant none of these guys is gonna care about the All-Star Game the way he did Kobe wanted to rip your soul out no matter what you were doing  these are like they're just a handful of guys over the years that have a lore like this Jackie Robinson was one of them I don't know if you guys have ever heard some of the old clips that Vince Gully talking about calling Jackie Robinson games when he first made The Bigs and how he like wanted to race Vin Scully in a pool  you know the Dodgers broadcaster I Jackie I think you're gonna win  he wanted to beat everyone at everything  Kobe MJ  I mean  I don't think it's a coincidence that these are some of the greatest players in their games ever but  point is you're not gonna get what are we talking about baseball basketball combined what do we have a handful  five fingers can count them on one hand how many people humans  are wired at that level of crazy to want to just destroy you no matter what you're doing  whether it's the finals or like Wordle  and they say oh this you know this generation of players is wired different it wasn't like everybody wanted to destroy the other person in the All-Star Game 30 years ago there were just like a couple  and that was all it took and then everybody else sort of like  fell in line because you didn't want to lose the game for the one guy that I actually cared about it  so yeah you probably need like you know two or three guys that really truly not just say they care about it but actually truly care about it I get bad news for you guys it ain't happening whether it's just the arrow we're in the risk of injury that to me is probably the biggest part of it and these guys want to get hurt playing in a game that doesn't matter it's not gonna happen they're not going to care about the All-Star Game  and baseball did a stupid thing that they have had to since abandoned which was make the All-Star Game worth something  and then in a fan vote all star game where you have all of these like Legacy players you know 41 year old whoever's who can barely hit a baseball anymore and they're throwing 88 instead of 97 there in there in an All-Star game now that's deciding the World Series know  no  I didn't get a work baseball sought it miserably you cannot attach a motivational angle that way to the game  could you put money on the line yeah you could  but one of the big reasons that the in season tournament money worked as a motivator is because guys like LeBron badly wanted to win 400 grand for a dude on the team who made half of that so like some dude on a 200,000 dollar contract or some guy on like a two-way deal that guy walking into 400 Grand that's life-changing  LeBron walking into 400 Grand I mean like think of what that dude has in a bank account accruing  he has a decent Financial investor somewhere between like five and 10% interest annually between what he's actually making and what is being made just by existing money that's nothing  the guys in the All-Star Game are largely Max contract or right on their way to Max contract guys I don't know what the whole roster was I couldn't look it up before the show because honestly I'm tired it's a holiday so I'm not gonna go through every one of those guys but I would guess that 80 to 90% of the guys in the All-Star Game don't really care about making an extra couple hundred grand  they don't they'd rather go to charity and then you're right back to that whole like dudes are they gonna care  no  so you can't convince him to care for no reason I don't think you're gonna be able to convince him to care for any amount of money that's not a ridiculous amount that makes the whole event a net negative financially for the NBA  so you're only choice  is the following turn the All-Star Game into  full-on silly  lean into it and then me I did a little bit of that on the rest of this all-star weekend this is not one of the things where I'm going to give them a ton of credit but like  take a couple of things they did in the Celebrity Game there was an NBA Jam like 4 point spot that just lit up on the court  that's a great idea for the actual All-Star Game  when I do the eliminating and all that stuff like again  the team actually gonna care all that much I think these guys care more on All Stars Sunday about doing  you know goofy crap that they could never do it again  someone on Twitter said you can make the All-Star Sunday like a skills competition yeah I think you could probably bake that into the game  it's gonna take a lot of work like you'd have to install a lot of stuff in it in an NBA court to make it happen but I think it actually be pretty funny if like wacky waving inflatable Army leading two Band came up out of the court and  tried to whack a ball out of a player's hand or if you like had to go around to see if cones or shoot from half court or like you know half court shots should be where they points when Dame pulls up and drains one from there it shouldn't just be him taking another three-pointer he should be worth more and a team makes three shots in a row make it like NBA Jam make them on fire  they can shoot from anywhere and it doesn't matter what happens they get three points for it  they can on fire shot make an invincibility mode I don't care what you do come up with all of the most insane ideas and just try them grab our handful screw a handful grab like two bodies worth grab a whole bucket of darts and just flip them at a wall  I don't have the answer there I don't know what all these silly ideas are gonna be but that is the way you get people watching all star Sunday again you put the best players in the world who badly don't want to injure themselves and now they don't have to  they don't want to bang into each other on defense they don't want to have to go up high for Rebound and wrist turning an ankle  when they dunk they don't want to do a dunk that you know they're gonna land weird on a knee  so give them incentives to do silly crap for bonus points  you could attach monetary  gain to do doing some of this stuff oh you know if like there's a DOT that pops up on the court I like to actually that weird interactive Court they did some really like Beyond goofy crap with it and I think we could make that fun going forward have a spot pop up that's just like a green cash bag and if a player runs onto that boom berries a shot from the cache Bragg 10 grand falls out of the freaking sky in the stands you know the people are gonna get into that  hell yeah they would  also they'd fall in love with the player who did it I keep using Dame because he was the MVP and he'd have court shot but like it could be anybody  who do you want  take a take a 60 footer from the opposite of the Court that's got a big cash bag on it and if the player makes the 60 footer basically a full length of court shot effectively  and drills it in the All-Star game when they're standing on the cash back yeah money rains out of the heavens  that'd be sweet  give me all that stuff  so forget NBA Jam I want to go beyond that  get the fans involved  I want to t-shirt to pop up on the court  and  and maybe on one these things pop up it actually says on the dot what you have to do so the dot pops up at Center Court it's a T-shirt and it says alley-oop so someone's got to throw an ally you pass from from mid-court from the logo  and the person taking off has to take off from a different spot that has the same little graphic on it if you complete the alley oop then someone fires t-shirt cannons across the like fire across the court like we got to go full loony bin mode the players will love it I can promise you because again they're not in any danger of hurting themselves they don't have to compete harder it no longer matters who wins but you can attach something to the winner and right now the thing that's attached to the winning side is that their player gets the MVP award so if there's one guy that wants it they're gonna want their team to win  but they're not gonna compete all that hard  or screw it put one of these things like  uh I use t-shirt I use money already I don't know what else there is put like a hot dog but a graphic of a hot dog right in front of a bucket that says block a shot  so you got to get somebody in there to fly SWAT a shot away and if that dude flies swats a shot away on a hot dog logo then like a thousand hot dogs  in little parachutes fall out of the ski the ceiling into the crowd  how many people wouldn't go crazy for this  I'd be sitting at home crapping my pants in with delight  as money in Hot Dogs rain out of the sky  you don't think people would watch that on their TV oh hell yeah they would  wash that I'd watch the absolute crap out of that  because the game would probably have to stop  for the money maybe for the hot dog dogs maybe for the parachuting hot dogs definitely for the money maybe for the parachuting hot dogs as the cameras now pan to the crowd and see rabid Indianapolis will sites  climbing over each other for six dollars and a wiener  boom problem solved I do want to give the NBA a little bit of credit this weekend because I've been clowning on how all star weekend sucked but I'm telling you man if somebody came into next All-Star weekend was like promoting the fact that money is going to be blasted into the crowd if the NBA player can a 45 foot 3 pointer at exactly this moment  you got its like power ups put power ups on the court treat like a video game  better than NBA Jam  because instead of getting an extra point in a game they don't care about you involve the crowd in it  you have all the viewers in it  there you go somebody  somebody can make a perfect switch from 37 Feet as in no rim  straight through  on a logo that has a digital dollar sign on it then anybody watching that game live in that moment can text the number for a chance to win some money  or anybody that does it  and he says you go one V1 like NBA street style you could have that break off in the middle of an All-Star Game  in fact you should have to because we've got this court boom all the lights turn off and two spotlights hit one player on each side boom once brought light hits LeBron boom once brought light spotlight hits Giannis  right in the middle of the All-Star game everybody else has to just leave the court and LeBron and Giannis go one-on-one first to three points whoever wins it gets to choose a prize  for their team or for the audience and everybody on the ones can split into an east and west  there's so many crazy ways we can mess with this thing I think we got to do it  but again I do want to get the NBA a time you made a credit because the Steph V Sabrina was very cool even if Kenny Smith was so beyond off his rocker  like Kenny Smith and Reggie Miller need to be banished to  whatever I failed to make this store Ragnarok reference on the last show and I'm gonna screw it up again they were just I mean Reggie Miller is always awful Reggie or Kenny Smith was is usually decent but he was he was way off with this one like you can see Kenny had no idea how to talk about a woman playing basketball there was like some really creepy old man stuff going on but that was cool having this thing that all of us in our bodies are just like yes boys versus girls  from the age you turn four until the day you die you have this weird desire in your heart to see boys versus girls and something  even if we actually want to see them all succeed you still wanted to see it  it was theater  so could kudos for the end to the NBA for giving us theater  and Sabrina's freaking good  like there's no doubt about that she lost a step by what three points  yeah big and shoot  and I thought the floor was fun  and I go I know that what I'm saying almost doesn't make sense because it's like Dan you're inconsistency and all this stuff doesn't add up but that's the thing you need to do different stuff to save different parts of All Star weekend 3-point contest you need to keep it pure  Dunk Contest you need star power  the floor to get weird  who cares if the floor like that's silly and All Star Sunday  make it the most insane crap you have ever seen in your life make it a reality show mixed with a video game but starring the absolute greatest basketball players in the universe  there can be two minutes in the middle of the second quarter where they're no longer playing with a basketball  where a thing comes up out of the ground like American Gladiator style and they have to go get like a freaking dodgeball and just Blast for players on the other team like I mean really turn this into a spectacle  we can't have anybody getting hurt because that'll ruin it and then no one will ever let us do it again but pure spectacle on Sunday  y'all can thank me later  tomorrow  the rest shot oh there you go consecutive shots count is more yeah if you get hot you get more points I love it  but I want every single thing they do good idea William I want everything that happens on All Star Sunday to be tied into something the crowd can be involved in somehow I want us caring as little as possible what the score of the game is and as much as possible about what ridiculous crap they're being forced to do in the middle of a quote unquote basketball game  here's my rant I'll watch next year if you give me that stuff give me some of that stuff while watch next year but we got to give up on turning Sunday into an actual basketball game it's not gonna happen you're not going to convince these guys to care you got to go the other direction  the rest of this week we've got some fun shows for you planned we got some looks at the second half second half I know we're two thirds of the way through the NBA season now so basically the last third a little bit more than that I think we'll take a look at the last third of the NBA season we'll look at some playoffs stuff
