welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  you know it occurs to me that  some kind of expert I should probably have set my lineups before I did this show but I'm counting on the fact that I got a little bit of time after  better not run too long I suppose hey what's everybody what's up everybody he should say if Dan could remember how to talk it's week three of the weekly line up show the week ahead preview I am joined as always by d-ball b-ball Derek good day to you sir I hope that it's okay that I introduced you as just deep ball b-ball at this point  oh absolutely give the people what they want if that if that's how they want to know me then that's what I'll answer to so does that mean that your first name is just D or is it d b ball or is it d-ball B  well you know I I got I got to throw it out there my sister's actually who we called D so if you if you yell at I'm probably not gonna respond due to a life of just knowing that someone else but hey if we're we're going to do that then let's let's roll with it yeah we both just don't call me late for dinner I'm gonna call I'm gonna say that your first name is d-ball B and your last name is ball so that would then make you part of the big baller brand feeling pretty good about yourself with that little as long as I can collect some royalties off of that I think that's a deal pretty good Revelation here to start the show Welcome in everybody I am Dan Vespers at Dan best person on social he is at d-ball b-ball  and we're gonna be looking at week three and for those that are new to the program  Derek is an expert at the week ahead he writes the week ahead piece at sports ethos that's in the fantasy pass but he also has a nice little primer to get you going over on social media and so that's actually where we're going to start this week  where well maybe that'll be the second thing we do I do want to get it on the screen so people can start to look at that you can go find him there you can see it on the page if you're watching with us on on YouTube chat room by the way also open if you guys have any questions for Derek towards the end of his appearance here on the show first things first what's the overarching theme of week three I feel like we're now we're into streaming land now I don't feel like there's any real because like we won it was no week two was kinda weak three it feels like go ahead no uh yeah I guess you could say that one of the big things is kind of pushing me in that direction right now is the fact that we're looking at a Six-Day week because you got election day in the states tomorrow something that I didn't know when I looked at the schedule but it was fairly obvious to me once I did a little bit of research so you're getting a little bit more of a condensed schedule that's going on right now there are several game days where you actually see double digit games being played you've got three days that are 10 games or more and another one Friday which is nine games so really I think you could call it like a get in where you fit in kind of a screening opportunity here Monday Wednesday Friday and Sunday basically I'm expecting most people's starting lineups to be filled with their regular roster players the cut the guys that they're holding every single week not really a lot of streaming opportunity there but obviously there will be some need for some teams to fill in some spaces thankfully having so many teams playing on those dates I really it's just a best player of eligible Street right now the captions being Thursday a two-game day and Saturday a four game day where really there's a very very limited value set to pull from and among that group there's going to be a lot of competition we'll call it a gold rush for those players because really if everyone's playing mostly even schedule the only way to get a competitive Advantage which I would Define as having a games played advantage over your opponent is to be one of those people that has more players active on Thursday and Saturday so I think if you're looking at your lineups versus your opponents this week  if you're anywhere near a tie with them and as far as games played you have to be targeting people that are active on Thursday and Saturday  do you make a move with that in mind today or do you wait until Thursday to jump it that well depends on how competitive of lead you're in I'm going to assume that everyone's in a competitive league and that everyone in those leagues is listening to sports ethos and realizing that yeah there is a fair you know what I mean I think if you're in a competitive league there is no time to wait you got to go now because everyone's going to be targeting those days I mean if you're if you looked at the schedule at all this week you must know by now that those are the days you have to really get an edge in and so if you're in an actively you should assume that the other managers are looking at the same players you are for Thursday and Saturday and sometimes it's just better to get them early there are some teams that actually let you cover your early week your Monday and your Wednesday while still getting ready for that first game on Thursday and it's advisable to go for those teams but again you're picking from a fairly limited pool right now you basically the Bucks are your best option if you want to ride it out for the entire week while having a move that will cover your two week game days but it's entirely possible for you know for an attempt to manager to just take a two game stream on the Monday Wednesday and then flip their layers for someone from the Hawks bucks or magic and cover both the Thursday and the Saturday with just that one move I'm going to leave it up to those managers to judge whether that's something they can do right away or whether that's something they're going to wait a couple of days to do but I say err on the side of caution when there's so much riding on having those games yeah if you're full already today and Wednesday what is is there an advantage to to making your Thursday moves now or does it make more sense to just to like you know wait and see if your guys are playing on Monday and Wednesday and and act accordingly and that fashion what's your what's your move if you're already full oh if you're full and absolutely go nuts you're going to stash them anyway you don't plan to use them but you might as well have them there when you need them if you don't lose anything for gaining them or for adding them on Monday then I you know I see no reason to you know call that a concern if you do end up needing them then yeah you know what you're accepting the risk that you might have wasted a move that could have been used later on but I would rather trust that  that my lineups are going to be filled that you know I can't predict injuries I can't know if someone's going to be in a note of lineup so I'm going to assume they're fully healthy and assume that it would be safe to if I know I'm going to be full make my moves for Thursday on Monday so let's take a moment here to go through some of what you have in your Twitter thread week three streaming strategy I'm going to read a little bit for those that are listening after the fact not watching live and can't see it on their screen Indiana and Milwaukee have a perfect start to the week you write this is this is a quote by the way they will be active every possible day until Friday long stream any rotation players such as Aaron Nesmith Bobby Portis Jae Crowder Jalen Smith Malik Beasley Obi toppin as we start to move through this you mentioned that most of the league plays Monday and Wednesday no games on Tuesday so you're looking at best player on the Monday Wednesday such as guys like Kobe white Denny offiah Dillon Brooks Grant Williams herb Jones Josh Hart Nas Reed I don't want to read the entire thing verbatim but you did mention here once you get to Thursday at Atlanta Milwaukee and Orlando are active and play again after arresting guys like Bogdan Bogota Village Beasley  mobile Wagner saddiq Bey what about as you get into Friday Saturday Sunday what should folks be planning ahead because that's kind of where I paused here that people can read it from your your thread but can you talk us through like how many moves would you say you should still have when you get to Friday because I'm assuming you want people to make a move on Thursday if they didn't use it already earlier in the week absolutely well I mean my general rule is that by the time you're getting to Sunday you should have one or no moves left if you do plan to be an aggressive streamer so we are coming up on the on the cutoff point for for making moves and having actually be valuable if you do plan to use all of your moves I think I would plan to have maybe one one move left after Friday the best option for Friday's gotta be the Celtics because they're on the back to back which presents quite an ideal situation for managers that do have that space to make a second move after Saturday night wraps up because they will be able to flip that player for one more streamer on Sunday the Celtics are the only team on a Friday Saturday back to back so if that is the route you want to go if you again one of those things where you might want to grab them early for me personally I'm going to start looking at Celtics players on Wednesday if I'm not trying to fill any holes in my roster on on Monday and really and truly I know I did say that Indiana Milwaukee are you know the perfect schedule teams of this week Boston is about as close as you can get and they are a  really great consolation prize for anyone that does want to make those early moves and just kind of long stream for the whole week because they are on a game schedule effectively on two back to back with only one game in between they only problem is that day in between is a really soft schedule day so that's kind of why I kind of paid them a little bit and why I'm not looking at them as urgently until Wednesday where you can get that three in four a really for me if if I'm looking at making moves on Friday I'm not opposed to making two moves on the same day if you do have the space in your roster to do that most teams that play on Friday Also play on Sunday so effectively I have met my criteria for making a valuable streaming move which is one move translates to two games there's not a lot of follow-up moves to be made after that so I you know I could even break my rule and having moves left over for Sunday if I know that the right guys will be there for me to do both Friday and Sunday there's not really any opportunity to flip that player if you roster them for Friday and really get too much value out of it and unless you know that you're moving into the Saturday Sunday back to back with the Warriors or with the heat now they're rotations are not always the most consistent they're bench players are not always the most productive so I'm going to leave that up to managers to decide whether that's their best option and they do have you know a lot of variability in their rotations so for me  I think I'm happy if I've used up all my moves by Friday knowing that those Friday moves could if planned well get me to games do you ever plan to have a move left over on Sunday to try to churn out some extra stuff for the following week or is that just a luxury that pops up every once in a while well it's it's a luxury for sure I mean if possible I love to have my cake and eat it too sometimes I just have a roster that's really chugging along and doing so well that that there is no reason to to really look at streaming  until the end of the week and really at that point I'm only using my moves in order to get kind of bonus plays for the next week so if you're one of those teams that already knows that you know you're in a really comfortable position for the week and and you don't really need those moves to to help you get over for you know for this weekend then it's perfectly reasonable to to look at making moves that carry you into week four there are some teams that I did identify for that and there's always kind of you know for me giving what I'm doing with sports ethos I'm always looking at least a week ahead and so I know that you know there's  there's players from Chicago from Milwaukee from New York for the Thunder or from the Wizards who can actually get you that game on Sunday if you do need it and then they can really set you up well for a strong play in week four because they're all playing on four game weeks have back to back so you know are basically all of those teams I just named are going to be in competition for best schedule or at least for competitive streaming purposes so I'd be really comfortable if I get him a move and I was kind of planning to turn that roster spot over just to kind of burn it on one of one of the players from those teams let's flip this over now and talk about the other side because this is how you maximize the games who are the teams that have a terrible schedule this week and is there anything that folks can do to rectify that  no frankly there isn't there are there are there are three teams that I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but there's just no redeeming qualities to to their schedules so you got the calves they don't play until Wednesday and then they don't play again until Saturday you've got the Blazers they don't play again or play until Wednesday and then they don't play again until Sunday and then you've got my Raptors again Wednesday and then Saturday so two games of waiting to start the week really one game I guess we're gonna we're gonna factor out election day as a non-playing day but really they don't play until Wednesday and then they have another two game break so if we as streamers are looking at you know kind of creating value with our moves there's no way to create value because there's no two and three day period that you can exploit and really kind of make your move stick together as one coherent you know chain of events I guess we'll call it this to me is the time to drop all of those players that are from those three teams again the calves the Raptors and the Blazers if you have anyone from those guys from those teams near the bottom of your bench and I head-to-head league right now I probably wouldn't be holding on too tight you have to really believe in those guys if you're going to hold on to them through a incredibly disambut disadvantageous schedule week and frankly with some of the some of the talk I'm hearing around some players that might fit this criteria Gary transgender for example I you know I'm not really feeling too optimistic about reasons to hold  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of beer Wine and Spirits then get them delivered right

when you talk about Raptors isn't that isn't that yeah yeah  that's true right  yeah I think so at least you know okay yeah I should make sure I had that part right what about Okay so we've got some bad teams in there what what if you have and this is a tough one I mean there's a loaded question and streaming is the short answer but what if you are stuck with players on those teams that you can't get rid of what if you have Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland on a team what if you have I don't know Scotty Barnes and Donovan Mitchell on a team do you just have to wear it do you stream the crap out of your other roster slots what do you do if you're in a situation like that or do you try to take a little bit of a Long View in a situation like because obviously you're not dropping those guys but maybe there's someone at the end of your bench that in a regular week you wouldn't you use them as a streaming slot but in this one maybe you would is there something you do differently if you're just coming into a week at a game's disadvantage because that's something I just came out of somehow I was at a game's disadvantage like by 11 I don't know how the hell that even happens in a regular League that's that's absurd there wasn't any amount of streaming I could have done to overcome an 11 game gap especially when you consider the fact the dude I'm playing against would just stream right back at me if I started  to do it so what do you do in a situation like that just try to minimize your losses well yeah I mean that's that's the the short way of putting it just to go back to what you're saying you know if you if you're one of those people that has you know Donovan Mitchell Scotty Barnes Darius Garland you know any of those other stars from those teams first off congratulations you got some really good players and I'm happy to tell you that if you have a player of that quality it probably won't hurt you too much this week because they are going to be productive enough in two games with all likelihood that they are going to you know bring back top 100 value now what you're going to need to do if you're going to try to compensate for that game's play disadvantage frankly you're not going to be able to if you're that guy that has Donovan Mitchell you probably not going to have that good on odd or good odds of catching up to it and other team in scoring for example your points probably just won't be up to just enough but there are categories like blocks like Steels like three pointers which if done properly and if you get the right specialist which frankly Steals and three pointers off of the off of the waiver wire are very very achievable you know categories you know it's possible to to come back we call them high-end back Saturday stats for a reason and that reason is that it doesn't take as much of them to make a really big difference in fantasy so frankly yeah if you're if you're behind the eight ball by a considerable amount in in terms of gameplay total counting stats probably aren't going to be your thing this week you're looking at efficiency you're looking at you're shooting percentages which frankly it doesn't matter how much volume you have you just want to make a higher percentage of shots than the other team something that really can't be controlled if anything by by streaming you're looking at turnovers which again if you have a games late is it manager probably going to be doing better in any way you're looking at deals you're looking at blocks you're looking at threes know not every team builds that way personally I like to draft this way so that I am always prepared for this but if you are able to Pivot towards any of those six categories well six categories is more than enough to win so you just have to really make sure that you're focusing frankly almost exclusively on those areas if you're if you're at a considerable disadvantage by games  play  ideally if you are streaming well you can probably get in a bonus 8 games out of your out of your stream if you're assuming that one stream equals two games and you do it four times but again like you were saying there's no telling that the other manager won't do that you might know your leg a little bit better than I will depending on who's listening here but yeah not every manager will stream back so if you do think that you're playing against it and attentive manager or a manager that maybe just doesn't have that much flexibility with their roster right now you know a lot of those wait and see prospects that we're not sure if we should drop we're not sure if we should hold  there's going to be some teams that are in decision paralysis right now so you're gonna have to judge what your league looks like and whether those you know those three counting stack categories are a possibility for you if they are and if you think that that other manager might not be able to keep Pace with you with the moves that you're making sure go for it but if it's me every single time I have to be I have to be looking at high impact steps I'm going to try to get a few questions from the chat room in here that are sort of streaming or line up be related is that that's a proper terminology so Wayne says should I start moving or Kyle Anderson I'm going to assume that this means in the near term as a sort of like a games cap Rodeo I'll hit the games cap I see your games cap rotor questions in the chat room don't worry I'll get to those in a little bit that'll be towards the end of the program but I want to use Derek's brain for these sort of you know spur of the moment nightly decisions which way do you lean on this one I mean in a vacuum it's always going to be slow-mo for me I'm a huge huge fan of him so just in general I'm always gonna be advocating for for playing him but then if you if you look at the schedules for the two teams you've got slo-mo in a four-day week slow mo Kai Anderson in case anyone missed that and then you've got the magic who are on a three game week so yes the magic do have that advantageous Thursday Saturday slate but really you don't get much out of them until Thursday and Saturday whereas you could realistically start Kyle Anderson all four all four games I would actually be happy to start him even if I did have a lineup full I might actually be looking at making some tough decisions and taking one of my holds in that scenario in order to start filing Anderson because he is so productive and all of those categories that I was just talking about those high impact areas he is a 3-point shooter he is a good steal and block producer he does have solid percentages and you know I think that's the kind of guy that I love to Target for a streamer he can do a little bit of everything you know I'm pretty confident in that in a Four game week  all right here we go should I start Walker Kessler versus Chicago or Kevon Looney vs Detroit oh all right so I got I got turtle versus Looney last week and I felt uncomfortable about it and I got loonie versus Kessler this week all right I'm gonna go Kessler he last time I got the chance to make a call for Kessler it really worked out in my favor um it was Kessler versus jokic I think the last time you asked me about him and he really returned value there the reason that I chose Kessler versus Joker's in that matchup is because you just need when you have an opposing Center like a okay or like with the bulls boosted it you just need someone who's you know very apt defensively in order to make that kind of shut down play now loonie versus Detroit that you know that is intriguing he's almost exclusively going to be asked to rebound and frankly I think it's going to be pretty hard to rebound when you're going against Isaiah Stewart and Jalen Duren who frankly I think he doesn't he get every rebound I I'm actually less confident in Looney than I might typically be and I know it's hard to argue for Kessler right now but I just whenever you get a deaf  specialist against an offensive player that you know is getting a lot of touches I think it's right to go in his favor next one on the board I'm moving through us here a little bit um I wanted to do here's one that's a question that I'm not going to do this exact question but this is a person who has Jalen Johnson and on Yakko Congo are basically their worst players and he says look my plan right now is not to stream unless injuries Hit And Trades don't really happen in his league is this a strategy that you can agree with because I mean I guess we don't really know the league but those are two very very good players to have at the very end of your bench and I feel like I'm going to say yeah you can't you can't drop those guys to stream because the guys are picking up are going to be so much worse absolutely 100% that you could miss edit any better if those two words players and you're looking really good this year Jalen Johnson would be the one I would pick if you had to move on from one or the other I'm just such a big advocate for a Congo I really love how he just continues to kind of flush out his game Jalen Johnson has been electric to start the  season but it does occur to me that this is his first real season of getting a lot of you know touches and having that increase role so he's not a sophomore but it does occur to me that something like a sophomore slump could be in his future I'm not going to tell you to drop them though because he is just simply too valuable right now simply too productive and too useful to the Hawks as you know it's kind of a multi-position player yeah no it's congratulations if those are two works but yes that's a good spot to be in but you're also there's this there's this innate desire as a human I want to make moves in my fantasy league and if those are your two worst players you're not gonna get to make that many moves this year especially if you're the league where trades aren't happening you're gonna like if you want to open up or roster spot you're gonna have to sweeten the crap out of a trade and you know I don't know exactly what that's going to take Mattis says in a 10 category League where double-doubles is the 10th Corps would you go Russell Westbrook or Kyle kuzma today noting by the way or I will know that James Harden is making his Clippers debuted tonight  yeah so I mean that you said it right there as soon as I saw Russ's name is like well I'm not picking him because I know that they're going to be doing the James Harden experiment tonight and  many nights yeah exactly I mean he is the system as they say right all right he's not a system here that was exactly that was special so I mean you look at that you look at a quote like that and then you know give me a reason to be optimistic about Russell Westbrook I can't think of one he's probably going to I mean he's rough he's gonna he's gonna go get his but I don't think he's gonna get a very efficiently and I don't think he's gonna get it in the same quantity or with the same amount of playing time kuzma on the other hand plays for the Wizards who as far as I know they just roll the ball out there every single night and just whoever wants to shoot to shoot yep we'll get it yeah go get it go play voice I think the Wizards should Pioneer a new Stipe a new style of basketball where it's like the beginning of a game of dodgeball you know you just put the ball in the center put the ball in the middle of whichever dude on The Wiz gets it they just get that first shot just do it over and over again because that's kind of what it looks like it's happening anyway  I think that's the only way to take a shot away from Jordan Poole or Kyle kuzma to be honest but you know with that in mind if you know that touches with with Kyle kuzma on the Wizards then you gotta go with him it's yeah just in a much better situation than us is it right now that is bad basketball out there I hope they can get a cleaned up a little bit I don't have that much Faith but still early thanks gonna happen I'm not gonna completely right the moth but there is you know it's one thing if you got to take turns offense where it's Kawhi Leonard and Paul George are you take turns like that that's why the clipboards won whatever was 45 to 50 games cuz you got two superstars trading off but it's a little different when it's cools and pool yeah okay so let me let me take us now to the end of my discussion with Derek for this week and that is what if you got to the end of your week with some moves left on Sunday let's say you're like Nils who asked that question that look I got a very full roster maybe someone on his team gets hurt maybe you only have one slot that you really interested in streaming you probably do get to Sunday with some stuff left what do you do then is there a way to set yourself up going into next week because I know I haven't looked that far ahead but you seem like the kind of person that probably has  absolutely I am the kind of person that does that so as far as as far as setting yourself up for next week There's a couple of things you can do I for one have always been to type where I do like injury stash and players so if I'm at the end of my week I'm not really sure that I need to stream and I'm not really worried about next week yet if I see on my waiver wire there's a you know an injury injured player like let's say bojang bogdanovich maybe a name another injury player trade Murphy and I have the opportunity to pick them up and stash them without penalizing myself for that week of competitive play and I think that's something I would consider if I'm looking at streaming then I'm probably looking at a team that's active on week four Monday because there's only four games that day so I mean really if possible I would probably be trying to get one of the players from those teams I think I named it early but that's going to be Chicago Milwaukee New York Oklahoma City and Washington that are going to give you the best Edge for the early part of next week next week if possible you should be targeting teams that are active on Monday and on Thursday in particular is the two weakest schedule days so if you do see that you have a player that's potentially available that would be there for 13  or for the 16th then I think it's worth picking them up a little bit early  all right you are officially off the hook Derek yeah I know celebrate a little bit folks listening didn't get to see the two-fisted pump there um thank you as always my man I hope that I'm trying not to make it too uncomfortable here but give it time we've got a whole season to for me to weird you out we do it okay so far oh absolutely I'm loving every second of it but we'll make it weird I'm not worried I have faith yeah let's get weird he's Derek ball he's at d-ball people on all social media platforms including in our Discord where if you have a fantasy pass you can pick his brain whenever you like in the ask the prosthetic if you got questions about the week ahead piece all so in the fantasy pass go check that out you can hit us up and Discord on social media Derek until next Monday my good man  it was pleasure we got a few more things to cover here on the show before we wrap it up we are not all the way done but a big big big thank you as always to Derek ball for taking the time on Monday afternoon to walk us through the week ahead get a situated here get us ready for some streaming also it is pointed out to me bye my good friend to the great Andre Lemos that we do have a tool in our fantasy past that can help you with streaming as well and that is our daily projections engine available in the fantasy pass all of that again fantasy fast starts at just six bucks a month if you want to upgrade adding baseball and football you can do that with promo code ethos 246 that's only seven dollars a month so it's one Buck more to add football and baseball to your fantasy pass between that engine that Andre is talking about and all the information that Derek just gave you for free on this show you're going to make the right choices on your streaming Monday Wednesday maybe even Friday this week it is a very very busy week for  overload Days by the way couple notes you heard the two game weeks of the Cavs the Blazers and the Raptors so if you're in a weekly format this is the general rule weekly leagues you start players of the two game week that are top 50 or better so in the Cavs that's basically Darius Garland Evan Mobley and Donovan Mitchell Jared Allen would be sort of right on the cusp since he's still working as minutes all the way up to Full Tilt so you might want to sit him in a two gamer on the Blazers that's DeAndre ayton and maybe shade and sharp but things can go south pretty quick up there I think you could probably do it and get away with it for the Raptors you got a few of them Scotty Barnes two-game week is fine Pascal siakam ogn and Nobby I think those three guys Schroeder  I do still think shooter takes a small step back but if you're hunting assist you could throw them out there probably not Jakob Pirtle these days although with precious or out he's kind of a maybe in that kind of targeting the top 50 Zone as well  let's go through some of the players that are game time calls right now because those are the folks also weekly leaders are going to be struggling with by the way we just got news about two to three minutes ago that Shea Gil just Alexander is available to play tonight Luka doncic and Kyrie Irving are both in as well so really good news on the questionable tags right now I got to say early in the year the question will players are playing more often than that I don't know if that's the NBA's pushed to get guys into more basketball games or if it's just that everybody knows the West is going to be a just a slugfest and so anytime you can get a damn win you gotta go try and get it either way great news on that front Shay Luca Kyrie we're talking about you know the trio of top 15 guys in the NBA all ruled in as we're live on air here on this show if you have some questions we're gonna try to get to those in a minute but in terms of players that are sort of the would you won't you Devin Booker is out for the sun's for their ballgame on Wednesday we don't have a timetable for return on Booker but it does sound like Bradley Beal is set to make his season debut on Friday that's the target for Beal that would be a two-game week they're gonna they're gonna load I don't say load management but they're going to minutes manage him a little bit so I don't think that I would start Booker or Beal this week but it is good news at least that deals probably not too far away Darren foxes know Derek white was probably until a few moments ago he just got ruled out for tonight so my assumption is that he didn't get back from the birth of his second child in time to kind of get his conditioning right for the ball game I'd assume he's back by Wednesday then they go Wednesday Friday and Saturday and so that's more than enough for Derek white who's been a top 20 fantasy play so far Chris stops porzingis is a game time decision for tonight again even if he doesn't play in this one it's he's dealing with a stye and his I presumably they'll be able to treat that over the next couple of days so I don't think you'd get any fewer than two games probably closer to three even three and a half depending on the call later on this evening they play at 5:00 so it's not right at lineup block but a little bit later so I think I'm probably a go on poor Singas this week  Kelvin Johnson is a weird one  his questionable with a sore left wrist they play at four so we'll have an idea of whether or not he's healthy this week in the next hour or so then they go Wednesday Friday Sunday the rest of the week he's been incredibly efficient so far which is not something we expected after last year  if you've been rolling with a warm killed in Johnson into this point you probably continue to do so this week unless he's ruled out later tonight then you might want to take me back off a little  dream on green is questionable in the back to back  oh Jimmy Butler is oh probable so he's fine so you're keeping him in their dream on his questionable Warriors go Wednesday Saturday Sunday I believe there's already yeah so I would start any Warriors that are questionable or better so Draymond is one of those guys  Nick klaxon is out for the week most likely I would assume Devon to sells out for the week Terry Rozier dealing with a groin strain he's probably out for the week we don't have that ruling yet but I think that I would probably sit on him Deni avdija is questionable but did participate in shoot around so we'll have more word on him here in the next minute or two if he's out and a three game week I would probably try to find a four game or to start over him but if he's in he's been good enough to this point Jamal Murray strained hamstring I assume they'd give him a week off Robert Williams dealing with a knee issue I would assume they're gonna give him at least a couple of games off and they play only twice this week anyway so he's a bench and that probably takes us about as far as we need to go on these  oh well Markle faults he's already been ruled out for tonight magic have a good schedule this week  but they're now with him not playing he's gone until Thursday it's Thursday Saturday it's become a two-game week for him so false I think is a bench  and I think that's probably all the questions on the sit start front for weekly leads and I think that means we can probably pivot over into the chat room and try to hit on the stuff that I didn't want to use up Derek's time on freaky says how low to buy Nick klaxon well let's assume he's out another month see if you can get him for an 80 90 range guy someone that doesn't want to sit on it now the issue of course is can you afford to sit on the clocks in for a month and the answer is  I don't know only you know that about your own team  hi would you trade Kyrie for Jamal Murray and Anthony Simons I would not it's a points points League now I want Kyrie give me the better player in most trades  Max Drew so Bruce Brown I think we had this question earlier today I'm gonna lean Spruce on this one but it's very very close I don't know that it's gonna make a massive difference in your team either way but I like screws yes and literally anybody that takes shots in Cleveland goes down he has a huge role  let's see trading Jordan Poole Malcolm Brogden I would get Kyrie Irving France and pick up Christian Wood yes go get me  your punting threes assistant turnovers  oh so that's why he is good for this team I think I would go get Kyrie because then you can go spin Kyrie into someone better once we know eight and steals are gonna come down from where they are right now look I love DeAndre and start to the season I have him in a couple of spots in teams where I needed badly field goal percentage and rebounds it but I'm also a pragmatist  I know this isn't Gonna Last all year  Kyle Anderson or Caris LeVert rest of season also CP3 to the bench or stay patient  I'm okay with benching CP3 in a games cap Rodeo while we sort of sort out this dream on green thing and then definitely Kyle Anderson over Caris LeVert  Spruce Bruce brown or Jalen Suggs uh give me Suggs just to see what happens why not  is Gaffer to hold in 12 teams yeah we got to see what happens he really hasn't been healthy for morning about a game and a half in the Wizards keep getting blown out so we legitimately haven't even seen what his role is going to be  should I trade away Jalen Williams to get Jimmy Butler yes hard yes  no dear and fox and no Jamal Murray is Mike Conley a safe replacement for this week yeah I mean he's not gonna get you with those guys did Conley's not gonna score anything like those dudes but you're hoping for you know it doesn't points  four to five to six assists in a good universe  there isn't really any replacing Fox and Jamal Murray in your lineup Conley is at least a point guard  but significantly worse should I play both kuzma and tyus Jones against the Sixers or they're gonna get blown out every damn Wizards game seemingly is a blowout these days  kuz has been good enough anyway I think I'd probably play them and then just pray  should I bench Walker Kessler until further notice I think you could do that I think you could do that I'm okay with it you're definitely not dropping though  I traded herb Jones for tyus Jones and I'm hunting blocks I'm hoping everything is going to be fine yeah it'll be fine  uh should I drop Walker Kessler for Mitchell Robinson if Robinson is on your waiver wire he should definitely be added for someone I think you got to hold on to kachler I don't know what your drop is gonna be but Mitchell Robinson is definitely a standard League guy  where is he at this year 126 that's just because he's shooting 41% that's not gonna hold the other stuff is totally fine Mitch Robb is definitely a 12 team or  would you drop Isaiah Stewart to pick up Robert Williams so I don't know how injured Robert is but yes he's much better than Isaiah Stewart so  sort it's like a soft yes  how would you order these players Michael Porter Jr Jeremy Grant Brook Lopez um give me Michael Porter Jr Overbrook Lopez over Jeremy Grant  and you could convince me to switch mpj and Brooke Lopez but Porter is off to a really good start this year and so I'm kind of wondering if maybe last season he just wasn't all the way healthy but he's he's looking great so far this season  LeBron and Brandon Ingram for Nicola yokich who wins jokic Side by a lot  Derek white was dropped in my ten team or what  lunacy he's a top 20 players so far  what are these League's I want in  do I drop Chris Paul John Collins Gordon Hayward or Mitchell Robinson for him if any  literally any of the four you should drop for Derek white but  Mitchell Robinson is probably the safest drop  me a man yeah Derek white needs to be absolutely belongs in her team I traded calculus for Austin Reeves how was that um  that's fine I don't think anybody's a big winner there  oh I shouldn't have done this one with with  Derek whoops start one today a Kong Keegan Murray or mobile Wagner with three-point percent is the extra cat give me oh Kang woo  is Trey young a Bi-Lo looking to send an offer either of either Tyrese Maxey or Tyler hero if you can get Trey young for Tyler hero you do it  Tyrese Maxey Trae young I think is pretty fair you're sort of hunting cats in that one it's a nine cat leaked so turnovers do matter here  but I think those two guys come together a bit over the rest of this season  hey guys and Yahoo if I have a player in the ill who is now active am I still able to offer trades or will they disabled it until they're back on my active roster I actually don't know why don't you just try to do it  if it doesn't let you that'll then you got your answer  would you consider activating Kyrie to starting while dropping DeAndre Hunter and losing on the two extra games on Mavericks play on all busy days  yeah I think I'd rather have Kyrie there  do we start Kessler versus vouch or is it an Olynyk situation for the Jazz honest to goodness I just don't know I think because the Jazz don't have a point guard they're using Kelly Olynyk more because they need a ball moving big man right now they need someone to help facilitate because they just don't have one at least until anybody on that Team figures it out like tailored and Tucker may be figures it out at some point but he's not Mike Conley and so they just like they need  non ball Stoppers  to keep the offense from chunking up  that's part of it  so I might bench him  Kessler that is  should I start Goga but tozzi or Walker Kessler today oh I'm gonna get this one wrong aren't I I'll go Kessler I just I have trouble believing in batsy he's also weirdly low field goal percent big man I know it didn't happen against the Lakers but like what are the odds he blocks five shots and has good numbers across the board again not great  should I start Dyson Daniels or Jeremy Sohan tonight that I don't know  probably so Han at least you're guaranteed to give minutes there  we don't know what the Pelicans are going to do exactly with McCollum out find out later on tonight would you trade Tyreese Halliburton and Andrew Wiggins to get lamelo Schroeder and smart no  I have Rozier tari Eason and Squid Henderson would you drop one to stream or hang on punting field goal percent I'd probably drop tari Eason to avoid taking a bunch of elves  it's hard to justify stashing two young guys scooter Rook East in a second year  scoot you got to hold on to because at some point this season you'll start to figure out the NBA he's got to get healthy first to do it but then he'll have probably a strong finish Eason is going to be you know rebounds field goal percent steals that kind of thing and if you're punting field goal percent  I don't know that you can take zeroes I don't know that you can justify taking 0 to hold on to these that those two guys even  I can only start two today out of Sohan Melton Wagner mob Wagner and Marcus Sasser yeesh you need a DFS expert for this question I'm probably going to Anthony Melton  and  Marcus Sasser  but I may live to regret it  do I trade Derek Lively and Andrew Wiggins for Aaron Gordon know  Aaron Gordon's off to a really good start this year he's still Number 96 because he doesn't make free throws his defensive stats are likely to come down  yeah I think I'd rather just wait and see what Derek Lively becomes  is Kyrie going to just play off ball and stand in the corner all season and Luca with the ball in his hands 90% of the time nah man they'll figure it out  they'll figure it out also by the way it's worth pointing out that as quiet as it seems like Kyrie has been he's number 27 in nine cat right now and that's what this shot not dropping and he's taking 18 shots a game even when it seems like he's not all that heavily involved  how are you doing in your League's Dan I don't know we're just getting started  I'm in three head-to-head cash League's and one of them is that was at a huge game's disadvantage the first couple weeks and is like two or three games under 500 one of them is 13 and 5 that one's in good place in the other one is like 10 and 8  so that one's doing fine Rodeo leaks are all over the map because I sometimes play guys I sometimes don't I often like behind I feel relatively good about like a solid 80% of the rodeo League's I don't know more in about two more weeks how's that  that's on Kelly oubre I'm gonna continue to start him until they give me a reason not to  do I start Clint capela in a games cap format I think the answer is probably yes but  I mean he'd been worse than I really know he's number 57 right now yeah you're starting capella  Have you shared what ESPN is doing with extra game in season tourney it doesn't count  the championship game does not count towards fantasy it's not it's not a legitimate game it's like an exhibition basically  thoughts on Dorian finney-smith I like him Nick Blackson is likely out a few more weeks with a high ankle sprain and Dorian Finney Smith has been a terrific feeling for clocks in his number 81 on the season without really getting any defensive stats so if those come around and even the tiniest bit you could even be a little bit higher than that I have absolutely no problem with rolling with DFS until  Clarkson comes back  who are you guys dropping for the other in a 12 team points League Jeremy so honors Xavier told me I'm dropping Tillman out of those two guys  nice Ace Ventura t-shirt thanks man yeah so this was I don't remember this was like the business card he had I love this shirt I just got it last week and if it's nice soft man this soft shirt  do an ad for tea public tea public please come sponsor the podcast anybody out there watching or listening Affiliated in any way with tea public.com I would love to have them as a sponsor because I'm wearing the crap out of their t-shirts on this show  not sure if you've been asked before but thoughts on Horford while the Celtics are healthy yeah when he's when they're healthy he's not playable but it does seem like now with Derek white getting ruled out tonight we might get one more Al Horford spot start which brings me great joy because you guys know I love how Horford  but look again pragmatist you can't play him when they're healthy but when he starts with the look  should I trade siakam for Michael Porter Jr to points League know you should not  she should go the other way around though use Michael Porter to try to get the atom so Buy Low sell High  someone dropped Emmanuel quickly would you rather roster him or use the spot to stream I would rather use that spot to stream  I just doesn't seem like quickly unless Bronson goes down I can't see quickly being better than about 130 range  it just too many bodies in the way there's too many bodies in the way  all right um  we all caught up yeah we're all caught up
