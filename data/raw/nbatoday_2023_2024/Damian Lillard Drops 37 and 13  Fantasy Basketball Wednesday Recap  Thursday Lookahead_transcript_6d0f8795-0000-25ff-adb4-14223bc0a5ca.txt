welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  this should be I think slightly easier show  Thursday everybody we've got a Wednesday to recap we got a short Thursday to preview let's dive in it is fantasy NBA today  sports ethos presentation and this if I had one is where I play a cool intro video but I don't have one so to that end  if any of you guys out there watching and want to do something fun  put together like a little  intro thing for Fantasy NBA today  I'll probably use it because technically speaking I think a pretty good with audio I am  a bit of a  what's the word I'm looking for bit of a boner when it comes to video  I don't really know what the hell I'm doing I got this board behind me I got the camera right up there I don't even look at all I don't look at all that much because I got all these stats flying around but I'm doing my best damn it and I could use your help is where I'm going with that  not that busy of a day but I want to get into it anyway first things first find me over on social at Dan Bass Pros I know a few of you are doing so every day and for that I am grateful because the more we grow their the more we can push people back here it's this positive feedback loop that goes through YouTube and podcasts and Twitter and sports ethos and so it all just kind of floats each other and so every little bit that you guys do count so follow on Twitter a like button push subscription button push whatever it happens to be  grateful for all of them they all really do help every last little bit is important  as far as yesterday goes if feels like the story of Wednesday was kind of that it was like the day for the fill injured guy Kyrie Irving was out and two Celtics were out and the list goes on and on so let's just hurry the hell up and start talking about some of it right now Dallas beat Washington and we've got some thoughts on Washington but let's talk Dallas first know Kyrie Irving I think they figured this was basically a scheduled rest day for him I know they can say it was his foot or whatever they want to talk about but this was a an easy way to get the team that's actively trying to lose basketball game the Wizards are basically a scheduled W right now I know the Pistons actually technically have a worse record and The Grizzlies have the same record as the wizards but only one of those three teams I think is trying to lose right now and so for Dallas this was an opportunity to just get Kyrie a little breather  and what did we get in the meantime is Derek Jones who apparently has gotten rid of the junior I was unaware of that he had a good ball game but  Ryan do anything with it Derek Lively had a really nice ball game here he's been very up and down  he is this doesn't move him off of schedule stream type guy for me this very nice ball game bumped him back up to number 106 so he's not far from being an everyday guy but it's just hard to know like if the big ball game moves you up to the edge of the top 100 the bad ball game drops you back towards top one 50 that to me is like a very strong schedule play  and I said it 1000 times I'll say it a thousand and one he reminds me a lot of Nicks and before he figured out how to convert all of that stuff into consistent fantasy appeal  my worry of course is that Maxi Cleburne eventually gets healthy which apparently that may never happen actually maybe we shouldn't even worry about it but at some point Cleveland might get healthy then you've got sort of the three-headed monster right now there's only Lively and Dwight Powell which is an easier path to minutes and even still it's very up and down  but  I also kind of get it if you guys want to just sit on him because there's an upside built into him that you don't find on the waiver wire all that often right now he's a schedule stream kind of play but that's not that doesn't preclude him from taking a small step forward and if you somehow were like okay well Dan I can guarantee you he'll play 25 26 minutes a night I'd probably keep him at that point  for whatever that's worth Tim Hardaway Jr 31 points in this ball game he's on a pretty vicious role to start the year  I don't know how it happened I don't know how long it's gonna last but you go with it while it's going he's number 91 and it's not gonna get a whole lot better than that because he doesn't get any defensive stats he doesn't really rebound or pass it's all points in threes  and  to his credit he's gotten those two things so far this year so but derp  all right Washington it's time for you to  feel my wrath  the wrath of an angry podcaster there's just nothing quite like it  you won't you don't know pain until you feel the wrath of an angry podcaster  so I say to you Washington  shame on you  shame on you Washington for taking so hard  for taking so hard in a way that is so flagrant to anyone who watches 10 minutes of Wizards basketball  that it hurts us  and the silly thing is that  your bad enough Washington where you don't have to do shenanigans  but they're doing shenanigans  Denny avya 24 minutes he was a plus one in this ball game by the way 15 points 3 boards four assists three steals three three-pointers five out of six shooting in two free throws made him both  that's a guy that should have been playing 32 minutes in this ball game or at the very least like 208 I know it's a blowout loss but good God let him play a little bit ties Jones he was a minus a lot but also we need to remember the lineups he's a part of he was six out of seven shooting in this ball game 22 minutes  Daniel Gafford five out of six shooting 10.9 boards  23 and a half minutes  Kyle kuzma 6 out of 18 shootings 30 minutes Jordan Poole  six out of 17 shooting 32 minutes  and the more hilarious thing forget the total number of minutes I don't know if you guys got a chance to actually watch the progression of this ball game I have trouble watching the wizards live on a television because they're really really bad  they were down 23 was it 24 something in that neck of the woods I can't remember if it was 23 24 or 25 and they were about eight nine minutes left in the fourth quarter that's a time when most teams just go ahead and wave the White Flag but oh no not the Wizards  they put kuzma and pool back into the ball game just to go Chuck a few  which if you got those guys in like a points for him at you probably were thrilled to see them back in the ball game but for every other for all intents and purposes this is a ball game that the Wizards had already lost by the time we got to about the nine minute Mark of the fourth quarter and then there were like you know what let's put our two horses that's air quotes by the way for those that are listening and not watching horses back in the Ballgame so that I don't know they can get a few more shots and feel less annoyed  because right now it feels like and I have no actual verbal or written proof of this but if you watch the games right now it feels like the Wizards are running out lineups on purpose that they know are going to stink  they haven't shown any inclination to change that to this point 10 11 games into the season  and what's more it almost felt like there was a contract with kuzma and pool in the fourth quarter of this ball game to say you know what I know we're down by a ton but we promised that you guys could go play 30 minutes and we promised you guys could each get like 15 16 shots or more so you get back in there take a few shots  it's almost like Cosmo pool we're like we know we're gonna be really bad this year and we're okay with that and we'll frankly will lean into the bad but you know don't don't bench us don't play US 23 minutes a game that's not fun we want to go play basketball have some fun this is the like go have fun minutes which is normally given to the backups the garbage time guys the young guys to see what they can do and instead it was given to the two main usage guys on the team but not the three other guys in the starting lineup that we're having I don't think it's all that hard to argue better basketball games  Corey kispert got 26 minutes I don't know maybe they think they still something there he feels like just a floor spacer  be a lot of cool I believe is the one that they're interested in going forward he's a guy that they took her earlier in the draft  really ish I guess 10 points 8 boards to assist a block and two three-pointers  if you're playing him right now you're praying that they can continue to just sit as many people as possible and let him get through  I do still think there's a lot of this tied to Dillon right being out  no I'm not super confident  that as we've been calling him Cooley can keep it going day after day after day  he has a  better Fantasy game that a lot of the guys on this team and he's going to be heavily rostered in competitively because it does sort of look like he's doing stuff right now it feels to me like we're  I don't know maybe later this year I don't think that it's something that sticks right now  but there's certainly some upside built into him because the field goal percentage isn't bad you can rebound he can get a few passes into the mix not a not a massive assist guy by any stretches more of a more of a wing than anything else and he's got good defensive stats we've seen that so far too  so what I stash him  I don't think I'm all the way there yet and I know that I might run a little bit late on this one for being skeptical and I'm kind of okay with that it just feels to me like at some point the Wizards are gonna be like okay we are safely one of the worst teams in the NBA we've rocked up enough what I've called the pre tank before when teams are taking early in the season so that they don't have to rest all their guys down the stretch it was are going ahead and just racking up l's in October November okay  at some point they're either gonna have to trade tyus Jones or play him a little bit same kind of story with Daniel Gafford I don't know honestly why they've kept some clamps on any of these so far it's seems like he's been one of their more consistent players but he's only at 26 and a half minutes idea is one of the guys on the team I'm starting to trust more and more I was skeptical of him at the start of the season but he's one of the only guys on the club that can both pass and shoot and play a little bit of Defense  yikes what a team  no Giannis  no problem Dame went for 37 and 13 got himself to the free-throw line a whole bunch of times  and one gigantic ball game was enough to move game from what he was in the 40s or 50s now he's at number 28  I think he might be the biggest positive impact for free throw shooter in the early part of the season and that's something that could stay close to holding  she'll just Alexander's for throws her down by a pretty good chunk always still the number one player and fantasy because of Two and a Half steals per ball game but this isn't about Shea this is about Dame  who I had as a Buy Low on yesterday's podcast second podcast or Tuesday second that was Tuesday's podcast and now you can't  sorry Brook Lopez was all so buy low and now you can't and that's the thing about these like  something in my mouth that was weird you have a limited amount of time on a Buy Low the window extends for a certain like we don't know how long it's gonna go but we know enough about guys to know where they're gonna be  and for Lopez  the block the shop the shop blocking is outstanding a lot of his stuff is still I think on its way up and with yesterday's seven block game he actually pushed himself out in front of his ADP is right because now 66 and 9 categories that's about 10 slots in front of where he was drafted he's been largely healthy so far he played 33 minutes in this game 8 boards for assists still isn't even really making his shots  were Lopez shooting 40 and a half percent from the field in 69 at the free throw line he's in 80% are free throw for his career he's much closer to 50 from the field and I get it a lot of his shots are three pointers this year but you're still looking at mid 40s for him so just as that stuff starts to move you've got even more room for growth  Malik Beasley at 83 pointers we know these games pop up for him every once in a while he is no more than a shot in the dark stream play or hoping you're getting some threes out of him Bobby Portis on the other hand actually does look like a pretty good play right now with Jae Crowder out he's getting a lot of minutes points and rebounds is definitely going to be the main stuff for Portis you're not going to get a lot else out of him  but his roster ship also jumped from like mid-50s to mid-70s over the last couple of days so if you're trying to look for him now you're probably too late you kind of had to do it after that first good game when Crowder went down  or you had to have him before that and then now you're getting lucky because he wasn't denying cat guy and now he is  yeah Capaldi did not start the second half but still actually had a better ball game 13 and 11 for steals two blocks the defensive stats is always been the stuff with turtle that you knew was gonna come around a little bit yesterday's game pushed him up to number one and 13 in nine category League's that's good he's still at only point or one point nine defensive stats that's a number that I think could continue to rise for him 42% free throw tends to be a riser I don't know that Turtles necessary necessarily A Buy Low type but I feel pretty confident that if you just waited out it'll be okay at the very worst not to say that he's gonna again blow the roof off the building but he'll be okay it's Scotty Barnes bounce back I think he had one or two kind of quiet ball games this pushed him back up to number 10 in in nine cat  one of the most surprising things so far is that Steph Curry's number 11 and 9 category leaks I have no idea how that's the case with 31 points and 5.63 pointers under his belt but again that's the type of insane crap you got to be doing to be near the top of the board right now  it's out of control  whatever with every passing day Scotty Barnes looks more and more like a guy that can actually stick inside the top 20 again I don't think 3.3 defensive stats holds for him  maybe maybe High twos is it possibility but again even as just some of that stuff starts to erode that ends up being kind of a big deal here but we've seen enough to know that he's gonna be better than his draft slot so I was way too low on him I'm not saying Fades Gotti Barnes arrest the way I'm saying probably comes back to Earth a little bit but not that much she feels like he could be a second round or or better all season long at this point  provided he stays healthy and he has generally to this point in his career the Dennis Schroder cool down has begun I this is not gloating because I'm still wrong  so I want to make sure that that's very clear but when he was inside the top 50 and I was sort of you know blink blink blink sound effect  I started to feel like a real big idiot because I don't usually Miss by that much on guys  we all miss a little bit you know we analysts we stare at this stuff day and night day and night 3605 days a year we try to get a lot of it right and I think our hit percentage for those that are like me staring at this stuff all day every day is better than most but it's never going to be 100% And I thought all right well I've seen enough of Dennis Schroeder's Fantasy game to know that in a big starting role he still I mean thinking back to his Oklahoma City years he was still kind of sitting just outside the top 100 and that's why I didn't really go for him because I thought there wasn't a like a giant upward  jump coming  and when you're a pick one oh five one ten one fifteen you're looking for somebody that you think can get into the 70s or something like that and so when truder was in the 40s I thought crap like where did this come from but  the threes have come down the steals have come down the field goal percent has been low low lower than expected on his way and he's just sort of settling  where he finishes is still as yet to be determined and this game was basically a blowout you didn't see full minutes for mostly anybody on the Raptor's side like you know siakam only played 29 kind of thing so it's possible that Schroeder can work his way back up a little bit he was part of a unit that was just getting decimated and maybe he does stay in the 80s this year so that would still be me being too low on Dennis but at least it would only be a Miss by like 25 instead of 70 I feel a little bit less nutty  think of that Austin Powers seen it's a bit nutty  Boston beat Philly without two of their guys  and I don't I mean this  not a great look for Philly  Al Horford filled in for Chris stops poor Singas like a boss 14 points 8 boards three assists five blocks and four three-pointers  how did Big Al pull this one out of a hat I have no idea but damn it  if porting us sits or frankly if Tatum sits because we see them they'll go bigger or third is a play  when someone sits or for plays Jaylen Brown was also out of this ball game Sam Houser got the start he had been red-hot lately but he didn't do much in this ball game and I think again if you're playing him you're mostly just hoping for anywhere from two to four three-pointers  technically you got that although  you've played him to fill in for brown here you probably hope for a little bit more  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the

more because a couple guys were out and he's gonna be bouncing around in the upper echelons of strong fantasy play this year  cool  Philly side no Nic Batum for a second game in a row they're expecting him back for their next one Rob Covington did manage to put together a better showing here and came up with 16-6 so with only a two steals I almost thought that you know 37 minutes you'd see more defensive stuff for Rocco  he's not a guy you're picking up  button was the better fit I think you'll see Nick slot back in there I like batam as an ad in nine cat Roto he's a tougher at head-to-head because he's going to get games off and he's gonna almost definitely play himself into an injury  Dean Anthony Melton has all the room in the universe to operate right now he had five more three-pointers is he rocket boosts his way up the board after a very slow and painful start belt now up inside the top one 40 little by little we jump but I don't want this to get overshadowed by any of our other analysis but  some news on Kelly oubre dropped  and they're hoping to have him back in the next two to three weeks  which is way faster than any of us expected when both woj and Shams tweeted that he was expected to miss significant time  that's not significant two and a half weeks I mean that's a  that's a medium ankle tweak for a lot of these guys although there was also a news report that came out yesterday saying that he the the info that Uber a gave to officials about where he was involved in the pedestrian hit and run was inaccurate I don't know what the hell turns out from that  as I learned all room I'll relay it to you  but that's weird  hopefully he doesn't have any impact on anything anyway hold on to Kelly oubre because it sounds like he's not gonna be on nearly as long as we expected  unfortunately my Nic Batum love is forcibly tempered a bit by the fact that he may only get two to two and a half weeks of value but I think I'd still probably take it and to no one's surprise Tyrese Maxey finally had an I'm human ball game and he fell to gasp  6th in nine cat he's gonna have an amazing year but some of the stuff he was doing just simply wasn't sustainable a block of game probably not sustainable 30 points per game probably not sustainable that's not to say that you fade Maxi because right now you're not trading him for anything worse than like a top 18 player  and frankly you might just feel better about yourself to ride it out if you got him at 40 or whatever the hell you drafted Tyrese Maxey but either way I'm okay with that and either way we knew he wasn't going to be a top four Five Guys the whole season it just it requires too much  of everything consistently all season long and they're just aren't that many guys that can do that sort of thing  all right move along Nick's beat the Hawks once 1614 good ball game here Josh Hart filled in for RJ Barrett again we still don't really know what the hell Hearts role is going to be punching Grimes as YouTubers can see as we Flash the bubble up on the screen hurt his hand late in the fourth quarter he's questionable the  the Josh Hart good news there is that he probably just slots down and takes Grimes starting spot if RJ Barrett comes back and Quinton is out  well I guess maybe you could see Donte divincenzo slide in there basically all this to say I still don't know if Josh Hart is going to play 30 minutes a game off the bench when the next have a competitive basketball game because we haven't had all of those boxes checked  like in two weeks like one time they had like one competitive game where you was coming off the bench over the last two weeks I think he played 29 or 30 minutes in that game  but I can't reliably point to that one example it's like oh there it was we know he's gonna play 30 minutes no one out of one time that's the ultimate in small sample size theater but if he does he has way better fantasy potential than most the clowns you guys are picking up and dropping off the waiver wire so we have to hold him to see what happens  if annual quickly I mean laser focused on three categories points threes free throw percent that's all he's gonna get you  he is very fun to watch and he's a good basketball player but from a fantasy standpoint he makes way more sense as a build guy for head to head if you need points you need threes if you need free throws Rodeo nine cat he's not really the guy unless Jalen Brunson has to sit again so you know maybe you could hope that that happens at some point  and it will I reckon and when Brunson sits you'll probably want to throw quickly in there because likely he'll get the start in that game and then you know he's getting 28 minutes like you did yesterday and then you know something Good's gonna happen  etc etc Julius Randle finally busted out of his absolutely all inspiring me bad start to the season he'll be fine he's not a guy that I Target but he was obviously a Bi-Lo after that terrible start  for Atlanta broke down both zdanowicz is on a serious heater to start the year he's getting defensive stats he's number 40  he's playing way over his head those one and a half steals are not gonna stick to defensive stats is not gonna stick the other stuff is kind of repeatable  so look at the numbers here and try to figure out do you think Bogdan can maintain not last night he had 28 points in the ball game that lifted him back up a little bit obviously do you think he can average 14-3 and three with two and a half to three three pointers even if the defensive Stats come falling way down I think the answer is sort of like a soft yes and that puts him inside the top one hundred maybe even inside the top 85 so I don't know that I would punt on Bogdan if you can trade him for someone ranked 75 to 85 that's probably the sweet spot and if you can't you probably just stick it out and see what happens  saddiq Bey had a second consecutive better game Off the Bench but that just sort of when he's shooting the ball well so no I'm not doing anything with him DeAndre Hunter needs to remain on your Waiver Wires as long as Trey young is in the mix  these should I drop okongwu questions have resurfaced here again guys  everybody  please  he is right where he was last year  mid-70s in 22 and change minutes per ball game  you are waiting out the inevitable Clint capela injury he'll miss a game he'll probably miss 12 to 15 at some point this year  in those games you're going to get top 40 production out on Google and the rest of the time as you're seeing right now you're going to get between 70 and 100 or 70 and 120 and that's all playable  we move on  or Lando got a game winner from Bunker Hill Alex Caruso says no that shouldn't count out Cruze says he traveled I have to bet I actually didn't watch the play I got too many things going out Jonathan Isaac 17 minutes that's close close  and he didn't sit out the back-to-back by the way  that may be more notable than the 17 minutes  I am about  45% of the way to a Jonathan Isaac pickup I'm not there yet and I don't think anybody's gonna erase you to the waiver wire for him right now because dudes averaging  how many minutes per game  13 but guess what he's better in 13 minutes than a lot of guys are in 24 and if Isaac can get to 20 I'm gonna say it again repeat myself at 1,000 times if you can get to 20 minutes he is an auto add you don't even pause the second frankly if he gets to 10 minutes and a half he's in Auto and nine cat Roto he's a much tougher at head-to-head but if he's actually trying to play back to backs that's a good deal  so think about it he's probably not all that heavily rostered outside of like maybe deeper leaks and stuff like that  had to head you don't need to get out in front of this one rodeo might a little bit  keep a close watch  you're not picking up go get more keep trading off interesting games you are definitely holding onto Jalen Suggs who even in his down ball games which I think you could argue this was a down ball game he's still so damn good on defense I don't know that his shooting is ever gonna get better than 39% he's not a very good shooter  from the field  uh I would argue like well below average actually but he did get up to 42% last year and frankly I would take 42% right now I take it but the free throws have improved for Suggs the playing time is improved that's probably the biggest thing and then the defensive stats are sick 2.7 per game right now  I will not call them stocks  Chicago no DeMar DeRozan he missed this one for personal reasons people are really being mean to Damar  you guys know that he's ranked inside the top 40 right now right like  everybody saying he's having a horrible season I would argue yeah it hasn't been a great start for him because he shooting just 43% from the field and he still inside the top 50 I don't know what you guys thought you were going to get  he's like the safest fantasy play on Earth even if he gets traded he's the safest damn fantasy play  Alex Caruso good to see him back we know if he hits 30 minutes left to miss a week with an injury so he played 24 and a half in this one and he's almost every day right now almost every day the Bull's best player  best that offense no  best the defense yes and just best overall  someone asked for my opinion on Kobe white which hasn't changed  at all  basically forever  every time you think he's turned to corner he hasn't I can pretty much promise you this  he had five points a rebound and assist a steal and a three yesterday on two at 10 shooting with three turnovers  it was one of the worst fantasy lines of the night  he's number one hundred and eighty four and nine category leaks he's not even a build guy like oh what if you need X well what is it exactly that you need he's averaging forests that's basically the only thing he's doing that's well above League average and by well above I mean by like one assist  now it is worth noting if Chicago blows it up Kobe white would benefit like crazy  he had Patrick Williams a basically be Auto ads if tomorrow is Zach LaVine get shipped out of town Alex Caruso would be an ad too but he probably gets shipped out of town next  so that's the only reason that I wouldn't go crazy for kerusso who basically belongs on rosters right now anyway  Kobe white is your I'll stash this guy until the trade deadline play don't do that it'll ruin your team between now and then but B like get the trigger finger ready on that one  because he's the guy in that spot otherwise yuck  that's my thoughts on Kobe white Minnesota I thought they would play a better ball game here they were too tuckered out after the Warriors game with the brawl and the late comeback and all that stuff  I was wrong  I thought they'd have energy they didn't Anthony Edward shot for out of 16 you could tell they were really like two guys on the team that work completely exhausted yesterday and that was cat and sort of Jaden McDaniels because he got tossed early the game before  no no valuation changes on that Minnesota side everybody seems fine they played low minutes because it was a blowout don't read too much into it and then these sons who yes you got really nice games out of Devin Booker and  Kevin Durant I don't know what my brain farted for a second there the  there's still a downer because we were supposed to get the big three together and Bradley Beale was like no you know my back's kind of seller woke up back with sore again it seems like it might be a lingering and kind of annoying thing we have no idea what this team is going to be yet so just keep on waiting  oh well  yeah the Kings beat the Lakers handily Lakers or another team that I don't think is gonna play all that well on a back-to-back  they're a little old  LeBron was actually pretty good on this back-to-back he was a 0 a net zero he's a zero plus minus in a game his team lost by 15  Anthony Davis was the problem  and you guys know I love add but he just had nothing in the tank yesterday he didn't attack anybody at all on offense the three free throws the five turnovers just absolutely brutal game for ad and he's gonna wear it and he should wear it and to me this isn't at all like the opening day game and I don't want to get two sidetracked by Lakers because you guys know I like to talk Lakers this is a fantasy show they're fine like there's just six and six you know their their right in the mix for whatever uh their first game of the year remember add got kind of punked by Nicola yokich  okay great like  yogic is the probably the best player on the planet and he's still 80 still at 17 8 and 4 in that ball game  this one to me is a little bit less acceptable  I and and demonic sabonis is an excellent basketball player I don't want to take anything away from sabonis but he's  like add should be able to go right at him  we are seeing in these two games  that Anthony Davis doesn't really want to attack  these strong Stout centers on the other side  that's a softness that I don't think plays for the Lakers  now the hope is that he wouldn't operate that way in a playoff game but like that's now a little bit of I know again small sample size stuff but it's a little bit of a theme here this regular season  looking at the rest of the Lakers games what are the other ones where the Lakers actually played like a big Stout Center I don't know that there was one you know you can call use of Turkish that he is very slow footed Lakers have gotten clubbed in both games against the Kings although add was much better in the previous one which is you know why that one went to overtime and was a tighter ball game but like  he can't shy away from these games  sabonis had the best fantasy line of the entire evening but the story on the king's side is twofold number one Malik monk only 21 minutes and this was the fear for me I didn't think he was gonna get enough playing time with the Aaron Fox healthy he didn't buy the way you want to know how much the king's wanted this game they played their main guys 39 38 38 and 39 minutes  yeah I think they wanted this one  big rested Vantage too for Sacramento huge rest Advantage here and that played in they played got played their guys big the other story is Kevin heard her who was on a vicious heater right now and you should ride it because his heater as carried him up to number 63 in nine cat  it'll take her off at some point like these not gonna he's not gonna get 16 shots every ball game there will be days where he can Murray gets more but right now herders hot and so he's Trucking also don't read too much into the fact that the Kings had 20 steals last night literally everybody on the damn roster seemed like they got two or more this is just a really ugly game from terms of taking care of the basketball by the Lakers Reeves LeBron and Anthony Davis combined for 15 turnovers  you know it was pretty good for Le cam reddish and D'Angelo Russell and yesterday's ballgame D Lowe played well and reddish played well  delos number 55 by the way in nine category League's reddish is on a pretty good little run right now I still can't possibly tell you guys to pick him up because the Lakers are waiting on Jarred Vanderbilt and he's the kind of guy that would get in and split minutes in a game just like this one  where they'd want to stick Vanderbilt on  you know fox or herder or something like that and those are the guys that reddish is chasing right now  now to cams credit he's played himself into some value in real life with defense with Corner threes with playing passing Lanes  but Vanderbilt and Gabe Vincent are two guys that are going to shave his minutes I would say considerably because they would want Gabe chasing someone like a herder or a fox in a game like this one and it said they had to go to somebody bigger like cam who again good at playing the passing Lane but just as no prayer of keeping up with Fox on a Speed game and the calves blew out the Blazers the final score was within 14 but this game was over a bit sooner than that luckily both teams managed to wedge their starters back in for a little bit at the tail end and he pretty much got what you expected no Darius Garland so Charis Levert had a better ball game got 17 shots off the bench max Drew Scott his dozen shots his line being weighed down by a weird five turnover game but otherwise everything is good there Jared Allen had 11 to 9 with three blocks 29 minutes for Jared Allen still dealing with this sort of weird nebulous minutes cap  I can't make up my mind if I want to buy low on Allen or not because I don't know how long the minutes cap is gonna stick  you probably could do it you could probably get him for like a top  50 60 guy right now and I feel like that's probably worth it what's he ranked at the moment one 12  yeah as minutes aren't there yet maybe you could even get him for a 75 range guy that would be worse while  you've got to kind of know he'll get past that  and then Charisma is a go he was a start even when the team was healthy and he's an easy start when one of the two main offensive cogs is down and then for Skylar maze kind of the only storyline in Portland right now is whether or not you're playing Skyler Maze and this is sort of what I warned you guys about because he doesn't do all that much stuff besides typically get assists so if the assists aren't there there isn't a whole lot to float his numbers I still think you play him 31 minutes out of a starting caliber Point starting caliber a starting point guard is sufficient  and we are bad game from DeAndre Aiden but he was sort of due to have a bad one he's still number 36 don't worry too much I think the the target for him was inside the top 50 and it's still seems like he can probably hang out in that range will see but I'm not too worried after one bad ball game there's a weird disconnect happening right now with shaedon Sharpe though  I had a I sent a tweet out yesterday asking folks who they thought was sort of like this sharpest draft picks in fantasy basketball and a bunch of people said shade and sharp which I looked at I was like oh that's interesting and then I looked closer at his numbers and I thought oh that's actually not that interesting  that's a that's a points League answer because sharp is shooting terribly from the field he's at 40 and a half percent on 15 shots a game that's gonna Crush you Steals and blocks are fine but not spectacular 19 points is good the rebounds at 5.5 is fine the assists are fine the threes are fine but the problem is that he has these things that are kind of sagging him down and actually sharp right now is ranked 142 in nine cat  so technically he hasn't even been a startled player in nine cat rotal leaks  if you're hunting field goal  he is and frankly if you're punting turnovers he's probably a startable guy because that's one of the reasons that he's super low is that he's not doing enough really good stuff to counterweight the three turnovers per game but like  look at these ball games and I'm thinking what are people seeing that I'm not seeing he's not a drop because he's playing so much that you kind of have to just wait and hope that some of this percentage is stuff sorts itself out  but he hasn't been nearly as good as people feel like he's been because there's been a few good scoring games mixed in there and that once again illustrates the goofiness of fantasy basketball and that  somebody scoring will always Cloud your judgment of whether they're good or bad every damn time every damn time  all right that's what happened yesterday next thing on the docket is what's happening today which is a relatively Short Card just two games TNT time we'll go ahead and make the font bigger for everybody watching on YouTube because  there's room on the screen for it but before I do I want to remind everybody to please come hang out with your buddy Dan best briefs over on social media at Dan best price d a n b e s b r i s the free to get some questions into the

out with me over on social at Dan best price  I'm gonna have myself a real good time  yeah I was gonna do queen there but  oh that was a good old fashioned coffee fit again guys I may never get better from this cold um  I remember I had symptoms on Halloween that's 17 days ago  seriously I made from this but we'll do it we'll die talking about fantasy basketball tonight  is Spencer didn't witty gonna be good enough with Ben Simmons out I'm still inclined to say no oh perhaps with both Simmons and cam Thomas out that might be the key here  I have them on exactly zero basketball teams and so I don't really have to worry about it all that much but I do feel like we need to mention it even in passing  the heat is all Tylo Tylo Tyler hero related fill-in information it feels like Duncan Robinson is the answer to that question  Kyle Lowry had a good one a couple of bad ones I met our kids had like three decent ones so consistency  interestingly for the young fella has been pretty good so far but it does feel like it's Dunkin' Robinson because he's gonna be out there and he's gonna be chucking threes and he sort of a big part of what the heat need to do with that slot on the roster which is create spacing for bam and Jimmy Butler and with no Max druce around anymore that kind of has to be Robinson  well no Max Drew said all so Tyler hero hurt for the Thunder my only question is can you get anything for Lou Dort I feel like the answer is no I know he's having a good start to the year but I don't get the feeling that anybody believes it's real even the casuals don't believe this is real he's ranked number 43 off to a really great first three weeks here like an absolute play right now in fantasy while he's getting defensive stats and shooting 49% from the field but we also know these things just aren't Dort  dhorshon  would be I think the  is that the adjective version of it  don't shine would be a much lower field goal percent and far fewer blocks and even far fewer steals I know he's good defensively but the Steelers are almost never there it's like he's taking all of Jalen Williams steel so far this year  can you get a top 90 guy back for him  I feel like you could get a top 90 guy back but everybody's like I can't get anything for lewd maybe it's because you're aiming for like 65 nobody believes he's gonna be 65 but maybe you could go get like  Casey p  which is not at all exciting but from now until the end of the year I'd probably rather have him could you get  Draymond probably not almost too much name value there so I get it this is a hard one to pull off it is there someone that you like that's slumping really hard could you switch them for like Chris Paul or  Jalen Williams or Jared Allen or one of these guys with name power that's in the 115 range  I doubt it  worth a try  at the very least and then the Warriors Draymond suspended five games for his Rudy gobert Chokehold Steph is still out with the knee sprain is that what we're at with this one I think so  the report was that they're hoping to have Steph back pretty soon it feels like he has to miss at least a week with this thing though doesn't it  like rushing him back I get it you know Drake know Steph the Warriors baseball  they've got the Thunder here  two times in a row actually today and Saturday probably gonna lose both of those games then they got the Rockets who were actually kind of decent then the sun's then finally the Spurs next Friday Steph maybe back for that one if Steph is back for something in there there's a chance they could avoid going on a prolonged losing streak but I think they've lost three games in a row right now and it's probably gonna get the four or five with those main dudes out  the questions on Golden State are relatively straightforward one who is the center at is it Kevon Looney or Dario sharp because they might need the offense enough right now to flip it over to charge when Steph is in there they tend to go more defense and rebounding with Looney but no Steph means like what shot did they have if they're going defense at the center spot  clay and Chris Paul and Andrew Wiggins three sir slumps a lot so far this year those guys can't do it charges the only guy in the team making shots right now  so the answer that question is I don't really know those guys may end up splitting minutes and maybe that's not a good enough for anybody and you get kind of the batad save Wagner thing going on the things that I can tell you I know to be true are Chris Paul you got to play see what happens clay you got to play him see what happens and frankly even Andrew Wiggins who was an a deep  deep  deep deep hibernation right now you've got to play him too and he may hurt you more than he helps but he's gonna have to take it at least the Dozen shots with all of these guys out and he's gonna have to play 30 some odd minutes and he's gonna have to get a few rebounds and so you just sort of have to do it and pinch your nose and close your eyes and whatever it is and just hope because this is not what we all want is a little bit of Hope  let's do some questions what do we got what do we got we'll start at the top we'll do I don't know a few questions  thoughts on trading away Michael Porter Jr for James Harden nine cat Roto would you do it yes  would you drop Melton Levert shade and sharp for Jabari Smith maybe shaedon Sharpe  maybe Levert  probably not  I don't think that any of that like mountains playing too well right now so he's a hard no Levert sharp Smith I don't know that any of those guys is gonna make or break your basketball team  Jaelyn Brown and Keegan Murray for Larry Martin  uh yeah that's fair  that's fair you can go you can get a second rounder for those two guys I think I'm good on that  should I sell high on Melton before the efficiency drops down again depends what you get because his overall rank still hasn't caught up after the really really bad first two and half three-ish weeks to the two very good ball games since but you know he has two or three more good ballgames and he gets himself inside the top 80 then yeah you could probably try to move somebody for it although it does kind of feel like now these playing well maybe you just enjoy it between Austin Reeves and Max Drews who do you think has better rest of season value I was thinking offering one of those guys for Jared Allen I think you offer either of those guys for Jared Allen and I think either way you're probably feeling good about your decision  Reef certainly as more versatility than streus his turnovers are going to be worse  I do think the field goal percent probably Trends up for Austin as we've been going here through certainly ranked higher right now  either way I think that's a good decision  greetings from London  what's up dude  Bruce Brown Trey Jones Mike Conley or Jalen sucks  rest of season  it's probably Conley in 9 cat it might be Suggs  in other formats I don't think it's brown or Jones right now  Dan what do you think of trading Mitchell Robinson for Chris Paul or Mike Conley  you know what I think I actually prefer Mitchell Robinson  his field goal percent is still on the way up and we still haven't seen full Mitch Robinson block mode yet like he's at 93 right now in nine cat and I think he gets at least another 15 to 20 slots higher I don't know that CP3 or Conley finishes inside the top 75  and Conley's around there he's 64  but I do think it's field goal percent comes down a little bit and then Chris Paul I think is just outside the top 100  this field goal percent is super low so he probably turns upward a little but I feel like Mitchell Robinson might actually be your best of those three believe it or not for nine cattle at least  damn what should I do with Marcus Smart  I want to trade or drop him in a 14 team or yeah 14 where you got a hold he's hurt right now I know he's not playing all that great Memphis is terrible but  don't drop and you're not gonna get enough for a trade when he's hurt  someone offered Lillard for either cat or Aunt in Roto I actually prefer Lillard in Roto over those two other guys  is Draymond a priority at  yeah I mean if you can squat on a dude for five games that's a that's a definite yes he's a top 100 fantasy place so absolutely  what are your thoughts Dan on Jabari Smith Jr would you trade him away to get scoot Henderson and we've gone over this scoot stuff a bunch of times Jabari Smith Jr is gonna be a lot safer between now and February and I mean that might not still be inside the top 100 scoot is probably going to be horrible between now and about the trade deadline and then you kind of hope that he picks things up  over the entire season Jabari Smith is probably gonna be a higher ranked fantasy play from the last like six seven weeks of the Year scoot has a pretty good shot to pass it  so that's how you grade that one out  Drew holiday has been decent this year besides scoring which was expected to go down he doesn't fit my team build so who would you look to trade him for that boosts points  holiday I think is around 50 right now right yeah he's number 53 Michael Porter Jr should give you a three or four point boost Guys nearby D'Angelo Russell should probably give you a three to four point boost nearby  who else could you get that scores a little bit more  those are probably the easiest ones to get your hands on you might be able to get ogn and Nobby when he comes back he's probably gonna give you about a 3-point boost  I don't know that you could get Jaylen Brown what would that be a much larger points jump I doubt that someone would give you Jalen though you might be able to get to Marta Rosen everybody's freaking out about tomorrow right now but he'll definitely score more than Drew holiday a couple more questions I got things to do today I can't sit on this thing the whole day would you trade Chris Paul to get Jordan Poole  no I don't want pool  what round value should I ask for loury meaning who would you want back for him  Freddie Van Vleet is the question also that's not my suggestion know you can get way more Larry marketing is number 13 if you're trading him away you want someone inside the top 20 and if you're buying him it's gonna take somebody inside the top 20  what are your thoughts on Jeremy Grant for Brooke Lopez I prefer Brooke Lopez but I play nine cat Rodeo if you play a points League you probably want Jeremy Grant but his percentages are very low and there's really no guarantee that they come back up although it does feel like they both Trend up a little bit going forward  Jeremy Grant this year is a whole lot like kelda Johnson and that's just not gonna be enough to get it done I was too high on him because his efficiency stinks  so Brooke Lopez is the answer there  should I drop Cooley oh here comes a cough it should I drop Cooley this damn thing Mark L faults Ben Simmons or Wendell Carter Junior for Kobe white or Derek Lively and a roto League  or Lowry um  you probably want Lively  over  cool right now  you probably just stay put  Jaron Jackson Jr for Evan Mobley and Jalen Johnson  I think I prefer the JJJ side  any chance of Ahmed Thompson having any value by the end of the season short five injuries no I don't think so Houston's winning games right out of the Chute and they goes a lot of guys in front of him in the pecking order  would you give up Mobley tray and Garland for Tatum Ozark Thompson and Malcolm Brogden so Brogden is the throw in so it's basically every Mobley and Trey young and dairy Garland for Jayson Tatum and Oscar Thompson know I think that's a bit of an overpay although it's not as far off as you'd think but it does really upset the balance of your team I think you have to think of it from that standpoint more than anything else points leak should I trade away Jalen Johnson or Terry Rozier to get Jordan Poole nope  I traded gobert and dejounte Murray for Damon Clint capela is a good move  that's fair  I think you might have been able to get more but it is fair  I just traded dejounte Murray and Herb Jones for Jimmy Butler do I am I right to be happy yeah I'm good with that  what do you think of Keegan Murray rest of season top 75 I think he's gonna be pretty good this year  tyus Jones and Gordon Hayward for CJ McCollum  you I mean we don't know how long CJ's gonna be out but if we think he's gonna be back within the month then that's probably fine  and Jesus are so many questions there's no way I'm getting all these guys you get these things in oh here we go Thai food or fa  I'll go fuc on that one  I'll go fuc I like fire I like soups  I like soups  um let's see here let me try I can't I can't jump out of order all right last question guys sorry that's all I got time for Tobias Harris and Yakima portal for DeAndre eight in which side wins it's probably a Harrison portal I think Tobias provided the Sixers don't get a star in the next couple of weeks he may just beaten alone this year so um yeah  nobody I know people don't want to hear it but Tobias Harris is a very good fantasy player again they just need to get hardened out of the way  and that's it that's all I got time for sorry guys um  I know there's a lot of questions in there but I can't do them all we're at almost an hour here I need
