welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I know it's Christmas Eve I know it's the middle of the day I know all of you are watching football or spending time with family  and on a day with no basketball games the NBA is the furthest thing from your mind but because of scheduling because of the way that Christmas day is scheduled for the NBA we got to do tomorrow's content today so in advance Merry Christmas everyone happy holidays tomorrow five games that started at 9 a.m. Pacific time there are certainly parts of the US that will have plenty of time to set their lineups when they wake up in the morning but there are also plenty of spots here Pacific time specifically white time where you basically got a set your lineups the night before special if you're in a weekly lock League where that 9 a.m. buzzer is the buzzer for the whole damn week  you know and plus with no games today this is a perfect opportunity to go over the 30 Games is incorrect the teams that all played on Friday and Saturday get everybody kind of reset for the week ahead and take a look at some of our streaming ideas in a week where teams that play tomorrow do have a little bit of an unfair Edge and by tomorrow I mean Christmas day Monday morning  there are only I believe  four maybe five teams  that have four games that don't play on Christmas  there are three more that have four games that do  so next week is a very three game Heavy week most of the NBA has three games the Clippers are the team with two  and so what I want to do here is  actually talk about the week ahead before we go back and review the 30 teams that have already passed us by I know that this sort of seems  backwards to some degree but I actually don't think that that's the case I think that doing it in this order makes a lot of sense because you can now kind of get a jump on things because I mean you know things happen over the weekend obviously but in terms of planning this is the way to get a look at stuff this is the way to begin to attack this week now  what you may recall those of you that are watching the show with us last week I threw up basically just like a small chunk of what we call our streaming chart over at sports ethos  and I'm going to do that again  first things first I am Dan Vespers welcome to Fantasy NBA today this is a combination weekend review show and week ahead show for week 10 please find me on social media at Dan Vespers rate like review all that good stuff on the podcast  Sports ethos.com is the website ethos fantasy BK is where you can go to get your news over on social media and of course finding us in Discord is easy the link is right in the show description  here is the image  for those that are watching the show for those that are listening obviously I'm going to describe everything that that we're all looking at so you guys get a pretty good view of it as well this is a streaming chart and I've done some color coding myself it doesn't come that way you can kind of flex that however you like my color coding illustrates all the back-to-backs and then teams that have what I deemed to be better long streaming opportunity so I sort of color the tail or the the body at some points of the long stream in like a beige a light yellow to illustrate the back to back and then a very light green to illustrate where you could actually just play these guys if you wanted to go for six days so this is what's coming up for the week ahead and I'll just do it alphabetically since that's the way that we've got things organized this by the way is available to everybody with a fantasy pass at sports ethos.com then you can see the whole season all the way through instead of just this very small section which you're getting for free here on this podcast fantasy past starts at 599 a month over at sports ethos.com  the first thing that you guys might notice if you're watching along with us is that Brooklyn is shaded in those two colors I just mentioned they have a back-to-back Tuesday Wednesday and then they play Friday and Sunday and again we have to remember that some of these days are  gonna say full overload but certainly close to it Tuesday is 9 Wednesdays only six there's eight Friday as I think 10 Saturday 6 and then next Sunday 6 so there isn't like a true overload day the way that this last Saturday was yesterday the closest ones are Tuesday because if you ended up not with many guys that play on Christmas you might end up having a lot of guys in the nine games on Tuesday and then Friday is a 10 gamer so you might have some overloads but there isn't anything that's a sure overload date it isn't you don't have a 12 or a 13 or a 14 in there where you're like well there's just no point this day doesn't even really count because everybody's got a full roster going there aren't days like that  in my opinion Friday with 10 games might even be slightly less likely to be overload I know the more games but like just depends on kind of where you have your players clustered  so what that means for our purposes is that every day has equal value this week with the exception of Monday on a super low traffic Christmas Day and at the start of the week actually has greater value  and I know I mentioned there were some days that had six games Saturday has six I think I said Sunday all so has six Wednesday has six those are low tide days so these are all really important ones but the reason I like Monday the most is that you can actually move make moves right now  you can make moves today because they're no games happening so you're not constrained by which of your guys are in an act of lineup which ones may have already played in IELTS all that kind of stuff if you have any moves left over from this last week that ended early a week that effectively ended on Friday because pretty much everybody played on Saturday so you didn't need to make any moves probably on Saturday so you got to Cluster your moves this last week basically Monday through Friday even for those that are streaming hard and I was I still ended up with a move left over for today  so I made a move for tomorrow already  and I think that's a really smart thing to do so to that end we can take a peek at some of the teams that might make a lot of sense for tomorrow first of all Boston let's just talk about the teams that even play on Monday let's start their Christmas games Milwaukee is in New York that's the early game that's a noon start Eastern Time 9 a.m. Pacific and then they games happen every two and a half  basically there's one game that has a three-hour Gap basically every two and a half hours the rest of the day starting at noon eastern Time or 9 a.m. Pacific the second game is Warriors nuggets that's up in the mountains Boston is in La they've been in La for a few days they played the Clippers and they smashed him yesterday they'll take on the Lakers Philly is without Joel embiid they'll be in Miami so Paul Reed hello how do you do that game is the early evening game and then the late evening game is Dallas in Phoenix where hopefully we'll have as many stars available as possible Luca obviously seems like he's good seems like Durant and and Booker should be fine and then whatever other streaming stuff we sort of float around there so those are the five games are happening tomorrow third of the NBA's playing it's not a very it's not a hype or small day but again because we have this weird little  Gap in the schedule today immediately preceded by a full schedule you probably have a move to use so use it for tomorrow now that again takes us to our next point which is what do you do for tomorrow Boston if you're going to go there Direction probably looking at guys you could just hold the whole week because they're off for two days after their game on Christmas Day  off the 26th and 27th and they go then they go three times in four days to finish off the week so it's not a great schedule at the start but it's a four game week and as we just mentioned what did I say eight nine teams go for games so if you can get players on those clubs you get a pretty good Advantage because by and large opponents are you your team too you're probably gonna have more three gamers than four next week probably I know odds are  Dallas we're gonna go through the teams that are playing tomorrow alphabetically they have a really good schedule they're at Phoenix then they got Cleveland without Evan Mobley so defensively the Cavs are not as good in Minnesota that'll be a tougher game to score and then they're in Golden State on Saturday which allows you to then make a move on Sunday if you wanted to sort of shore up your week as we said six games on Sunday so there are options to go on that one and we'll get to what some of those are in just a little bit also interesting uh we're going chronic we're going alphabetically here so I want to make mention of Memphis there another team like we talked about with up at the top of the board Brooklyn's another one we'll loop back around to those guys in just a second the next are another good one they go four games in six days sorry I'm having trouble speaking to start the week as does Philadelphia four games and six days to start the week you could also pivot partway through to one of these other teams we're going to mention in a moment but these are all Clubs Dallas New York Philadelphia that have four games in six days to begin the week if you're looking at streaming Christmas Day those are the teams that you want to look at because you can hold them if you like the players involved you could potentially hold them all the all the way through to Saturday  if you don't want to make a bunch of long streaming moves for Christmas Day  you have a couple of other directions you could go like let's say you want to go Boston  but they only have three games for us the week and there's two days off in there and maybe you're only streaming one roster slot so you don't have this intense need to hold somebody for six days  you could pivot off of them and the other teams that I was mentioning were Brooklyn I think I said Memphis is we were floating through a minute ago Oklahoma City and Orlando by the way the Thunder are going to have a good schedule like almost every week the rest of the way because they're behind a bunch of teams in total games played but again that's Memphis Oklahoma City or Lando Brooklyn we mentioned earlier on and then the Washington Wizards these teams have four games in six days starting on Tuesday  most of those teams actually all of them I should I guess I should clarify Brooklyn not other than Memphis  Brooklyn Oklahoma City or Lando and Washington they go back to back Tuesday Wednesday and then they also play Friday Sunday so that's a team you could lean into starting on Tuesday  and then Memphis was another one that I mentioned on Tuesday all they also are better starting on Thursday because Memphis actually goes Tuesday Thursday Friday Sunday they have their back-to-back kind of in the middle of the week  so those are the teams you're looking at if you're planting on holding somebody for longer than just a back-to-back if you're looking towards later in the week we already mentioned Boston they go three games the final four days of the week Memphis three games of final four days the Lakers three games the final four days of the week San Antonio is the other one in that department but again that's not usually where I'm looking here like  I don't see  unless you really hated the streamer you had to start the week like let's say you had a Dallas streamer and you let them go Monday and Wednesday but Dallas is playing on Thursday it's a little bit stupid to drop a guy who's playing on a day for a different guy who's also playing on that same day that's a waste of a roster move I don't even care if you're getting an extra gameplay later in the week like if you dropped a Dallas player on Thursday for a Boston player on Thursday yes you're gaining a game Thursday through Sunday but you're not gaining that game until Sunday  or technically there's a back-to-back but then Boston's off on Saturday and Dallas plays on Friday  that to me is is a silly move  you're making a move three days or then you need to what if you end up needing to make a drop later in the week one of your streamers that you plan on holding for two or three days got hurt you got to get off those guys and not take a 0  every move you make  when you're streaming should be with the end game of adding one to two games  either the rest of the week  or over the link of the long stream that you're planting on a holding that guy  so Brooklyn for instance they're really interesting test case and I can highlight it on the screen for folks watching on YouTube but I'll just describe it starting on Tuesday of next next this coming week I'm really having trouble talking today starting on Tuesday of this coming week they actually go six times through the following Wednesday so that's game game off game off game off game game  six games nine days  five and seven is the best thing you're gonna get in the NBA so you can hold the guy for a whole week and get five games out of it six and nine is basically the second best thing you're gonna get  that's the same ratio as 4 and 6 you don't have to use a roster for another three days  so that's the second best one  obviously a back-to-back is the highest percentage and three and four is the next highest but you're stuck using a lot of roster moves if you're gonna make a move every two days or every four days if you can hold somebody for five six or nine now you're suddenly able to stream two or even three roster slots on a club and you can really power up the number of games played you've gotten a given week  in terms of teams to avoid this week the only logical one is the clippers but they've had a really light schedule they a Boston way back on yesterday I say way back Saturday off for two days Charlotte offer two days Memphis off for two days this is an opportunity for the Clippers to try to get their guys a little bit of rest on top of everything else she's in Hawaii Leonard's dealing with a little bit of a hip injury he's missed his first two games of the year the thought was probably now like if he's not 100% I don't think they're playing it again Charlotte a team they feel pretty confident they can smoke without all of their best guys Memphis is certainly a lot better with John Moran back but like you might not see a clipper  you might not see why back until that Memphis game maybe even Miami this is not great opportunity for them to give them like almost two weeks off and Miss only four games  this is what teams are looking for you can say always actually injured  whether or not he is we don't know but we're gonna assume he is  as far as like fringy guys we'll get to that in a second we'll do kind of the weekly lineup decisions but then basically everybody else is three other than the like you know a little bit under a third of the league that's playing four games that's why streaming is important it's a really big week for streaming when they're that many teams that have three games because it's really easy to turn three into four this week and if you long stream effectively especially if you use a move to day or even two moves if you have them today pick up somebody that is on one of the three teams we say Dallas New York and Philadelphia that go Monday Wednesday Friday Saturday you got four games the first six days of the week you could use another move for each of those streamers on Sunday and maximize and you're getting like an extra two games you know with a five game week in each of those slots instead of three right so let's talk about some of the weekly decisions now at this point which of the guys that are game time decision and this will be a little bit tougher again because we're doing it the day before they will I'm sure be  updates in the morning very early in the morning  and so if you get those  you'll make your adjustments however you need to  but let's just start at the top and we'll go through some of the names of relevance here I want to see if I can actually get that on the screen for you guys we'll bring up I'm gonna bring up a Yahoo page it's gonna have some of the various team names this is one of my  one of my Yahoo free League's that I'm in so  you know don't tell everybody I guess here's the player board for those that are watching  we'll just go through some of the guys that have injured tags on their names so Joel embiid is an interesting one because he just got ruled out and it's just sort of like they're talking about maintenance stuff for him it's ankle leg  I truly I don't  I don't know what the severity is I think the Shams tweets said something like oh yeah he's getting treatment every day and they don't know what is what his deal is for their next game on Wednesday  I gotta hope you're getting two games out of him being this coming week and so to that and I think you have to start him because he's basically the best player in fantasy sports I know Shea is ranked higher and he deserves to be but obviously a lot of Shay's value is tied up in the fact that he's like a full head and shoulders above anybody else in steals there is anybody close  she has something like 86 Steals on the season and then the next highest is I think  Matisse diebel who has like 60 something he's legitimately like a third ahead of any other player in the entire NBA  and so his value in that particular category is so high that the other stuff he's doing he didn't even really matter all that I mean obviously it's really good but like right now Joel and beat is doing more good things more separated good things and she is been  vastly Superior at a couple of stuff so I mean those guys are like you know one in one B at this point and then there's a pretty good drop off behind them but all that to say this is a bead we're talking about you kind of have to  Kawhi Leonard is in a two-game week and that's if he played them both so I hate to say it but you kind of probably have to bench him  you know the latest on Kauai  the latest on Kauai is a little bit unclear you know the fact that he's now up to number five by the way at nine cat is pretty awesome  it's just a hip thing we haven't really heard anything good or bad about it I you know I again he's so good that you like I've got to get him out there but if this dude ends up playing in one ball game and you could have flipped him out for somebody who's playing four you I mean you can pick up like a top one 60 guy playing for games that can outperform a first rounder and one  it's pretty easy to find somebody averaging I mean think about this Kawaii is it 24.5 points six boards three and a half assists this part of the how you do the calculations on these things  can you find somebody on the wire whose averaging six and change points one and change rebounds less than one assist  and like 0.4 Steals and barely any blocks of course you can that's like every Fringe player in the NBA  and this is if Kauai misses just one of their two games what if they decide to give them the whole week off because the competition's not that tough Clippers have played well so far this year you know they've taken a couple of losses here but playoff seeding wise I don't think they're all that worried especially when they're healthy they've been collaborating teams  this is just not a guy they're gonna rush back  Donovan Mitchell is an interesting one he's been dealing with this illness for three ball games I think it's this respiratory thing that everybody the NBA's getting and some guys are getting worse than others and then the ones that get it the way like you guys remember me I was sick for the entire month of November  these guys are going to get better treatment than I do they're going to sit and you know they'll be on a freaking ventilator all day to get the cough to go away I can't do that I get a Chase around booger nose kids all day and all night so I'm just gonna keep getting sicker and sicker so yeah obviously they'll get better but if you're wondering like why is he missed a week  I couldn't do crap for like four weeks  all that said  you know the Cavaliers are oh you know what there are two game are also did I jump right over that I did my apologies people Cavaliers are all so two-game week  now Donovan Mitchell's off for three days after their game in Chicago  oh that's a tough call man that's a real tough call  yes I think he's probably back by Wednesday  hmm  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you

that's drizly.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  Nish  tough one  I'm going to go ahead and hope the Donovan Mitchell's back and I'll start him  Kyrie Irving know Victor weapon Yama probably yes  believe he turned an ankle  before the ball game he had like a collision with a ball boy or something like that San Antonio is not a two-game week I don't know how I missed the Cleveland ones sorry guys San Antonio's a four game week so even if he misses one or even two you're still in excellent shape their  Kristofferson gets sat out the last one that seemed to be precautionary although the left ankle sprain not just a back-to-back thing so I guess we don't know but like we mentioned Boston they got a game tomorrow which he might miss but then they're offer a few more days and they got three and four to end the week he's been sitting on half of a back-to-back so if he misses Christmas day it's probably a two game week for Singas that makes him a really hard call but I'm gonna say yes I think we get two games out of him and that will be enough  at  so nebulous holy moly the wolves  you got ruled out with left knee soreness we saw him kind of come down funny or walk a little gingerly at the end of the win over the Lakers  honest goodness this might be one where I really don't know they're off Christmas day then they've got three games the rest of the week they're in Oklahoma City I know they're gonna want to win that game then Dallas they got the Lakers again  but we don't know we got we got no info on cat almost of any kind just left me soreness rule out  ruled out a day ahead I think as well so I'm gonna think you're getting two games out of him would be my guess I probably  sit him and you guys might kill me for that but that's the direction I'm leaning on cat  Jana is to go he's probable Terry Rozier missed the last ball game with knee soreness and Charlotte three or four games this week  Charlotte's three games including a back-to-back oh that's a tough one too  missed Saturday's game he was a very late add  um I think I'm gonna play Rosier and hope that he gives me two this week because he's been just barely good enough but it's more of a dice roll than I usually do lamelo know Evan Mobley know  Jimmy Butler is questionable for the Heat and Miami is a three gamer with one of them on Christmas Day  you might be able to get a better rule on him tomorrow morning hopefully although that's kind of a midday game I think I'm gonna start Jimmy Butler I think the question will tag for Monday is good news for Thursday and Saturday so I'm guessing you get at least two out of Jimmy  but I guess I don't know for sure  sounds like Jalen Johnson might be back this week but if you're in a weekly format I don't I don't think that you can take that shot  probably wait until he's actually back and I'm sure they'll work him in over a game or two Mark Williams you got a bench him until we hear anything good about him Jalen Suggs is more like day-to-day with the wrist thing but he hasn't been playing all that well probably because of the wrist thing anyway so I would probably sit Jalen in a weekly format now you're getting to the point where if somebody's even a tiny bit hurt you got to keep him out Yusef nurkic maybe being like the lone exception to that because Phoenix has a four game week he's still out with personal stuff we don't know exactly when he's coming back you could probably play him and hope you get three games but it's a little bit of a dice roll Derek Lively know Zach LaVine know Darius Garland know  and then kcp I honest to God I didn't even know kcp was dealing with anything at all what's his latest deal  always probable that's nothing that's nothing tag he's number 95 and again now we're at this point where it's like look if somebody's questionable you're not playing them  so you get outside the top 100 you got just a handful of guys that might deserve your attention but Jalen Duren until he comes back I don't see how you play him  Kyle kuzma sounds like he wants to go in their next game on Tuesday so he's probably a goal although now folks he's falling near the 120 Zone how many times did I have to warn everybody but look if you're playing kuzma it's because you don't mind the percentages and the low defensive stats so like he's a guy that's been part of your team to this point and he's a guy you Just Gonna Keep On Truckin out there and then nobody else is really worth talking about I don't think on the weekly side  okay that was the Yahoo recap where 20 some odd minutes in and we're just finally getting to the weekend review part of the show let's do that now with a quick reminder while we're pulling up some of these weekend stats to please take a

again promo code there being  ethos 20  you know it just use it  is it true that if you don't use it you lose it  let's go through Saturday that was obviously a big card and was at 13 games on Saturday most of the teams the NBA played on that one  Milwaukee beat New York that was the early game Bobby Portis is very much in the Stream while warm situation right now and he's been on a little bit of a heater finally a bad game out of Brooke Lopez I say finally not like that I wanted to happen because you guys know I love Brooke Lopez I just sort of like a bit overdue he falls to number 29 so sad so sad Malik Beasley got dropped in a bunch of places I think because he was sick and then he had a couple of bad ball game that was kind of dumb I picked him up in those places and he's been pretty solidly useful all season long to this point Chris Middleton is  not a huge headache right now so I guess that's something  on the New York side Jalen Brunson keeps Trucking along Isaiah heart and shine he's got all kinds of wiggle room now Dante even shenzo had one good game and then he kind of came back to Earth such as the story for these fringy guys on the next you can play them and schedule spots which I mentioned there is one this week those types make sense in those but not for Roto  we're gonna move pretty quick on this guys Boston blew out the Clippers with ball game was over early but you know if you Celtics got theirs beforehand Drew holiday has been coming on lately you know it didn't hurt his cause that for Singas is missed a couple of ball games but Drew's now up to number 65 when he was down in the 80s and 90s pretty pretty easy by load just a guy you do was gonna do a little bit more as the season moves along Derek white continues to be amazing Al Horford just a fantastic fill in when porting his out nice little across the board type of stuff for him and I don't care about anything else going on there no Kauai for the Clippers and they look kind of human Paul George had a pretty good ball game zubats had his very like empty double-double James Harden slowed down a little which you kind of knew what happened as well but these guys will all be fine the only thing that I thought jumped out on the Clippers side was typically  when Paul George or Kawaii letter is out Norman Powell picks up the slack but he did not in this ball game I think he probably will in the next one but that matters we mentioned Alpine getting called out by his coach for sucking on defense a couple games back and he's come roaring back for the Rockets  we got Tara Eason back in the mix I know he wasn't as great in this ballgame but he's an easy hold very simple hold decision Jabari Smith Jr another good ball game not much to take away from this one other than just kind of seeing a nice bounce back from Shen couple of good ones after the coaches like yeah you're not gonna play if you don't actually do the defensive stuff we tell you to do and he said okay got it  eliminated the slippage there  herb Jones you're running out of time but only 18 minutes in this ball game wasn't like it was foul trouble they just you know they like Trey Murphy Moore  herb is a better Defender but Trey is a vastly superior offensive player  and they need someone that can space the floor because the whole rest of the team hit five three-pointers in this game herb Jones by the way hit two of those  Trey Murphy three of the teams eight total three balls it's just not a good spacing team I like the Pelicans they're decent but they have no spacing that's why I trade Murphy is getting the run and why herb Jones isn't right now I told you I would let her have another week week and a half we're almost a week into it and he's running at a time he's falling like a an absolute Boulder right now down into the mid-60s like every game he's fallen 7/8 slots  that's tough to handle  I still think CJ McCollum is a pretty big sell high if you can do it but I don't know how many people are gonna buy on  CJ being a top 20 dude  that well see what you could get if it's like top 40 50 or better I think I would do it  Denver decided to play this game with sort of one eye slightly half open I mean it just no reason why the nuggets should have shot 43% against the Hornets but not matter here we are no notes on Denver not many notes on the Charlotte side either Nick Richards continues to be a solid fill in for Mark Williams Brandon Miller got hurt in this game turned in ankle when he went down PJ Washington tends to be the next guy to get stuff and it happened again here PJ took 20 shots which is stupid because he made six of them if Gordon Hayward had even half an NBA brain left in that head of his he'd been the one taking more shots he's still more efficient than these other dudes but he didn't because he's getting old and he's slow I think hayward's a drop in a lot of formats I get it you know again  if you don't have any issues with this turnovers free throw percent is typically low defensive stats so they're better in this one okay fine like  but nine cat he hasn't been very good frankly since the start of the year he's had some like one game or one week blips that have been better  team obviously needs lamelo ball back and certainly Terry Rozier would have helped this game as well but with those guys out they were just shots for days for the rest of these dudes  so PJ Washington needs to go when you got it this many guys out  if Brandon Miller misses the next one then PJ kind of goes from like a 50/50 play to a yes Heyward probably becomes a yes if Brandon Miller misses the next ball game but otherwise I I'm kind of moving out on the Hayward thing entirely much like I was last year  he was terrible  let's keep moving  Orlando beat India Franz Wagner solid ball game Paolo had 34 but again makes a lot more sense in the points League side set it before I'll say it again I don't think one doll Carter Jr is a is anywhere close to a 12 team 9 category guy getting out played by moving or getting out played sometimes not this one by Golda Todd say they just like these three centers there all staking claims to settlement it's and that means none of them is any good for Fantasy at least  not picking up Derek Gary Harrison Roto you know if you get into Orlando good scheduling spot that would work Jalen Suggs being out played a pretty good sized role there  as far as Indie goes Andrew hard got the start at shooting guard in this ball game and put up a decent line 17 and 5 he's not usually gonna be this efficient you know so it doesn't get any defensive stats which makes it kind of hard guy to play every day  Bruce Brown was all so out for this game  I know he had a terrible ball game but Aaron neesmith is actually the guy that I'd be looking at most of the time seems like Rick Carlile feels pretty comfortable giving him about 27 to 30 minutes at night and he had a number of good ball games in a row that had pushed him actually inside the top 100 on the season believe it or not  So Nice Smith I think you can hold  I think he was an ad and I think he's now a whole  no other real surprise is here  Jordan Clarkson came back for Utah scored 30 points it won't be this good he is a lot like Kim Thomas in that when he has a big ball game you try to sell when he was a bad ball game you could consider a buy although camus's better for Fantasy by and large but this is a cell moment for Clarkson if you waited through his injury Walker Kessler Off the Bench in this one for reasons I don't completely understand but you still had 10 8 and 2 blocks I don't think he's just gonna get better as the season goes Colin Sexton is going to fade now with Clarkson back I don't know that Clarkson necessarily going to start over him but Sexton is kind of a one trick pony and so again if you start take away any of that trick then these just a pony and which I know sounds fun for like a fourth birthday party but doesn't work for Fantasy Kelly Olynyk only 17 minutes typically if he's starting you can start him Chris Dunn still starting and if yante George and tht are both out for Utah's next ball game I would start the crap out of Chris done again  love that dude's Fantasy game I just wish that there was any kind of consistency to his role  right now there is but every other point guard has to be hurt apparently for us to get there  so keep an eye on status for mostly for Chris Dunn more than anything else but also you know do we see a Colin Sexton flip back to the bench at some point here Utah trying some stuff out we shall see definitely a team worth monitoring the Utah Jazz because Chris Dunn is great for Fantasy Walker Kessler's great for Fantasy John Collins can be decent when he's out there long enough but he wasn't really in this one Collins sex is less awesome for Fantasy but when he plays giant minutes then it's good enough no notes on Toronto yakkas bouncing between terrible games and good ones he just got to sit through it at this point  OG and Adobe was better thank goodness for that but let's keep moving  Jayden Ivy and Isaiah Stewart had big games for Detroit and  who cares  team sucks  let's see boy and Bug zdanowicz yeah Cade Cunningham yeah I'll start Thompson at least got 31 minutes here but he's gassed all that stuff he was doing at the beginning of the year that energy is out the air out of the balloon I still like him long-term  Detroit finally went to Stuart at the five when they didn't have to Marvin Bagley to the bench Stuart the five is interesting I'll give him that but the reason he had a big fan of fantasy game here is because he shot at a nine from the field  and started the same story with Jayden Ivy you made eight out of 10 free throws in six out of 11 shots usually he's a guy that tanks you in both percentages and turn off overseas and he didn't hear and everybody's like Dan why are you diving in on Jaden ivy immediately I'm like well because we've seen this a bunch of times in only a year and change with him he doesn't have nine cat Fantasy game percentages hurt turnovers High a sister actually not usually that overwhelmingly good but they don't go on these little mini runs like he's been on I would argue the last two maybe three ball games where the scoring is better because the shooting is better he's hitting three-pointers yes five three-pointers in his last two ball games he had three in his previous eight games  he has 14 assists in his last two ball games it took him five games to get there before that  and he's more like three turnovers a night  Steals and blocks are okay but not you know massive for him  and therein lies the rub if you're in a points League I think you pick up and hold on to Ivy but for 9 cat he's just not a guy that sticks long term  that's okay you can be a points League guy  I believe I have no notes on Brooklyn Camp Thomas is currently in one of his more Selene spots that by E spots  nice to see Michelle Bridges finally get something going a game against Detroit is usually good for what else yeah  let's keep going Memphis jaw and Bain Mondo games JJJ slow down a little bit in this one but again now that now that those three dudes have each other  it just everybody slides into the role that they belong  and playing Atlanta also helps  but again like you don't have to go any farther than those three guys  unless you're stashing Marcus Smart who might very well be back for emphasis next ball game I think he'll probably be on some kind of minutes restrictions so don't expect the moon but I do think it's worth exploring to see how what Marcus Smart's role looks like when this is all said and done they're probably gonna have to play small they're probably gonna have to run Bane at small forward or smart as just a very short but extremely powerful small forward  and when they play longer teams they'll probably have to rotate guys a little bit differently  nothing I got no notes on Atlanta not one  this is a neat team because they have six guys with fantasy value that's cool thing fun little claim to fame  Cleveland still without all of their horses managed to find a way to win on the road in Chicago mostly because they defend Jared Allen big game 19 and 17 in this one when he can have a game without foul trouble good things happen  Max Drew's finally woke up still took him a lot of shots to get there but 26 points 7 assists five threes two steals in a block  Craig Porter Jr has been filling in relatively well for Donovan Mitchell you could probably stream him if you think Mitchell's gonna miss another game with the illness I just don't know about that Dean Wade Isaac a coral that's guys are more scheduling plays but they've got the longer shelf life because they're in there basically for  Garland and for Mobley because when Donovan Mitchell comes back they won't need Craig Porter to run point now mostly be Donovan  we're seeing Kobe white slowing down a little bit the popcorn numbers are still there with 17 points and seven assists but he's down no outside the top 100 over the last week  and honestly you knew the three-point and feel gold per cent couldn't keep up forever he was on a crazy run but he'll be fine as long as Zach LaVine remains out right now I think I'm comfortable starting to starters for Chicago  White Patrick Williams Alex Russo DeMar DeRozan and Nicola Beach  they're all fine in my eyes  by the way for ends tomorrow is up to number 54 vooch is at 57 slowly they rise you're not even gonna really notice it's happening  tomorrow's free throw percent is up to 83 field goal of 45.5 every little bit those numbers claw up the board he jumps 10 slots  he was 65 last week now he's 54 does it again you'll be into the 40s  that's why I had tomorrow as a Buy Low it wasn't going to be this massive massive turnaround but he was like 20 slots below where you should have been  Lakers got a big shooting game beat Oklahoma City on the road LeBron is a freaking cyborg I cannot I mean  so I don't fade LeBron Dan you stupid idiot  usage is down  didn't matter he's taking five fewer shots a game this year  and he's 20 slots higher  because he's shooting 54% making 2.33 is a game and he's at 2.2 defensive stats again  sunbelievable LeBron James is the first rounder and he's 39  well he's about to be 39 you're my dog barking in the background yeah yeah everybody's home get used to it I honestly I just I can't even believe what LeBron's doing right now the big news in Laker town is that D'Angelo Russell got moved to the bench and only played 17 minutes he was quite efficient in his 17 minutes so that was good but this may be unfortunate a little bit of a death blow to him  uh Lakers new starting five is super weird I don't know why this is the assortment of guys they picked  and it didn't last very long because you got more rui hachimura as the game went on he scored 21 points that's not a sustainable number but if what the Lakers are trying to do here is get bigger that could be a thing that helps you more in the long run  no I'm not picking up really in Roto I do still think Tori and prince who had some foul issues in this game I do think Tori and Prince is still worth playing and most formats because he's usually getting big minutes in a bunch of three-pointers so you can go LeBron you go add obviously Austin Reeves and right now I would bench Duo I'm not dropping him because this you know these lineups are going to change I think again I like Lakers won this ball game but it wasn't because of the starting five it was because LeBron was insane it's because really played really well and add was good if you get good games out of your Superstars and you get a good game out of hachimura you probably gonna win it okay see is sort of a zero surprises Place Jalen Williams always plays well against the Lakers still not getting as many steals as you'd want can't understand that one  she is a monster uh Chet played well Chet played well 19 and 10 with a steal and three blocks against Anthony Davis that's pretty well  like I know he didn't dominate the way he has been and he missed some free throws you know the percentages were worse  but that's the magic vanity Davis you're just you're not gonna have your best games of the year against add unless you're young age  because he's like 50 pounds more  you got to be able to move add if you're gonna beat him and she ain't that strong yet  Warriors blew out the Blazers or yours this peanut and it's so funny to hear Steve Kerr come out after the Ballgame and say like yeah yeah like  I know my young guys are better than my old guys but I had to make I had to make improve it you know what that actually meant  I can I can tell you what the the translation of that Steve Kerr line was I needed everybody in the world to see how much my old dude sucked so that way when I benched him nobody gave me a hard time about it  right because the discussion right now is Steve what took you so long to do the smart thing  that's a lot easier of a discussion for him to handle than beginning of the year bench the old guys and lose the team  but between Draymond being suspended and Wiggins being terrible there's been this opening for the Warriors to play branded pajami who's a fantastic play right now I don't know if it's gonna stick all season because guys will eventually come back but he's terrific right now so pegs gotta be gone Klay Thompson's woke up so that's good he's rolling now Jonathan kaminga when he doesn't miss his free throws he's playable in most formats but that's only like half of the time so I like it more as a head-to-head play trayce Jackson Davis is sort of the hot name in Warriors town but you only got 17 minutes in this one he's doing a lot with his time on the floor I do still think he needs to be on rosters to sort of see how this  Draymond lists run shakes out this game was a blowout so minutes were kind of screwy not  hugely screwy just sort of a little bit so keep hold on Jackson Davis for now come mingi again he's not a guy I'm playing in road opensky is the one that all right is the easiest call on that side outside of the usuals and then for Portland Malcolm Brogden is a play as long as shading sharp is out Simon's he's just like this three-point numbers are crazy right now every time is hitting a lot a lot of three-pointers but it is also worth noting he doesn't do all that much else and that's why despite another 7 3 pointer game for him he's outside the top 30 I mean still good  and we haven't even really see the bottom come out at all like there's gonna be a cold spell in here so I think if you can sell Simons for Top 40  50 maybe even you do it anything lower than that you probably hang on and see if he can boost his own value  sharp being out  maybe allows you to sell him for 100 range guy it's almost better when people are not seeing what his numbers look like when the teams healthy  and then once he gets healthy  I don't actually know what's gonna happen to Brockton I'm a little worried that he does then fall off a cliff but you know we'll take it as it happens  when banana sat out this last ball game so Zach Collins got the start and Dot a lot of good stuff but and then Collins I mean this is three good games in a row he had one good one in there well when he was actually playing so he bought himself some more time I'll give him that I was basically ready to drop him and then when he got hurt and I don't need to drop him yet anybody himself a little more time  what does that mean by the end of this week he might be off my roster by the end of this week the Bali was getting you know 17 minutes behind wembanyama he just that's just not enough time  and that's the only player really to note on this Spurs Club because  I've mentioned it before anytime Devin masal has a big ball game I try to sell anytime Kelvin Johnson has a big ball game I try to sell anytime Jeremy Sohan has a big ball game I try to sell nope Theo I'm sorry you can't come on this video my child is pantsless and he's trying to come on the video  well that was fun wasn't it I had a child who was completely naked trying to get on a YouTube video want to get our accounts suspended that's the way to do it try to remember to edit that out on the actual audio side of things so you'll just hear me and then the very quick blip over to the other half of that anyway you guys know I'm feeling on the Spurs I know Kelvin Johnson's been better than expected all year but guess what he's now down to number 98 because we it was coming  we knew it was coming I didn't know when but sells number 113 Zach Collins is outside the top 100 hold a teams outside the top 100 except for Victor one banana  Dallas well Luca was back so you know Luca versus the universe and that's usually good for him as long as he doesn't tire out that's good Tim Hardaway Jr I think is a play while Kyrie Irving is out and then everybody else is a little bit iffy and I know you're like Dan not to exam how are you not getting more excited about this because I've never seen anyone who's more Prime for a shooting drop off in my life then Dante Exum who's shooting like 70% from three-point land over the last two weeks  that is not going to stick  he's at 71% from the field over the last two weeks 17 points for boards three assists a steal and two three-pointers when that 70% from the field comes down to Something in the 40s like a normal person his scoring is going to drop by 25% which is like a Solid 4 and some odd points the threes are going to drop by 25% or more I don't know that the playing time is gonna stick maybe it does but he goes from a 50 range guy to probably more like 100% again  I don't know  I gotta go back and find out if my kid actually made it to the screen I think I was able to keep him off of the camera there  and Derek Jones junior is the other one that's like  just not that excited about these guys last game on the board from Saturday Minnesota wins again man that team is good  nasri is starting to cool now though so that he was a stream while warm guy and when he's not as warm yet on stream  when they're healthy it's harder for him to get that sort of inside track and that's what happened here Jaden McDaniels happened to have a massive massive ball game I wish to God that he'd be this aggressive all the time but he's generally not  and he's probably gonna somehow find his way to like that 115 to 140 range and sit there all damn season just like last year  so he's like  he's a start in 14 teams and he's right outside the start in 12 team  I don't know that I see anything changing there though you know I like in this ball game it was certainly helpful that Colony Kansas out and if cat misses another game I think you probably can go nazri because it's like okay well look Rudy gobert's gonna have to rest at some point and then NASA is going to get some playing time but Rudy was awesome in this one 21 and 17 they needed him in there because Sacramento like you rest you settled for even a moment and the Kings will put up 9 points on you in 45 seconds and so it's just sort of wasn't a good fit for Nas because he's not gardening anybody  anyway if cat is out play NOS Reid I'm okay with that I know this game wasn't very good for him but typically if cats out there's gonna be enough there and it's you know it's good for these other guys to get a few extra shots but  again with McDaniels this is like the thing we're just gonna pray and wish and hope that he becomes aggressive overnight but it just like guys don't usually change their stripes like that  and then for the king's another good ball game out of Keegan Murray we all this is like again one of the easiest Bilo opportunities on planet Earth he's number 56 and 9 cat and he's just coasting along right now  let's play our every week game of who the hell played on Friday that didn't go over the weekend the answers are Philadelphia  Miami  Phoenix and Washington yeah all right so here's Philly and beat his out  it's about that earlier in the show and meet is out for the Sixers game tomorrow on Christmas Day I know Paul Reed doesn't start in those spots they usually let Marcus Morris start but Paul Reed will get 25 minutes and that's more than enough for him to put a fantasy value so give me Paul Reed give me b-ball Paul this will be a big game for Tyrese Maxey big game for Tobias Harris you'll probably get enough shots out of Kelly oubre because you take MBS League leading usage numbers out of the the pack and then everything tips in that favor  Miami you know you got better stream stuff in this one for the Duncan Robinson had a better game Caleb Martin had a better stream I met as Junior had a better stream  I'll be honest though I don't really know who to stream for the heat right now if Butler misses another one I would probably  probably just pass on all of it well I like why  if I can just starting you could probably stream him because they love him they give him all the minutes he can handle he's finding ways to get some points and rebounds and steal or whatever but like you know if Caleb Martin might just disappear and Duncan Robinson about is he has a bad shooting game Off the Bench he'll only get 18 minutes  so probably a kez if he starting for Butler  but otherwise I think I would probably just pass on the heat streamers  the other team was Phoenix their slumping a bit right now I think Grayson Allen is a play in all formats while Bradley Beal is out otherwise no surprise is there Drew you Banks Got the Feeling start for use of nurkic and he was absolutely horrible you don't go as a bookie had 11 and 11 behind him I've got to think that Eubanks has a decent ball game in this next one but  man this one surprised the crap out of me I'll give you that  and then Washington they were kind of running out of gas in Golden State this game was a blowout Wizards closed the Gap right at the very end of the Ballgame kuzma left early but I think it's because the game was like a 25 Point Gap either way this is the Jordan Poole Revenge game and so he got to take a bunch of shots but he remains outside the top 175 and 9 category League's tyus Jones I mean he's just doing good stuff every single game right now he's inside the top 60 and 9 cat there's no real like supremely interesting notes on the Wizards other than  cool to believe not there until guys get shut down kuzma  like you knew the wheels were gonna come off a little bit he's still gonna be the main focal point of their offense but as his percentages came back where they always are he's outside the top 100 now Daniel Gafford has been amazing and then Denny Abdi has been slowly falling since the start of the year as well so kind of all the same stuff and that is your week ahead and weaken behind oof hope you guys have time to check this out before the games begin on Christmas morning remember to set your lineups tonight Sunday night if you can get a chance to
