welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  there we go second half of our back-to-back episodes on this lovely Wednesday morning good day to you all this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation and I am your host Dan best briefs please make sure to like subscribe rate review all that good stuff everything as you get going I gotta remember to say that early in the episode a couple of shows lately I've been  squeezing that in at the very end when nobody's listening anyway please do it at the beginning makes a big difference really every little thing you do makes a big difference some point way down the line when we're a massive  Powerhouse of Epic Proportions I won't have to ask you guys to do this with such earnestness in my voice but today I do so please like rate subscribe and please do find me over on social at Danvers so we can continue our discussion of all things fantasy basketball today is Wednesday the NBA cup is done so we now actually know who's in and who's out I had a thought before we get into the breaking down all the fantasy stuff  as the games were ending last night and you know me I'm  a what I call a pragmatic Laker fan meaning I don't typically get a lot of their players on my fantasy teams or at least I hadn't for a while they got a few better ones this year  but in terms of the actual play  the the interesting little footnote on all of this is that you know team like the Lakers I think they already had four game schedule this year with the Phoenix Suns  well now they got five  because the Lakers will have the Suns on Tuesday in the intimate quarterfinals be in Los Angeles so it's a bonus home game  and so there's this weird trade-off  and I got a discussion with folks on Twitter because it is a little bit confusing in terms of  kind of like how does the schedule make sense so none of the games for next week we're scheduled when the season started  every team in the league is going to play two times next week  the teams that are that made the in-season tournament quarterfinals we'll have a game on Tuesday or Wednesday it's eight teams so uh there will be four games two on Tuesday two on Wednesday  everybody that didn't make the quarterfinals plays on  Thursday know or is it Monday Monday Tuesday sorry Monday Tuesday are the quarters and then everybody that didn't play Monday Tuesday didn't make the quarters plays on Wednesday  the  teams that won their quarterfinal battle go to Vegas and have a game on Thursday so there's two games again on Thursday  everybody that didn't play on Thursday plays on Friday  and then the finals are over the weekend and everybody else gets the day off that game doesn't count towards fantasy it doesn't count towards the the real record of teams either  okay that part's not that hard to follow what is a little bit hard to follow is  how to how the schedule gets created so the NBA created a schedule where the teams had 80 games on the books meaning they played all the teams in their own division  four times  they played teams in the opposite conference twice  so that's 30 opposite conference games and I think 16 if I'm getting that right divisional game so you're a 46 meaning there's 30 in this case normally they'd be 36 other games to schedule among the remaining 10 teams in this particular case there is only 34  so there's going to be this blend of three or four games against the other teams in your own conference that's how it generally is and typically there's more for game battles than three game battles because of just you know you got four 29 opponents to play against 15 of them you're only gonna go twice and so blah blah you guys can do the math on that that part I know I have right  the problem now is that if you end up playing a team in your own  conference  there's a chance you're going to end up playing them five times instead of four  and on top of that the team you play so this is for the teams that qualify it those are going to be teams that play against other presumably good teams an extra one or even two times  like say for instance so the West in season tournament is the Lakers the Suns play each other on Tuesday the other battle there is the Pelicans and the Kings I believe so you know let's say the Kings and the Lakers get through it those teams already had four games on the schedule too because schedule makers were not going to just randomly leave out a game against a divisional opponent the Pacific Division teams are going to play themselves for times I'm pretty sure I didn't check this for every single team at every division but like if you go to the Lakers Suns like what games are they going to see each other this year  they've already played a couple of times trying to figure out where the forget the preseason game Lakers beat the Suns on October 26th and then beat him in Phoenix in an in-season Tournament game on November 10th so I've already played twice they're going to play on Tuesday so that's the next one  where it is this go after that let's see they play on Tuesday and then they play on January 11th and January  our February 25th  so someone was asking me on Twitter there were like well the league is already scheduled out they know that like there's time to build in these games yeah that's not what I'm talking about my thought is okay these teams are trying to win these games they want to go to the quarterfinals they wanted to try to win 500 grand for their teammates the Lakers could end up playing two of the better teams in the NBA five times this year and I don't know who that ends up like I didn't deep dive the Lakers schedule it's just the one I picked out because I knew they had already played the sons a couple of times but  do the Lakers play the Spurs only three times so far this season I don't know I didn't look it up but the Spurs are bad  and there are a couple other teams in the Western Conference that are also kind of bad  and I get it the West is a pretty loaded conference overall but the point I'm trying to make on this is  you may be getting rewarded by having one extra home game in the quarterfinals  before a neutral site semifinal game but you might also be getting punished by having to play two of the best teams in your own conference five times  by the way that's bad  and miss out on playing I don't know the Blazers or the Grizzlies or the jazz or the Spurs  you only play those teams three times  that's tough that I mean that could be the difference between making a playoff spot versus play in or play in versus missing the Playoffs altogether  think about if you were a team that was the 10 seeds 11 seed and the nine seed and you guys are all fighting for the play in spot on the last two games of the year and you look back and you're like damn it you know in late November my team made the play or made the NBA cup and we had 10 games against two of the top five teams in the Western Conference and the teams were fighting for only at six and again if this happens you know the NFL deals with that kind of crap every year but typically the NBA doesn't  so this does create a weird little Advantage for a team having a good record on the NBA cup days but actually missing the quarter and semi-finals because then those teams the remaining 22 teams that don't play Monday or Tuesday are gonna all play each other  and yeah there's some decent teams mixed in there like the Mavericks didn't make it the Nuggets didn't make it you might get it you might draw the Short Straw and have to play the Mavericks or the nuggets in your makeup game on Wednesday or Friday but you might also draw the good straw the long straw  you might end up with an extra game against the Pistons next week you might end up playing the Pistons five times this year  what if you're the Hawks fighting for the 10 seeds end up with five games against the Pistons  you don't think that helps  so I think that's something that the NBA might want to look into a little bit  you guys are saying the music is still going I actually can't hear it I'll turn that off sorry guys I thought I had I thought I had turned that off completely but apparently I messed it up you guys are all yelling at me now my bad everybody my bad it was off I turned my my music off in my headset I the problem with with streamyard is that I bring the music down on my soundboard but it's still pipes through God forsaken thing that's gonna be annoying for folks watching after the fact sorry about that everybody I thought the song had ended that's when I tried to start talking  son of a gun  oh well anyway I think that's something the NBA might want to look into just like  your rewarding there's a there's a financial reward for the teams that make it that actually win it but like what if you just make the quarterfinals and I have to play an extra game against a really good team  some to think about you guys are saying it's still playing that's impossible I have stopped it I've hit the pause button I don't know what's going on here  streamyard is out of control today all right let's just mute it that way even if it's says it's off there's no way it's going now right  unbelievable  oh  fighting with technology today all right anyway so that's my thought I didn't talk about any fantasy stuff so you guys yelling at me over the music you guys are you only missed me screaming about NBA cup having some things that are maybe good or bad with it unfortunately I can't fix that after the fact either womp womp all right let's talk some fantasy sports you guys waited long enough on this one and away we go yesterday we'll roll through this thing Toronto there's really nothing I'd like to say there's something but there's nothing other than ogn and Obi continuing to struggle  and he continues to be I think a pretty obvious Bi-Lo candidate he's now outside the top one 20 this is just not gonna stick he's shooting 60% at the free throw line steals are under one lot of things that are going to get better for him and we should capitalize so go get him you can probably get him cheaper now then you could before  Brooklyn Spencer Dinwiddie is cooking right now it sounds like cam Thomas is getting closer and I do think that he puts a pretty fat Dent into whatever didn't what he's doing because didn't what he stuff right now is due to the fact that he's basically grabbed the highest usage role on the team he didn't shoot the ball well at all but he made all ten of his free throws and basically he's a play he kind of has to be a play right now while he's rolling hot  Nick's in his back that's good cam Johnson's back that's good a lot of good stuff going on there Royce O'Neill had a giant game but you certainly can't believe that that's gonna stick long-term  typically when Claxton and Ben Simmons are out that's what we've seen with this Nets team that's when O'Neill and Dorian Finney Smith can be played on the Roto side right now with just Ben Simmons and also cam Thomas out you could probably look at those guys as scheduled level plays but at the moment they're really aren't any teams that have a particularly interesting schedule because we're about to roll into this weird NBA cup thing and that's kind of where I leave that one as it lies Charlotte not surprisingly got destroyed by the Nicks Noel ball for what they revealed yesterday is likely to be a more extended absence and that's kind of what we thought was going to happen anyway  so  yeah know how did we prep for that during a whole lot you could do I think we need to hold on to Gordon Hayward a little bit longer I know I've been saying that for like a week and he hasn't snapped out of this funk  I just find it hard to believe that he's not gonna have something to do while lamelo ball is out it would blow me away if he didn't step up and do something anything's possible I don't think it's a shoe in but I'm gonna give Gordon Hayward at least another week to see how this goes even if I leave my bench on the Roto side uh because we'd feel kind of silly if he now sort of jumped back into what he was doing at the beginning of the year and he was on somebody else's team  Brandon Miller took 18 more shots some of that was blowout related some of it is just the fact that he's sort of launching right now I think while he's launching you can probably play him just understand that this is not a thing that's guaranteed to last long term  you're going to see the ebb and flow of a rookie as we've already seen with him the first five and a half weeks this year it's going to keep going but again while he's just out there firing away you kind of want to make sure that he's a play for you at the moment  on the Knicks side I know I'm moving a little bit faster today but you know we did the early show we're doing this back-to-back thing so I don't want to spend too much time on stuff that isn't sort of game-changing level  so yes yesterday I said I was finally done paying attention to whether or not Josh Hart was getting close to 30 minutes and then Josh Hart came out and basically spoke  to the media basically he was like look I I  feel like I'm not involved on the offensive side  is what he said and I don't know if that was the impetus for him getting a few extra minutes in this game or if it was just like RJ Barrett wasn't shooting as well so heart got a couple extra bonus minutes and shots  but he had he did more stuff  and so now I'm back in on paying attention I don't think you need to add Josh hard after one good ball game after three or four kind of clunky ones in a row but I think at the very least we need to be paying attention to heart after this one good ball game because if that him coming out and just saying like hey wait a minute like why am I playing 24 25 minutes I'm supposed to be a 30-minute guy I want to be handling the basketball a little bit more maybe that does something it feels more like this sort of short-term bursts and then fade  but  at the very least we can pay attention to it  and then Julius Randle who we had on the Buy Low board yesterday I think probably surprise to all of you because you guys know me I'm not a big Julius Randle Fantasy game fan but like he was so bad it was unbelievable they would he was so awful that we simply couldn't  like  we basically just had to assume that it would get a little bit better there was no way that it wasn't going to get a little bit better and  that's why I said this is a guy that might be able to do something that like you get points boards and assists for possibly a later round pick I thought we'd have more than like two hours to execute on that buy low but is what it is and  so anyway you go from there  Atlanta got blown out by the Cavaliers and I think you're gonna see Atlanta suffer a little bit without Jalen Johnson he was a big part of what they were doing they're fine I mean the Hawks are not gonna like turn into total pumpkins but  they're going to need to figure out how to bridge this Gap attached and my thought is that Sadiq Bay is the immediate add folks are asking me if I prefer sadique Bay or DeAndre Hunter it's Bae because he hits more threes and he gets more Steals and with Hunter we know he runs extraordinarily hot and extraordinarily cold  and I mean we got a pretty good game out of a even in this one 14 points for boards three assists two steals two three pointers  I'd like to see him take a couple more shots then eight in 32 minutes but his Fantasy game does translate better than hunters and so that's why I think is probably going to be decent enough for the foreseeable future folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with

locations Cavs there was really nothing I mean  all of you that keep expecting Max Drews to not play well he keeps playing well there's another good game for him assists were weirdly high in this one for Max  he's showing no signs of slowing down and we're you know more than a fifth of the way into the season I mentioned not a couple of shows recently and then all social careless Levert has been downgraded officially in my book not Health Wise is health is fine but fantasy wise he's been downgraded to basically a streamer level guy only  I sort of wondered if he could continue a mildly efficient run he was putting together early this year and and now we have our answer which is no not really not when both Garland and Donovan Mitchell are healthy and special not when those guys are playing relatively well all so big game out of Evan Mobley even with Jared Allen around that's a good sign for him he's been solid so far this year and we can just kind of keep on moving  Chicago's a mess man like they got they got a pull the plug and they got to do it fast because the season is spiraling the drain there's kind of no reason to continue trotting these guys out there this was the big fear stagnation syndrome it has said in exactly means dealing with a sore foot it doesn't matter  uh there hasn't been really any change to my feeling I want to do about the Bulls which is you kind of have to stash Kobe white because if they trade Zach LaVine and or DeMar DeRozan he becomes very interesting Patrick Williams have been playing better lately and perhaps some of that is because he's sort of sniffing a bigger job when things get blown to Smithereens  Patrick Williams has the better Fantasy game Believe It or Not between he and Kobe white white has the  safer interim Fantasy game because he can go out there and he can sort of make a couple of buckets  but if Patrick Williams suddenly gets a chance to go take 11 12 13 shots of ball game meaning like these other guys get jettisoned out of town then you're talking about points boards steals blocks threes  field goal percent free throw percent like there's a cross the board kind of dude  he's a harder player to stash because we could have a game where he basically just does nothing  but at the same time I mean you can make it argument to stash both of these guys if you think the Bulls blow up is not in the two distant future I just I have no idea how they continue to put this off and the beauty of Patrick Williams is that he is not heavily rostered only 31% you can get him in almost like a lot of Yahoo leagues  I wouldn't play him  I always had like two-ish decent ball games here maybe you could argue like three out of four he's not been great over this stretch by any means but  again he's like all these Bulls guys just ready to step up and do some more stuff we already talked about Caruso early or and frankly I love for the big guys on this team to get traded because  they'll be reinvigorated going somewhere else that'll be good for them even if they're role isn't quite as large at least they'd have more fun doing it and that's generally good  Al Horford ladies and gentlemen Al freakin' Horford  what's not to love  my goodness  ah  I do  all right so look he's obviously not a play all season long but while Kristofferson gets out is out he's he's a monster right now  Big Al  fire em up man  I'd like to talk about him for the next 15 minutes but I think all you need to say is that he is a beautiful thing is fill in and he had  effectively one of the best Roto games we've seen almost from anybody all year  last night  with six out of eight shooting from the field and cleaning 4 3-pointers 16 points 9 boards six assists two steals three blocks  that's a colossal basketball game  I can dig it  let's keep moving Milwaukee beat Miami in a nice juicy high scoring game that actually started off really low scoring Believe It or Not Dame is working his way up the board that's been fine Malik Beasley has been on this crazy heater here but it reminds me all too much of the Tim Hardaway Jr heater  we know it's not going to last forever  you can play a while it's going that's okay  I've actually fallen into this trap in the past on this very show of saying I you know like we know this isn't Gonna Last so and then just write it off but like  short-term heaters are fine Blake Beasley's been number 90 in nine cat this year thanks to the fact that over the last two weeks he's running top 50 but there's going to be a stretch coming up where he's probably outside the top 200 when the three-pointer completely disappears but he's super confident right now shots are dropping he's grabbing rebounds he's so happy to be out there playing so just roll with it it's okay  you're probably gonna end up catching him on a really bad night and when that happens you can be like ooh boy here it comes and then you can back off but right now playing him while he's hot is an okay strategy  some of you guys asked me about a sell high on Brook Lopez I mean yeah obviously if you can do it you do it but I don't think you're gonna get anyone inside the top 50 back for him and I actually think he is going to be inside the top 50 this year so  what's the point  Miami was without Jimmy Butler again and when he sits and Tyler here all so basically every other Garden Wing descends upon fantasy value like vultures Kyle Lowry big games right now play him I may have kids  big games play them Josh Richardson having a big games you can play him Dunkin' Robinson missed some free throws that kind of screwed up why He's listed lower on the board yesterday but typically having big games with no Tyler hero play him to it's crazy by the way that two guys being out for Miami basically means that like four Dudes get above the cut line the cut line but that's kind of been the way it's going for this team because they're doing it in different ways Lowry does it with threes and assists and some steals I know he had some shots yesterday Ikea has been more the across the board guy with some boards and defensive stats Richardson is more the threes and some points and a few assists kind of guy and then Robinson is all three pointers with a couple of blocks and Boards mixed in it's like Butler and hero left these things on the table and a bunch of guys that were in the one like 125 to one 70 range all like okay I'm gonna pick this and you take some of that and you get that thing that they left behind and I'll take a few of those shots and give me a couple of them assists and they all just they took exactly what they needed to to all descend on top 100  honestly it's one of the craziest fill-in moments  that I think I've ever seen typically you don't see one guy go out and like three guys coming in but that's like kind of what happened here two guys went out and four guys came in and somehow they all made it but you took two guys out that were top 40 or better and you replace them with four guys that are like rolling top 80 to top 100 it's crazy but it's fun  cool little footnote on this fantasy season  I have no notes on the Oklahoma City Thunder although we did get word earlier this morning that the Newport Beach police department has indeed opened an investigation into Josh giddey  wait and see you really can't do anything else on that one Jalen Williams keep buying low man like this isn't Gonna Last Forever  The Unbelievable price on him right now  hey Rudy gobert had a good ball game he'd been kind of falling off a cliff the last few weeks is pushed him back up into that kind of 80 range and I'm actually okay with that if you want to trade for gobert now you probably couldn't get him anyway more important notes on this ball game Anthony Edwards left early he's a tough nut hip injuries are kind of funny but he's also super young so we'll see I don't know that he actually misses any time but if he does  it'd be good to get that one game kind of filed in the role of X who would take his starting spot  slow-mo Shake Milton  hard to know oh the guy that ended up having a better ball game yesterday was Nas Reed who got off to a very fast start this year and then cooled if he happens to get on any kind of little run here you're gonna want to be a part of that but mostly the note on this team is does Anthony Edwards miss any time because if he does someone's gonna step into a big fat juicy clump of value and we probably want to be there to grab him  Houston Dallas not a whole lot of fantasy stuff on this one Houston is relatively predictable fantasy wise Van Vliet is slowly working his way up the board Alpine is putting up these colossal popcorn number games and he's taking a huge step forward honestly defensively I've been very impressed with Shen more than anything Jabari Smith has been rolling warm lately that's good news and then Jalen green continues to be a god-awful nine cat player and points League guy only there's really sort of  Houston for the big numbers they're putting up which is fun like day-to-day fantasy there really isn't anything to talk about with that team because there aren't any ads or drops  Derek Lively's back for the Mavs get him on your roster specially with him playing 28 minutes that's a great sign if he's in the 25th that probably gets him inside the top 100 make sure he wasn't dropped while he was hurt add them up throw them in get him going have some fun  that's it by the way on the map side nothing else  and in the Warriors blew a 20 some odd point lead in this game to the Kings and if you're you know watching along with us you can see all the red on the warrior side multiple mid-game injuries Chris Paul left very early in the game with leg soreness that's some old man crap right there and you know part of what you deal with when you drafted old man team hopefully he'll be back in the not too distant future I'm guessing he misses a game or two because he he's old  and then Gary Payton her his calf that's that's usually a couple of weeks we'll see what the the deal is there that's actually a big loss for the Warriors because he's one of their better Defenders maybe their best defender  certainly outside of Draymond Green  and like get one guy back and lose two others it's kind of a tough way to operate good news at least on the Warriors side is indeed they do have Draymond back so you can fire him up Andrew Wiggins had easily his best game of the season last night he was confident he was attacking he wasn't settling for wack jumpers he was sort of going at smaller dudes maybe that wakes him up he had one good ball game like a week and a half ago and then he went right back to sleep  hard to know but I will say this take one poke around your league to see if somebody got sick and tired of Wiggins BS and dropped him  he is available in one League that I'm in  which I again like it seems insane but his roster ship dropped under 70% before this big game yesterday so there's sort of no guarantee that he's  rostered he might have been dropped  seems nuts but it did happen in some spots Klay Thompson kind of the same story I don't think he was dropped it as many spots as Wiggins just because he's clay and he was still heating three-pointers he still almost 90% rostered but you can take one Peak there as well again less likely on that one but again  Wiggins is out there you got to pick him up on the chance that this is the ball game that woke him up because it did you know very rarely do you have like a top 90 guy that's just sitting on the waiver wire and we know that Wiggins can be that over a full season because he's done it you know 12 times or whatever  not surprisingly Dario charged basically disappeared with Draymond back come on Luni actually played a bunch of minutes in this one but that's sort of a big fat who cares and then as far as the king's goalie monk was the hero and every once in a while he gets to be the hero and the rest of the time they limit him to like 1920 minutes I just I don't get it so I know you guys hear me talk about how I don't think Malik monk is a full season 9 cat guy  but so far this year he hasn't been  that's not me saying he shouldn't be I think you guys sometimes conflate is and should  I would love for Malik monk to get more than 24 minutes a game consistently he just hasn't when Darren fox has been healthy so far  I don't know what to tell you like  that's just the way it's been  here he was their Savior and so he played more and he won the game he had scored he did their last two shots to win it basically including a game-winning wacky fading bank shot from near the free throw line  but even with that like 21 points and really not much else  and that's kind of been the problem with monkey he's had games where he's assisted pretty well he's had a couple of games where he scored a little better they're just hasn't been a game or a week or two weeks or whatever we kind of put it all together and unfortunately that's probably gonna be the case going forward because he's they're just sort of isn't room for him to play 20,829 minutes a night not unless somebody gets dinged up Darren Fox played 40 minutes at a brutal free throw shooting game and again like this is some of the drop off we expected to see with him there's gonna be little games like this where you don't even really notice it because the scoring is great or something is great and you're like oh everything seems fine but then over time those things take their toll they slowly move him down the board back to where we would be after the extraordinarily hot start he still gonna be a fun player to own  that's another thing that's tough for Fantasy analysts that have to talk all the time  when we talk about a guy like dropping off that doesn't mean we think they're gonna be bad it just means that we didn't believe the small sample we saw  you guys are smart though I give you guys a lot of credit you guys know what I'm talking about Kevin herder got back on the good side he runs hot and cold he's one of the streaky players in the NBA technically to this point he's been a start so keep starting him he's number 80 in nine cat some of that is because he's under one turnover a night if you're hunting turnovers he drops outside of the top 100 but I'm not and he's sort of a quietly medium productive plotting along type dude who does it hurt you in that category and that's okay I like it I know like everybody seems to want to punt turnovers but then if everybody's doing it then is there any real advantage to doing it anymore and plus I play a lot of Roto I think there's an advantage to trying to be decent in that category  yeah the teams that give up and you know early March they're going to be the top two or three in turnovers but if you can get nine points in that category role where another team is is steam rolling along with all these high turnover guys and I'm gonna seven eight nine point bounce on someone that way that's a big deal on the road oh side you can't just give up on it especially if like just punting turnovers doesn't guarantee you're good in all the other categories that's the other thing you may end up bad in another one so you don't want to be bad in two  I get inside Track by this thing  let's keep rumbling along again please do take a moment to like rate and subscribe as I navigate to the medium sized Wednesday can I talk about how much I love the fact that this week is just like all medium-sized cards that brings me incredible Joy like a nice solid medium level effort from day one on  that's a beautiful thing I don't have to do a 14 game recap one day and then just nobody's paying attention the next night this is way better  by the way if I keep moving quickly we'll probably have some time for a few questions so  you know just saying  all right what are we looking forward to night there's a few things on the docket we can't ignore everything in this one what do we got coming up this evening Some Enchanted Evening cam reddish sounds like he's back for the Lakers that'll be useful they'll probably put him on Cade Cunningham speaking of needing their sort of wing Defender slash Corner 3-point shooter all that a little more you might even see some Tori and prints on him as well because I don't need the Lakers gonna trust that anybody else in the Pistons is gonna hurt him all that much  because really who is  but they can't take this game lightly Pistons of lost a lot of games in a row there gonna be pissed  the piston  reminds me of a Married with Children reference  on the Pistons side you know it's all about breaking the streak Jade and Ivy is also worth paying attention to he's played well lately but he's also shot over his head so you got to think that's gonna come down Wizards going against one of the best defenses in the NBA can they keep it closed so ugh like falling into my microphone and discussed at how few Wizards games are actually competitive in the late fourth quarter  but that's all we want out of them Magic  do we bother with the center thing like it seemed like it was gonna be Goga  and then it wasn't for two games in a row  technically he's actually been nine cat play for the full season to this point and even in the last game where we only played 20 minutes he still at 11 and 7  but you know he didn't block the shots that we wanted to I think you could probably keep streaming Goga it's very borderline know  also Cole Anthony almost forgot he's been Lava Hot lately  how long can that last  we would hope forever but I also doubt it  son's we're just waiting on a Health Report on Kevin Durant he's questionable as far as I know and then that would trickle down to whether or not you play a guy like it Eric Gordon  that's kind of it Raptors nothing Jazz I think we know Larry marketing is out for at least a couple more ball games that means Simona Funke all has been getting the starts for them but it really he's more of a placeholder so you just get sort of more stuff for the other usage guys like Jordan Clarkson if he plays kante George and then also the Walker Kessler ramp up people keep asking me what do I think about Omar Yates in what I think about him is that he's probably gonna be the reserve in the next couple of games  so nope  Grizzlies how low will Jaren Jackson Jr fall this year before the bottom finally hits because right now I like honest to goodness if I had more time in my day I would spend like a solid 40 minutes just trying to trade for him in almost every League because you can buy so incredibly low right now  someone spent a late second round pick on this dude that's definitely getting frustrated and not feeling like waiting it out and starting to believe that this is just going to be it all year  you could probably get him for somebody that you drafted like four rounds deeper try to do it take some time and try to do it that could totally change the fortunes of your fantasy team in the next I don't know month or whatever  by the way I'm still playing Santee all Donna I have given up on him yet  Sixers the only question there is whether or not we're streaming Nick button I probably will  we'll see  we'll see  a pelican CJ McCollum is back that's really good news I've probably should have started the show with breaking new stuff that's the breaking news CJ McCollum is back  only missed about three three and a half weeks which is about half of the time he missed if you recall the last time he dealt from a small new thorax during his time in Portland  so that's really good that's gonna make the Pelicans a whole hell of a lot better because they have the sort of  guy that they wanted to orchestrate their offense now back in the mix I would expect the Pelicans once they reintegrate him to put together a couple of little winning spells don't know if it's gonna start tonight Sixers are a very good opponent but this is good for the pals it's bad for Dyson Daniels and Jordan Hawkins who had different types of value those guys likely mostly disappear as does any chance we have of hoping for a Jose Alvarado experience  move on Houston nothing  unless you want to talk about like Freddie Van Glee very slowly moving his way up the board member two weeks ago he was like number 50 two and I said buy low and then last week he was like number 49 and I said Buy Low  he's number 45 now I don't think I've ever seen somebody move up the board as slowly as Freddie Van bleed is I still think he probably ends up about around higher than he is right now but how he gets there I mean you want to talk about baby steps  now gets all gonna come down to health Aaron Gordon Jamal Murray is closed Nicole yokich I would think goes but I don't think we know for sure yet  and then you make your call on if you're gonna bother rolling anybody out there on the stream side Clippers I think I'm Giving Up on Norman Powell he looked like kind of an interesting  Gunner  but if his minutes are not even guaranteed to hit 23 24 that's probably not gonna be enough for him  I think by the way and a couple of Clippers games against the Spurs ruined my constant I was sort of beating the drum hard over and over again that I thought a lot of the Clippers were going to be in Bilo territory and then they played the Spurs who just don't defend anybody and so everybody put up these big lines and and I thought maybe that was getting ruined but I think you're going to get these these Bilo opportunities on the Clippers still yet because as you saw with their loss against a bad a weird zombie nuggets team they still haven't fully figured this thing out  and the Kings you want to talk about a letdown game let's see if Sacramento can get up for this one I'd be  pretty impressed  I don't want to say floored because again anything's possible but  Sacramento put their whole ass into yesterday's comeback against Golden State this has like all the makings of a oh here we go back up again today  luckily for the king's the Clippers are terrible these days but if you're wondering why the Clippers are 2 Point Road favorite that's why  we'll see I don't have a whole lot that I'm watching with the king's other than whether or not he can Murray plays but yeah I mean that is relevant  I don't know when the right time is to talk about this but it is worth noting that now that we know the Monday Tuesday Wednesday and most of the Friday schedule for next week you should start looking at your streaming charts and figure out if you can kind of get a jump on the game's happening next week  does that make sense I'll try to be a little bit clearer about this so we now know that Boston Indiana New Orleans and Sacramento are playing Monday we now know that the Knicks the Bucks the Suns and the Lakers are playing on Tuesday we didn't know that until late last night  now we do  Wednesday and Friday are going to be big time overload days and there will be an extra team going on Friday that we don't know about yet but those are gonna be huge overload days with all the teams that aren't playing Monday Tuesday or Thursday  those days you won't need to do anything so basically what you should be doing is as this week gets closer to the end and maybe you don't have to do it today because it's still Wednesday and and you still have today tomorrow and Friday to kind of get into the streaming mode but as you get towards the end of this week maybe call it Friday  see if you can get the jump on grabbing some players that go Monday or Tuesday of next week or Monday I guess and then use a bunch more moves on Tuesday  because you're not going to need you use any moves on Wednesday or Friday you're going to be using all your moves on Tuesday and Thursday and if you can use some moves that set you up for Monday this week you can get like a three four five game advantage over your opponent who might not be thinking that far ahead and they're gonna get stuck with all their players going on these overload days and you're gonna max out the extraordinarily low traffic days before by the way you get to a weekend where nobody plays none of the games count for Fantasy Saturday or Sunday  the IST they call it the in season tournament that's how the cool kids are saying it  that Finals game doesn't count  okay this is this is like extraordinarily important stuff for streaming because most leagues are treating next week as its own individual week then everybody comes back and plays on Monday of the following one but like most fantasy teams are only gonna have about 22 games played next week so you can turn your 22 into a 26 that's a huge game's advantage  that's like a 20% jump over your opponent  you are very unlikely to lose with a 20% game's advantage  all right so a few questions before we wrap up our sort of two for Tuesday here his buddy hield still a must roster in 12th is yes I know he's last ball game as a starter was not as good overall since he's moved into the starting lineup he is top 25 in nine categories yeah shooting 57% so that's not going to stick but it's our about 29 per game as a starter and yes the last one was lower Pacers were kind of Rick Carlisle was doing his mix and match crap but we know from last year the Buddy hield as a starter ran top 50 that's not a guarantee that he'll be back there again this season but it is a sort of Upper Crust and just you're not finding anybody like that on the waiver wire so yes  what are your thoughts on Jayson Tatum this year seems like you don't see him as a first rounder this year I just traded away Scotty Barnes and Tobias Harris for Tatum and Jalen Williams is that a good trade yeah I actually like that trade because I think Tatum ends ahead of Scotty Barnes when the season's over Jalen Williams to buy his Harris they're probably gonna be somewhat close to one another so maybe  you know  call that one wash I think Tatum Gibbs back probably towards the end of the first round it's just it's like it's not a guarantee you know um  his steals are I guess the same as last year blocks are down from point six to point three and then the free throw is normally 85 right now it's at 80 and a half everything else is fairly repeatable for him all the might even argue the field goal percent could come down a tad my issue is not necessarily that Tatum's doing anything wrong it's just that the top of the board is now harder to be a part of Booker is in there on his hot start he wasn't expected to be a MidFirst spider is in there on his hot start these guys could taper off Lucas still shooting 77% of the free throw line so that hasn't completely ruined him yet  Tyrese Maxey still in the top 10 chat Holmgren Lowry marking and her into the top 12 right now  so you know it's not that Tatum needs to do a bunch of things better free throw percent should come up and that would move them up a few spots on the board and then if blocks come up that'll move him up one or two more spots the issue for Tatum is just that all these other guys are insane like dude Steph Curry is not in the first round right now  how is that possible he's at 30 points and over 53 pointers a game  and he's number 13  the top of the board is just playing freaking pinball  so there's nothing wrong with Jayson Tatum it's just that it's harder to be a top 10 player now that it was even as recently as last year  some of these questions are about my music choice which again I very much effed up at the beginning of this show  what is a fair price for OG or Jalen Williams I did a show on this actually go back and watch the Bilo show I'm not gonna rehash this one sorry Timothy but go watch the Bilo Show from the last week I think  is Buddy hield and he eats a zubac enough for ogn and Obi that's worth a try you know only the person who owns OG in your league knows for sure  uh Dan who would you rather have rest of season cam Johnson or OG and Adobe uh I'm gonna go cam  would you sit OG and tyus Jones tonight in a roto League  I'd be more inclined to sit tyus Jones because they're playing a really good defensive team in that game could get ugly but also every time I get kind of weird with my if I get cute with my benches I screw it up so take it with a grain of salt  what do you think finishes higher  nine cat bam out of Bio or Karl Anthony towns  I think you're kind of splitting hairs a little bit there Bama's 19 cat is 28  Bam's  blocks and steals are a little high right now  is scoring is way up although it doesn't look like that's coming down anytime soon cat is probably about what he's gonna be in the mid-20s so I guess the question is do you think bam slides back into the mid-twenties I think the answer is probably  they may end up within one slot of each other how about that for an answer I think they end up tied this year I think they end up as like 25 and 26  how about that there's my ballsy call  uh what do you think of this trade Dan Desmond Bane and Oscar Thompson for Trey young and Onkyo Kang woo guess it's fair like  probably prefer the  Trey side for when Jack comes back but that's fair  should I trade miles bridges for Deontay Murray in points League I think the answer to that is yes in any League actually mostly because I'd rather win without Myles Bridges so if you can get a player that you can more easily route for and feel good about and is also probably gonna be as good or better yeah absolutely get to Shante  with CJ McCollum coming back to I drop Jaylen Suggs Anthony Melton Mike Conley or Shannon not Shannon it's shaedon Sharpe for the rest of season Shades the drop he's not a he's not a particularly strong nine cat guy right now should I drop CP3 for herb Jones this would seemingly be a shallower league and the answer there is  probably  would my yaka Pearl for anunoby be a decent get um  no that's the thing so Purl is also a guy who's been sort of steadily moving up the board he's top 50 over the last two weeks  and it's pretty repeatable stuff for him other than the field goal percent being like 80% of 65  I think there's actually a reasonable chance that poodle and OG end up almost right next to each other  so no I think I would try to hurdles a guy I'd rather get these days then sell  tyus Jones or Chris Middleton rest of season the whole  the Middleton I guess he came back from this Achilles thing oh God it's gross either way it's gross Wizards can't play competitive games Middleton as an injury Rec  this is like do you want to barf or do you want to have diarrhea your choices today  I guess I'll go Middleton since at least like they're trying to get him ramped up oh this is rough  if we want to trade four dejounte Murray what range of players should we try to get well he's been bad over the last two weeks so that probably makes it a little easier  I think you could get him for someone in the 45 to 50 range which is where he's ranked right now would you though is the question a lot of the guys that I would try to sell their or hurt right now  DeAndre ayton would be an interesting one to try to sell on  James Harden on I wouldn't do that um  someone just said miles bridges in the chat room that's not a bad one  blue blue I feel like eight and is the perfect one  because the other guys around his Shante Murray I think are also kind of headed up  like I'd rather have already been Fleet  rather have Jalen Brunson  yeah they're closed I guess maybe I'll print  most people that have him probably don't want to give him up because you got these giant points boards and assist coming in there  I don't know there aren't that many choices unfortunately I think eight is probably the best pairing  almost time to wrap it up guys We're not gonna get through all of these  can I do a show on Buy Low for OG I did I did it last week  hardened and on yeco Kang woo for JJ you shouldn't even need both of like the hardened would be more than enough and I don't think I would sell on him right now either Harden's a by low you're giving away a Milo for a Bi-Lo  Jeremy Grant for JJ oh that's interesting  yeah I think that's it I think I kind of like that one  Jalen Duren our output had to head well this really depends on what stat you're looking for it's probably Shane but if you're hunting field goal percent boards and assist or a little and blocks  during will have a little bit of an advantage there but Shane Goods gonna annihilate him in points and assists  and so again it really depends on what stats your hunting there within about a round of each other right now shingles in front so it's probably Alberton but again there's a little bit of a stat hunting element especially now that we get kind of towards the middle of the year it all right I'm doing three more and I'll do them in chronological order so you guys don't think I'm trying to screw anybody Mark Williams and jaw for Kyrie Irving  yes give me Kyrie  is fontecchio worth a stream or should I go Killian Hayes yikes yeah go find techie oh there Killian Hayes basically isn't playing right now  do you think it's stupid to bench JJ and Roto until he plays better or keep rolling them out there he's killing my field goal percent I think I'm gonna keep rolling them out there um I know it's been bad but like there are other worst field goal percent guys on the board and  chances of JJ doing something Mega oh look there's only a couple questions left so let's just keep going  thoughts on Trey Murphy well mccollum's back now so this will be interesting I do want to see if there's enough for him with the PALS like effectively healthy right now it's kind of amazing so I had stash him and see how it goes but I'm I don't think there's a guarantee Mediterranean food or Korean barbecue ooh  I'll go Mediterranean food I'm a sucker for  a sucker for a good shawarma  what can I say also hummus is delicious creep Barbecue's good though that's one  please rate Kauai Trey young dejounte Murray rest of season um  nine cat it's that's the order you've got it Kawaii over tray over to jaunty  now again if you are  assist hunting you know you go Trey  the one that feels pretty obvious is that Deontay is behind the other guys  all right we're done  oh keonte or Suggs it's Jalen Suggs  all right everybody thanks for watching both shows today I need to rest my voice I'm gonna go do something else I'm gonna eat a golden Oreo because they're freaking
