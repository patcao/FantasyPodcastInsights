welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right friends it's the second half of our two fur today this is a weekly preview show as well as a streaming guide all rolled into one  because they are one and the same this half of our daily programming is dedicated to head to head League's typically you're in your playoffs probably in your finals right now if it's a Yahoo public league  you might be over  I don't know why you're watching this particular episode if your league is over but hey I love having you around regardless  there are a small very small handful of leagues in the head-to-head side that go all the way to The Bitter End of the Season as a warning once again we will not be doing these Shows Daily next week this is the last week we're going to be doing these Shows Daily  because next week it's all going to be about what players are upright  no idea who's playing on any given night the final week of the season this week we have a little bit of an idea so we're gonna kind of roll on that premise as we look at the best and worst options for this coming week I have to do a Preface on this oh the high by the way Dan vasper is with you from fantasy NBA today this is a sports ethos.com presentation I'm at Dan Besse over on Twitter  the preface is that this week and I started color coding this a little bit on the diagram you can see on your screen Friday if you look at Friday and and Sunday  they're marked in red kind of a light read like a lipstick red  because they're likely overflow days I just want to kind of have those as a quick reference as your building up your schedule for the week ahead  Friday's a dozen Sunday is 13 12 on Friday 13 on Sunday  again you can run the numbers on the Yahoo site and just sort of like  you know it it's  nothing is guaranteed 12 out of 15  possible games being played on Fridays 80%  80% of 13 roster slots so 13 times 0.8 is 10.4 so when all likelihood you will have 10  give or take players going on Friday airing towards 11 as more so than nine but again it's all like it's all confidence intervals to a certain degree the probability is 10.4 is the mid that's the most likely outcome but then you'll have the curve on either side of that where anything between you know eight and whatever and 12 is all very still  possible  Sunday I would say it's it's extremely unlikely that you wouldn't be full because 13 out of 15 is 87% and 87% times 13 roster slots is 11.3 so by all accounts you'll have 11 guys and change a third not quite of another player going  on Sunday so you probably won't have to do anything with streaming on Sunday and probably not on Friday but very much not a guarantee  and that's a funny thing about you know the way that Yahoo leagues are constructed those short benches mean that you you're less likely to have overflow you know even one extra player even if it's four bench slots instead of three it dramatically changes the odds of you being full on a given day and I've tried to bring this up on previous episodes and maybe it lands maybe a dozen but again if you're talking about 12 out of 15 again that's 80% 80% of 14 roster slots is 11.2  but you still only have 10 starting slots  so instead of 10.4 where you're probably full but you know chances are you could have nine  it's not that insane versus 11.2 the odds that you'd have only nine and that's an area or much lower  that's originally 13 and 14 roster slots but I'm going to assume that if your leg is still going right now it's probably a Yahoo public prize League or some other default setting that went to the penultimate week of the year and so you probably only have three bench slots and some ills but you know you can't rely on those guys right now so you're sitting on the 13th with here so Friday you probably have about 10  give or take one or two and on Sunday you probably have 11 and change give or take one or two  with that in mind  let's start with the best schedules this weekend I know normally I talk about the worst but the best is actually more intriguing because the worst side is really heavily about what your day-to-day volume looks like right now  so the best schedule this week is an easy one it's the Atlanta Hawks and it's not closed I've left them up on the screen here for folks that are watching on the video side the Hawks have the best schedule this week it's not remotely closed nobody else can claim that they go three times the first four days of the week the Hawks can nobody else can claim that they have four games on exclusively quality days meaning days where most likely everyone out there is sitting on under a full Ledger the Hawks go Monday today Wednesday Thursday and Saturday they dodged Friday Sunday completely while all so front loading the roster  but then there's this massive laundry list of teams that have the what you'd call the quote on quote second best schedule this week  it's basically any team with a four game week where three of those games fall on non overload days or what will know what I think is known pretty much across the board now as quality days  sometimes people talk about quality days as as days where there's only like two or three games happening but really any day that you're not overloaded or not likely to be is a quality day at least in my eyes so this week that's the other five Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Saturday our quality days because in all likelihood you can add one or two or even three games played and you wouldn't hit the overload marker  by all accounts once you get to like a 10 game day  that's when you start to say okay well this is no longer quality like there's a shot that I might be overloaded and if I stream one guy then I probably hit that Mark and so on so forth but the other days this week are  in my opinion quality level today is 16 games tomorrow has nine which again it's closer but not there Wednesday is all so nine Thursday is 5 Friday is a dozen Saturdays 4  and again Sunday at Baker's doesn't so Tuesday Wednesday are busier but again we can go back to the calculator and just say what are the odds here okay well there's nine games going out of possible 15 that's only 60% feels like a lot when you say 9 but it's really not that much 60% of 13 roster slots is 7.8 so an all likelihood you have eight or just slightly under eight out of your 10th full on Tuesday and Wednesday so you should be able to stream about two guys but some of you will get unlucky or lucky depending on how you look at it and you might have nine going on one of those two days so it becomes less of a quality day so nine is a borderline for a number of games happening on a given day Tuesday and Wednesday or not would you call traditional quality days but in all likelihood you can probably stream at least one additional player there and it won't come back and burn you probably more like two  so the other best schedule as we mention any four game teams with three games on quality days those teams are Brooklyn Cleveland Detroit the Lakers the Grizzlies and the 76ers  one two three four five six Brooklyn Cleveland Detroit the lake Lakers the Grizzlies the 76ers I think my younger son just got home from school so he may be coming running in here momentarily what about the bad teams what do you do like how do you open up the roster slots that to me is the hardest question of the week there are three teams that I would argue have slightly suboptimal schedules this week Chicago although they play tonight and then they have three days off after that that's crummy and then they play Friday Sunday so the two overload days but again how many of those guys in the Bulls starting five are you actually gonna punt on  considering they play today and what are you gonna get you might get two ish extra games out of that in the in the interim but then you come rotating back to the game's on the busy days do you now all you honey undoing the overload  I would lean more towards the Spurs and the Jazz as the two teams that don't that have a poor schedule this week where you can do something today because they each played tomorrow and then they're off for two days so just like the Bulls they have one game over four days but you can make a move today and try to front load your roster a little bit like maybe if there's a hawk floating around you turn that one game or into three can do the same thing with Chicago but you could also do that after today with the bulls you might as well just take the game there playing before you make a move tomorrow with spurs in the Jazz you'd have to wait one day just to get to a schedule that doesn't get all that much better and the other Beauty there is Chicago's got five guys that are all really good fantasy players in their starting five the Spurs have two maybe three  when B the cell when he's healthy which is not we missed the last Blog game and then trade Jones is kind of the iffy one and Utah has Colin Sexton probably Walker Kessler right now but I don't know if John Collins might come back and kind of blow that up  so you got a lot of question marks on these teams that are not necessarily must holds  when you think about somebody like oh I don't know for San Antonio if you're thinking about a Jeremy Sohan or for Utah you're thinking about a bowl Taylor Hendricks or something like that that's a guy that you probably wouldn't miss all that much if he was your 11th guy going on Friday and Sunday  but again  I come back to one main point before I do that I want to give you the quick  like the the fast lightning round edition of who are some of the guys you could look at on those better schedule teams  for the Hawks it's basically DeAndre Hunter and Bruno Fernando I'm assuming everybody else's rostered and frankly DeAndre Hunter is probably roster but Jalen Johnson is back so maybe he got dropped you could think about maybe going that path  and we other teams I mentioned Brooklyn Cleveland Detroit the Lakers the Grizzlies the Sixers Dorian finney-smith maybe trendon Watford he's a maybe for the Cavs it's Levert Spruce if you think he's gonna play in the back-to-back in there and yang Pistons she's amazing met two Marcus Sasser for the Lakers it's really hot tomorrow for the Grizzlies GG Jackson and Jake laravia oh and Lamar Stevens I guess could probably fall into that bucket maybe Kenard but I think he probably sits out of back-to-back and for the Sixers Kelly oubre if he happens to be floating around campaign would be another one I don't think Kyle Lowry's in the back-to-back he hasn't with the Sixers so far so I would be surprised if that magically started this week  but back in the strategy part  the strategy of this week comes down  very specifically  to whether you have available slots to use  on Friday and Sunday  and it really not only comes down to available slots but how many on top of everything else for instance I built a team that for whatever reason doesn't have that many guys going on Friday I only have eight out of 13 players going in my Yahoo public league on Friday this is not really by Design I dropped one dude  trying to remember that played Friday Sunday today already so it would have still only been nine  and that's the thing even though the average there would be 10.4  9 is not that insane  that's without making any additional roster moves to Pivot onto our off of that day  I happen to have a couple of nuggets and three Cavaliers and those guys don't play on Friday  they do play on Sunday  so my Sunday not surprisingly is busier than my Friday by a couple of games actually it's not you know I know Sunday only has one additional NBA game but it's one that's critical for me because it has Cavaliers so when I went into this week I was looking at Friday and Sunday and as of 1201 a.m. today I had nine guys going on Friday and I had I think I would say believe I was overloaded by one on Sunday I think I got 11 going on Sunday so I came into this week knowing that I could actually  make moves and not worry about Friday at least by the on the first move  everybody that I had on my roster that played on Friday  was going to be in my starting lineup for Friday  and so I had to look at my week differently meaning I could make a pickup that played Friday Sunday  replacing someone else I guess that maybe played Sunday or just somebody that was partially heard or whatever and it would still gain me a game played on Friday I wasn't picking up a guy that was just gonna like be my 9th or 10th guy and push someone back out of the lineup on Friday and Sunday yes it was sort of a wash on Sunday and that the example I can use here is TJ McConnell I picked up for crazy who I had  I made a dice roll on Atlanta I didn't work on it all that well last week but you know I I dropped I probably lost a game played there  because crunchy didn't play on Sunday and then I got someone who did  so I actually my team at Den guys going on Sunday and I actually bumped it up to 11 so normally that's kind of stupid but again in this case crunchy he's been doing nothing on the fantasy side so it didn't cost me all that much to dump him because four games of him what the hell am I even gonna get anyway like minimal is nothing  so I didn't have to worry about it all that much but also moving crunchy Saturday game to Friday  didn't really hurt me or you could even say I moved his Thursday game go Friday  you know so I didn't it wasn't like I cost myself multiple games played in that move  that's a bad example though because I took a guy that had the best schedule of the week the other move that that I made was to unload Mitchell Robinson his questionable for the game tomorrow there's no reason for me to hang on to him and I pivoted onto someone who I think I had the exact same schedule as Robinson  Tuesday Thursday Friday Sunday what did I do there I already forgot what it was  oh I think it was Delano Banton  no they go every other day so they go Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday with the next word Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday Sunday so it didn't change my overload days at all it shifted you know what two days my guy played the first four days of the week didn't again no real change there no overloads became a no overloads um but I didn't have to move I didn't have to try to abandon a game on Friday in particular  that's enough about me it's a weird example that took us on a strange road that probably didn't provide any real Clarity for you guys what I'm trying to say is look at your roster and figure out how many games you have to wiggle with late in the week  if you're already maxed out on Friday and Sunday  what you do with your moves  should be too largely of void Friday and Sunday  in fact  and you're like well what's the point of going from 10 down to nine on those days the point of going from 10 down to nine on those days if you're moving off of Friday Sunday now is that you can move back onto them later in the week  so what I did was maybe a little bit hairbrained  but if you have Friday Sunday games that you can spend  it's totally fine to do it  look for somebody that goes  on you know max out those games on Thursday and Saturday because after Saturday's over if you're not full on Sunday you can use whatever moves you have left to fill up your Sunday again it's a really good idea early in the week to use your moves to get on the non overload days  now what I did was again maybe a little bit backwards I sort of looked at it as you know what I'm just gonna take guys that I think are playing really well right now because I'm not super overloaded someone's probably gonna be like scratch on one of those two days so even if I have 11 going on Sunday in all likelihood I'll probably only get 10 of those guys actually into my lineup so I'll just Shuffle out the 11th and I'll play the tent and you know call it a wash  but if you can  look for the teams  and maybe the move is to wait through Friday  like maybe your Friday is 10 games maybe you save all of your damn moves this week and use two on Saturday and two more on Sunday or maybe you three on Saturday and one on Sunday  because again if you play the averages  you probably have about 10 guys going on Friday  if you just play it through on Saturday you probably have a couple and on Sunday you probably have a 11  it's my dog making noises so on Saturday  you can use three moves if you wanted  all guys playing on Saturday and not on Sunday if you like and you're 11 turns into eight on Sunday and then you use one more move on Sunday and you turn that back into a nine but the beauty part is because you had a 11 going before that you actually save an extra game so you gain the games played that were happening anyway  and then you gain the game that you wouldn't have been able to use  it's a very strange week for streaming because a lot of what you do now  won't matter later  there's only one team with three games in four nights right now so you're streaming options are extremely limited and if you can't get DeAndre hunter or maybe Bruno Fernando I I don't think that I would go that path at that point you might as well just hold your moves basically until the end of the week and then max out Saturday  and make sure you don't have wasted games on Friday and Sunday  that's the short version of the long story on this podcast is  make sure  you don't have wasted games play  my opponent in this league which again is a battle for third place because I'm so pissed I lost on  my team just really crapped the bed late in the semifinals but Yahoo publicly because they do pay out for Thursday and I got to make an effort at it I'm pretty I'm not super used to doing that but I'm gonna do it here uh I was looking at what my opponent did and he didn't look at that end of the week situation  I think he had 11 where he has 11 10 and 11 or something like that and he made a move to a guy who added to those days so he has wasted games late in the week  he picked up a guy that'll have two decent games early in the week but I don't know if he's even gonna get to use them later like he's shifted off a guy to get to someone who's the only gonna get two games out of  so make sure that every game your team is playing this week counts  that's the story when you have a 12 and a 13 game or built into your week somehow  take  away from some  ha it's like fantasy socialism take away  from the days that have too much and give to the days that have too few  and it's like oh Dan  I like this one player I've got okay great hold them through Wednesday hold him to Thursday or Friday I know I don't care  dump him late  that comes back to this discussion we had a bunch of times last week that's like well um okay who's a good example of this because there's so many teams with wonky schedule this week oh I don't know  that's a good example teams going like every other day  uh let's say you have a streamer you like and oh I don't know who we're gonna go to here  I need a good Fringe play who's a good Fringe play  Portland has some good Fringe plays  Banton is a pretty good Fringe play right now  and you're like okay well Dan I you know they play Friday Sunday I don't I don't know that I want to go to Atlanta Hawk even though I'm gonna get to use all four of those games and maybe I only get to use two of my Blazers games okay you know what you can do hold your Blazers through Wednesday  and then pick up somebody that goes Thursday Saturday  because then it actually expands your options Atlanta is not the only team that goes Thursday Saturday Denver goes Thursday Saturday and I don't have that many streaming options either but you know they're in the mix Philly goes Thursday Saturday it's a couple of streamers on that club you could go with the team that goes Thursday and some other stuff if you wanted to  hold the player you like until their schedule gets to the point you don't like it anymore and you'll have a better idea what categories you're trying to attack  so don't use more than one or two moves today save the rest for Saturday believe it or not  unless you have like 11 on Friday and 13 on Sunday then you can use it sooner  but not likely to probably have 10 on Friday and 11 on Sunday so save your moves until Saturday  thanks for watching everybody I'm Dan bass we'll be back with you another two shows tomorrow just keep a rolling have a great one everybody we'll see you soon
