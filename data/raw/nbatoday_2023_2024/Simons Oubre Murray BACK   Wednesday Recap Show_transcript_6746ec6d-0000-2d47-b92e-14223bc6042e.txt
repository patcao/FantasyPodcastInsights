welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  good morning everybody we finally finally have some games to recap from yesterday it would appear that my lighting is just  a tad extreme  we're gonna bring that down to a more mellow  sexy dare I say  lighting situation here in my bedroom slash office slash bathroom slash  cave  that's better that's better not too shiny  I'm a pasty fellow I'm fully aware of that I am what you'd call pink of skin  but I don't need to illuminate that for everybody to see welcome to Fantasy NBA today it's Thursday  just one show today we've been going a heavy on the episode's these days but only one showed today find me over on social at Dan best price you know a few years ago I didn't think that I would care about this sort of thing but now I'll fully admit I do  I'm in 19,703 Twitter followers and  I want to get to 20  I know it's embarrassing I shouldn't care but social media gets this grip on you  and now that I have this what you'd call very Niche level Fame now I want it now I crave it like a weirdo  so you could help out on that front go drop a follow over on x.com to at Dan best person I'd be most appreciative this is of course a sports ethos presentation fantasy NBA Today always is a sports ethos presentation that site is sports ethos.com  and the Twitter handle for all your NBA news is ethos fantasy BK by the way we are looping up around on baseball  and then not too distant future Yankees acquired one Soto yesterday so the hot stove is warm and Joe orrico and his amazing baseball team will start having content pumping out for you here basically right after the New Year I know he's got his show going right now but it's almost baseball Fantasy Draft time so that's pretty cool other good stuff going on over at sports ethos that's ethos fantasy BB for baseball if you want to go follow them as well but let's Dive Right In because we actually have some things to recap today that's fun we didn't for a while there  and a mellow level recapping  11 games yesterday and lots of injury related stuff and basically any game where we don't have an obvious one  is a small victory in the grand scheme of things and that first one almost had an injury Daniel Gafford left early  came back however just before half-time and ended up putting up another terrific fantasy line he did all so foul out in 23 minutes because that's the magic of Joel embiid but  Washington kept this game competitive which was kind of fun for everybody because it meant that embiid went for a 50 spot they're just nobody that could guard him on that other side they had they had Danilo Gallinari trying to guard him bead for a while D Anthony Melton remember when you guys were asking if you should drop Anthony Melton this is why you don't he's inside the top 80 now after that slow start  Kelly oubre made his return from injury played 19 and a half minutes at 12 points three boards and an assist looked a little rusty but overall pretty good  I would say make sure he's not on your way for wire because I think as we settle in here is minutes will Trend back towards that 26 to 31 range  and he played relatively well even after the hardened trade before getting hurt it wasn't obviously as big as  when guys were out and Harden was sitting and they didn't have Batum and Covington and whoever helped Marcus Morris  because those guys combined played something like 51 minutes yesterday but Uber is going to take some of those minutes back  I also think we're in a little bit of a by low on Tobias Harris for whatever that's where he started the year super hot just like he did last season he's now cool Todd he'll be okay  just kind of finding his space and honestly in this ball game  anybody taking a shot besides him bead was kind of a win for the Wizards because Joel was fully Unstoppable  anyway make sure to make sure Uber is not floating around on your waiver wire as far as the Wizards go if they can keep games close we can get okay fantasy lines at 20 points and 8 assists with a steel and two blocks fantastic line from tyus  and this is why I cannot ever advise a drop on this dude  because if the Wizards and they're the Wizards aren't about 50% of their games have been competitive this year  if that number was just 55% right now tyus Jones would be inside the top 100 as it stands he's at 103 on basketball monster which I mean honestly that's close you can get without actually being inside the top 100 but  I think you guys sort of get what I'm what I'm  not at all hinting at here which is that they're just aren't that many guys floating around out there that have that level of upside meaning all his team needs to do is remain competitive until the final two minutes of a basketball game and tyus Jones is a top 75 or better play  Yahoo actually has him ranked number 94 so he's actually inside the top 100 on Yahoo right now it's just sort of depends on what metric you're looking at and guys are all so bunched together as of course a garbage truck goes by guys are so bunched together at that the difference between 103 and 94 is basically negligible it's like one steal for tyus Jones so far so I mean that's basically the same thing  103.94 those guys are separated by nothing  that's the same separation as like one slot in the second round  but again this is why you're hanging onto these dudes even Jordan Poole was a little bit better in this ball game he did no peripheral stuff but at least he didn't shoot all that poorly  Kyle kuzma you guys know my stance on Coos and you guys can keep arguing with me all you want but I've watched him long enough to know that the stuff we were seeing from him and have basically seen for this season so far is just not who he's been for his whole career now  meaning the 47% from the field and 82 and changed at the free throw line those are numbers that are just like lie to come down  maybe the field goal percent stays a little higher but I don't expect that free throw to hold and when it does that you see the tapering he's already down to number 72  and it's not the counting stats that are doing it  he's being held by percentage is that to me feel like once he probably can't so the nice thing about kuzma and we've had him on the cell High board a couple of times so I don't want to go too deep down that rabbit hole but because he's scoring 23 points with six boards and five assists and two and change three pointers you can probably trade for someone who is very close to him in rank because most people don't think that he's a traditional sell high and that's fine yakka portals right nearby Yusuf nurkic right nearby Jared Allen I don't think you're trading for Zach Levine who just got ruled out for another month unless they trade him before then because then he'll probably play wherever he goes  Demar Vu she's got all in the 60s you could probably get most of them for kuzma  that's keep moving  Memphis Gigantor game from Desmond Bane Gigantor game launched himself up back inside the top 20 on the year with this one he's now number 19 per game  only however five more games until Jacques comes back so at some point here is gonna take a small hit and look let's be on that when we know there's gonna be hit we just don't know exactly how large it's gonna be it's probably not going to be inside the top 20 once John comes back he'll still be fine he's not like it's gonna turn Desmond It Go bad fantasy player but  if you can move him right now for someone inside the top 25 or top 30 I think I would try to do so if you can't that's fine he still going to be good he just not gonna be quite this good  JJ 24 points on good shooting with three blocks little by little baby steps are being now obviously playing against the Pistons Health but there's a couple good ones in a row for Jared Jackson we had him on the buy board a couple of times when he was hovering in the 90s and then he dropped outside of the top 100 and now he's back into the 70s just a few good ball games is all it takes I don't know that anybody else healthy at least on the Grizzlies needs to be rostered right now basically everyone else split the minutes almost evenly  they're like six or seven other guys that all played about 24 minutes in this ball game which means that's not really enough for any of them the closest you might argue I know John conchar I had the best fan is he game yesterday but we're talking more about sort of the aggregate would be Santi aldama who played 26 minutes that was the highest Mark of anybody not named Bane or Jaron Jackson in yesterday's contest and we also know that aldama can put up some fantasy stats so if you have a roster spot you can hang on there I don't think you have to though  Jalen Duren another ankle injury  he made it at least to the end of this ball game basically before having to come out with it best basketball monster says he's out five ballgames it's that's sort of an educated guess we have gotten a report on it presumably it'll be a couple at least because he has lingering ankle stuff and they're not gonna push him up now when you've got a team that's losing no matter what you do  what we don't know is who the hell is going to play for him because Marvin Bagley has been completely eliminated from the rotation James Wiseman finally saw 8 minutes of action yesterday  they could just go small you might see them go small you might see  Isaiah Stewart as the full-time five and if that's the case then he would be a pickup because he's been terrible playing as a power forward  but I don't know there's been no indication as to what the next thing they're gonna try is in Detroit and losing Duran is is pretty crushing because he was actually a plus two in this ball game that is you may recall they lost by 14  so rut row bad gets worse for the Pistons who haven't won since October  well at least boy and bug zdanowicz is kicking butt  he's definitely not on Waiver Wires anymore so hopefully you got in there and stashed him before you came back Jayden IVs 5 defensive stats to show for his 24 minutes in this game I'm not trusting him if he's coming off the bench Killian Hayes played 27 minutes at 12 four and four  I think you could probably hold on Hayes I'm not super excited about him because so far in his young career the fantasy game hasn't really a fleshed itself out yet  but he is starting and we heard Monty Williams say that he's gonna shorten his rotation so I don't know if that means that you know more minutes for Hays maybe more minutes for Ivy hard to say regardless  there are some questions now for the Pistons one of them being us our Thompson and whether or not he's ever going to play decent minutes again I'm gonna assume the answer is yes at some point  but he's been benched here  and I don't expect that to magically flip and then the next ball game but you never know here's the thing  we had him on our cell board not two days ago but the previous week I started Thompson he was already falling and I was like this dude's gonna fall farther because he's a rookie and he hasn't even really hit the rookie wall yet and then it got way worse because he got bench and his minutes got cut in half basically  I think he's gonna get dropped in a lot of spots and I don't think it's that crazy two drop him if you have him because you probably need somebody on your team that's actually producing something problem of course is that we've now seen what he can do when he gets actual playing time  and we'd all feel a little bit silly if he was on somebody else's team when he starts playing decent minutes again which I have to believe will at some point come back around this year so if you have Thompson do whatever you can to try to stash  if you don't watch the person who has him like a hawk because he may end up on your waiver wire  another early injury from yesterday's card was Jalen Suggs and this one was kind of stupid because he turned ankle or kind of like landed awkwardly while going for a steel and it almost seemed like the ankle flexed backwards instead of to the side and then he tried to play through it which is just like the ultimate idiotic move someone should have been like Suggs you've been hurt your whole career so far don't push it right now they were down like 20 points at the time too but then he tried to play through it  elevated to get a block shot which he did block by the way so he ended up with two steals at a block and yesterday's game but it seemed like that ankle was hurting even before he landed on that jump for the block shot  either way he was not moving well took two players to kind of shoulder carry him off the floor  I'm gonna assume he's out for a little while we don't have a report on him yet and people were like Dan do I go pick up Gary Harris he doesn't really have Fantasy game anymore there's a fleeting possibility  that Gary Harris could put up fantasy numbers  fleeting  but even when you look at his games this year even when he's gotten 2829 minutes it's been iffy  you know yesterday we ended up playing 31 minutes off the bench at 83 with a steel he just not a focal point  he gets hot that's the only way that it happens  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning

result of this is that jaylen's or Cole Anthony is is just going to have more on his plate  and you saw it already yesterday  1972 with the steel and a couple blocks he played 32 minutes  even while Cole Anthony he's been hot lately he hasn't been playing typically this many minutes  29 seems to be the number that they've kind of landed him on but he's almost gonna have to get in the 30s now  you can expect low 30s and minutes which makes him very much a play in all formats he already was because he'd been running so hot for about two and a half three weeks but now there's like there's nothing standing in his way that's Cole Anthony we're talking about  golgappa Todd say and Moe Wagner in this battle for sediment it's it's kind of turned into like bag of sand against bag of sand and neither one of them ended up being useful there was a stretch there were Google looked like he could hunt kind of hang out near the edge of the top one hundred but even that doesn't feel like it's necessarily set in stone you can do better elsewhere and we'll tell you where in just a game or two and nothing really on the Cleveland side  other than I'm still getting questions about whether or not I think Max druce can keep it going and like  still number 57  we're two months into the season now  he had five fouls by the way yesterday's game if one of my spruces minutes were down by like three or four Georges niang also played a little better every once in a while you get that big niang game and Spruce loses three or four minutes but not much to worry about there and then Jared Allen had a horrible foul trouble he had five thousand nineteen and a half minutes if you're worried about that one that also contributed to Extra niang  but don't worry about Jared Allen he's he's been finding actually put up an okay fantasy line and this one other than the four turnovers in only 19 minutes anyway  the zombie heat knocked off the Raptors who really I mean this is kind of an embarrassing loss for Toronto he were without Tyler hero and Bam out of bio  and kind of  the Robinson twins that's a joke by the way I'm fully aware that they're not related or Lando Robinson feeling in for bam out of Bio its Center he's a great fill in play right now because we know bam is still a couple games away and I think Orlando Robinson is floating around on most Waiver Wires because everybody's looking at it like you want me to pick up who  but he's had three games this year Robinson has where he's played  basically 28 minutes there was another one where he played 26 even that one was pretty decent  if you look at the four games screw we'll just log them all where he's played 26 minutes or more his numbers in those were 117 and 7 with a steal that was in 26 minutes and 27 and a half minutes he had 14 nine and two of the steel tube blocks and his last two games 16 5 and 3 with a couple of three pointers and this most recent one 1512 and 4 with 3 steals a block and two threes  he looks like a juicy juicy stream play right now and I am fully blown away that he's not more universally rostered for as long as bam is out  Orlando Robinson looks like he has some serious Fantasy game  so adamant as many places as you can because I believe the last report we got on out of bio and we can check on this but I'm pretty sure that he got ruled out for a whole week  anywho Duncan Robinson also a stream while Tyler hero is out Caleb Martin is a little bit more iffy at 24 and 12 here but he's been he sort of appears and disappears fully almost at random this was like the Kayla Barton we saw in the playoffs for the Heat last year he's played big minutes in you know basically five consecutive ball games and he's able to score a little bit in those but this was the only one where the peripheral stats were usable  he did have a seven rebound game to go all the way back like four or five games back  so if you want to stream Caleb Martin I'm not totally against it  I'm a little bit against it because he's running super hot right now he shot 50% or better in five consecutive ball games and we've seen when he can when he really starts cooking like playoff Caleb Martin that he could be a hell of a fantasy play but unfortunately only has three Steals and a block over those five games the assists have been like you know whatever the rebounds have been okay but mostly it's been points threes on Goodfield goal percent and that to me is like  maybe makes more sense in head than Rodeo it's not like quite enough categories for me to really take the plunge especially because the field goal percent could cool off at any moment and then you don't have those other categories to fall back on in a way that I know that sounds crazy to say Duncan Robinson  is actually putting up some stuff in other categories besides just threes  even Kyle Lowry at a terrible ball game here he's been streamable with Tyler hero out I think we might be seeing a little bit of the shine come off of Jaime hot kez Junior  and it's to be expected young dude had all the adrenaline in the universe for those first few ball games they still played okay yesterday but the rebounds of taper the assist the steals all that stuff that the energy stuff is tapering as he starts to  sort of  get those we call kind of walking in mud a little bit now  all that to say I think I like the Robinson streams Lowry and then if you need threes and some points you probably go Caleb Martin  Josh Richardson also played 31 minutes for whatever that's worth but  he's the guy you certainly trust more when Jimmy Butler's out for Toronto oh yeah no no be fine finally finally with a really nice ball game  he's gonna need a few more to get anywhere near where he was drafted but he's a guy we've had on our Bilo board so it's good to see some of those coming around Pascal siakam also had a nice ball game he's also been a pretty obvious by low the question more was like what the price on him I don't think was quite low enough and then you know not surprisingly Scotty Barnes is not going to be able to put up those ridiculous numbers every single ball game he's still number 14 it's been an unbelievable start to the year I just I feel pretty strongly that Scotty Barnes is gonna end up falling back towards 25 again still very very good but if you can get somebody inside the top 20 I think I probably would for him  and then the one that was making me feel like a total idiot was Dennis Schroder who has now fallen outside the top one ten after his hot start he's been out the top 150 for the last three weeks in a row and I no longer feel like an idiot thank goodness great head dad play for points and assists  and some free throws but very weak in a handful of categories and that's what's been weighing him down and Dennis Schroder is now back exactly where we thought he would be  phew and ended up getting that one right just a weird path to get there  Brooklyn over at Atlanta and a game that had over 40 40 40 lead changes in it that's one of the most ever since League changes in a ball game were tracked kind of a fun little stat  uh cam Johnson  Rolling Along he was another one of those bylaws who I thought we were able to get  even after he had already jumped from like 120 up to 90 I still thought he was a Buy Low and he's been rolling top 50/55 range the last two weeks and I still don't know that anybody's even really noticed  Dorian Finney Smith has been serviceable off the bench I don't think that he's a roto play the guys you probably want me to talk about are Spencer didn't witty and cam Thomas who both had their minutes down in this ball game  actually a lot of broken players had their minutes like semi shaved a little bit here  bench units were having good runs so they got a little bit of extra run so don't worry too much about that that's why Dennis Smith Jr got a little extra and Finney Smith got a little extra day Ron Sharpe got a little extra Roy so Neil got a little extra  I have been saying on this pod for a week that I'm worried about what's going to happen to Dinwiddie when cam Thomas comes back this isn't really how I thought this was gonna go  cam Thomas was always someone that was gonna run either extraordinarily hot or extraordinarily cold this terrible ball game dropped him down to number 94 on the season because basically all he's doing right now is points and free throw percent  steals blocks are low assists rebounds low I guess threes is okay  and you know that's enough because he's been good enough in those categories to where it's floated his value but when you're only good in two or three categories and if you have a bad game in those categories it it really looks bad and that's sort of what happened here but you're obviously holding onto Camp Thomas you're holding Dinwiddie  although I will repeat again historically he doesn't have the world's greatest Fantasy game low field goal percent  free throw percent that's kind of a net neutral which is unusual guys that have low fuel goal and take a lot of free throws usually there guys that kind of helped you and one of the other he doesn't really help you in either one and he hurts you a lot and feel goal  turn over his tend to be on the higher side he's been able to keep those down so far this year but he reminds me a lot of Dennis Schroder he'll get you points assists  Not the Same free throw percent but better three-pointers than Schroeder  but it's hard for guys that are only good at a couple categories to stay high enough rank wise and so I do still have this feeling that dinwiddie's gonna end up back outside the top 100  you guys can yell at me all you want but we've watched him long enough to know what he is when he's not  getting super efficient looks right next to Luka doncic and that is a guy who's High usage but sometimes hurts more than he helps  you're almost definitely holding him in head-to-head all so but I like I'm not playing in with he in Roto right now if I had him on a roster I wouldn't play him  and against the game's cap  I will say it again and I know what actually is harder right now that it has been before on yeco Kong will remains a hold I know he's been very bad the last week because he's just sort of not doing anything in his time on the floor is deals and blocks or lower than we need them to be kind of the field goal percent to kick back up a little he's dropped into the mid-50s  it is what it is click the pill has been healthy so far  we don't usually see capella played two consecutive months of basketball without missing of all game but that's what's happened to this point so Capella's inside the top 65 and Kong was in that 120 range and that sort of what it is so Congo is a 90 to 100 130 ish range guy when Capella's healthy and he's top 40 when Capella's hurt  which is tough because how long can you sit on a guy like that well if he's running cold if you're in Roto you can go ahead and bench him head-to-head I think you gotta hang on because you know at some point the juice is gonna be there and in the meantime it's not like he's been so bad that he's killing your team he's just sort of like  right outside every day play  he's stream level with ridiculous upside  so I'd eat basing to be enjoying life without Jalen Johnson all the Hawks as a team are not because they've stopped winning with Outland Johnson  Womp  Spurs finally realized that Jeremy Sohan a point guard wasn't the answer and then facepalm time  nope not trade Jones at Point  chitty Osmond  now technically he's not the point guard technically Devin vassell was the point guard  but Osmond led the team in a six assists with six  Tre Jones the second on the team with five and his 23 and a half bench it's did this lineup work any better the answer is  Minnesota didn't look like they were taking this game all that seriously so you got good ones from vassell and keldon Johnson and you might you know my take any time those two guys put up a big ball game I think you try to sell on him  Wendy finally slowed down in a ball game but obviously he'll be fine Victor webinar but nobody's trading him anyway he's number 33 right now be bouncing back and forth depending on percentages and things of that nature  I saw a couple analysts talking about how you wanted to like hang on and see what happens to Sohan he's outside the top 200 for the year I don't know that anybody was still hanging on so no  and then Zach Collins I like that he took 20 shots I don't like that he only made six of them he's also a hold but he's kind of a tougher hold all so  Spurs are God awful  tried to warn you guys about this going into the season  remember when they won like two games early and the media was like Spurs are coming for a play in spot and I was like yeah no  nobody like look  there are a lot of pretty good analysts out there but you really do have to watch this a lot  it's not a two hour a day thing to be good at this it's more  I don't usually try to get up on the high horse on that one  but you can't be a mess around analyst and I'm not talking about fantasy I'm talking about like all the way across  because there were a lot of people that looked at this team and they're like oh yeah gonna be fine no  Wendy's rookie year you think they're gonna be gunning for anything hell no  anyway Rudy gobert is bounced back he had two really good weeks to start the year and then he had two kind of bad weeks and now he's back to being good again it's a weird back and forth that's seems to be based heavily on his free throw percent  Mike Conley just  zooming along  doing what he did in Utah  but kind of with the team that I would say appreciates it more  that means anything he's number 66 and 9 cat he has a six to one assist to turn over ratio this year  crazy  Anthony Edwards came back  to kill dogs are and Alexander Walker continued to start a small forward you continue to do nothing nazri design one of his little heater's right now I think you can play him until he decides to take a week to sort of regather his strength  I'm okay with that I'm okay with playing a guy who's a hot hand that's what nasri is right now  Chicago wins again  I know it's the Hornets so it's not like you're gonna really celebrate this but  the Bulls have been markedly better without  injured Zach LaVine and that's of course one of the big pieces of news is that Levine yesterday got quote unquote reevaluated and they decided to just shut him down for another three or four weeks I guess the foot isn't feeling any better after one week off or you know I guess the paperwork on whatever trades are being processed and didn't come through quite yet in any event  we'll do Bulls before Hornets in this one even though that's not the order I normally go in Kobe white it continues to be a very good play once Levine went down he's been killing it  Demar just waiting on to Mars free throw percent to work all the way back up where we know it's going to be once it does he slides up the board pretty easily  Alex Caruso's a play anytime he's healthy and upright the questions I think people have on this team right now is what do we do with Patrick William's  and Oriole and my thought is  Patrick Williams has been good enough over the past  really like  not really since Levine got shut down if you want to call it that he had a couple of really good ball games when both LaVine and Demar or Caruso were out  and he's sitting at like  top 150 over the last week and a half but a lot of that's because he's gone I think two for six at the free throw line or something like that so it's got to sort of artificially weighing his numbers down the other stuff is actually pretty good over that strike so I think you could make an argument to just stash Patrick Williams now  that doesn't seem like Zach Williams gonna play another game for the Bulls that's certainly the direction this feels it's moving  if they keep winning ball games they might see what a team looks like and I know that's what AK  karna Silva said that he wanted  to do which is let's see what we get back for Levine and let's see if that makes the team any better  still feels like the kind of have to blow it up  but if that's gonna take more time  then that's the type of thing that could push Patrick Williams back outside the realm of usage like what if Zach LaVine gets traded to I have no idea doesn't sound like that that many teams really want him right now but let's just throw a team out there and say the Lakers who would go back  I think it'd be D'Angelo Russell and probably you know one of those wings  that would hurt a lot of guys I don't think that's gonna happen I don't think the Lakers want to go that route in fact Lakers  played pretty well last few ball games since they've had their wings healthy so I don't know that and it sounds like they're more interested in Caruso or DeMar  but anyway I just throwing a hypothetical out there guys that come back create log jams  so Kobe White's the obvious one William's I think if you have space you could do it  and he's been barely playable in most formats lately  well we kind of need one more usage guy out of the way whether it's Demar or vouch or white Caruso being gone frees up more minutes which is useful but we just need Patrick Williams taking shots  shots shots shots  hey quickly here because we're a little more than halfway through yesterday's card now that a nice chunk of you are actually watching and hanging

off other than Shea Gill just out Alexander but Jalen still a top 80 play over the last week week and a half so he's been coming on I'm not really worried about it in any way  and man I just like  I was tweeting about it but I feel like it needs to be said I know Shea Gill just Alexander's the number one player in fantasy lately he feels like a top five player in real life  he's fully Unstoppable  he's fully Unstoppable he shooting 55% from the field right now 93% at the free throw line  I don't know that there's anybody in the league that's been more efficient  then Jill just Alexander  not indeed not yoke it's this year because yoga shouldn't make in his free throws and in fact after yogic bad shooting game yesterday Shea is ahead of him in field goal percentage this year  on the same volume  it's crazy how good she's become he is fully unguardable  fully unguardable  he is taking this Thunder team which look I'll give you they have some decent talent but like  there's no other star on that team  that's Shea and some like above average role players and Chet is solid but he's not a superstar Jalen Williams solid not a star  Lou Dort decent Defender but  yeah Josh giddey  I know they lost yesterday so it's weird for me to go into a Thunder's rain after a loss but that team is 13 and 7 this year basically on Shea who's missed one ball game so far  and that's gonna be the key for them if he plays 70 some odd ball games they're gonna have a good record at the end of the year  so far so good  Aaron holiday went nuts for the Rockets didn't see that one coming and it'll probably never happen again so shuffle along Dillon Brooks had his first good ball game since I don't know last time they played the Lakers usually that's when he wakes up  and then  I'll print had one of those like oh ball games yesterday where all the counting stuff looked pretty good and then you got across the board and you were like wait I wonder how he did at the free throw line and oh  shenko gotten worse at the foul line I did not see that one coming um  and it's weighing his stats down because the county stuff is amazing he's a 219 and 5 and a half  point nine steals 0.8 blocks that's not bad either 54 from the field that's all so solid  but a high volume now 65% of the free throw line and that's why he's number 55 and 9 cat  he wasn't drafted as a punt free throw guy that's the problem here too if you drafted him you were like oh we're gonna get like a smattering of everything and he's gotten better in all the stuff and you're like this is all wonderful and then fell off a cliff at the foul line I don't know what's going on there  sort of Ypsi  anyway um he's interesting one because if you think free throws are coming back for Shen then you buy  but if you think this is what he is you probably sell because his points boards and assists are so juicy right now that you can probably sell for a player ranked higher than him especially if you find a team that either doesn't mind to that he thinks the foul line this year or is already punting that  so it's this weird occurrence where you could sell up  again if you think the free throw number comes back though then it's a buy  what do I think I have no idea none there's no way for me to know and saying anything else would be just pulling stuff out of the sky  so Dallas beat Utah by a couple of points oh 50 wasn't it oh sorry about that it would appear  that Utah might need a couple of their scoring threats back  they don't have any right now Larry Martin and Jordan Clarkson are both out  they nobody left that can put a basketball on a hoop on this team and it's going to make everybody terrible because defending a bad offensive team is not that hard  kante George did have 11 assists yesterday but he was absolutely atrocious in everything else and he continues to be exactly what we've said but I'll repeat it again Head to Head he's a long-term stash and you just pray to the fantasy gods that he doesn't put up a game like this one Roto he's a drop  oh man you're at 7 is a stream at best Walker Kessler is a Buy Low in my opinion right now because people still don't think that he's gonna come on but he gets much better when the team gets healthy because  he can just go and operate off of them get offensive rebounds from you know Clarkson and marketing and stuff  he could defend better because I mean well okay so look Dallas is always going to be curtains on an opposing setter  but Kessler's a Buy Low and what else is there I know I thought Colin Sexton might score 15 points in this game but he shot over four from the field so John Collins was not good the whole team was just terrible  but the story here is they need someone who is competent on offense in there  because it allows everybody else to operate a little bit more easily too on the Dallas side Kyrie Irving and Tim Hardaway Jr both came back yesterday Hardaway actually had a pretty good ball game and only 22 bench minutes but we know how he runs hot and cold so ignore  a lot of folks are trying to convince me that Derek Jones Junior was a safe play I don't think he's a safe play but with Grant Williams and Josh Green out  it does kind of feel like he has to get enough minutes to be playable here certainly on the head-to-head side I don't think that I would risk it in Roto only Roto plays for this team obviously Kyrie and Luca and then Derek Lively is all so a star on the Roto side  Nicola yokich human it would appear took 32 field goal attempts yes yesterday and couldn't make him  yet with he had a triple double but it I mean this was truly one of the worst Joker game that I can remember  believe it or not he was still a plus one in a game they lost by nine bench just got wiped out for by dead or for Denver in this ball game starters were solid Jamal Murray came back played 29 minutes that's more than enough so get him fired up Reggie Jackson is now an easy cut that's probably the whole story on the Denver side  for the Clippers  James Harden just getting better every ball game  I mean this is the thing this is why you were able to buy low after the trade  because he had some down ball games  I still can't believe that I was able to draft this dude James Harden in the 50s and 60s in those last few drafts before the season started  and I know you can say Dan you didn't know that he was gonna get traded that quickly know we kind of did  because he was a dark cloud over the 76ers and they just couldn't afford to let it go that way so they just had to make something happen  he's a second rounder now  on the year  last week and a half two weeks I think was it two weeks or week and a half  where is he at over that stretch it was it week or week and a half  last week yeah last week he's all so a second rounder  last two weeks  mid second round  just feels like he's getting better and every ball game too so ride it out now Paul George bounced back in this one Kawhi Leonard was a little bit quieter not bad necessarily but a little bit quieter and I keep getting teased by Norman Powell who played 32 minutes and had a pretty full stat line  I don't know guys I don't know every time I think he's a go then he's not every time I think he's not then he is I think you can probably leave him alone but for a schedule play on Powell that's probably the easiest way to handle this one  I don't think you need to add him specially when you've got these other guys getting hurt that's creating streaming opportunities so leave it alone  Anfernee Simons came back for the Blazers and then Malcolm Brogden went down for the Blazers and if you thought ooh does this means Skylar maze is going to play again the answer is no  because they're gonna roll Point Scoot and point shade and sharp and point Anthony Simons  so you don't need to add Skyler maze  I still don't think well you know you guys know the deal with scoot at this point he's learning the NBA speed he won't be good for another month or two he's a luxury stash  and sharp played 42 minutes he basically has no choice but to play every second of these games right now now again with Brockton out and Jeremy Grant out and DeAndre Aiden was out for this ball game  so he had a lot of weirdness for the Blazers Plus on top of that to Monte Cara fouled out in 27 minutes Jabari Walker fouled out in 22 minutes uh and wreath almost fouled out you had 5,022 minutes  so what does that mean for the next one honest to goodness we have no idea anybody that says they know exactly how the Blazers are going to run their minutes no we have an idea a small one I shouldn't say no idea we have a little one Matisse diable picked up a few extra minutes when everybody fouled out he's interesting because you know if he gets 30 minutes he'll put a four defensive stats but we don't know if he's gonna get 30 in the next one  we don't know if Aidan's gonna be back for the next ball game  pretty sure Jeremy Grant's gonna miss another one  Brogden I have no idea if he plays in their next ball game so what do you do  well you start Simon's because dude took 27 shots in this one you probably start sharp because there's just so much usage even though his percentage is often stink and he has these sort of young player efficiency issues  he's probably gonna do enough  stuff in 40 some odd minutes that it kind of doesn't matter he's inefficient  he just hasn't enough things to do with all these guys out  if Brogden plays you started if 8 in plays you started and probably leave it at that and then if we look over at the Warrior's side Chris Paul came back he played 21 minutes wasn't very good in them but he'll be okay  Andrew Wiggins also came back played 28 minutes he was terrible again  we had that one good ball game from Wiggins any mashed his finger in a car door  and he couldn't keep the Good Vibes rolling  I truly I think you can probably drop Wiggins and then just pick him up if it looks like he's getting it going  I didn't draft him anywhere I did pick him up in one League where he got dropped after that big ball game but now I'm inclined to feel like maybe I should just drop him again specially because Steve her came out and he's like look our like our starting unit isn't working  and right now it feels like Wiggins would be the guy to take the hit there I don't think that they bench Klay Thompson he's sort of too much of an icon for the team even if he's been kind of terrible he has been top 90 the last two weeks prior to this one  so Clays at least been closer  and if we gets benched then he definitely isn't a fantasy play Moses Moody would probably take his spot but I don't know we'll see we'll see if it's just Bluster or if he's actually gonna move some body's around Jonathan kaminga had a really good second half in this ball game he didn't play in the first half does that buy him some extra playing time does he get in there  Warriors have some unanswered questions and perhaps the next ball game will afford US an answer  tonight's card is a short two gamer it's the semifinals in Vegas the game start early they started about four hours from this moment as I'm recording the podcast  Indiana there really isn't anything other than stream stuff which if you guys are interested sure you could stream Obi topping you can stream Aaron any Smith  but then everybody else is a little bit iffy TJ McConnell and Andrew nembhard split like 14 back a point guard minutes in the last ball game Jalen Smith is out or he might have been the guy to look at  so  bucks  Port is a stream level guy  and then  you know maybe campaign marjon Beauchamp could be  distant streamables of only because this week is super weird  Pelicans don't really have any streamables either anymore now that Trey Murphy is in there and mccollum's back they've got sort of a top six and then everybody else's scraping at the ground for whatever's left Najee Marshall Dyson Daniels Jose Alvarado is probably the closest to playable because at least he gets Steals and limited minutes and then the Lakers have the same problem  as the Pelicans they just got a bunch of guys healthy too  cam reddish came back  really hachimura came back Jarred Vanderbilt came back  jaxson Hayes came back  they got four rotation guys back in a week  Pelicans got two rotation three rotation guys back in a week  having that many rotation guys is bad for Fantasy purposes good for the team teams got better  but for those of us that were like oh maybe we can get Cameron 30 minutes he might get me two steals nothing is guaranteed anymore  if the matchup doesn't work they'll go another Direction  so anything you're streaming with these teams and you know those some of those names I threw out their reddish Tori and Prince hachimura these guys you could play this week today basically because everybody's an overflow mode tomorrow 13 game Friday  but these are not guys that even make the stream board once we hit a normal week  these are very Frenchy these are you know 150 to 200 range dudes that's like you're not getting very much out of that maybe later 150 to 250 so to look at it tonight is not all that thrilling games are at 2 and 6 Pacific  there's like an hour and a half break basically in between the two ball games but  it's the tourney they're playing on the same court so I think they want to give a little bit of a respite in between let the teams come in change locker rooms all that stuff and that's why the schedules a little bit caca maybe today but I love it I love having afternoon basketball it's literally the only good thing about the covid bubble is that we had games going all day they started at noon and they ran until the end of the night because they're only two courts and they were getting 7/8 games in  that was amazing everything else about 2020 was awful  truly horrible  except for that  oh and that all of our Los Angeles teams won championships that was pretty good too I guess but look  at least they were games all the time all right we're 50 minutes in this is longer than I thought we'd go I will do five questions normally I do them chronologically but when I run out of time like this I want to try to find the questions that apply to as many people as possible here's one thoughts on Amen Thompson in Houston what I prefer to stash him or Jaden McDaniels well Aman's playing in the G league right now and I know he put up a giant line down there but there's no room for him in Houston unless about three guys get hurt so Jaden McDaniels because he's the guy between these two that might see an NBA floor in the next couple of weeks  so there you go let's see we talked about Patrick William's that was one of the ones I covered during the show and it's also in the chat room  here we go hey Dan big fan first time caller ha very funny it's like doing an old time radio show is it better to get a one game up to date with a stream or try to get someone better on the wire that's a really good question this is very much match up specific so I'm in a match at also standings specific  so I'm gonna leave I'll use this as an example where I had fewer games than my opponent four of the first five weeks the only way I know this is because I was like I feel like I've had fewer games and I checked and I've won turnovers basically every week that's nuts that's like just not something that happens and head to head  so then it gets to this week consequently I didn't get off to a very good start in that league and its 11 categories so if you're down in games played they're even more categories for you to lose because field goal made and free throw made are all so in there so if you're down in games played like you very easily could lose seven to four every week  so for me it was more important for me to try to get an extra ball game  even if that's like even if it cost me a slightly better player I need to try to squeeze out a categorical win any little categorical win coming back because  I like I just I've had horrible luck so far  I'm in another Head to Head League that's a Yahoo publicly this one where  the games played this week a relatively evenly matched and looking at my roster I think I'm gonna beat my opponent  and I'm in like 5th Place my team had some injuries the first two or three weeks so I got off to a bad start but the last two weeks has been good that one I'm not doing any extra streaming today I just dreamed the one guy one guy that was it so uh look and look at your surroundings look at your standings look at your matchup this week try to figure out kind of a short and long-term View and that's how you can make a call on this but again it's it's different literally for every team and I've done it two separate ways I'm only in three Yahoo head to head leaks because you guys know I hate them and I'm playing two of them on completely opposite ways  let's see quick shohei ohtani thoughts Dan where is he gonna go  I think he's gonna surprise everybody it's gonna be a dark horse team  but it really can't be because there's only like four or five teams that are willing to  give 600 million dollars to a baseball player  I think I said it on yesterday's show I think the Dodgers were purposely sabotaging their own chances at him  because they'd rather go for like two or three top lines starting pitchers instead of a guy who can't pitch until next season  but wherever he ends up showing he's the most amazing player I've I think I've ever seen  I'm 40 so maybe there was somebody better before that but he's the most amazing thing I've seen in baseball ever  and he's one of the most amazing things I've seen in any sport ever  guys shouldn't be like  he's  there's no higher league for him to play in  two-way guys they that's like the best player on your college team where it was like oh yeah this guy like he's gonna be a big league or someday that's what show is doing too big leakers  he could say healthy  I know not a basketball question but it was sort of a fun one  let's see here anything else that applies to everybody  should I oh should I drop Obi topping for scoot Henderson this is an interesting question because it brings up this idea of like Obi topping is going to be probably like a top one 40 guy basically forever  he's been top 60 the last two weeks because Indiana has had a bunch of guys get hurt and he had like a like a three or four game stretch where his shot was going in at a super high clip you shouldn't 60% on the Year by the way or you pick up the guy that you think could have like top 50 60 potential the last month and a half of the Season I'm inclined to go the top in route because lately he has been like an actual usable fantasy player we don't know how long Jaylon Smith is going to be out and you know maybe top and continues to shoot this really good percentage it's possible maybe he plays his way into an extra one or two minutes all of these things are possible I wouldn't say probable with brick Carlyle at the helm but I go top in there I prefer this short term because I would rather play try to get myself towards that one or two seat on the head to head side and then in Rhode Island you know the top is actually playable right now if you're at a game's deficit  and if you're running ahead in games played on the Roto side then you probably go the other way and you go with the stash because you don't need that roster slot  is Oculus still holding a 10 team her that's a good question I think the answer there is no  12 team or yes 10 team or no  should I drop Dennis Schroder to activate Jamal Murray see if you can trade Schroeder for a top 100 guy who's appeal is not quite so localized in one category  would you drop John Collins for tyus Jones or herb Jones what is Herb Jones doing on the waiver wire he's been a top 40 player this year  he's number 30 right now absolutely dropped for herb Jones  and I would actually probably take Ty's Jones over John Collins also  and that  is probably where we'll put a pin in it 56 minutes I think is enough plus I got a busy day I gotta play my play gig tonight so if you guys are interested I call some division to college basketball it's Cal Poly Pomona maybe somebody watching went there it's so much fun I love it but I gotta drive out there early in the day because traffic would take me like three hours if I wait until closer to rush hour so I'm not  but if you guys want to hear more Dan that would be the way to do it because that's like you know three and a half four hours of broadcasting for a little little back-to-back there I think I saw one last question I wanted to do before we wrap this up this one's good one because I think it may apply to multiple people Walker Kessler or Derek Lively who has the better upside for the fantasy playoffs so you guys are forcing me to open up my my schedule grid while we're talking on are here first of all it's gonna have something to do with when your playoffs are Utah starting after the All-Star break they go 3334434 so if your playoffs are late Utah has a really good playoff schedule Dallas unfortunately has a two gamer right smack in the middle of that but if you playoffs start before that they go four three four two four three four so if you somehow dodged that one week Dallas is the team you're looking at  unfortunately if that two game are slips in there then that makes them sort of a tough team for a lot of purposes in playoffs  Kyrie and Luca you're in real trouble if you're have those guys as sort of your top dudes with a two gamer  you're gonna be in survival mode Lively in a two-game week playoff time might not be what you'd call a traditional start  now that said if you dodge that  then they've got two sets of 11 on either side  and that same week Utah has four games  I think most of us I've been telling everybody to try to end their season at least three weeks early I don't know how many people have listened to that but that would mean that Utah goes 334 in the playoff weeks and Alice goes three four two  which is the same number of games  but a clunkier way to get there  that would mean in your finals then you'd have a two game or at a Dallas  I think I'd prefer Walker Kessler is the short answer to a long short version of a long answer but three four out of lively those first two weeks and then maybe you end up dropping him in the two game or  again it depends a little bit on what your playoff weeks are but hopefully that was helpful all right everybody have a great Thursday tomorrow I think we're gonna have two shows I'm actually really excited about this we should have a little Dynasty show that'll be sort of like a pocket you know 20-ish minute specialty thing I've been wanting to get that going for a really long time we'll be talking to Mark Camaro on that show all of our big weekend review episode like please take a second to like the show it's not that hard wherever you take in the Pod please subscribe find me on social at Dan bass really look forward to continuing the conversation over there  and enjoy the early start today should be fun so long for now we'll see you tomorrow
