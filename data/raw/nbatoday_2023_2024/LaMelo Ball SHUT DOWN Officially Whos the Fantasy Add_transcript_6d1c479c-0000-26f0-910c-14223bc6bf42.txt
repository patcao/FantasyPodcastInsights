welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast I know big shocker of the morning  lamelo ball shut down for the year  that we didn't all know this was coming  but now it is official  yes indeed  finally  he can come off the can't cut list  on Yahoo or whatever website you're using for your fantasy sports because again  we wasn't coming back here's the tweet from wodge Charlotte Hornets guard lamelo ball who's missed 29 consecutive games with ankle injury will remain out for the final two plus weeks of the Season comma team says  that's the quote from woe that's a tweet  and we need this was happening at this point I mean you're two weeks from the end of the regular season so nobody was holding their breath that he was about to magically reappear there was no reason to another Lost season for lamelo ball  who's been healthy one  of his years so far I believe  fourth season of his career I mean some of it comes down to how many games there were he missed 21 games is freshman season  only missed seven his second year in the league that was the sort of Hope  last year he played 36 games this year he will finish at 20 to  love missed 60 games of this year if you drafted lamelo ball with your first or second round pick your team was largely doomed this year you just can't get nothing  out of your first round pick in fantasy basketball you can't  I don't care how good he is in the games he's in which by the way he was pretty good  but for nine cat  26 per game  which let's be honest we call that  his Fantasy game is very  neat it's neat  but he also has two you could even argue three if your thought talking about blocks but I'm not really too very large issues with it one being turnovers so big reason in nine cat is values a lot lower than an eight cat and then he's basically a punt field goal guy  which couple guys above him ended up there that I don't know that we knew they were going to be like a Dame ended up being kind of a punt field goal guy  but aims turnovers were like one and a half lower that's a thing  Freddie Van Fleet been a punt field goal guy forever but he didn't take as many as lamelo 19 shots a game at 43% that's pretty rough  pretty rough  and then where Dame has another giant Edge is that he's the best free throw shooter in the NBA so that ends up being a huge positive or for the Mellow ball it's a smallish medium positive  how was he gonna get to that 11th or whatever is 80 P was like 10 11 something like that how was he gonna get there this year I just there wasn't a path to it so fortunately I only drafted him in one spot that team is dead  that team I ended up going mellow ball and Kyrie Irving like right around the turn I think I had the second to last pick or something like that massive regrets I mean I got no problem with Kyrie's number nine per game buddy he's also gonna probably finish this season missing 22 23 ball games you can stomach that  you know if you took Kyrie at 14 15 something like that where he was going and he's number nine per game and he misses 20 ball games he's not gonna get to his ADP but he's not gonna be all that far off  but I couldn't possibly stomach both I needed one of my two early picks actually play in some ball games  but this is also again I'm like the funny thing is this isn't even why I had said I was avoiding lamelo ball I wasn't that worried about him missing the whole year with an interest that he was gonna play  I thought the Hornets were actually gonna try to compete this year but as soon as he went down again  so went any prayer of Charlotte being a competitive basketball team this year  so I asked you all before we get into the massive Wednesday recap  is he drafted  his lamelo ball draftable next year  the answer is yes everybody is draftable every year  but  the price tag has to be right what's a reasonable price tag for lamelo ball well it was getting  pretty consistently overdrafted because his eighth CAD value again was going to be so far ahead of his nine cat value so that  skewed the X Rank and then the ADP  in nine category drafts but this is a guy who's gonna get drafted what 10 11 12 somewhere in that range and had almost no chance of getting there in 9 category leaks on a per game basis  does this back to back completely obliterated season run for him does that finally push him down to where he should have been going anyway  here's my issue with ball  what more could he have done this year reasonably yeah I mean you could hope that if you go percentage could be better but it's probably not  yeah I'm gonna get more than one point eight steals per game that's a huge number you probably not gonna get more than three and some odd three-pointers five boards and eight assists like he kind of maxed out  free throw percent is is good  I don't know where he goes to get higher on the board other than to eliminate turnovers and I don't know that that's something that's just gonna magically go away either so this is a guy ball that should have been getting drafted at the end of the second round anyway  now where does he go this coming year next season he probably gets drafted around where he was ranked per game  so I still don't know that there's a massive amount of upside there you're going to see him getting drafted and being targeted by a lot of folks if he's going at like 25  and I'm fine with that because again if you're sort of throwing turnovers throwing caution to the wind unturned over you know care that much about them great  you're not alone everybody's doing it  and you can always make up for that a little bit later on old man squad Style with some guys that are lower turnover types so there's what there's he's a pretty easy guy to build around  if you're getting him at 24 25 or later  but I also don't know  that that leap enough  I asked this question on Twitter this morning and the response was definitely like look I'm not taking him before the third round  I bet you are  I bet you are  because I bet by the time draft season comes around next year  he's gonna be going before that and so if you have any chance of getting him you're gonna have to probably move before that  all right that's a little mellow story for the morning we have a lot to cover  uh but first welcome to the show it's fantasy NBA Today sports ethos presentation I'm your host Dan Vespers you can find me on Twitter at Danvers super easy d a n b e s b r i s we have a Whopper  of a 12 gamer to cover from yesterday so I just want to Dive Right on in I would very kindly ask that if you guys are somewhat new to the proceedings here please take a moment to like  if you're watching on YouTube or on Twitter to like if you're watching on YouTube or listening after the fact subscribe if you're listening after the fact please drop a five star review whatever you can do to continue to grow this thing so if you're new  if your brand new welcome I like to assume that one new person is watching every single day whether it's or listening I guess some taking in the content one new person every single day so we'll try to treat the show as such  but let's get into it we're gonna try to move somewhat fast over situations that allow it Cleveland is a spot where we do need to pause for just a second because Max Drew's came back had a minute's cap if you're wondering why he was at 24 and some odd minutes in this ball game Donovan Mitchell is targeting a return on Friday so that'll be the Cavaliers next ball game tomorrow what does it mean well first of all stress looked  pretty loose for the first time in a while  yes I chose my words quite carefully there he had been playing on a bum knee for a bit and I do I I think this time off almost definitely helped him  and I'd be inclined to say and I know I've been probably a little too high on screws this year but I'd be inclined to say give him a look  because if you really does have his bounce back from the beginning of the Season which evaporated and then he just like he couldn't keep up and the shot wasn't falling he's about to go on a little bit of a nice run here with his legs back under him that'd be a pretty good guy to get because he was getting some points of threes and boards and assists couple of defensive stats not a lot but some  he might fall into that doesn't matter group that's possibly might be 100 to 150 range but he has a shot to go a little bit ahead of that so I'm adding screws  and then you can likely move on from George Yang you could like move on from Isaac akoro and you can likely move on from Charis Levert because especially once Donna Mitchell comes back he's not going to have anything to do anymore and what he does do is gonna be done inefficiently Hornets shot 58% caps might have maybe wanted a little bit of Defense they did not  Brandon Miller miles Bridges those are the easy calls Trey man I believe is a yes barely but yes  vasilia mitsch had 12 assists here he's basically an assist stream has some pretty glaring issues with this Fantasy game turnovers lack of rebounds typically  not a great field goal percent he was fine he was good enough in this one but he's a he's a category hunting guy with Cody Martin all by the way ruled out for the year so if you wanted it pick up some assists me it's the way to go and then of course Nick Richards is the same old Nick Richards Alexa is interesting he played 23 minutes here at ten and seven with an assist showed off some interesting handle  but you can't do anything with him unless his get up into the high 20s and I don't see that happening and no I don't care about Grant Williams having a slightly better ball game he runs hot and cold and pass  Brooklyn beat Washington took everything in their power to get over the hump and including over time cam Thomas is back in a big way Camp Thomas nic Claxton Mikhail Bridges those the guys you can definitely start Schroeder at a nice ball game here some of that was because Washington is so truly truly awful on defense  with Cam Johnson out  and Dennis Smith Jr out Schroeder is probably still a yes  but it's iffy and you're like Dan how can you call it if you do that 21 and 8 with 33s yeah but we've watched Ruder for long enough to know that his Fantasy game is typically some points some assists and not a whole lot else  he and Reggie Jackson kind of have that out of similar profile just in how they accrue stats if there's enough usage which they're very much was yesterday plus overtime doesn't hurt then he's a goal if it slips under that barricade he becomes more of a kind of a points assists play  but right now with the guys out for the Nets that are out for the Nets he's a play in I think most formats  for the Wizards were Sean Holmes got her 12 minutes in that bust up what was a pretty amazing run he had 45 rebounds in his three ball games before this one Marvin Bagley is an ad across all formats they really don't have much less Tristan vukovich I you know four minutes no they played Anthony Gillette center before he's a no I you know the Denny obvious Center is probably the most likely other solution here but that likely means mid to high 20s minutes for Bagley at least and he's playing all right he might even get to 30 he was inside the top 100 before they started playing with Sean Holmes before  and now with the assumption that we're Sean misses a ballgame  I don't know guys leaving a game early I always assume that they're gonna miss the next one because like  if it didn't hurt that bad they tried to play through it so Jordan Poole Marvin Bagley Kyle kuzma Denny obvious those are the four guys you can start on this team Corey kisper is a guy you play only when kuzma is out  or maybe after but mostly cuz  Warrior's dream on green got ejected three and a half minutes into the Ballgame it was beyond idiotic  then there was footage looked like Steph Curry was almost tearing up he was so annoyed with his teammate but the Warriors won anyway somehow pretty damn good win on a sleep for the dubs they just played good defense because it sure is crap didn't score all that much  trayce Jackson Davis filled in admirably you got another you got a nice big game out of him because of the Draymond ejection  he's a hold right now again the free throws are an issue but he didn't go to the line so that's sort of like the best case scenario Andrew Wiggins has had two good ones in a row after a whole bunch of middling games I still think Wiggins probably profiles is like a 100 to 1 30 140 range Guy where if you're attacking some points some boards maybe a little bit of the defensive stuff you could Dive In  but if you warms up he has the potential to be a little bit better than that so he's sort of like a doesn't matter with upside which I think is kind of similar to how I view macros  and you're just looking for slightly different things  wig and scares me though because if he starts shooting  the percentages can both hurt you  in a way that with a lot of these other guys maybe not both maybe one or the other  so what do you do and I know everybody wants sort of like the final call on Wiggins  I honest I don't think it matters  I don't think it matters  pods is obviously a drop Clay is a whole special back in the starting five and then Chris Paul is probably a drop these days he's barely playing lately a wonderful we're going to find out that he's dealing with something but even if he is who cares there's two weeks left there's no reason to hang on to somebody who sucks right now and Chris Paul sucks right now  I think you can drop him if you want to hang on for assists I'm okay with that as well  for the magic Cole Anthony 32 big bench minutes their bench played better than their starters so you saw some of the minutes flip-flop a little bit here I'm not adding Colin Anthony and neither  should you  why no Carter is not a nine cat play Noir is Mark hell faults Jalen Suggs is cooling back off again so I think you probably want to abandon ship their my favorite player to watch on the Maverick or Mavericks the magic right now is Jonathan Isaac  nine and five with a steel two blocks and a couple of three pointers he has the  one of the best fantasy profiles of anybody in the NBA remember the last time he was four or five years ago at this point but the last time he played starter's minutes for a couple of months he was a second rounder  24 minutes which does not feel sustainable specially because they got a back-to-back coming up but if he's getting 24 minutes somewhat regularly then he's a play in any spot where you can get him in there  certainly more so in rotow because then when he takes a game off it doesn't hurt you all that much but he's always gonna be dramatically under rostered  because of his injury history and makes total sense but  he's he's available in a lot of leagues and  if you're in a rodeo league and he's on the wire that's that's foolish  Nick smoked the tanking Raptors McBride  easy call to fill in for OG right now Dante Brunson  Josh Hart are all easy calls as well  but things have gotten a little bit confused in the Nicks front Court Mitchell Robinson came back played it doesn't mean minutes which I think of this game was closer maybe he would have gotten like another three but there was sort of no reason to overextend him  he's a roto stash not I had to head at said this on Twitter say it again here  heart and shine you hold for now but I do think that is Robinson gets fully up to speed Argentine will end up being a drop question is is there even enough time in the season for it to matter season might be over before you hit that point and if we do it'll be with like what three four games left Maybe  and then precious Drew had a giant ball game here but a lot of that was blowout and just sort of the way the rotation shook out he's not a guy you can trust night to night precious that is  for Toronto if they could just keep one game lightly competitive we could see Gary Trent and Kelly Olynyk really turned it Loose they were still fine in this one despite their team getting blitzed again  those are the two guys are hanging on to and Rodeo had to head they have a bad schedule the rest of this week Toronto's off for three days in a row if you cannot afford to hold them then don't do it but that's a headband issue for your team not for everybody because I have a clinic and mostly wrote a spots and I'm holding him there I have Gary Trent on a head-to-head team and I did drop him today because I was sort of looking at my matchup and I have a pretty good size lead in three-pointers I have a small medium lead in Steels but I figured whoever I picked up could probably cover what Trent does in one game in two I just need to have performance in those things and then I'm likely going to lose points so if I guy I pick up doesn't score half of what Trent score then it doesn't really hurt me all that much I could probably get a rebounding and assist Bounce by making that move again steals threes I can probably hold even maybe I get a blocks bounced as well maybe I gotta field goal percent bounce if I pick up somebody who's not a chukar  so I get it I'm there with you in a couple of spots but again you know your team better than I do  Portland's in full tank mode right now I am starting to think we don't see their regulars the rest of the year but DeAndre ayton wasn't ruled out until relatively late so there's a possibility you you do see Aiden  luckily I don't think it matters all that much because do up brief is not a reliable backup center he doesn't rebound he doesn't block that many shots he's not super close to the bucket on the offensive side so the percentages are not particularly helpful from their Center those are the ways that centers can rack up fantasy stats is rebounds and field goal percent and defensive stats and he's not really all that good in any of those  as far as what the hell's going with Portland right now the guys you can probably trust himani Kamara has a pretty translatable Fantasy game cuz he'll score rebound assistance gets some defensive stats  and then Delano Banton who's just taking a ton of shots right now he's gone ham 23 shots again last night he's crested over that point where yeah ultimately the efficiency stuff is going to be terrible but even like you could take 23 shots at night even if you're efficiencies awful  you're probably still gonna put up enough fantasy stat to counterweight that so in this  iteration of the Blazers especially against teams that all so don't play much defense like the Hawks and Portland has a bad schedule so don't get on my case about this on the head-to-head side  they got Miami in Orlando next teams that actually play a little bit defense and then Charlotte and Washington and then probably Boston who won't be taking them very seriously in that one  that's probably where you want to attack some Blazers middle to end of next week  but Rodeo side yeah I mean you could probably play those two guys band in Kamara  I not any farther than that though  Atlanta I think you can play DeAndre Hunter he's iffy but I think you can play him capella Bogey and johnte Murray those guys are all pretty straightforward capellas seven defensive stats that was  pleasant surprise you expect the blocks every once in a while but for steals the magic of playing a Blazers team that's a bunch of G Leaguers right now I don't Garrison Mathews at a good ball game I don't care I know Bruno Fernando had a pretty good ball game I don't care  Veet crunchy has been doing a little bit more I don't care these are guys that you use for their good schedule on the head-to-head side but you can't you're not bothering those dudes on Roto  all right let's keep shuffling along nothing to see here on the Clippers really nothing at all zubats as it doesn't matter level Center if you're looking for boards he didn't get many in this ball game but boards field goal percent in particular that's the only thing that's up in the air on the Clippers side Philly Kelly ubreak came back and then this very controversial ending where he pretty clearly got clubbed on the last shot of the ball game it wasn't called and then he then he went full  scene from  well as originally  well I guess it's really more of a half-baked reference yeah  anyway he singled out each ref individually you gotta go find that tape if you want to see something pretty hilarious Uber is a play I know he wasn't a fish in here but he's a play Max he's a play to buy his is a play and then my continuing fear on what's to become of Paul Reed he managed three blocks again which is covering up for the fact that the rest of his stats have completely evaporated he remains because of the defensive stats he remains just barely above the cut line but it does kind of feel like read is falling back into that doesn't matter group meaning the if you need a few boards and some defensive stats play them if you don't you don't categorical hunting that's the  you know during the regular season early in the year whatever you're not really playing those doesn't matter guys very much but right now  they're all part of the okay do I need this stat  mobile had a double-double but only 19 minutes that's the more important part but he'll let 17 points but again only 25 and a half bench it's no  link that's all we needed to talk about on the Sixers Pacers got waxed you're not changing anything you're doing with them fantasy after a bad ball game nem hard at a good one I don't care teaching McConnell still got his 12 points and four assists so he managed to kind of survive it to some degree  nobody else did  McConnell  Halliburton Turner siakam those are the four guys you started in all formats now hard  Nesmith are your sort of  schedule level plays they're not even they're not even in a dozen matters on their schedule level only Bulls take care of this one early Andre Drummond got a few extra minutes as a result he's a rebounds Target only  and then otherwise white DeRozan to Sumo virgin Caruso those are five Bulls same old things same old thing they keep it easy for us in Chicago  here's an interesting one Detroit 32 minutes again  for Shazam mettu who  you know two games back yet a good one and then he played 17 minutes in between  and after he had that first decent ball game well better than DC it's 17 and 83 assists a steal a block good percentage is lot to like about that game against the Pelicans whatever three four days ago  then he gets the Nicks he had six and two with four assists he did still have two steals in a block and it seems like meteors kind of played his way into the  vacated minutes that originally belonged to Isaiah Stewart and Azure Thompson and then became the property of Simona Funke  and now they're just there sit in there for the taking I'm gonna call me to a speculative add here I don't know that I have the balls to play them in Detroit's next ball game  and Pistons have a bad schedule so I get it head to headers you can kind of tune me out but they got the Wizards  if there's ever a team that met you could pick on a little bit and they got caged back so that should get him open a little bit more than they got Memphis then Atlanta Memphis again Brooklyn a lot of kind of cake opponents here not that Detroit's gonna win any of those games but they should be competitive in most of them  so why not why can't make to get 29 30 minutes in those ball games why not  so I say at least in terms of the sort of risky proposition role of the dice types I think met two has a pretty good shot now you got to wait and make sure that he started before you actually use him against a games cap and you're not using a head-to-head because Detroit only has one more game this week  but if this sticks and phone thank you doesn't come back  Detroit could make a lot of sense for next week they got four games for six days next week  something to keep an eye on head-to-head wise Rodeo I mean I got some clunker players on my team I'm happy to dispose of if I can get some rebound steals blocks on good percentages out of a guy  I'm into it  Wiseman is a drop with durian back Sasser is someone I've got on my watch list but not beyond that he hasn't shown any consistency to Warrant it and then came back so that was good news  no Jane Ivy in this one  which may have played a role everybody may have sort of shifted up a spot that's why you got to make sure that may do starting again in the next one  for the Wolves it's just kind of fun to see nasri cook and people this is why last offseason I prayed to the fantasy Lords that nazri was gonna get signed away from Minnesota by some team that wanted to make him a starting power forward it didn't happen so we had to wait all year but now with cat down NASA's just going crazy  he's crazy great  Conley Nas go bare Anthony Edwards you got a bad ball game here and we're just an amazing basketball player and he's almost definitely gonna get overdrafted and fantasy again next season despite finishing he's not over yet but he's at number 38 per game this year and doing almost as much as he possibly can yeah I mean kill me for it if you want but to be honest goodness truth slo-mo has been inside the cut line over the last week and a half two weeks some of that was because guys were out some of it was because he's just sort of settling into a slightly large role I do think that ultimately he probably profiles better as a rebound assist steel combo specialist but he's been good enough in scoring and the percentages to be playable in all formats lately just don't be surprised if some of that stuff does kind of tape her off a tad and he becomes more of kind of that three category thing but like it wouldn't be that nuts to see him roll at kind of like a top 9 0  Rockets caught a break No Shave for Oklahoma City Houston was able to beat him in overtime behind massive games again from jail in green and I'm in Thompson  Dillon Brooks was pretty good in this one I keep wondering if he's gonna be able to do enough with shengwen out it hasn't been consistently enough though  for me to actually get behind it if Brooke starts taking 15 16 shots of ball game I might adjust and say go ahead but he's on my watch list uh no big surprises here you're starting the starters besides Brooks with Houston  for the Thunder  going into this ballgame I think I said something on yesterday's podcast about how I thought Giddy and Dort had a shot to actually do some fantasy stuff well giddy was right Dort wasnt  I needed door to take about a dozen shots and I certainly needed him to shoot better than two for 10 to get there  if she misses another one  do I have the stones to play what those two guys against the games cap  I probably would play giddy against a game's cap if Sheamus is another ball game I don't think I played Dort against it  and then Chet fouled out in 18 minutes so that was all so kind of relevant here that's why I guys off the bench got sort of different run than there used to  thought maybe Mike muscala know they ran small Isaiah Joe got a bunch of extra playing time but that could very well disappear in the next one not safe at all  Lakers big numbers on offense again like Acres our garden anybody and without Anthony Davis you knew they were gonna guard anybody here but you also knew that with Anthony Davis out hachimura was gonna have a whole lot to do and he did and you also knew the Jacksons was going to give you sort of a Richard Zion a few dunks and a handful of rebounds kind of fill in game and he did just that and that's the difference here so when LeBron is out you can go rui when ad is out you can probably go really and jaxson Hayes it frees up a lot more and then you go Dlow Reeves you know LeBron or ad if they're in there obviously kind of flip flipping whatever  I really like how Spencer did we've been playing lately but unless he's filling in for d low or Reeves in the starting lineup there's just sort of not enough usage there for him but he has pretty consistently made their defense a lot better this year and then from Memphis  Bane and JJ those are obvious ones when they're in Desmond with 16 assists in this ball game that's crazy  Jake laravia got super hot hits 73 pointers after I think going like oh for 8 from 3 and his previous ball game so good luck chasing that one and it appears as though Santee Elma has officially quieted down so they could probably go a different way there keep one eye on Brandon Clark he made his return from an ACL tear had six points in five rebounds is like legs won't be underneath them I don't think for the rest of this season he's a guy you should consider and try to figure out where he fits for next year if anything but you can keep an eye on it certainly doesn't cost you anything to just watch a guy but again you're gonna see Jake laravia get picked up in a bunch of spots and you'll probably see him get dropped after the next one there's just you know the consistency part is the part that's frustrating where you know maybe if we get John conchar back or if Luke Kennard shows back up again but as it stands right now  with aldama now cooling back off and maybe he wakes up in the next one I don't know but if he's cooling off then it's just being in Jaren Jackson  and I know what you're thinking Dan why aren't you talking about GG Jackson  same reason that I've been talking about him on this pod for a couple of weeks he when he's usage just Sky High he can overwhelm the bad  which is kind of like what we just talked about with Benton in Portland but if the usage is in a high and the percentages are poor then you get this which is just like a whole bunch of nothing  with turnovers and a bad field goal percent the bottom can fall out pretty hard for Gigi and that's why you know we talked about him what two days yesterday two days ago or was like look even when he was running hot he was still just barely he was like one ten ranked player  so you're very much hunting points  that's it  with GG you can treat a couple other guys similarly I guess Spurs beat the Jazz Battle of a el Tango Jeremy sohan's had two good ones in a row but you're you got bigger Stones than I do if you're putting him in your lineup Wendy and vessel are the super easy ones and then Trey Jones took a grand total of two shots in 32 minutes that's just not acceptable but I do think that because the assist just sort of never really go away for him he probably stays above the cut line  when he's cold he's an assist specialist when he's warm you know he can run it like a top 60 clip so I hold trade Jones  Utah Sexton and Collins and Walker Kessler are your safe plays kante Georgia's a points assists streamer just understanding that the turnovers in bad field goal percent and complete lack of defensive stats make him do more damage than good  but yeah I mean if you need points in assistance and some threes that's totally fine but does for me it's it's those other four guys for Utah and then Phoenix came out and caught Denver kind of napping in this ball game KD was great a Grayson Allen Devin Booker Bradley Beal those are the guys Noir in this one but there isn't an obvious fill-in for him you Bank started but he didn't do very much so just those main four for now and then for Denver I said it before I will say it again I prefer two guys out before I'm comfortable starting Reggie Jackson against the games cap Jamal Murray was out Reggie took his spot at 11 in the three not a particularly good ball game for Jackson if you were again stat hunting some points some assists that's a spot where maybe you could take a shot but if you literally need anything else then it's a bad decision and that's why I need two guys out because I need to use usage to be higher I need more offense to be going through Reggie as a being more of a catch and shoot guy around Nicole yokich  and that is your very very large when's day recap that we rolled super fast through because I also wanted to do our streaming show immediately after this one  just says happy opening day Dan happy opening day everybody baseball starts today ladies and gentlemen I do love it I love it I Can't Get Enough Dodgers open up at 1 p.m. Pacific times I came starts at about three hours here  ah good stuff good stuff  I will have it on in the background as I

before so hopefully you're new I love new viewers very few new viewers on YouTube today but quite a few I'm sure over on social media I dropped lamelo a while ago and God Jalen green definitely been a great pick up yeah I mean lamelo's been out forever and we didn't think he was coming back hi Dan I'm currently being destroyed by the best players in the NBA Jalen green and Banton how do I cope  attack the other categories try to win percentages  and try to win boards and assists and Steals and blocks there's always a way there's always a way  Matt says why aren't there any new games for a Baseball opening day I think there's some one o'clock stuff I don't I didn't look at the whole calendar but  yeah is that weird I mean is there not is there not a noon Eastern Time game that should be

other things are make sure you're subscribed there we'll get that streaming show out early today so you guys have plenty of time to make your choices it's quality day quality Thursday a follow on Twitter at Dan bass d a n b e s b r i s go use promo code ethos 20 ethos 2-0 over at our Pals at manscape.com and I will talk to you all in 15 minutes for show number two on this two for Thursday by the way I thought about it I don't know if I'm gonna do the two first on the very last week of the season because everybody's gonna be resting so there's kind of no point in gaming out Max games played you pretty much just want to save your moves for when your main dude gets shut down that's the best way to handle the last week of the season because you're gonna need to use at least four moves on guys being ruled out there's no point in streaming on other stuff so I don't know that we necessarily need to do well do a weekly preview show but I don't know that we need to do the streaming every day but we'll continue to do that this week and and hopefully next week as well timing dependent but so far I've been able to do it I can't believe that by the way  is this a sign that my kids are getting older  that I actually have time cheers I'll see you guys in 15
