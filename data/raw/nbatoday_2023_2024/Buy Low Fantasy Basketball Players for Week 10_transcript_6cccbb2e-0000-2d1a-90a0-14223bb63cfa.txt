welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  weekday by low show diving straight into the good stuff here no reason to screw around at the front end you guys want me to go fast so we are going to go fast we'll see if we can even do Today Show in a tidy little 20 minutes  that's the goal set the timer the first minute of music and Bs doesn't count  now I am at Danbury this is fantasy NBA today it's our bonus Tuesday edition you guys seem to like the Buy Low shows so I want to keep those going  and frankly I think there are two this week very good reasons for us to consider buying low out of the fantasy space but quickly here at the front end follow me on Twitter at Danbury d a n b e s b r i s and if you're enjoying what we're doing here on our YouTube page on our traditional pod channels

oh that's not the right week guys says week nine but that's not right  it's week 10  son of a gun I forgot to fix it  I wonder if I could do it on the Fly is that gonna show up for you guys how'd I do hey look at that on the Fly editing  week 10 let's look back at how some of our wrecks have gone over the last couple of weeks  I'm trying to cover a lot here on a couple of slides  and we've got that's my half naked kid attempting to run into the show again some of the names we've had on the show over the last three four five weeks Julius Randle he's no longer possible by Lil JJ Keegan Murray Damian Lillard Jaylen Brown all these guys have jumped pretty far and you can't really Buy Low on them anymore oh gee know he's actually gone 10 slots the wrong way since our initial Buy Low call on him that's not great but at all makes him one of an even easier by low because it's bad as he is he ain't gonna be this bad  specially if the Raptors move somebody's around  that's a pretty easy call I think who else we got going on a couple more updates on buy Logan DeMar DeRozan is finally starting to move his way up the board we've had him on the Buy Low table for a few weeks in a row now and we're finally seeing action from him he's up from the mid 60s to the mid 50s basically it's percentages right now the free-throw percent moved up about 2% the field goal percent still hasn't really moved shifted far off of this kind of lower number for him he's now basically in a dead heat with his ADP in the mid 50s so any additional gains for tomorrow on the percentages side and he will then move in front of his ADP he could continue to be one of the more reliably healthy guys in the NBA so you got that going for you even if the other stuff isn't going exactly according to play and even if right now is basically just Aid and he's right at his number guy that's actually been believe it or not kind of good enough  we'll take any wins we get on top of that Jalen Williams finally starting to move up the board he is questionable with an illness right now but he's up to number 78 and he still isn't even getting any steals so if that ever changes and I'm starting to have some slight concerns that it won't but if that ever changes then Jalen Williams can keep moving up the board Walker Kessler cam Johnson are static they've remained basically where they were when we gave their Bi-Lo Rex whatever it was two three weeks ago that's fine just continue to sit on it it's not like it's been terrible since you bought low both those guys kind of you know 80 90 range  okay I have a lot of confidence that Walker Kessler is going to move pretty far ahead I don't have quite as much confidence they can Johnson's gonna jump as far but he'll move up a little bit I think and so we can take solace in that  I asked you now on this next slide can we rinse and repeat on any of these guys the answer I believe on Walker Kessler and Jayson Tatum who we had on our board last week is yes I think with the MARTA Rosen and Jaylin Williams moving up the board a little bit probably not as much wiggle room to buy on those guys anymore now if you did it you enjoy if you didn't you probably just leave them alone and Ogden and Obi is actually kind of a better Buy Low now with some slight concerns as I mentioned before these like concerns being is he ever going to get it going this year in Toronto and I don't know though I still feel somewhat confident that he will be better than he's been so far  let's get into our first Bilo for this week and that and they're only two on the board this time but they're pretty big names and one of them is Mikhail Bridges Who currently sits at number 76 in nine cat on the year over the last month he's number 128 largely because over that month he has not been able to shoot the basketball he's at just 44 and change percent over the last month he's at just one point one combined Steals and blocks that is an obscenely low number for him even if you continue to believe which I do that the Steals and blocks numbers are not going to be as good as they were when his job was just to get Steals and blocks in Phoenix they can back about you know the big first half of last year he was a two combined Steals and blocks that's where he's been in his lower usage roles but even in Brooklyn last year he's at one point six so  and even on the course of this year he's at one point three so the fact that he's at just one point one over the last month that's the number that's likely to come up  and it's possible that is last ball game actually made this Bi-Lo a little bit harder to pull off because it is last game McHale had 29 Points yes it was against the Pistons that's always good for what else yeah 29 Points on nine out of 17 from the field 10 for 10 at the free throw line six board seven assists a steal a block and a three-pointer is it a step in the right direction maybe you know better defenses have been tougher for him but honestly a lot of things have just kind of been tougher for him he was really bad on Brooklyn's five game West Coast Swing looked like he was playing on dead legs came back home started to get his legs back and their second game back in Brooklyn hopefully a little bit of rest over the Christmas break they had two days off between games maybe you keep that going as Brooklyn moves now into sort of a heavier next I think they play four out of the next six days  the nice thing about mikal bridges is that even if we adjust and this is the thing even from the beginning of the year this is a guy that was getting drafted on 20 and I didn't really have much of a problem with it because the the assumption  or mine was at least was that Bridges was gonna be more like a 30  35 range per game guy but was going to be smashing those numbers because of totals  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last-second drink run and end up missing the game-winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of beer Wine and Spirits then get

armchair  download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's d r i z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  because he is consistently one of the healthiest dudes in the entire NBA and he's played in I believe this is every game so far this year might get that right yeah 29 out of 29 games so even though he's been bad or not great on the per game side he's still inside the top 50 by totals and a little uptick in per game appeal and as the season wears on and you start to see more and more guys actually miss games here and there Brooklyn of course having played you know one or two fewer games than some of the guys that are in front of him on the board as well  this is a guy that in my estimation has a lot of different ways that he can actually slide up the board in overall rank so just attrition is one of them if he's a guy who stays upright when other people start to miss games here and there and that's a thing that tends to happen he'll move up the board a few slots that way if he starts to get defensive stats a little bit better than he has been the last month if he goes on a little warm run where he shoots 50% of 404 it's just all these ways that he can get better and so if you're looking at more of an in Target rank I think maybe a slight adjustment down from mid-30s to more like 40 but because of how bad he's been so far this year you can probably get him for someone in the 60 range with a lot of name recognition someone uh like a Alpine shengwen who's been very good at points boards and assists but as this big free throw Gap so if you weren't trying to blow your free throw percentage up that's a way you could maybe pivot off of that to somebody who has a chance to move up the board DeAndre ayton has pretty big name power he's in the 60s Michael Porter Jr has pretty big name power he's in the 60s Rudy gobert although again if you're punting free throws that's a different story these guys that's sort of the case for a number of these dudes I don't know if you go much farther above those dudes but someone like a Nikola who I also like but probably sort of hangs out in that kind of 45 to 60 range you're giving up somebody who has a safe floor there for somebody who maybe the dust the floor ever get all the way high enough I don't know France Wagner's at 20 points that probably isn't enough to get it done but you never know maybe you pair him up with somebody else that's in that like 85 to 95  range like a buddy Heald or right now Alex Caruso or an Austin Reeves that might get it done  so there's a lot of ways I think in that range that you get yourself a male Bridges without having to pay up one of those guys in the 40s right now who frankly are just too expensive  so as I think about as high as I would go  I definitely would not be selling on Bridges right now it's absolutely a positively the wrong time to do that  what did I just see like did something just break in real time on the Chicago Bulls here  we may have just had something break on the Bulls  what's the story hit oh Nicolas vuskovich just got ruled out right in the middle of the show what's the report on that I don't want to be late on this one  something with his ad ducktor  let's see he's out  sore adductor we don't have a whole lot on it besides that okay so it doesn't sound like a like a deal not like something's torn but he's a late scratch who is a late scratch meaning on Andre Drummond is a fill in guy but we can talk about that more more over on the social media side so I got a little worried that something crazy happened no smaller thing will deal with that when the show is over what do the Bulls play tonight what make sure that we've got time to actually get this information out on social media Chicago plays and an hour and a half so we got time okay back to the story at hand here sorry about that guys and we got way late at tiny bit just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything in the middle of a podcast so for Bridges because there is this likely you know he's got room for a 30 slot jump or something like that you got room to buy for someone in between so look for those names we were talking about that have a lot of name power  or look for someone in that range that's just putting a big big big big games right now Jabari Smith Jr is putting up huge games that's probably not enough to get it done but again you pair these guys off  Michael Porter Jr just had a big ball game pair him up with somebody  and again if you're trying to unload a free throw issue you've got a few guys in there that are kind of Punt free throw types vouch now with this ad doctor probably Now isn't enough to get it done so that ruins that potential plan to buy his hair is a guy that's been on the rise here after a slow stretch does that get it done I'm not right now but if he has two or three more big ball games in a row and with Joel embiid out maybe that ends up being a possible thought click capella has been very good somehow not a punt free throw guys so far this year but he would be a great one to offer up in case the punch for free throws back in  there you go  the other name on the board this week is also a pretty big name guy going through kind of a weird little slump and that man is Jimmy Butler he was currently ranked number 50 in nine Cat Crazy low for him and 88 over the last month and believe it or not it's basically the same story  as Mikhail Bridges  Jimmy Butler is at one steal per game this year one  that is not Jimmy Butler's universe  one steal per game I mean what are we even talking about here it's been  um I don't know forever since the last time that was even an afterthought  his worst steals season  I mean basically as far back as our memories can go was 1.6 steals per game  he's lower than that right now in steals and blocks combined this is a guy that over the last decade 10 years of basketball basically any season he's been a starter in the NBA and I'll read them off to you rapid fire starting in 2013 when Butler became a full-time starter playing starters minutes those were Tibbs minutes but still whatever combined Steals and blocks 2.4 2.4 2.2 2.3 2.4 3.4 for 10 games in Minnesota the following year that was post-trade Philadelphia 2.3 that was that was post trade excuse me many was the was the start of the Year 2.4 and Miami this is the start of the Miami run 2.4 2.4 what 2.1 2.1 1.5 one of these things is not like the others  also of note Butler's currently having his worst field goal percent season in five years free throw is fine three-pointers remain low but who cares rebounds are low but not like out of the range of normal possibility low assists are low you could pin some of that on Tyler hero but he's been out a lot you've been some of that on bam out of Bio but he has been out at decent amount  Miami just continue to find ways to win and for Butler the big thing right now Steals and blocks Steals and blocks he was at one point eight steals per game last year he's among the league leaders this year he's right smack in the middle of the pack and it's doing nothing for him  that said I think some of that comes around for Butler and I don't think them being all that crazy to assume that it does how does it come around I don't know we've started to see it come around for Freddie Van Vleet while kind of nobody was watching he had some Gigantor ball games and he's cooled off a little bit in his last two or three but for now up at 1.1 steals per game and of 0.8 or whatever he was at three weeks ago these things just slowly find their way back to where they always end up  the nice thing about Butler right now is that this is not nice but it's nice for those of us that are trying to cash in a little bit and I think for those of us that are trying to cash in is that he's now been this whatever version of himself for long enough where it's believable  so you can get him for about the same price I think that you paid for Michelle maybe just a little bit more because we've seen Jimmy Butler do this a lot he's also ranked 20 slots ahead of bridges right now but the guys are ranked they guys that are around Butler on overall rank boards right now are DeMar DeRozan that might get it done he can Murray Nicolas who comes back tonight if he has a big ball game I think you sell for something if you can get Jimmy Butler Daniel Gafford yelling his Fallen Junius Nicole Tyler hero Jamal Murray Bogdan bogdanovich that won't get it done miles Bridges just in case anything happens there remember he has a pending court date  I think all of these guys will have some chance varying chances of getting the job done if you're trying to go get Jimmy Butler who's out questionable right now he's dealing with this calf injury which is no fun and we know Jimmy tends to miss anywhere from usually you know 13 to 20 ball games per year maybe you pick them up here towards the tail end of whatever this sort of small medium length calf related absence as about  and then in all likelihood at some point this year he's gonna have like a top 12 run he goes on where he's getting two and a half steals per game for a couple of weeks that number probably evens out someplace the other stuff doesn't change all that much and then they just sort of looks like Jimmy Butler again and maybe that's more like top 20 instead of top 10 this year but that's still way out in front of where he is right now I think he gets inside the top 30 relatively easily  when it all starts I don't know that's the problem with by Lowe's is you just don't really know when the turnarounds gonna be but he's been in this sort of quiet Meandering last month where you know again number 88 over the last month wild guys have been out it's been sort of a weird stretch for him and the big reason again  0.8 defensive stats combined over that last month 0.7 steals 0.1 blocks  that will not stand long term  he's not an under one he's not Danilo Gallinari he's not under one combined steel and block guy  this is the fluctuation the random variance of defensive stats has hit him hard right now  he's sub D'Andre Hunter at the moment he's Austin Reeves  defensive stats over the last 30 days  that ain't Jimmy Butler and we all know it so go try to get him for someone in that 50 range see if you can pull it off I wanted to take just a few seconds here before I give you the last kind of reminder slide to number one take your time on this stuff typically these types of things now that were you know two months into the season these types of BIOS don't usually flip overnight you saw with the martyrs and it took like three weeks for him to start getting it going sometimes it takes a few weeks for this stuff to kick in JJ earlier in the year took a few weeks to kick in sometimes it happens fast like Julius Randle happened fast right after we talked about it boom it happened Jaylen Brown boom it happened some of those guys that clicks right away like the Bilo is put out there by yours truly and then it just manifests but a lot of the time there's a week or two where things continue to slide  there's no perfect answer to finding the right way to buy low  you don't know the moment it's going to turn but you know when the value is low which it is on these guys and you can see it via public perception and you know that at some point because we still have three and a half months of the basketball season left Something's Gonna Something's Gonna squirm back the other way  also please check out our buddies over at

stuff they got going on over there on our first show earlier this morning so here on the show too  if you forgot about a Christmas present for somebody that's the place to go to get it all so before I give you this last reminder on a very very dicey Bilo that I mentioned on last week's show that I want to highlight very quickly again before we wrap things up please take a moment to like  if you're watching now or after the fact and please  find ways to just help us drive up numbers I am not big enough on YouTube yet to just rely on the goodness of the algorithm I need you guys to help me with it  pods Twitter whatever all that stuff yeah you know the site does a lot of the work  but that's years in the making we've only been on YouTube video wait wise for one calendar year one we made a lot of Headway but I need your help to make more so please do help us on that front pod folks I think iTunes is changing things around so that it counts only people who are actually like going in and listening it doesn't count subscriptions anymore so please do take a moment to make sure it shows get downloaded onto your mobile devices that's actually really big for us here even if you only have a chance to listen to the first 30 seconds and then Advance because your kids yelling at your something that actually matters now before we wrap things up because I said I was going to try to do it in 20 I wanted to put Bradley Beal back on this thing because he's hoping to be back not long after the first of the year he still available and I still think you can get him for somebody in the 75 to 100 range I don't know if I would go as high as 75 because that might be where he ends up this year but if you can get him for somebody in like the 90 range with some name power Kelvin and do it buddy hield do it  cam Johnson much as I like him do it  Austin Reeves do it  who else we got in there that might get it done  hmm those might be the names  um yeah that's probably it  Dennis Schroder after a big ball game that'd be one to try he's number one 11 right now but if he has one of those  like I don't know Toronto is playing next I should probably know that off the top of my head but you know when they play like a Wizards team Intruder goes for 19 and 11 throw him out there for Bradley Beal right after that  Kyle kuzma he's number one 16 and most people would have agree he's actually playing relatively well this year but his Fantasy game is crap for nine category League's because of the things he does poorly steals blocked both presented and turnovers that's five negative  billing out five negatives even if he ain't the old Bradley Beal he's not gonna have five negatives he'll be positive and points  he'll be positive in assists probably steals possibly both percentages at the very least he'll probably be a negative and rebounds blocks  maybe turnovers maybe threes hard to say  I bet you could turn kuzma into Beal I thought that you would  whose is playing right now I'll tell you what January 1st  they're all calcium out there for Bradley Beal  and then let it you know whatever League you're in it takes like two three days for a trade to process so you get Beyond like January 4th  you miss like a week of kuzma there and then maybe you get a guy who just can walk into fantasy value that's 340 slots higher just because of how they're nine category games are built  I know you guys hate that call but I don't care and I went over 20 minutes sorry about that everybody but we're done now I'm at Dan Vespers on social thanks so much for listening again please whatever you can do to help power boost this thing it does actually mean a lot find me on Twitter find our Discord Link in the show description along with all the other partners we've had over the course of
