welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast we can review time here on fantasy NBA today happy Friday to you all we've made it to the end  of the third to last week of the NBA season we are really coming down the Chute now a lot of leagues are done  many finish up  in a couple of days many more finish up in  a week after that  and we have to that we're all done  oh  sad face  I am personally  now ready  not ready for it to be over  I had a blast this year  it's always easier when picks go better obviously this is a more successful year  not that you know the nice thing about having sort of this old man squad level of appeal is that you very rarely have disaster years unless every old dude gets hurt which kind of happened that two three seasons back there was a year were like Jimmy Butler Paul George and two other old guys were all going near the turn  and they were all just hurt the whole damn year maybe it was the season after covid  that was a tough year to have an old man squad but otherwise you know nine out of the last 10 years basically you go old dudes and you have a really safe floor and you often just get like nice quality hits well this year we got some bigger ones which has been really nice like guys like Kawaii and then he Davis just wildly outperforming their ADP out of the old man James Harden the old man Zone  so it's been a fun year and I don't want it to end but I can't stop the passage of time try though I might  so we gear up for an off-season  I will certainly not be doing two shows every day and something like 11 shows a week it'll be fine Monday through Friday we'll have our off season shows we'll be breaking down all kinds of fun stuff Lessons Learned From a season gone by how we did with our rankings how Yahoo did with their rankings  team reviews we'll talk about the draft we'll talk about free agency and then we hit the real dog days we're just like I am out of things to talk about  but we will continue to talk about things  even then  so I roll baby  so we do it here on fantasy NBA today and that is why I humbly ask you here at the front end to please subscribe to Fantasy NBA today and if you could and I take my phone

mean Dan through it into a Microsoft Word document and then through that into read View  I know I'm all class baby one of my projects for this offseason we'll see how it goes is to relearn OBS studio so I can put out a slightly less greeny  video feed here on YouTube but man stream yard is so convenient  we're gonna cover the stories of the past five-ish days or so  and I want to remind everybody listening that this show will focus on players independent of their current schedule  so do not ask about Game Volleyball do not ask about streaming do not ask about games played that will be for our other show which will be doing like in the afternoon well we'll see how long this one takes where we go through your ads and drops to maximize games play this is not about that this is about guys that you can use sort of every day or versus not every day's make sure to follow me on Twitter at Dan Vespers d a n b e s b r i s ethos fantasy BK is the basketball feed will be switching that to ethos fantasy NBA in the offseason just before warned on that and if you're I probably should have changed the dialogue here the addiction but like rate subscribe however it is you're taking in this this show if you're watching on Twitter navigate over to YouTube so you can subscribe or to iTunes Spotify or whatever it is and I'll be forever grateful  we're just start with the injury Replacements and I mentioned why we did this pivot last week the injury Replacements coming first is basically so that when you guys don't see the names these names these names on the other lists you won't ask me why  I want to get these out of the way early so there are no questions why these names are not on the ads or drops or holds or whatever  I tried to Cluster some of the guys up near the top that were  ads for the rest of the season  where we don't know exactly what their role will be going into next year it's kind of like I call them the Trey Murphy all stars from last season where was like look I don't know if this guy's actually going to be a fantasy value when his team is fully healthy I do know he's a Fantasy value in someone's down and that's the case right now for I'm in Thompson who is crushing it since Albert and shengwen went down monster League winner type stuff here at the end of the year Nas Reed with cat down for the season also kind of that same general vibe  those guys are obvious ones their ads in every sense of the word their play everywhere but they stay on this injury replacement list until we see them do it consistently when the team they're on is fully healthy  I think we can move through most of these other ones relatively fast I'll pause from time to time just to mention if somebody's not a play them all the time guy but Josh Hart with Julius Randle out every day Deuce McBride with ogn and Obi out every day Paul Reed with Joel and bead out is more I mean he technically hovering around that 100 range which should make him in every day guy but also  we've seen The Disappearance of scoring the rebounds are down the assists were never really all that high but they're basically gone lately he's pretty much been a smattering of rebounds and then pretty good defensive stats which I know I love defense of stats so it's weird for me to say that that's not enough at times but it's a little more Specialist Team so if you're playing Paul Reid understand that that's kind of where he's at right now  Kelly oubre is back cursing out referees it was absolutely hilarious he got fined 50 grand for doing the half-baked  foo foo foo you're cool F you I'm out mic drop and it was so worth it  but Uber is a play guy Al Horford if Boston rests anybody he's just perennially perennially perpetually here on the injury replacement board  Big Al Nick Richards  low end Center but he's been on this board for four months straight now  but see him it's such with Cody Martin out for the year  that's official I forgot to change the Cody Martin status to season but let me just more of a an assist stream at this point and you know this is the thing like we get caught up in these  you know what is a particular category worth kind of thing I get it assists or harder to find and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah bitches outside the top 200 over the last two weeks 12 points five assists a ton of turnovers no threes no rebounds a little bit of Steel block not good enough if you're trying to play them everywhere every day but if you're looking for five or more assists and you're not super worried about the rest of the stuff he's got going on then there you go so he's more of a specialist  Keon Ellis with Kevin herder out who's also a little bit of a specialist but we saw he can wake up from time to time and give you some points and a couple of boards and a couple of assists and that's all you really need out of him because like Paul Reed he's been awesome on the defensive side I think I like Ellis a little bit more because the defensive stuff has this insane insane  upper limit to it like a we don't really know how high it could go  I do think he's got a little bit pooped  which is I believe a medical term but if you were looking at her like why is Kiana Ellis seem like he's running out of gas well Sacramento played five games in seven Knights so yeah so some of these guys slow down why do you think they got their butts kicked by Dallas kings are gonna put on a better fight today and I expect Alice to be a part of that better fight  slow mo Kyle Anderson with Karl Anthony towns out is again I think he's also falls a bit more into that specialist Department at least in my eyes you know I last two weeks I think for slo-mo he is a playable over that stretch we're talking about like in every day or top 75 range 10 5 and 5 and a half with two and a half defensive stats  it's hard to see the defensive stats staying quite that high it's hard to see  well I guess the other stuff the assistant five and a half is probably a little bit on the high side but it's really about the defensive stats two and a half of them is probably gonna come down he probably falls back towards the edge of the top 100 which makes him a guy you can play everywhere  but again you when with guys in that 100 to 150 range you really need to be looking at what stats they're good and bad at  that's what those range guys are for this time of year  in November  you just play them a guy ranked around 100 you just play him in November because he's gonna give you a little bit of a bunch of things and maybe not as much of the other things but you can't fall behind in games played in November and a guy that gives you enough stuff where the math basically equates that he's a play then you do it but this time of year if it's like well okay what if I don't need steals then slow mo becomes only semi valuable what if I don't need assists or steals well there's no point to play them at that juncture so you know your team better than I do  guys that have that you know 100 range kind of profile or guys where you have to pause and say do I need what they are giving or can I part with them  it's amazing to who's picked up some really nice minutes with us or Thompson out for the year in Detroit and Simone fontecchio out for we don't know how long in Detroit  I remain somewhat skeptical that make to is going to play 30 some odd minutes every day but he's definitely been the best option there lately  and I like his ability to get a few points in some nice rebounds and Steals and blocks and do it on good percentages  there's something there but I am a little bit hesitant to drop him into a roto lineup without knowing for sure that he's gonna get the minutes if you see he's starting talking about May 2 then I coin flip it I just I really don't want to spend my games cap on a guy who's not gonna perform right now Delano been and timani Kumar Camaro is actually out for Portland so I probably should have thrown an asterisk on his name but with Simon's and ayton and sharp and Brogden and the Wicked Witch and  Sasquatch and the Tooth Fairy everybody's out for Portland right now  bands taking 20 shots of all game which you know bad efficiency be damned if you're just out there 37 minutes and taking every shot you're gonna have fantasy value unless you're full Russell Westbrook in the percentage is which he's not  he's not good in them but he's not you know rust tank you level  and then tomorrow when he's in has you know a little bit of a better Fantasy game that Banton does he's not gonna shoot his offense so that caps out a tad but those two guys are playable when they're in and everybody else is out  Josh giddey is your relatively safe SGA replacement he's got his big Fantasy game holes but he's gonna shoot enough and passed enough and rebound enough where he probably overwhelm those  and then I expect Anthony Davis back for this ball game at Indiana for the Lakers but they're not gonna push these guys the Lakers I think are pretty well resigned to the fact that they are in the plate in tournament the push now for La would be to try to get into the 7-8 pocket instead of the nine ten  and  you know they they can't really afford to lose any games against teams that are not significantly better than them and Indiana is not one of those teams and if you look at the Lakers upcoming schedule they've got basically five games in a row coming back from Milwaukee or after Milwaukee which they won mind you but Memphis Indiana Brooklyn Toronto Washington Indiana Far and Away the best team in that bunch  this is an opportunity for the Lakers to gain ground on the King's and the Suns King's have a tougher schedule by all accounts they have Utah in there that's a gimme but Dallas the Clippers the Nicks the Celtics are the other games coming up for Sacramento and then we know the sun's we've talked about it before they have the toughest schedule in the NBA they wanted in Denver but now they've got the Thunder all the without SGA so that's helpful for them Pelicans calves wolves Pelicans again Clippers twice Kings and wolves there's just no easy game for the Suns so the Lakers are  eyeing I would think the eight seed so that they have kind of two chances at the playoffs meaning will they push their guys I know LeBron was like look I'm not gonna push myself I can't worry about seating but the difference between one and done versus two and done is enormous  so I'd be pretty surprised if Anthony Davis didn't play tonight but if he doesn't play that's the big preface to really hatch more and jaxson Hayes are guys that you should throw into your lineup see I got there  I just slow walk us there but we got there  and that's your massive injury replacement board now let's get to the ads everybody's favorite part of the day and I remind you all once again if you're joining us late please do take a moment to like subscribe  I can speak  it's what I do  subscribe but  and  please drop that five star review today this is the this is the last two weeks of the seasons is where I'm gonna start to come at you with please review stuff  adds adds of the week Max Drew's back and he looks a lot better he looked freaking spy in that last ball and I don't know that carries over maybe you just had it game where he was healthy or he was hitting shots but it did seem like he needed time off that he wasn't getting  and then he got it and then  I don't know it just doesn't seem like it's a coincidence that he came back from injury and looked healthy Andrew Wiggins is I think animal with golden state he's a guy I had more in the doesn't matter group but he's been playing better than that lately so we'll upgrade him a click  Marvin Bagley is an ad with Rashawn Holmes already ruled out for the Wizards ballgame due to his toe injury that means it's Bagley or Bust at the center spot he'll probably get 25 to 32 minutes somewhere in that neck of the woods and yes though I do not like his Fantasy game in general that is enough time for him to put up some fantasy numbers  and then finally and he's the picture on the thumbnail this week  Jonathan Isaac not a guy you can pick up his head to head because a missed ball game is enough to sink your team  but  after today tomorrow they only have one more back to back the rest of the way and next week they got games every other day so there is a shot  that John I might play all four games next week a shot yes 50/50 shot  calling Flippy  but if we find out which of the two back-to-back games he's playing today tomorrow early you can make a decision then that actually could potentially work out for you on the head-to-head side because look what if I Isaac skips today plays tomorrow well then teams that played today but don't have games the rest of the week you could pivot into Jonathan Isaac knowing look wherever you go you're turning a zero into a one-game rest of the week go for a guy who's got this ridiculous appeal for threes and percentages and Steals and blocks and some rebounds  Jonathan Isaac belongs on all Rodeo  teams right now unless you don't need any of the like four or five categories he's good at  but let's remember  if the magic get to a point and they're just like you know what let's see if Jonathan Isaac can play 28 minutes and actually play in the next ball game what if they gave him 28 minutes one night just to see  it's not gonna happen I don't know why I'm even bringing it up but man oh man  strong holds is the next category on our board these are ones this this is now the category that requires the least exploitation because these are guys that at some point in like the last two weeks I've been asked whether or not you should drop and this is me saying nope  Deni avdija who has  some of pretty good efficiency issues actually and and this is why I was hesitant to draft him at the beginning of the year he's number one 36 on the season last two weeks he's number one 50  but it's largely because he's going way under on his free throw shooting over that small sample size he's had a couple of games where he's just been absolute dog due with the foul line one for three on March 8th 4 for 7 on March 12th three for six and one for three on the 23rd and then back on the 21st respectively  call the free throw yep call it just a weird down tick because maybe he was above his average before that if you wipe that out over the last two weeks avda goes from being sort of not playable to very playable and you can't just wipe it out that's not fair  because it happened  but  understanding that that's not the norm for him I think is really important because it's small sample size  we were looking at last two to three weeks he's played in seven or eight ball games he's averaging 19 and 10 with three to four assists a steal a three-pointer 54% from the field but he's shooting like 55% of the foul line over that stretch which is terrible but also that's not sustainable now we talked a lot about what is an is not sustainable for a player under 60% free throw shooting for Avidia not a sustainable number so if he continues to score 19 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and give you four assists and not a lot of defensive stats but hit a three-pointer or two and you know hopefully like one to 1.2 combined defensive stats  and the free-throw number gets back where it belongs near 7273 well then he goes from being number one 50 to more like you know number 60 it's a big jump right now because of what has unfortunately become kind of a high volume terrible foul shooting over the last two to three weeks but that's it  as these as he follows up saying I don't really need to talk about these players by giving and needlessly long explanation Trey man and Charlotte is playing relatively well right now he belongs on rosters Gary Trent Jr and Kelly Olynyk again this is not a show talking about schedules I know they're in a bad scheduling spot but those two guys belong on rosters  I wish Olynyk would stop with the like four turnovers a game BS going on lately because that is artificially depressing his value because the other stuff is pretty damn good  12 and 6 with a steal points 6 blocks but for her game whoa Kelly  get it together dude I know you got a force it when your teammates all kind of think which Think Tank and Toronto Walker Kessler they're gonna be some people that are dropping him you should probably pick him up because he's actually getting most games 23 ish or more minutes that's good enough Trey Jones  is on a little bit of a cold snap but he'd been very good for about a month month and a half straight and the assist buttress any drop-off in his value TJ McConnell is just rolling these days and then Trace Jackson Davis who got a giant ball game because Draymond Green got ejected but  you know he's another guy where well the difference between Tracy Jackson Davis and Danny is that  obviously is going to shoot 70 something percent at the foul line at the end of the day Jackson Davis is probably going to stay in the 50s so that's not a thing where you can be like well hey maybe this will level off that it is level off  he's bad foul shooter Jackson Davis but if you need those big man stats then he is then he is a strong hole  and let's pivot into the soft hole because I think these ones probably require just an extra minute or two of our time  you only Tunis who really looked like a drop the game before when he played 10 minutes but in that actually came out yesterday and was a factor a magical twist he had two turnovers they were both on illegal screens if you're wondering how that happened 17 in 10 a steal a block at 3:00 on positive percentages that's the van and chunis that we were looking for and it only took him 23 minutes to get there this is this remains a hard one for me because I don't have Valentine's anywhere so to try to put myself in your shoes I'm doing my damn best and I think that's why he's a soft hole because On Any Given night he could just get his 20 something minutes again  bucks are a big team  they play fast  sporadically but when they're in a half quart they play strong ball and so I think that's part of the reason that New Orleans wanted valence units out there was someone to just bang into people  especially because there are other guys weren't really hitting shots so they just needed somebody to go get an easy bucket around the rim besides design  the Zion versus Giannis free throw off in this ball game was gross  oof Zion won it at 63% on high volume honest 46% on high volume  yucky  DeAndre Hunter  thank goodness he had a better ball game because I was having trouble convincing you guys that you had to hang on he went over three at the free throw line I can't possibly figure out what the hell happened there but 21 and 13 with five three pointers the free throw thing is obviously not something that's gonna be a long-term problem but you know it just there's enough for him to do with Trey young out and with Jalen Johnson out and with saddiq Bey out  teams missing a lot of dudes  GG Jackson is the softest whole recommendation I can possibly offer to you and it's largely because he's gonna be good at scoring and scoring is extraordinarily hard to find  on a waiver wire they just aren't that many guys that are going to give you between 15 and 22 points on average and he's probably gonna be there because he's taking typically 13 to 19 shots of ball game problem is when they're not going in he doesn't do anything else he has four steals over the last three weeks combined three of them came in one outlier ball game  he doesn't pass all that much three one zero four zero three three two zero those are the assist numbers will rebound a little bit he'll get you like four to five rebounds a game but it's mostly threes and points on pretty good free throw percent and terrible field goal percent and so if you catch him on the wrong two or three games band which is basically what just happened for Gigi his rank Falls like a boulder in the ocean he's back near the edge of the top 300 over the last week because he's shooting a medium volume with 35% from the field and he doesn't do anything beside score so very soft hold if you don't need points Abandon Ship now  if you do okay Santi aldama not that dissimilar although at least he's able to sort of you know push his value up from the seller by getting some blocks some steals some boards things like that so even over the last week where he hasn't been able to knock down any shots he's still inside the top 50 because he's a 2.4 defensive stats eight plus rebounds two plus assist out of the power forward spot he said two three pointers a game out of the power forward spot and he hasn't turned the ball over in a week basically so I'll dhamma is a soft hold but an easier call I think then someone like Jackson just because of what he can do in a few different spots  Grizzlies had a bad schedule to end this week so he may end up on some ways but their schedule gets good again next week so I'll almost a guy you could pick up on  me tomorrow and then just hold for eight days of you wanted to  or longer then they go off for two days and then they got another back-to-back after that so you can really hold the Grizzlies  any player on the grid starting tomorrow through the end of the year because what's that 16 days they got 11 they got nine games over 16 days it's not great but  it ain't bad and if you wait two days then you get eight games over 14 days which  I think that's I think that's  that'll play  Jalen Suggs what is it one is it one or two bad ball games in a row everyone was hard for me to keep everything in my head without it a browser tab open I think it's two  two bad ones in a row although he played 36 minutes in one of them really the most the most recent game was the only one where you like oh no what the hell happened there let's let's give him another one or two he'd been playing pretty well before that you know and he runs cold it really cools off quick I feel like he's still is one of those guys that kind of seized the finish line  and so then you get that that push forward  he's also in a situation where actually they got a back-to-back starting today so sucks is in a pretty damn good spot they go 10 times over the last 17 days to end the year so you could just pick him up and ride him out and head to head wrote I probably bench him  keyonte George  you got to be stat hunting here because again they're just isn't a bottom there's no floor  number 250 over the last week medium volume 31% from the field at least with keonte gets you a cysts  so he'll score and he'll pass you have two things you can lean back on free throw percentage is pretty good  soft hold for points assists and free throw percent on keyonte George but right now he's doing so much more damage than good  so if you dropped him I don't even care I dropped him in a couple spots I don't need those stats all that bad and I can't afford to lose the other ones  Isaiah hartenstein is a soft hole I just don't know what's going to happen with him with Mitchell Robinson slowly working his way back but it feels like the Nixon played so well with heart and Stein in there and Robinson is going to be brought along slowly that there's probably a little more  Runway  on the iHeart  free train  he did a very funny podcast with the Villanova guys I don't remember what it's called just talking about but actually his race so you should get you guys should go check it out the those those Nicks guys are absolutely hilarious and the podcast discussion was Illuminating and entertaining  but anyway soft hold and then Dennis Schroder is a pretty easy one he's playing well and the Nets have a couple guys out so pretty easy call there and finally the I'm scared or nervous or dropping list five names on it Malik Beasley is and I'm nervous guy or a pre-drawn you wanted to call it that with Chris Middleton and honest both healthy  but he's hot so this feels like sort of a weird time to say You must drop  he will be one soon  but he's also on the best two game Run he's had sinned  mid February so over a month  still it's hard to know with Beasley sometimes these heaters last for five six ball games in a row not that he was like freezing cold before that or anything and he's having a career best year in a lot of ways  so and you know scheduling I know we said we're not by scheduling but scheduling wise there in a good spot so you could probably hang on a little bit longer but as soon as he cools off even the tiniest bit you know I get the hell out of there Corey kispert is  probably a guy that I should just drop on the injury replacement board at this juncture he's a guy who's gonna get a bunch of stuff to do when Kyle kuzma's out that's what we've seen this year definitively whether he's hot or cold that's what locks in his consistent value Aaron Nesmith he's a drop Bruce Brown is a drop Chris Paul is really not more than a specialist at this point he's number 87 for the years so I get it we've got it other than the injury overall this year it's been fine but the last week he's number 240 and he's only playing 21 minutes over that stretch shooting poorly assist her down steals are down  you know we're still close to the end of the year that even if you dropped him and suddenly he had like two or three good games it's not like you're missing a long run of a proven asset at this point  it's been a perfectly fine year for him but he's now vanished and we have to react in the moment to that so as much as I love Chris Paul's Fantasy game I'm totally fine if you guys want to move on  I don't see any reason why you absolutely positively must hang on to Chris Paul right now I know that probably freaked you guys out but I said it out loud and I meant it  the watch list is a quick one Dillon Brooks is on the watch list in case he more consistently takes 14 15 shots Jake laravia I don't think he's getting there John conchar and Luke Kennard in case either one of them can actually get and stay healthy for the Grizzlies because I I truly believe that if either one of them gets healthy and stays healthy and the other one isn't that then that one that is healthy is the guy that you could probably start every day  keep an eye on Alexa poker chefski I think they're gonna have to see a couple guys maybe one more at least maybe like a miles Bridges would have to get  set down by the Hornets for poker to see more than about 22-23 minutes a game and we're gonna need more than that but he has a very unique Fantasy game and he looks a little bit  like the game is slowing down a tiny bit for poker  and then Mitchell Robinson is a watch list or if you really want to do you could wrote a stash him but again there's two weeks left in the season so I don't know how long you can hang on to a guy before it becomes uh well just a little bit silly  quick look at the chat room I do see a number of posts there so hello everybody happy Friday to the four of you that basically are saying hello at the beginning  and then a you're welcome to those that are thanking  any surprise sit outs for tonight from fari Gutierrez uh none yet  none yet um  Kate and Jaden Ivy were present at shoot around so I'm gonna assume they're in for Detroit Donovan Mitchell was at shoot around for Cleveland he was targeting a return to the lineup tonight so that's a seems like it's gonna happen  oh Chaya is already been ruled out for Toronto Marcus Sasser downgraded a questionable with an illness for Detroit but I mean you weren't playing his butt anyway and Karis Levert just got downgraded to questionable due to a sore wrist but with Donovan Mitchell back he wasn't a guy you were playing either so in terms of the news of the morning  not much not much  is Damian Lillard a top 10 pick next year no any I don't think he was a top 10 pick this year he was a guy that I thought was going to go and this is the thing like we do this every year and we talk ourselves into it  there was absolutely no way that Dane was going to do as much in Milwaukee as he did in Portland  none no chance  zero  zero percent chance  and this always happens where we back ourselves into like well what if the efficiency does this or what if this is do this or blah blah no  what a superstar joins an equally High usage guy nine times out of 10 they take a hit the question is just how much  I thought Dane was a very safe early second round pick and that's basically where he's been at this year he's a midse second round or on a per game basis who's been largely healthy so he's number 12 by totals  great if you got him early second round you should be totally satisfied  but there was this weird move I think late in the draft season where we were like you know maybe Dame will be a first round guy maybe something will figure itself out no we gotta stick to the damn odds on and Jess I'm not yelling at you I'm just yelling at the concept in general where we had too much time to think about the Dame trade and we've had too much time trying to think about other ones in the past dejounte Murray  joining up with Trey Young  it was it was always going to be this way now Tradesmen out for a few weeks so Murray's been taking every shot on planet Earth and rocketing himself into our hearts  he's up to number 31 now and he's been super healthy so that's good but I'm thinking more of even last year when uh when when the trade first went down dejounte Murray was a first rounder in San Antonio and  we all kind of backed ourselves into this thought of like you I don't know if you guys remember this not this draft season but the previous one when did jonte Murray got traded so he was listed as a first rounder on pre-rank  and then he got traded and he got dropped all the way down into the 30s which interestingly and ended up being the right move and then everybody's like now it's too far and then he bounced up into the teens and he bounced back down into the 20s and he really just sort of pendulum swung his way between that first round and third and until he landed at like number 20 which is not insane by the way but it's that kind of phenomenon where we had so much time during draft season two years ago to be like well maybe dejounte is going to be better here or maybe he's gonna be worse there and he just bounced back and forth almost indefinitely until finally the season just started and he couldn't his ADP couldn't bounce around anymore because nobody was drafting but that's what happens when guys join when ultra high usage guys join other ultra high usage guys  they take a hit  that's that's just how it works  I love Kevin Durant he's having a great year  but he's number 10  this year  and it's not because he's doing something like obscenely different than last year  in fact his numbers are  Honestly by and large relatively similar as a 29 and 5 last year this year is it 28 75  defensive stats are about the same I think it's if free throw is down for KD and he's one of the rare dudes who doesn't usually take the big hit when he joins up another Superstar because he remains kind of alpha level and his percentages are outstanding and blah blah and like Devin Booker didn't take much of a hit but oh what happened to Bradley Beal 102  14 shots a game even when he's been healthy he hasn't been that involved someone  always takes a hit specially when there's three of them  that was a pretty easy one to see coming feel taking the hit not KD or Booker  Katie and book pretty much did what they did  and the fact that that team also thinned out there's like nobody else on the team besides those three guys  when stars come together  someone drops  especially if they are in the case we're talking about here and Giannis  guys that it's not like a big in a little  those are ball in hand players  play the odds is what I'm saying on this one  I need a center if 8 is still out who do you I like best between Andre Drummond do Opera breath or Wendell Carter Junior  in a points format uh  probably one no Carter Junior in a points farm at talking from a strictly nine category sense isn't Klay Thompson also kind of a doesn't matter player ranked 112 for the season 115 for the last two months yeah so it's been this is a good question actually Clay's been an interesting one because he's had such an up-and-down season extraordinarily slow start then he got going a little bit and then he tapered off again and then he moved to the bench where he had a couple of big ball games and then he slowed down a little bit and now he's back in the starting lineup he is above a doesn't matter player  Albert great question because of one idea and the idea is  he is his floor is doesn't matter level he was basically operating at his floor for most of the season  but we know enough about clay to know that if he just gets like one more shot of game or the field goal percent ticks up like one percentage point then he is immediately above that level so what I need now I probably need to even break down my categories a little bit further there's the doesn't matter guys who basically have no prayer of ever getting out of that range and then there's the doesn't matter guys who are a little bit better the guys that you hold on to on the hope that they have a couple good weeks and then suddenly their number 90 or 85 instead of landing at 115 and right now with Clay coming back into the starting lineup he stops 60 something over the last two weeks  so there's that doesn't matter and then there's that that upside in  what's our plane with scoot Henderson I have no plan with scoot I haven't had him all season long and I don't ever want point guard or guard rookies it's just an absolute disaster almost every time  some guys figure it out in the second but it's good missed a bunch of time in the first half of the year so he's still kind of on that learning curve  Portland schedule also stinks to high heaven this week before he gets okay again I mean like if you really want to get their eight games over the last two weeks had to head side you could but he's gonna probably do more damage than good  I got Halliburton in three of my five teams I got him at pick six to seven which I thought were steals back then where do you think he'll go next year I think he'll go in that same range because he was awesome until he got hurt and he just hasn't been the same guy since he's still number 11 on a per game basis overall but you've seen the field goal percent drop you've seen the Steels drop you've seen the scoring drop I personally don't think Halliburton ever really got fully healthy again so he'll go mid first round again next year  do I think oggian and obey your incentive aldama are a drop I talked about Santee already I don't to say he's trending down after Clark came back I think might be a bit premature I you know I he was trending down because he just got colder but he's doing other stuff right now  so I'm holding Santee a little bit longer he's a soft hold Ogden and Obi if you're in the playoffs is a drop because we don't know when he's coming back if you can stash him obviously you stash him and then is Joelle and bead able to come back and play next week I think the hope is yes  if you've made it this far you might as well just keep going you've held him for what seven weeks and now it's like oh he's close well he's doing stuff at practice I don't know what that means for you know was he gonna do play 19 minutes well 19 of them beat is better than 35 of a lot of these dudes  and finally would you consider streaming if you're worst players are iot assume Jalen Suggs and Daniel gaffer yes I would stream the Jalen Suggs spot and that is our week in review episode I'm  I think I'm gonna do this dreaming show in a little bit I think I need to get up and move around  yeah plus I'd like to wait and see who gets ruled in and ruled out maybe we'll get some more injury news over the next two to two and a half hours and we will do our injury streamer show our head-to-head whatever  right after my lunch that'll be the
