welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast so we can review time ladies and  oh yes  Friday shows are always a grand Adventure I'm so glad you guys are along with me for it welcome to Fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation I am  Dan best price  and I am on Twitter at  Andres  I know  complicated life this one  and who  guess we ought to talk about some stuff news of the morning news of the morning the Baseball division over here at sports ethos released their draft tracker tool it is awesome  if you guys use the one we had over on the NBA side which was all so stellar  I did it I used it in every single draft I was in I'm never going back you can get that over in the MLB fantasy pass if you have an NBA pass here at sports ethos you can upgrade to the All Sport for one dollar one dollar it's ridiculous  I promise when you start using a draft tracker like that you'll never go back to drafting without it again  just to know how your team is doing in real time and how everybody else is doing in real time it's an unbelievable luxury you're going to love it  today of course on the show will be Breaking Down The Weeknd review which I say is the week in review but it's really like the mid week in review so kind of like Monday through yesterday four or five days roughly  we'll get through all that good stuff I don't believe we'll have time for the schedule streaming episode today it's already 9:30 out here Pacific time  so unless we zip through this show in record time I don't know how we get to the other one I'll do my very best but I got to get out of here pretty quickly this morning as I've mentioned if you guys want to listen to more Dan I will be doing baseball play-by-play for the USC Trojans over the next three days so you guys can catch that and satisfy what I'm sure is a gaping need for more of my voice yelling into your ear but let's talk about  whoops  week 20 in review here we go I already told you about it silly season is on us for a few teams at least stretch run is two playoffs are gone  but I want to remind you guys that this show is not geared towards a playoff league right now so just a heads up if you're like Dan I'm watching this show because I want to know who to stream tonight  that's not this one we'll try to do some of that stuff over on social media again we've been really pushing that hard all week long and I hope you guys have been enjoying the extra playoff head-to-head scheduling content I've been putting out but I don't think we're gonna have for time for that second show today so this one is really more about  players you can hold for whatever reason treat it like oh season long non-playoff League or if you're not in your playoffs letterhead or if it's Road or whatever that's more what this is about please do again follow me over on Twitter at the best first follow ethos fantasy BK for basketball ethos fantasy BBB for baseball and please do like rate and subscribe as you enjoy the program  I over the last couple of days weaks have changed font sizes on our diagrams for these Friday shows just so they barely fit on one page which means we only have a couple of names for a section fonts going to be very large so welcome to large font City here for the ads of the week and those four names are Nas Reed Daniel Gafford Kelly Olynyk and Gary Trent Jr those of you that have been listening to the show throughout the week you guys have heard my explanations on these players but I have to treat every show like at least one new listener is joining us so here's why we're looking at these particular players feel free to tune me out if you already know what I'm gonna say nazri is about cat so technically this is an injury replacement play but it sounds like by all accounts the wage report is that cat is going to be done for the regular season they're hoping you haven't back early in the playoffs but again we're talking about you know regular season is five weeks left we're basically done he's being re-evaluated at four weeks meaning even if he came back the following day he'd be on a severe minutes cap for what two games  so cats basically a drop which sucks but that means that not read is a rest of season hold add in this context  what are you going to get out of Nas um yeah yesterday's ball game Thursday's game I thought was a relatively decent indicator 13 points 8 boards to assist a steel Block in a three-pointer took 15 shots so if he was more efficient you might have got an extra couple more points on that  what does that put him like ranking wise I don't know that it matters because we're past the trade deadline so it's not like you're going to be trying to pawn him off to somebody simple fact is  he's a floor spacing big who can rebound and get some defensive stats  that's an awesome fantasy stat set it translates well I don't know if that means top 70 top 90 whatever he's a start that's all you need to worry about at this stage of the season is somebody a start in all formats or is somebody not a start in all formats and he is my headphones are going in and out here for a moment I think I got that fixed Daniel Gafford is the next one and admittedly yesterday's game was sort of fine at best but I'm more concerned with the fact that he started yes yesterday's ballgame Gafford into the starting five replacing Derek Lively who actually played more minutes than gaffer off the bench because his units were performing better  Lively still dealing with this this facial issue is nose fracture  and maybe Gafford goes back to the bench I don't know perhaps but think about Gafford is he only needs about 22 minutes to post fantasy value you got 21 minutes yesterday and he was pretty damn close frankly if he doesn't go too for four at the free throw line because perfect five for five from the field I mean it's a guy that might shoot 70% playing alongside Luca and Kyrie he gets blocks he gets boards his field goal percentage colossal he's a pretty good free throw shooter in general  so again give me starting Daniel Gafford  because it raises the floor now you're talking about a guy who's very rarely if he stays in the starting five so this is sort of the big if there  it's very rare that a guy starts and doesn't play like 19 or 20 minutes it happens Derek Jones had it happen in this ball game it happens but it's pretty rare unless somebody's absolutely horrible you know they play the first seven six seven minutes of the game for six seven minutes of the third quarter that's just it they don't come back in I don't think that's gonna happen here with gas or I think you're talking about 20 minute minimal which starting job raised his floor and racist ceiling because when you start if you're playing your butt off your minutes are going to tick up  as a bench it's like well if the starters playing well you're gonna get 16 minutes the start is not playing well you might be able to push yourself forward but that means you also need to play well  basically what I'm saying is here  if you're a starter you can get more minutes by simply playing well independent basically what other people are doing if you're off the bench and this is a simplification of things if you're off the bench you kind of need to both play well and have the guy in front of you not playing well at the same time you need two things to go right now we only needs one Speaking of Gafford here  so in my opinion if he was dropped you add him back up this is why we tried so desperately to hold on to him as long as we could  and he's got upside we know that  Kelly Olynyk and Gary Trent Jr are the other two ads of the week because I think yakka Pirtle probably done for this the regular season it seems like Scotty Barnes might also be done for the regular season although I guess we don't know that for sure  if you really wanted to split hairs you could put a link in Trent in the injury replacement Zone  I don't think that's entirely necessary  fine like it doesn't matter either way they're plays right now a Linux was only fine yesterday he'll be better than that most ball game Gary Trent was great yet 30 points and five three-pointers the usage is going to be awesome because a lot of guys are out Barnes is out  they've opened up the board  for what we needed  which is I kept like look I I I'm not gonna go into the Kelly Olynyk how we basically we got very lucky that I had him added everywhere and then all these guys went down Gary Trent was one that I kept that I had actually and if you look back at last Friday show he had sort of moved his way into the dust and matter group which was it probably be in that like 125 range and then another player went down for Toronto and every time one player goes down it's just a little bit more and at some point there are enough little bits  to for a guy to get over the cut line  and between Barnes is usage being out and they're just not being other choices to go big for Toronto they're gonna go small and that means  Gary Trent  and all so and  Emmanuel quickly was running point in this last ball game he had a ridiculous 18 assists you're gonna see better ball movement with a Linux as the center then you would with Yakima Turtle that's going to help the other guys it's this little thing  all right next page  strong holds I've broken the holds into strong and soft holds here and I probably should have done this earlier in the season frankly because not every hole is created equal in fantasy basketball sometimes it's an easier decision sometimes it's harder one the strongholds in my opinion which is maybe I should come up with a better word for it because a stronghold is its own thing  or I just say the words more clearly and slowly a strong  or confident hold these are the guys that have given you no reason to drop them  so I think we should be able to Blitz through this group Klay Thompson especially now with Steph dealing with that turned ankle Trey Murphy who has been surging like a son of a gun and by next week he probably won't be a stronghold anymore because I believe the heater runs out over the next seven days  grace and Allen who's backing everybody's good graces keyonte George who's putting up gigantic counting stats before you got sick  he'll have his downsides make no mistake but nobody's dropping him Deni avdija specially now with Marvin Bagley on the Shelf because obviously is gonna play some small ball Center and that's generally good for him Trey man who's been a little banged up here lately but he's not a guy you can drop to the wire because someone else will scoop him quickly herb Jones I don't know why I didn't put the two Pelicans together on this board but I didn't so leap in deal with it  and I'm sorry Thompson who's finally getting the run that we wanted him to get through the middle of the Season through the dog days but either Monty Williams was sick of him or is tired or some combination thereof  but he's back to playing good minutes and it doesn't seem like anything's taking that away from it  soft holds these are the ones that I think require a little bit more explanation Aaron Nesmith Marvin Bagley Paul Reed Isaiah hartenstein are the four soft holds  and I should clarify too  then when we talk about soft holds  these are players where if you dropped them I don't think I'd be all that mad about it  a soft hold is kind of like a  it answers the question of Dan what are you doing yourself  in the for the teams that have these players so for the two teams I have that where Aaron East Smith is on them  I am holding Him Softly  or Loosely if we want to go  was at 38 Special  was a 48  38 right  yeah 38 specials the name of that band  oh I couldn't come up with the number what do I know about  specials  so Benedict Matthew and being out as part of it I don't think we can call neesmith a and injury replacement because he was starting anyway but with mathura out there really aren't that many players sort of gun for his minutes  meaning even if he continues to be this weird facsimile of earlier season Nesmith  he still got 30 minutes yesterday and he was a plus two so he like he was decent when he was out there his unit on the floor was playing relatively well  and if he doesn't shoot like absolute dog do it ends up being a decent ball game he shot two for ten from the field even four for 10 would have been good enough because I probably would have been a three-pointer in a 2 pointer  that would have been 13 points for boards and assist two threes and two blocks plus three for three foul shooting in no turnovers  that would have been a pretty good line  but eight and four with two blocks you're looking at it like what are we doing here  but I think you got a hold because we saw enough of niece Smith when he was healthy or early this year to say this is a guy who's playing his tail off he was putting a big defensive stats he was scoring a little bit but it wasn't about that it was just like the run through a brick wall guy for his team and he just doesn't have that  surge in him right now  presumably because of the injury stuff I guess I don't know for sure and they haven't really come out and say it said it and as much but we can try to read between the lines a little so I'm holding onto neesmith in places that I can in places that I can't which for you guys would probably be a head-to-head playoffs you kind of have to look at and go no oh I'm holding on a Marvin Bagley where I can he was putting up some really nice numbers before this back injury popped up I get it if you're in a playoff format and he's not ill eligible yet because he's only missed one game and he's gonna have to miss the game tonight and Sunday before Yahoo gives him the eel tag that's a hard dude to hang on to because you gotta suck down 3-0 to get to an eel stash probably can't do that in the head-to-head playoffs and that's why he's been dropped in a number of leagues  specifically ones that I've had to head playoffs if you're not in your playoffs right now there's absolutely no reason to drop him because we just don't know how long he's gonna be out he got ruled out for today's game yesterday which sort of makes you think that he's still at least two or three games away  now great but you know look at the games before he had to exit early he was starting to get on a pretty good role  15 and 14 9 and 10 20 and 9 23 and 4 he actually had six blocks over those four games attendant 10 the current Thomas double double and then he actually had six nine and four with a steel before he went down in that game against Utah  so things were coming together for him maybe the best news is that he didn't really go to the foul line much in there to you know thank you  very much  uh so try to hold on if you can soft hold  Paul Reed is a hold because we don't really know what the hell his job is right now he looked great for a couple of weeks then he disappeared then he came off the bench for a couple of games and he was better and then he was not and then he started and he was good again with 17 field goal attempts against the Memphis Grizzlies I think some of it has to do with the fact that everybody's out for the Sixers right now Kyle Lowry sat that game Maxine and beat her both out  Nick bottom sounds like he might be out for their next ball game well I assume that Lowry is back for that one all that just sort of rolls into well Paul read probably is going to just have to take more than four shots because everybody's hurt right now  so soft hold  I don't know that his minutes are going to take much above 20 for 25 but  with all the usage guys gone  does that mean he's gonna like take a dozen shots or more again I don't think that he gets that the 17 shot spelled like a pretty good size outlier but you know maybe get to eight and instead of six and that's probably enough because then you just get them out there long enough to get six seven eight rebounds to assist a steal a block that kind of thing so soft hold on Paul Reed  in basically all formats because at least you're not sitting on a zero at that point and then Isaiah hardenstein who might damn well be the most difficult soft hold in all of fantasy basketball because Mitchell Robinson is breathing down his neck at this point he should be back in the next couple of weeks and hartensteins achilles doesn't seem to be getting any better  Lord help me I wish it was because I've been soft holding heart and Shine for a while now but he hasn't played full starters minutes in a month  February 6th was the last game he played over 30 minutes  he got 27 minutes on February 26th against Detroit starting to Trend the right direction then he needed the next game off  it was a back-to-back mind you but he's gone 2023 and then the three game since then  so just doesn't seem like he's getting back to it and I know earlier this year I had Tyreese Halliburton as a Buy Low when he was dealing with the thing like this because you knew there was time for it to get ramped up but it wasn't like anybody was going to come for halliburton's role that wasn't his Achilles that was something else for Halliburton is just sort of a similar like indefinite low minutes cap thing even if Archen starts to get revved back up here in the next I don't know two three four five ball games whatever it happens to be then you're gonna have to deal with the fact that Mitchell Robinson is going to be splitting minutes with him  and Randall's gonna come back and OG's gonna come back and the next have more depth than they had before  he was so good when he was good  makes no sense he was so good when he was playing minutes  which makes it so hard so unbelievably difficult to drop him  and so he's a soft hole but at the same time  you could probably drop  I hate it I hate even that it came out of my mouth  put it back in  here's the I'm scared or nervous grouping all the before I get to that I do want to take that quick second in the middle of the show to remind you guys to check out our partners over at manscape.com the handyman  I cleaned myself up hey maybe I should make my face a little bit bigger for this for those that are watching where is the where's the big face there's big face look at that cleaned it up man look at that yeah  I do it all with landscape that by the way that's not me blowing smoke I use the handyman for the areas cheeks here maybe some like around the rim of the neck I use the handyman for any place that I need an actual electric razor shave and then I have two different iterations of lawn mowers in my medicine cabinet that has  there's the lawn mower three which I like because it has the best I thought non pinching technology so for areas like in you know around the rim of the neck that's been really useful and then the lawn mower four is what I take a little bit lower  to bring it in tight that's before I use the handyman on stuff where I want to make sure that it looks real clean so I like I got a whole process here and it's all just awesome manscapes stuff they've been sending me over the last three years you should go buy it ethos 20 is the code ethos 2-0 gets you 20% off and free shipping on your order  all so shout out again to everybody that continues to hit a thumbs up button on the shows and likes and follows over on Twitter I again changed something earlier this week  where it seems like the social media algorithm is enjoying  our show more I don't know what the hell I did  anyway um  so here's the potential drop board boy on bug zdanowicz she's been on there for a while I know we had a couple of better ball games recently but I do think that parallels or kind of lines up with Jalen Brunson being out I'm in Thompson last week on Friday I said you got one more chance he hasn't really done anything with it so sorry love is Fantasy game Buddy ain't playing any minutes new names on the drop or potential drop board or trade Jones and Derek Lively the second Lively coming off the bench he might still get enough minutes to be somewhat relevant but it just again it lowers that floor when you're not the starter  and then Trey Jones who  I don't know but like the Spurs might grow around him  he's getting I think a little bit of a free pass  because the Spurs are much better when he plays more  one of the reasons I didn't draft trade Jones this year wasn't because I thought he was gonna get marginalized in fact you know that went that went horribly on a lot of fronts I didn't draft Trey Jones because I didn't think he was good at enough things in fantasy I don't have any on a single team other than one where I picked him up in the middle of the season when he started getting more minutes he's number one 32 right now and he's obviously been a lot better over the last month or two versus the beginning of the year but even that stretch has been more like  he got he got hot for a while and then the last month he's right around that 130 range because he's shooting 55% from the field that's very good and frankly a little bit high for him but only 6.2 shots so I didn't helping all that much nine points four boards six and a half assists I like the assists  but what do we really targeting with him here  he's point guard who can get you okay feel goal percent and okay a sis he's like if TJ McConnell didn't get steals  TJ McConnell but one of the reasons I love teaching McConnell's because he gets steals  unfortunately and you know Jones took nine shots and said of six it'd be a totally different discussion but right now he's really only providing a positive impact in one category  yes he's well above average and fuel goal and free throw percent but his volume is so low that it kind of doesn't matter he's basically just not hurting you there because he's good but he's not shooting so he needs he just needs to be better in some other thing whether it's taking more shots or more free throws or bumping the Steels up into the you know one point two range or something like that instead of 0.9  this is the stuff that needs to happen  and it just hasn't and now we're in March  so I don't think you need to sit on trade Jones I don't think he's gonna be an impact guy you know like if you want me to put him in the doesn't matter group I'm okay with that all so maybe that's more accurate for him he's a doesn't matter  anyway  um let's see here we've got a massive watch list so let me see a couple of questions in the chat room are about Trey man he's Sally a mitsch Derek Lively Jake ravia Marvin Bagley nasri Walker Kessler by the way he was not on my list and Andre Drummond who's not on my list so to the questions the previous questions the ones that I just listed off there  the only two names that I won't be getting to or have already talked about our Walker Kessler and Andre Drummond so let me hit those real quick here as a chat room break before we get into the big lists which is watch list and injury replacement Walker Kessler I have no idea what to do with  I know you guys are coming to me for me to sort of plant my flag in an answer  no clue  none  frankly doesn't look like Walkers been super healthy all season long but the good news is that he was a participant in practice yesterday so by all accounts we might see Kessler in the next week  if you're in your playoffs hopefully you can keep them in an eel slot  Utah is in the midst of an absolutely atrocious scheduling chunk here remember we talked about it on yesterday's streaming show that they have two games over 8 Days starting yesterday so now it's two games over seven days  but so I mean in my eyes that probably means they just hold Kessler out for those two games but maybe I'm wrong maybe they get him back in to say hey here's your opportunity to ramp up with out with the most rest on planet Earth  try to hold on because if he comes back in time for their five and seven he probably plays three or four out of those five I would assume but everybody's out for this team so getting back in there and you know marking is not in the oven to play a little bigger  probably isn't great for John Collins but whatever try to hold if you can be him being ill eligible is useful because you can probably sit on him I don't know what day he comes back but I'm guessing we see him by the time Utah gets to that five and seven stretch  hope that helps a little bit Andre Drummond I've talked about 100 times on this show so I'm guessing you may be a new reviewer and great so welcome buddy I'm happy to have you the story with Drummond is  he has his big games against teams that play two centers basically so the Wolves when they had cat and go bear cats hurt now obviously the calves when they had both Mobley and Jared Allen and now Mobley starts all these teams have lost one of their two you know Twin Towers situations and then if Caruso has to miss a game so Drummond is spot play he is the reason he's not putting up numbers every day is because they don't intend to play him every day  that's a story on Andre Drummond  oh two a couple of the names that just popped up here Nick Richards do Opera don't worry there on our list Iota soon was on the list Clint capela is not on any of my lists yes he's still a whole I think at some point his minutes cap starts to take up a little bit but luckily the floor for him is like 121 30 range so that's very holdable  all right let's get back to my actual list here because dammit it's my show and I do with it what I want here's your watch list it's a big one so lean back in your chairs ladies and gentlemen Kyle Anderson watch list got a lot of questions about why I thought he wouldn't be the same Kyle Anderson that he was last year why wasn't I hire on him as the pickup between Kyle known as slow-mo because he operates in slow motion and nasri why was I so pronas and anti Kyle  and the reason is  Kyle Anderson just isn't doing as much this year  and I don't think that was because cat was healthy it's just the makeup of the Timberwolves  gobert does more  ant does more  nickeil Alexander Walker does more Nas Reed does more Jaden McDaniels does pretty much the same it's like I every night I wish upon a star that Jaden McDaniels would get more involved offensively for the Timberwolves and every night I know it's not gonna happen but basically What's Happening Here is that slo-mo who was needed last year to be kind of that like a point guard unifying anchor when cat was out because Dilo was not that guy he's not a point guard anchor player he'd much better at what the Lakers ask him to do which is be a flamethrower run the offense for stretches but his job isn't to get everybody else involved his job is to just like go  hit the hit the accelerator B D'Angelo Russell then they brought in Conley who was like hey my job is not to go button but it's dead to just make sure all of you guys are a go  and that took a little away from what slo-mo was responsible for doing for them  so then you kind of saw it yesterday Kyle played plenty play 28 minutes only took five shots only had four assists  fouled out you might have gotten more minutes then I had enough fouled out but even still like we're not talking about a Kyle and you know the old version the guy who did stuff if you gave him 2627 minutes I'd say great top 100 guy pick him up I mean I feel like he probably needs 33 minutes in this current iteration of like don't do a whole lot slow-mo and I don't know that he's gonna get that  so that's why I'm not quite as high there let's move this through this list a little bit quicker Jordan Goodwin is on the watch list he's a spot play guy for Roto when you actually see him on the active board for Memphis but he hasn't played in the last couple of ball games Santi aldama I do I know he had a big ball game last time out but I continued to think he's tied his production is generally tied to whether or not Jared Jackson is in there now if he gets hot great but if he doesn't you saw the minutes fluctuate hard when JJ was healthy and he's playing again now Jake laravia he's had a couple of double doubles in a row from Memphis keep an eye on him again I'm not convinced that this is gonna stick all the way through but you know with guys like Luke Kennard kind of in and out and Contra in and out and Jaren Jackson in and out at some point  there may just dance and oh and Zyer Williams being out is also relevant here at some point you might just take the plunge on levia  kind of looking ahead for Memphis a little bit their schedule is okay starting tonight they go four times over the next six days and then they're off for a couple of days and schedules not that great the rest of the way for the Grizzlies so if you're thinking Head to Head side and I think for Roto you can probably just watch a little bit longer see what happens  Grant Williams is on the watch list Brits kind of perpetually at this point so flat Corey kispert is on my watch list in case he sticks in the starting lineup with Marvin Bagley out then I would like Lee play hymn Terence man for the Clippers is always a watch Lister when his minutes are up but I pretty much I don't believe that he can hold a nine cat role Domani Kamara and Matisse diebel in Portland it's just too many bodies in and out of that line up right now  similar to the Grizzlies you don't have that many guys that have good nine cat game Bible could Kamara I don't even really know if he could but we need a lot of guys to be out know Jeremy Grant is back to being questionable again so I'm maybe he disappears for another ballgame or two and maybe Kamar comes back from an illness  there's a lot of bad fantasy players on that Portland roster  so that's why they're on the watch list that's why they're not on a playlist  Brandon pajama ski back on the watch list because Steph Curry went down so pods might see an uptick in minutes and facilitation all the it's unclear because they have both Draymond and CP3 healthy right now so they just might not need that extra bit I would like to see how it goes first  Rashawn Holmes got 25 minutes off the bench with no Bagley around if he slide into the starting five I started that's the simple answer for me on Roshan  Andrew Wiggins I don't know what the hell's going on there  is it going to be a headspace thing again for him hopefully we can says all right I don't see how you pick him up in any head-to-head format Roto you could squat on him treat him kind of like an injury stash and hope his minutes come back up over the next week and he does have better upside than a lot of the guys on this watch board so I could understand that move but I don't think you need to overextend yourself Jalen Suggs he's been a little better lately he shot the ball well for a game or two but we know kind of the ultimate field goal percent issue there so no campaign  I don't trust him in nine cat maybe he puts up points League numbers with maxi out but even that I'm pretty skeptical of  D Anthony Melton also being out kind of opens things up but they have Kyle Lowry who yes sat out the back-to-back but they don't have another back-to-back for like two and a half weeks I think  all the Cavs floor spacing big wings are on the watch list George and yang Sam Merrill Dean Wade  it's not clear that any one of these three guys is going to be good enough for more than one single game at a time but my inclination is to say no to Dean Wade and to say yes to whichever of nyang or Merrell is starting  basically for Max Drew's and then if strus comes back at some point which presumably he will but I don't know how long then you just  abandon ship on all this stuff Norman Powell is a watch list guy he hasn't been good enough with Russ out so I don't expect that to uptick but you never know Bryce sends them all in Utah probably not going to be relevant when keyonte George and or Walker Kessler come back if marketing decides to play again then we know it's not going to be useful and then really hatch a Moro who's been really playing well for the Lakers but his Fantasy game has been limited because pretty much only scores but if LeBron has to miss any time that would be the way that you bump rui up a click  quickly here the stream while hot club actually lost a few names because guys got hurt in front of them so Jordan Clarkson who used to be on here is now an injury play because everybody's hurting Utah I think I took someone else off this one I forget who the remaining names are RJ Barrett whichever between her and monk in Sacramento is getting the minutes it's Malik right now Jeremy Sohan who is actually kind of warm  maybe one BB out a little bit extra and then no probably not Jalen green and PJ Washington you guys know for me  I tend to shy away from the this group The Stream while hot club because I am perpetually nervous that I'm gonna catch him on the day where it all starts to level off and sometimes those end up being very very ugly days I've been willing to play Malik monk of the names in this list more than the others because you still tend to get points and assists out of him which is Sister hard to get points are sometimes hard to get kind of late  PJ Washington would probably be my second choice because it does sort of feel like just being again around the Mavs Superstars is gonna allow him to get a bunch of looks  you know it wasn't great yesterday 10 and 8 with a steel Block in a three bad shooting bad free throws but the floor is higher because of who he is playing with right now so yes PJ is gonna be outside startable when he's cold  and inside startled when he's hot the difference is that in Charlotte it was like when he was hot he was top 75 when he was cold he was 200 and in Dallas it's gonna be like oh and he's hot he's like top 60 and we cold it's probably more like 150 so you balance out more into that  probably the doesn't matter group maybe maybe he should settle into that one now  okay we can go sort of the Ace Ventura deep breath mode here on the injury replacement board it is substantial it is two pages long good gravy  someone in the chat rooms like stream RJ Barrett I don't know if he means because you should play him all the time or because you should never play him it's a stream while hot board so please clarify because if you play nine cat there's really never been a stretch of more than two weeks at RJ Barrett's been anywhere near the top 100  so I would like to know if you thinking that I'm too high or too low and if you're like oh he's been great over the last month guess what he shot 56% over the last month on 32 minutes a game want to know where he's ranked and nine cat 220  so hopefully that clears it up he's horrible for nine category leaks  oh there you go all right points yeah yeah not points  no points League  there's a lot of guys that are better in points League than cat League's and it's kind of impossible for me to try to break him all out but basically if we get to a guy that has horrible percentage is in bad turnovers but it's pretty good and everything else then they are a play in points and these stream Wawa hot guys actually kind of tend to be more points league so on his points League green is points League yeah League he is a word I use RJ Barrett is like the poster child of that Washington a little bit closer to okay in both but yeah he bad percentages again so basically find anybody who's pretty good in scoring boards and assists and horrible and field goal free-throw percent and you're like oh well that's a that's kind of a points League only sort of guy all right let's get to the injury Replacements now I want to make sure that I was understanding the question there  I would assume yes still a play with I mean he's a play basically for the rest of the season because Levine and Patrick Williams are out for the year Royce O'Neill for Devin Booker Josh Hartford ogn and Obi precious chachoua for Julius Randle Deuce McBride for Jalen Brunson who believe it or not might actually play in the next ball game Insanity I know  Paul Reed Kelly oubre Jr Kyle Lowry all seemingly playable right now with embed and Maxi out Al Horford anytime a Celtic player sits in Boston as a couple back to backs coming up so that's a deploy owl spot Play Owl kind of thing Nick Richards who's the most boring injury replacement play of the entire year and he's been on this board for four months because smart Mark Williams may never see the light of day again please let him out of his cave vasilia mitsch new name on this board with Cody Martin going down for a couple of weeks he's kind of a fun one Malik Beasley very boring 3-point type of stream for Chris Middleton Duncan Robinson for Tyler hero Dennis Schroder and Dorian Finney Smith for all of the Brooklyn Nets that are out right now and there's a bunch of them oh where did I end up throwing I thought I put Lonnie Walker on one of these boards as a points League stream could you go Lonnie  did I put him later did I leave him off I wrote him somewhere  ah must have overwritten him Lonnie Walker is a points League stream in Brooklyn he'll score a bunch but he didn't really do anything else I could coreo is a stream injury replacement play in Cleveland for Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley as is Charis Levert and on the second page do up wreath is a low end stream for DeAndre Zach Collins is a stream for Victor wembanyama Kris Dunn is a stream for kione George if he misses another ball game and Jordan Clarkson is your stream for Lowry marketing and orgy on day George obviously better when both of those guys are out but Clarkson I think should be just good enough  in most formats with just Mark and missing  it might be borderline he's another guy who would be better points leagues than others if you're talking about Dan who are you playing in all formats from these streams the names that I'm going for full bore to soon move Royce O'Neill heart achua McBride of brunson's out but he might be back so keep an eye on that one Kelly oubre is an easy call Kyle Lowry actually think is probably streamable Horford as a spot play  Mitch I think I might lean towards yes that one's borderline for me Duncan Robinson is a play Schroeder and Dorian Finney Smith they're good plays Aurora is a good play done would be a good play if George was out and then probably Collins so those are the names of all of the ones I listed that I'm likely going for even against a games cap but I think pretty much everybody on that list you could play on the head to head side provided their schedule is not true trash like Kris Dunn and Jordan Clarkson's will be and you could potentially throw a rule on that board if we hear that LeBron sitting it out but I gotta feel like LeBron is going to be trying to play its stretch runtime you use your big games coming up  what's the Lakers game tonight is in Milwaukee tonight like a big game Milwaukee Minnesota Golden State like Lakers are on a brutal scheduling run right now listen to this Denver top seed Thunder top seed Sacramento who the Lakers always struggle with they're good though Milwaukee up at the top of the board Minnesota top seed Sacramento again Warriors surging although if they're without step for that game that would be pretty different and then the Lakers schedule gets pretty easy after that so they'll have a kind of a cakewalk through the end of the year from May the last month pretty much so I think it survived this Gauntlet but their schedule also sucks was the point I was trying to make their and I got sidetracked by how kind of nuts it is there was some other team that I was looking at yesterday that all so has  just an ridiculous Gauntlet of teams are playing right now  was it Boston  Dallas Golden State Cleveland Denver Phoenix Portland Utah Phoenix now that one Boston  no that wasn't it  was it Denver no not dead matter  figure it out another time Daniel live on are what the hell are you doing right now  so I don't think there's going to be time to do the the ultra fast  oh  man in a c says Milwaukee's running a gauntlet right now Clippers Warriors Lakers Clippers Kings  Sixers Sons Celtics yeah I mean that's not great but it's not like four out of five number one or number two seeds  I can't think of who the hell it was someone besides the Lakers has a skeletal schedule I was like whoa  oh well again it done really matter it doesn't matter  it's not important for a fantasy purposes  let's see what else we got here quick check of the chat room because we have cleared our  we've cleared the board of the week and review stuff other names that you guys mentioned that I  didn't bring up my Conley so terrible schedule for Minnesota coming up next week but Rodeo your holding  Devin vassell would you agree that he's been one of  if not the biggest surprise player this season  no he's number 68 in nine cat which is he was drafted at 70  so he's pretty much right on his ADP I dodged most of the Spurs because I was afraid of what pop was gonna do  missed out on vessel who is been like right where you should have drafted him and then it was no way I was going to draft Wendy early enough because everybody was climbing over each other and he's been amazing so yes missed out on that one but no I you know I call the cell a pleasant surprise that he didn't underperform for a tanking Spurs team  he's been fine  I've liked it I don't have him anywhere but he's been fine and then nobody else for the Spurs is anywhere near the top one hundred Kelvin Johnson hung in there for a while and then they benched him and he pretty much disappeared  so no I wouldn't call him a giant surprise I would say  solid  it's like  we did find  do you have any Simon's  Chris Paul Walker Kessler Chris Paul I think he's gonna be fine I'm not gonna do trade questions on the shawl just talk about the players do I think Simon's potentially shuts it down at some point might be another side way to look at that I don't think we're there yet he missed a bunch of time earlier this year so I don't think it's coming  this week next week week after that maybe at the very end  do you feel better about Jake laravia or Santi aldama  can I say neither it's hard to know  I'd probably go laravia for memphis's next ball game because  aldama aldamas percentages can can really knock you for a loop  for Roto I'm not playing either of them in their next ball game for head-to-head I'm probably not playing them because they're schedules okay but not terrific  you know I had to head I might go old dama just so you have a better idea of what you're almost definitely going to get  that's not a guarantee  and any event um let's see here it's 10:17 Pacific Time right now is
