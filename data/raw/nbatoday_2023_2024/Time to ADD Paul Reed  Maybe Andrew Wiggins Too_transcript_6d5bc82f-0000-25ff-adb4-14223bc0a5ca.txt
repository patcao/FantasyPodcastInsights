welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast and away we go here on this Wednesday morning good day to you all  good day to you all  last day of January  ladies and gentlemen  ladies and gentlemen we are almost in February  which is trade deadline and all star game month  meaning we get the highest of the highs for Fantasy rolling through the trade deadline crazy our five-hour Morning Show will have moves we'll have Blockbuster deals Maybe  and then at some points lightly later in the month we just get a week off which is  bit of a downer honestly  I feel like I want the week off but then I ultimately don't want the week off because tartar to find content podcast wise  and I just want to work I like I love working on my teams I like picking up and dropping dudes I like setting lineups  that's fun  you get to the end of the regular season and I don't know maybe you guys feel completely differently about this I  have like  a week  or I deep sort of deep breath like ah  okay we made it and then by I swear by the end of April for sometimes even earlier I'm ready for the next draft season I don't need a long break  certainly don't need a break as long as the actual season so what I want you guys to do to start today show is to appreciate the fact that it's about to be February so last day of January we still have fantasy basketball we got some time left on it but let's just enjoy it for a moment  those of you with Joel embiid on your rosters might find this morning harder to enjoy however  because  he played through a knee injury and it wasn't looking good and then on top of that he got rolled up on by Jonathan kaminga  and we don't have a report on MBD yet he said to get him and MRI today I don't think anybody's expecting anything great to come out of it I think the best case scenario for indeed right now is like oh you know re-aggravation he's just gonna be out indefinitely and hopefully it's not too long and then there's also you know possible you know poorer case scenario but from a fantasy standpoint we cannot wallow in the misery of it all which believe me is is quite crummy because this is the number one number two guy in fantasy basketball and he's been dinged up lately his knees been not good basically this month he's had some insane insane ball games and then he's also now kind of on the other side of that  and indeed is only a 34 games this year that was one of the big fears taking him at the top of the board it is unfortunately come to fruition  but that means that you gotta act on it this is a you can act on it moment when we don't have those every single moment of every ballgame sometimes you have a 10 game card and there isn't one act on it moment  yesterday we had a five game card and we had multiple act on it moments  this one being the big one  Joel embiid hurt to some degree we don't know what yet  but you absolutely positively and I put it out on social media last night and just you know another reason for you guys to be following me at Dan best person over on social  Paul Reed was a pickup the moment and bead walked off the court before the Ballgame ended the moment he walked off the court before the Ballgame ended because we have no idea how long he's gonna be on it might be one game it might be a week it might be through the deadline it might be through the All-Star break we don't know  and then people were like oh Paul Reedy hasn't actually been all that good with MB is out well that depends if the only thing you care about is points then yeah he hasn't been that impressive in the games and beat missed but by and large in the games and Beads been out and reads play you know 24 25 minutes or the couple of bigger ones Blended in there he typically getting you about eight to nine points I know not a celebratory moment for him but multiple blocks multiple steals potential  let's play the Paul Reed game let's look and I mean without doing the like double checking ourselves thing here how many games has Paul Reed played 20 minutes this year let's set the cutoff super freaking low November 22nd 26 minutes in Minnesota 10 points 9 boards two steals four blocks  November 29th in New Orleans 26 and a half minutes nine four and five with a steal okay not as impressive following day 21 and a half minutes 14 4 and 1 with a block on 6 out of seven shooting not to be overlooked the field goal percent does matter  32 minutes on December 27th he had 15 and 10 with a steel 3 blocks three assists 6 out of 11 shooting and a 3-pointer mmm next day 7 2 and 4 with a steel on three out of five shooting and 24 minutes that one 28 minutes  last game of 2023 11/7 and 3 4 Steals on a block  January 6th 25 minutes 16 6 and 1  25 minutes on January 12th 8 and 2 with 2 Steeles and three blocks  I could go on and I will 42 minutes 4 days ago  30 and 13 with two steals  and in the last game before embed tried to come back and play this one in gold and state 24 minutes 116 and 3 with a steal and two blocks I get it the scoring is not that impressive other than the 30 point Mega blurs 4 days ago but how many steals how many blocks I talked about their  as a pretty good lie number  and if you look at his season stats for Reid in 16 minutes a game he's at 56% from the field six and five of the numbers and 0.7 of both steals and blocks we're talking about adding 50% so now you're talking about a guy who likely gets you over a steal and over a block per ball game which is rad on 56% shooting a volume that probably goes from five shots a game to about seven and a half shots per game he doesn't take many free throws and he's not that awful there even when he gets there you're talking about going from five to seven and a half rebounds 9 points okay fine I get it the points are not that exciting but the other stuff is pretty good  is Paul Reed about to be a top 50 guy probably not because the Sixers are gonna play Marcus Morris senior at Center at times they'll go smaller they'll rotate bodies they've got What mo Bamba all so floating around so it's not a guarantee that he's gonna go out there and get 25 minutes every ball game but I think he can average close to 23 to 25 range while impede is out and that puts him very much inside the top one hundred that's a guy that needs to be rostered in I believe all formats  you guys can just agree with me if you're hunting scoring and that's the only category that matters to you but it shouldn't be you should care about the other ones as well a other pieces of news that broke this morning because I was last night and a little bit just popped up in like the last 30 seconds but not quite as relevant Jared Allen downgraded a questionable with an illness my Conley remains questionable due to a hamstring injury Ben Simmons downgraded to questionable after his strong return now it's his knee and his back so  if you had the under on five games for him she'll just Alexander Lou Dort who are each question will did participate in Thunder shoot arounds that's good for them Paul George questionable with a groin  this is sort of the Paul George experience he's been generally pretty good this year Tyreese Halliburton expecting to play in all of the Pacers games going forward but on some kind of minutes count that's the news of the morning to the show what's up everybody it's fantasy NBA today I'm Dan bass at Dan Bass Pros over on social media this is of course a sports ethos.com presentation please do take a moment to go find our trade deadline live show and throw a thumbs up on that it's at 680 pre thumbs up and we still got eight days to go before the deadline I did not think we were gonna get to 500 we're now over 600 and I'm starting to think maybe we could even get to like 750 before the damn thing even starts whatever you guys can do to help with that whether it's doing it yourself or retweeting something that I put out on social media all of that is extremely important as we grow the website as we grow our YouTube as we grow our trade deadline live coverage so I am grateful obviously in advance and again find me over on social media at Dan best person like rate subscribe every taking in the podcast let's talk yesterday's boxes  Utah has fallen off a cliff they want on a extremely hot run and now you're seeing sort of the the other side of that because look at the end of the day the Jazz are at okay team but they were never as good as they looked when they were hot and they're not as bad as they look when they're cold they are much better team at home than they are on the road so that does play a role and the Knicks are also a pretty good basketball team but the Knicks are down ogn and Obi and Julius Randle right now so this one you felt like maybe Utah had a better shot still look what look what we're seeing happen Colin Sexton still good Larry marketing he's had a couple of slower games lately but you're not it's not your worried about him he's number 11 and 9 cats still even with a slight slow down here  it's everything else that's going on Jordan Clarkson is hit a very slow patch which I mean how many times did we say that on the show Walker Kessler continues to block a truckload of shots in limited minutes which is making him kind of an annoying player to roster this year but definitely one that needs to be on rosters  John Collins has been on a little bit of an upward trajectory lately but sits right on the cusp on the year of being an everyday guy versus a sometimes guy keonte George I don't see his job changing very much same thing for Chris Dunn and this is why I for the last month  when they were hot when they were cold my assessment of the Jazz Remains the Same  Clarkson is a cell while hot guy Market in Sexton and Kessler guys you can play every day and then the other dudes you're looking for opportunities John Collins has been warm lately so that's probably an opportunity to play him Kris Dunn had a little stretch where he was playing in the low 20s and minutes that was enough but you know 17 is not  the Jazz remain only as confusing as you're willing to allow them to be meaning if you really want to like dumpster dive have at it but it's much easier to just play the three guys that are good every day  or good enough every day  for the Knicks who needs Randall who needs ogn and Obi when you have  Dante even chenzo who hit nine three-pointers in yesterday's ballgame this dude is on a ridiculous Terror right now and  it's coming at a good time because he had slowed a lot prior to Randall and an Obi going down he has 143 pointers and 61 points in his last two ball game they've got Indiana tomorrow super poor defensive team the Lakers two days after that another super crappy defensive team  this is a really nice stretch  and Dante could continue to go completely insane for a bunch of it  his issues stem from percentages whatever issues he may have he's a negative and free field goal and free throw percent which means he needs to have good volume to be a fantasy asset which he very much is right now and remains a strong hold Josh Hart stronghold triple double here in this one 10/10 and 10 Yahtzee  two steals two blocks as well would have been nice you've got two three-pointers so it would have been like almost like a true Yahtzee 310 32s  wow it's not really how the dice game works but sort of close enough for our situation and then you know Tom Thibodeau going  full Tibbs here and basically playing a six-person rotation like almost don't justify person rotation let's be honest because heart played 43 minutes press it to a precious a chew up played 40  Davidson 39  Brunson 38 somehow he was the guy who got the rest here and then hartenstein who's on a minutes count got 29 I know  this is  I mean the wheels are going to come off at some point you can't play the guys this much every single ball game are there are there going to fall in their faces you just you don't really know with NBA or how long before it takes its toll  so hard as I mean basically at this point you're starting the starters and the only one that requires an explanation is a chewable because I did very much come on this podcast and say I don't trust him as far as I can throw him and then ogn and Obi got ruled out as well and so all of a sudden it's like okay look I don't like Precious Fantasy game  at all really he's an okay field goal percent guy who typically gets his value from rebounds and steals which amazingly he didn't really get many of either of those in this ball game he blocked two shots I wouldn't expect that to continue in most scenarios yet 18 points I don't think I'd expect that to continue in most scenarios  but it's very hard to play 40 minutes and not post fantasy value and so with that explanation  I think you could all play pressure  I don't know if he gets 40 minutes when ogn at OBS back  that's a question that is still hanging over me OG is certainly much closer than Julius Randle so  you know unless we get early word that OG's out tomorrow  today  I think I would wait on doing any kind of pressure thing  Russell's  sorry it's hard not to talk about a chew a lot without slipping into Golem Gollum  should I start doing voices on the show that feels like a really bad idea that feels like a great way to lose half the listeners of the podcast goodbye half the listeners as Dan slips into trouble  so I'm okay with streaming a Chua while both Randall and OG are out I'm not yet sold on streaming process when OG comes back  Lakers continue to be absolute dog do without Anthony Davis who to 80s credit dude is played in freaking 46 games this year he's missed three and the Lakers have been whomped in all three of them non-competitive in all three and the really sad part here is that the Hawks don't guard anyone so like the Lakers shot 53% in this game  and lost by 16 because they also cannot guard anyone the the ending numbers on this I think bolide a little bit of all the things the Lakers did wrong they were being dramatically out rebounded they were being dramatically outshot from three until very late in the Ballgame that changed when the game was pretty much already out of hand there was a stretch with the Lakers were like one out of 12 from 3-point land Trey young had all six of his three-pointers to start I don't remember if he missed one down the stretch I turned the game off with like five or six minutes left because it was pretty clear what was happening  and it's you know same belief different day kind of thing for the Lakers because they don't guard the three-point line very well they  are doing everything in my eyes backwards  and I get it like you don't want to force everyone into Anthony Davis because that risks putting him in foul trouble but all so  he's like the one guy in Vanderbilt on your team that can actually guard somebody  so instead they're protecting Anthony Davis and just giving up wide open threes on every play and so then when a D's not their teams have they have nothing to fear  they got wide open threes and they got nothing no contest at The Rim it's gross man I have no idea how the Lakers haven't made some kind of change in  coaching at this point like  we're dealing at the brink of insanity doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result as far as fantasy stuff goes I don't know why I'm scrolling around here so apologies to those that are watching the video as the the box scores are just rolling back and forth because Dan's Mouse really finger was feeling itchy  jaxson Hayes got the start Christian Wood tweeted Lowell and then claimed he had messed up a quote tweet which I don't think anybody in their right mind believed he felt like he deserved the start he still only got 22 minutes off the bench  I didn't suggest either of them as a stream because I didn't trust either a Mazda stream I said rui hachimura would be a more interesting one and he was missed his two free throws or it actually could have been a pretty good stream for rui this is only with Anthony Davis out otherwise things were kind of as you'd expect Dilo cooled off but he'll be fine LeBron had an awful for Heathrow shooting game he'll be fine Reeves was better than the other guys but didn't get a single Rebound in 32 minutes on the court which is kind of unacceptable for a bad rebounding team you got to go get one and I like your ADV Vanderbilt these days he played 26 minutes probably should have been more but he went six of six his finishing around the rim is getting better as he's got his legs underneath him he's still got his two steals  so there are five Lakers I like right now  and neither one of them is a backup center for this team no jaxson Hayes sorry no Christian would sorry  it's uh D-Lo LeBron Anthony Davis Reeves and then Vandal is the 5th one  the Hawks are gonna post some questions here in the next eight days and a lot can change with them so it makes a it makes him frankly kind of a hard team to talk about in handicap today  because we only really know that Jalen Johnson is going to keep destroying people as long as he's healthy he's number 38 just outside the third round crazy what an awesome year he's having on Yoko Congo seems very unlikely to be moved Trey young seems very unlikely to be moved and that everybody else is kind of like I don't know maybe  we know John Mayer's on the Block Atlanta might opt to just hold on to him if they don't feel like they're getting enough in return but if he really is blowing up the locker room the way reports are suggesting I don't know how they do that saddiq Bey seems a candidate to be traded for team wants a guy who's normally pretty good at the corner three that for whatever reason hasn't really been able to hit him this year click capella  could be very interesting for a contender because the Hawks can't dilute themselves into thinking they're a contender can they  and then even bogged on bogdanovich I don't know how easy any of these guys is to move I haven't dug into the ramifications of each and every player's contract but I bring all these names up because if dejounte Murray and someone else get moved you got a lot of stuff left over  even if it's just Marie getting moved then saddiq Bey continues to somehow be a fill in level guy the entire season that's basically what happens there DeAndre Hunter when he ramps up to full bore would probably be right around top 100 this is if Deja Marie does get traded by the way Bogdan would get to do more Trey would get to do more if there's really even any more for him to do  just you know thinning basically a thinning of the herd  and then what if  does Deontay Murray  and Sadiq Bay get moved well then DeAndre Hunter becomes a must own player  what if Clint capela gets moved well then on yeco becomes a monster there's all these different combinations and permutations of how this could actually go for the Hawks at the deadline  and I just don't know  best guess just dejounte Murray gets moved but again  it's still a guess even if it's a best one  I don't know  feels like Clint Capel has been on the Block for two and a half seasons and he hasn't gone anywhere  Atlanta has traded all of their guys at the wrong time they got nothing for John Collins  they got nothing for Kevin herder  you gotta trade a guy with an offers on the table they're gonna be like well maybe we'll get more for Deontay later unless he's like asks out in the offseason and then they have to take whatever they can get  they got to get something I think but you know what the hell do I know  Tyreese Halliburton back for the Pacers but on a minutes count and he basically said he expects to be on a minutes count for a little while here  so the expectation Pacers 27 and 21  they were my biggest season win total over bet of the year and this whole tie on a minutes limit is freaking me out because it's seems like they were a couple weeks ago gonna Coast to a win on that bet and now I'm like what is this minute but let's give let's not get too panicked here because they lost to arguably the best team in the NBA and they kept it tight even with Halliburton only playing half a ball game because starter version buddy hield was finally better after two bad ones he's a hold Aaron Nesmith loves playing the Celtics he loves to go after his old team and he had a monster game Pascal siakam he settling in nicely now heart had a nice game and he might have sort of like schedule level run here while Halliburton remains on his minutes cap  and then Myles Turner people are freaking out about Myles Turner but he really just had a bad shooting game otherwise this wasn't nearly as awful as everybody wants to make it out to be  he's been annoying this year there's no question about that he's ranked he's a he's an early fifth rounder because his minutes are stuck at 27 and a half and his blocks are under two per ball game  does that make him a little bit of a Buy Low I guess that's possible  you know with Carlile he's gonna he's gonna mess around with folks  miles still makes them better you know they can everybody on this team in the starting lineup can space the floor which is amazing and miles is a rim protector on top of that on the defensive side so I don't I don't think his role is changing basically at all and he probably floats back up into I don't know late 30s early 40s if I had to guess so maybe a little bit of a Bi-Lo on Myles Turner not a massive one but if somebody's freaking out and you could get him like at cost right now which would be like someone else in the mid-50s then you do it I just I don't think that's gonna be enough I don't think somebody's gonna part with them for somebody in there that's not  like a big name trending up  Celtics know no notes just big numbers for all the starters cool let's keep going  Toronto Beach Chicago this is a bad loss for the Bulls they'll be fine because the  the bottom five teams in the East are pretty  not great all the they've been winning you know I was thinking about it the other day and I was like man look at the Western Conference teams like right on the bubble to get into the playoffs and they've all been playing horribly and I'm looking at the East and the Sixers are in a tail spin and the heater in a tailspin and the magic have been bad and then I'm like well who's winning right now here's a weird little footnote the Hawks and the Nets of each won two games in a row the Wizards have won two games in a row also some of the worst teams are like three and seven in their last 10 you're like that doesn't sound very good Dan but compared to what it was before that's pretty good  anyway Toronto is without Immanuel quickly without Jakob Pirtle and without RJ Barrett right now and they lost jante Porter to back spasms early in this ball game  and so you're looking at effectively like a zombie Raptors lineup but it was fun Bruce Brown Put up giant numbers in his zombie role Gary Trent put a big numbers in his zombie role Dennis shrewder 16 and 10 and his zombie role that young 16-6 and 6 he was a steal away from a perfect sad line in his zombie role  weirdly enough Scotty Barnes was the one Raptor who was bad in this ball game  and they prevailed by 11 it was like Chicago just didn't take this game seriously that's the amazing part of the dog days of an NBA season this is basically what I made a ton of money wagering on back when I had time to actually handicapped the betting card every day  is motivational line angles  and in the Dog Days teams played down to their competition if the schedule lines up the right way and that's what you saw here with Chicago they just played down to the competition  in any event  you can't do a whole lot with the Raptor's side because we have no idea when quickly and Pirtle and Barrett are coming back  they could each be back for the team's next ball game  which is  Friday  they're off today and tomorrow so they got this long layoff then they're in Houston  you might see frickin 60% of the starting lineup come back so how can I possibly come on a show and say oh you got to pick up all these guys when you might not even get a good game out of them  you can't  trade deadline wise  if Bruce Brown gets moved that helps Schroeder it helps Gary Trent I don't know if it's enough to get both of those guys near the top 100  I think you can make an argument to stash both of them  it's not a great argument but you could make an argument  Schroeder was closer  so getting maybe one player out of the way does that get him back to like top one ten one fifteen range Trent I think probably needs two guys out of the way and then that young he'll most likely evaporate when either turtle or Porter comes back Pirtle Porter easy to say  long way of saying  I can't really tell you guys to make a bunch of ads right now not in good faith when the team doesn't play for two days and a lot of guys are putting up numbers because  the pathway the runway is six times as wide  Chicago I mentioned it two days ago three days ago some number of days ago well Patrick Williams is out for at least two weeks I owe to soon mode is a play the Sumo looks good in the starting lineup he's taking a bunch of shots he's getting threes and defensive stats do most should be streamed everywhere  injury fill in name  Marta Rosen at 7:50 stats in this ball game I don't know where the hell that came from but I ain't gonna argue about it  he remains right at the edge of the 30s and 40s and he's played in 46 of the Bulls basketball game so far this year how many games did they played all that 48  so durability and reliable easy to predict numbers tomorrow is number 27 by totals and he's doing fine again and finally in the late one and this is the one we already talked about some of the stuff from it Joel embiid left partway through he was just not even close to himself look at that line 14 points on 18 shotts eight turnovers he could barely move even before kaminga rolled up his leg  we're all holding our breath waiting on the MRI results I pray I pray they are not bad  we'll see  Paul Reed pick up Kelly oubre Hold because we know he gets a bunch of usage when emptied his out  Tobias Harris is going to be a behemoth while I'm beat his out  Patrick Beverley is a stream while Tyrese Maxey is out and despite the fact that Jayden Springer and ferkin cork Moss had decent ball games I am not adding those guys  keep an eye on whether Mark is Morris gets healthy and sees reliable playing time because he could also potentially be a winner here I don't think enough to get him on a nine cat 12 team Roto board but you know there's the the schedule angle does come into play and Sixers all of a sudden now they need to get a couple of wins they've lost four games in a row and they're behind the Cavaliers now  technically a dead heat Cavs have played too fewer games though so they actually lead in win percentage by the tiniest little bit and Sixers are staring down the barrel of not even having home court in the first round but they got to get him beat healthy  they can't take any more chances  start the starters for the Warriors sorta Klay Thompson was out with an illness in this one Brandon ski started and had 11 points and six boards he was fine  and I started my head to head if they missed another ballgame but not Rodeo I just I think kind of the the rookie shine has come off teams of figured out what he's doing he's a little more tired you know ankle weights kind of thing when Clay comes back you start the starters for this Warrior's team right now Clay's a start greens of start staff obviously  I mean it was clear as day that Steph needed Draymond  Stephanie's Dre and drain need Steph and Curry is up to number 17 now after he had fallen outside the top 20 and on and on and on he goes he's probably a game or two away from being 14th  meanwhile Tyler's Halliburton and his stupid minutes cap is dropped him all the way to number 14 in nine cat  what a pain in the you know what  maybe you don't know what insert body part that has pain that would be all of them thank you very much  and when you get into that kind of bad luck there on the Halliburton thing Andrew Wiggins probably an even bigger story than Jonathan comingo right now who's coming is getting all he can handle and I admit I was late to the party and picking them up on the Roto side whenever he started to bust out I was like yeah you got to do it on head-to-head I don't know if I'm there for it on Roto well sorry Roto listeners that means you probably ran a tiny bit late as well but he's going crazy right now he call this freaking coach out and it worked  you never see that  you usually guys get thrown straight into the dog house and instead Steve Kerr was like hmm maybe he's right  what  anyway good for comingo  and then Andrew Wiggins who's had two to three decent ball games in a row here now he's not gonna shoot 80% every ball game but it's just nice to see him looking more confident  this lineup for the Warriors provides a measure of spacing and ball movement and speed that other lineups did not they're not gonna be able to Garden many people but they'll do their best on that front and look I mean the thing we've been saying on this podcast throughout the whole damn season is every time Wiggins has a good ball game  he has to be picked up  has to be because if it was the start of a Wiggins run that got him back into the 90 range that would mean that he would actually actually have to be much better than that because he was like outside the top 25 for a much of this season  unplayable un roster Andrew Wiggins but for many years he'd floated between 65 and 120 with mostly just free throw shooting being kind of the downfall there he got steals he got some boards he scored even started to add the three-pointer later in his career the field goal percent wasn't good but it wasn't like tank your team bad the free throw was the thing that held him back but he hasn't had any steals this year and he got three in this ball game he hasn't scored at all this year and he's done that the last few games in a row  and that's why it was like okay if he shows any signs you gotta pounce on it because if it's the moment you don't want to let somebody else have it so that's why after the last good one I said all right like I got no expectations here but on the very slight chance this is him actually waking up we don't want to be behind well hopefully that meant you went out and you grabbed him and had him for this ball game or had him on your bench just to see what happened it does look like he's playing better these two games in a row evidence that Wiggins is just  like back to Wiggins now no absolutely not  does it however increase the probability that he is back to being Wiggins and the answer there is yes if it was like 4% before  now it's like eight  or whatever I mean make whatever adjustment you want  his roster ship number is up like 25% in the last three days because of the big game against the Lakers and now the big game here against the Sixers  his game prior to that was actually not terrible either I was against the Kings he was fine he was in spectacular but he was fine  he's really been serviceable for about seven games in a row minus one or two in there that were pretty quiet but like not awful  and you're starting to see those signs of life and so you just you have to be on board if the signs of Life stick  so hopefully you've already done it if not  still only 60 some odd percent roster so there's still probably a little window to get in there and you can be a part of that  we pivot now into a very large Wednesday coming up and you know you're just gonna have to keep your eyes on the news feed so ethos fantasy BK fantastic spot to get your news make sure you're following the beat reporters they have news that aggregators don't always pick up like there was a I forget which beat guy for the Knicks was like Hey if you're worried about a heart and Stein playing like 16 minutes he had a minute's cap in that previous game of 25 and they just didn't need him so that was it there like oh we're a big no reason to push him in another nine minutes and that's why he came back out yes yesterday and played 29  so you get these little things this is my like why you got to follow the beat right there's rant portion of the show and I think almost everyone in fantasy sports would unilaterally agree following beat writers is so much better than following and aggregator especially one that doesn't give you the source they're like a hiding how they were able to do it  drives me nuts man just put the source  I know Sports ethos does I know Rotoworld does if you click into the blurb you get the source  what beat reporter said it so you know what that you can trust the damn thing anyway I don't need to go down that path I suppose let me quickly check the live chat room and while I'm doing that it's a great opportunity to remind you guys to please follow over on Twitter at Dan Besse burst d a n b e s b r i s we cleared 21,000 a few days ago which is crazy because I feel like I was just a couple weeks back like how the hell did I get to 20  doesn't even make any damn sense but here we are and we're gonna keep on freaking pushing because that it's it's a snowball you know you get more Twitter followers you able to send them to the podcast you get more podcasts listeners you're able to send them to Twitter you send them to sports ethos folks are able to buy some things that keeps the website growing and churning along we're able to add these other sports  it's a freaking winged man and it's a big reason that I miss in the offseason  I hate the offseason because you can't do those things you like you got the die-hards and I love you guys God love you I will love you to the day I die but  but  I miss having like the Pod where you know you you grow your listeners I can't do a tweetstorm in the off-season there's like two weeks in the whole offseason where you see your Twitter account go up its  the NBA draft and free agency that's it  then you get back to draft season  uh I'm looking at the chat room now and there's there's someone over on Twitter that's like desperate to get a question answered so I'm gonna do it they're asking lamelo ball or Damian Lillard the answer is Dame and it's not even close  so  there you go  um Delonte was asking did I miss the new somewhere or how long is him beat out we don't know how long and bead is out we do know that he's getting an MRI which means something got worse the comingo roll up likely the reason for that or just playing on a bad knee Gary asked what do I do with Jordan Clarkson same thing as always Gary this is been the Dan best for stance for two and a half seasons in a row you roll with him when he's Lava Hot and then you sell him while he's lava hot  and if nobody will buy him when he's Lava Hot you just drop him when he's not because Jordan Clarkson hasn't for a while been a nine category serviceable player because I hit that many threes he gets no defensive stats and he's a true punt field goal guy who turns the ball over way too much for someone who only gets 4.8 assists score is great free throws good actually great this year he's been better at the foul line but he's you know two to three trick pony that's not enough for nine cat and so uh you know he's a  he's like Camp Thomas man that's the same thing you stream them while they're hot you see if you can get anything for them when they're hot and then when they're not you get the hell out of the way  is Paul Reed an ad yes I made that pretty clear would you drop PJ Washington for Paul Reed  no because the Hornets are gonna keep blowing this thing to pieces and if PJ's one of the guys left behind then you're gonna want to have him because the upside is very good and at some points gonna come back so like I love Paul Reed he's the opening story of today's show he's very much an ad but he's also a villain because I don't think he'd gonna be ruled out for the season right now  let's see any other players Tyler appreciated my my Smiggle voice earlier in the show  um what did we see here what else we got what do we got what do we got would you drop Josh Hart  or Andrew Wiggins is that 400 Wiggins um I would rather have Josh Hart right now I don't like me again I don't know how long Randall's out but we're still looking at multiple weeks and Wiggins could still turn back into a pumpkin tomorrow  Hart's gonna be very very very good while Randall is out we know that so I you know me I like  whatever it is burden to hand kind of thing  so I probably drop weekend sadly if that was the question because someone you gotta activate Maxi off your ill unfortunately I prefer holding Josh over Wiggins would you drop Santi aldama for Paul Reed  Phil's um this one's a little team dependent Santee vs Reed I think I probably stick with Alma for right this moment because we don't know how long I'm beat is going to be out  and with all dhamma it does kind of feel like he's gonna be a guy that Grizzlies just hand the ball to a bunch of times down the down the stretch and what do we do with Luke Kennard I dropped him in a couple of spots because I don't really know how long he's gonna be out shame of it is if he comes roaring back then he's he's gonna kill it because he was amazing in the couple of games before he got hurt but I've said it like 15 times on the show Luke canard's body is another one of those players that can't handle full NBA workload someone yelled at me about that I forget who one of the listeners was like you say all these guys don't have the body for it I think I've said it like five or six times in in a decade  and like con artist is one of those guys  every time is the same thing Ben Simmons body can't handle it anymore Kenard body can't handle it every time he plays full minutes for like a week down he goes  shout out to Josh Hart because he's mostly been able to avoid  the like I rebounded so hard injuries so far this year but I am very nervous about this coming stretch here if he's playing freaking 41 minutes of ball game  Keegan Murray or Emmanuel quickly the answer there for me is Keegan Murray  in Roto you might want to go quickly head to head but I think he didn't have the higher rank if that's really what you're doing there oh D Anthony Melton question that's a good one when is melting coming back and are we expecting it uptick with him beat out absolutely I'm expecting it uptick I have no idea when he's coming back though I'm expecting some kind of update on Melton a pretty soon because they're doing this like reevaluate every week thing and he's been out since January 12th  the last news on him  was  that today  no I was a week ago today where they said they re-evaluate him in a week so I'm hoping that means that we get an update on him later today  and maybe it'll be okay because if he does come back I mean he was number 60 with embed mostly healthy so far this year so hell yeah uptake for Melton he could be he could be top 50 here with guys coming back but as far as Wendy's coming back I don't know cuz back stuff and that's what he's dealing with his is some spine issues I mean he could be out for another month or the fact that they're checking him out every week suggests they think he might just turn a corner and play  but I don't have I don't have a great sense of I mean this is  you guys have seen that I've made some pretty good calls on when guys are coming back from injury with backs I just don't know like it's the Mark Williams thing too he's been out the whole damn season and they've never really said what's going on I'm hoping that Melton's back sooner than that Lisa Sixers are like yeah we're checking out every week  how does he look well maybe we find out later today and maybe we get a good rapport but if he's out for another week then it's like all right we're we're not getting anywhere  because back stuff is weird man I don't know if any of you guys watching or listening have had back spasms and I've had him a number of times in my life because I have scoliosis here on the left side it's my spine is kind of bent and a little twisted  and when the muscles and the nerves when they when the bone and the muscle and the nerves all kind of get in that same little chunk it just locks up  can't really do anything for hours  days when I was young and now I'm a little stronger and so it tends to  relax quicker because the the muscle is  doing a better job of kind of like separating things that shouldn't be touching but I had a backspace in my sophomore year at College where I basically couldn't walk for like four days you just you don't know what these guys unfortunately and we're talking about the Anthony Melton here I hope he comes back soon because if he comes back while he is out  yeah he's gonna be he's gonna be sweet but they'll ease him back to so get ready for kind of like  1820 to 23 24 minutes the first handful of games where they make sure that Melton's back and handle it oh more love for this Smeagol Gollum impersonation oh no  so yeah let me tell you guys a quick story before we wrap up today's podcast because we're at the end of the show that's when I can do best for story time when I tell stories the beginning people are like got to the fantasy already  pitchforks and what have you  I don't know how many of you guys know and I've mentioned it on shows but I don't know if many of you guys actually followed me back in the day but like 2009 through 2011  I worked for the website pregame.com which is a sports handicapping and picks sales betting website this is before bedding was so prevalent the way it is now there weren't domestic sports betting websites it was Vegas and then it was offshore's  so it wasn't as big but I had by all accounts the first sports betting  handicapping podcast there were plenty of sports betting shows out there where people who sounded like this came on and said yeah you gotta take did you got it take to points with the Chiefs at the only way you get to go you gotta buy it it's 14 dollars  and I came out and I was like no this is a new wave of show and so it was breaking down the card every day on a sports betting podcast it was called today in sports betting and it got pretty big actually before I moved back to into baseball play-by-play there were there were many shows where we had multiple thousand downloads which I was pretty excited about because the first show I did had like 22  there were I had many guests on that show from the sports betting world handicappers people who are you know like former money Runners guys who ran sports betting websites and and sports books and all that good stuff and a lot of the time I would kind of warm up the crowd before the show we did all this on I had a Skype account that I was able to make local calls from so I could record it easily that way I would kind of warm up my listeners by just doing impersonations and they couldn't see my face so they were just they were just hearing me doing like I'm not good at it anymore but I had a pretty good Doctor Phil going into 2010  I unfortunately still do a pretty good Herbert if you guys know that character from Family Guy  he's the pedo you guys know him he's got the whistle and so I would just do these in impersonations  for like 15 minutes before starting recording trying to get all my guests laughing and being silly and then we'd roll into the show and everybody was in a good mood I don't think that it's a good idea for me to do a bunch of that stuff in a Solo format live on a podcast but the fact that you guys liked the gollum Smeagol today uh basically what I'm saying is you're all a bunch of enablers and you should be very very very very ashamed of yourself  because now every time I talk about the Knicks I'm going to make sure to mention I'll probably  have a great day everybody I think it's a one show Wednesday today go make the moves that we talked about at the beginning of the program and throughout and we'll do the rest over on social at Dan best purse I'll see you guys over there and you guys know the deal man man escaped ethos 20 is the promo code there  go check out the live deadline show and like it like
