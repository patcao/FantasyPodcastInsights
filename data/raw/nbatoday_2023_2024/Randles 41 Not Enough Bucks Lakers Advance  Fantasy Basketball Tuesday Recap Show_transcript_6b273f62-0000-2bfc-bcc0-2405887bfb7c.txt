welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I don't know why it took me so long to get my butt on the screen here but here we go it's fantasy NBA today it's our recap and look ahead show for Wednesday morning  December the 6th 2023 I am Dan best person thanks as always everybody for hanging out with us spend it a little chunk of your day on what I imagine will be a moderate League paste and linked program as we roll back to back hopefully you guys had a chance to check out our Bi-Lo show from yesterday morning and our cell High show that just wrapped up about 20 minutes ago here on all of our channels YouTube iTunes Spotify whatever else magical places all exist in the universe  as far as today goes we finally have games again it's an 11 game Wednesday and I admit I was kind of screwing up the math a little so I was like oh yeah this gonna be like 12 13 games that no no because anybody that played Monday or Tuesday does not play tonight they play Friday anybody that plays tomorrow  Thursday  already played Monday or Tuesday and they're done for the week fantasy wise they're still the finals in Vegas over the weekend but that one is not a fantasy game so remember the fantasy week is over on Friday  today is a sort of like a maybe overload day and that was the thing that I got a little bit stuck on in my analysis which is basically like  there are going to be a lot of teams that are not full of roster today  if you have someone on your Club that's playing tomorrow don't drop them today because the guys going to Morrow it's the streamers are going to be sort of few and far between and everybody's gonna be trying to grab the same three or four guys Lakers Pacers pelicans and Bucks all going tomorrow so if you've got a streamer level guy on one of those teams you just you kind of have to hang on but if you have anybody from one of the teams that lost Monday or Tuesday they are very much a drop  because you will like be overloaded on Friday Friday he's a 13 game card you'll probably have an opportunity to roll a full lineup about there so anybody that played Monday or Tuesday that lost drop them for a streamer today to make sure your lineups full or if you can pick up someone that's playing tomorrow if you say if you have a full line of today or you're very close to one that could also work  but there's absolutely there's almost no reason at all to hang on to a fringe level player that lost in the IST quarter finals round  wanted to get that off my chest before we start talking about what happened yesterday and what's coming up tonight again thanks as always for hanging out with us everybody find me over on social at Danbury this is a sports ethos presentation you can see their logos all over everything we do here as it should be Sports ethos is like six or seven years old now which seems kind of insane how the heck did that happen still growing still having a good old time opportunity for me to tell all of you that watch this show if you guys think you can handle being an analyst Sports ethos is always looking for new folks that want to kind of break into the industry it hit me up reach out on Twitter or here in the YouTube live chat if you're watching with us as it's going after the fact YouTube commenters that's fine I'm really trying to get in there and answer all YouTube comments not quickly but eventually and so we can we can have some fun all right enough about streaming for this week let's get well we'll probably talk more about it in a minute but let's get straight into the short two-game card yesterday there's very very little to cover from yesterday couple of key points Nick's lost in Milwaukee got blown out despite Julius Randle going for 41 points on only 19 shots and remember this is this was a hard one for me Julius Randle was on my Bi-Lo board last week he was the Buy Low one of the Bilo names on the week six episode that was last Tuesday I think that one came out he was ranked outside the top 200 I was like look  I don't like Julius randle's Fantasy game as much as the next guy but he ain't gonna be this bad all season long and sure enough since then he's been wonderful he's moved up from two 18 to 1/64 in a week  and then this ball game did a whole lot to help semi fix his free his field goal percent now he ate the free the free throw number a little bit higher and hopefully everything will kind of balance out for him he's probably a sell high now after this giant ball game but that's you're kind of threading a needle if you bought low a week ago and you're trying to sell high today just understand that the full Julius Randle experience will be somewhere in between Josh Hart had a pretty good fantasy game by all accounts with three steals kind of floating things for him but only 26 minutes because RJ Barrett played better at least for stretches in this ball game it was a blowout and we've seen Josh Hart's minutes fluctuate weirdly in blowout games so I don't know the exact  situation there you might have seen another two or three minutes at the end of the Ballgame still it's hard for me to call him a full rest of season play when his minutes are this  dynamic  fluid  insecure  so I'd rather use Josh Hart as a streamer for now which you know that appeal kind of wears off with them losing this ball game  if you want to hang on to him sort of indefinitely you can every time I try to quit him then he gets minutes for two or three games in a row  he's not playable in a 9 cat Rodeo league right now because you just don't know what which are you gonna get the 2526 minute iteration you get the 31 minute iteration of heart and there's a pretty big gap in between those two head to head he's playable in a good situation because you know 2526 minutes actually still enough for him to do something like a four game week for Josh Hart right now would be playable in a head-to-head weekly format so that's Matt coughs snuck up on me so he's  well somewhere in between those two and that's why he he's sitting on a little bit of a Razor's Edge  remember how earlier this year I was like yeah I don't think Emmanuel quickly is actually a 12 team play unless Jalen Brunson gets hurt and a bunch of people were like no no no no you need to get the points out of him well  yeah I think you guys get it at this point we're gonna  beat a dead horse their Milwaukee is a very easy team to handicap right now Bobby Portis he did block two shots in this game which is kind of weird for him but overall he's streamer level he has not cleared that I thought there was a good chance he could when J Cryder went down and  it looked like he might for about a week ish but he's falling off the end of the map again  and it's mostly because his Fantasy game is not all that well-rounded he mostly scores and rebounds and so if he doesn't do those for a game he's becomes kind of a goose egg  Christmas Milton got up to 26 minutes for whatever that's worth I still think he's gonna be one of the most annoying players to roster and fantasy all season long every time there's any little nagging thing they're going to dial them back down to 22 23 minutes of ball game he Buy Low technically yeah but it doesn't mean you have to and frankly I think I'd rather just not deal continue by the way to not deal with Chris Middleton because I drafted him in zero places I told you guys he was going to be a huge headache this year don't risk it I know it felt like oh if I can get him at 9100 he could no  here's the thing about fantasy sports and I don't spend too much time on this little philosophical non-sequitur but  you don't have to try to get every value you think you see  so you know how I was like look if you guys want to pick up Myles Bridges he's probably gonna have fantasy value  go ahead I'm just not doing it I feel confident and I can win my league without him  and I'm in  eighth Yahoo cash League's and then you know a smattering of non yeah who leaks Yahoo or Yahoo done matter  three of those are head-to-head God help me I hate them all one of them is a keeper league so that one doesn't really apply and the other four are Rodeo redraft  I don't have any miles bridges's on any of those teams and the four Roto redraft teams are ranked first first first second and first as I looked down the page  so you can win without  going and trying to snatch every value this isn't even about bridges this is about Middleton who I get it if you were if he was on the board at 100 you're like oh this is khris Middleton like I got to take him at 100 you don't you don't have to do anything even if a guy falls away farther than you think he should if you know in your heart of hearts that someone's going to be a headache or a pain or someone you just don't want to root for for veering back into the other thing  that's okay  at 100 Chris Middleton might have been a value but he also is going to be on a massive massive  winding headache to get there and I just wanted nothing to do with that and I still don't  what I do want to deal with is the rise of Damian Lillard and Brooke Lopez still being this freaking awesome on a day-to-day basis you guys know I anytime Brooke Lopez has a big ball game I have to talk about it because  I reminded what is the it's the Breaking Bad meme Jesse Pinkman yelling how did they keep blooding him go this how did he how did he keep getting away with this yeah that's how I feel about us having Brooke Lopez on our fantasy teams I think keep letting us do this he's a Fantasy juggernaut  3.7 combined defensive stats  huge  good percentages low turnovers just enough threes points and rebounds so that he's not syncing you in any of those categories  I adore it meanwhile dam is up to number 17 we've talked at length over the last two or three weeks about how I felt like if you could get him for other guys ranked nearby he was the one name in that group that was still ascending because the field goal percent was the big one you was gonna work its way up the board and frankly it does kinda seemed like field goal attempts maybe all so slowly working their way up all these one ended up in a blowout he got all of his stuff and 13 attempts in 83 throws because yanis is a monster  honestly can't hit a free throw to save his damn life but it's sort of doesn't matter because he's been so damn good and everything else that he is justifying his punt free throw early draft spot  on 30 points 11 rebounds in 2.7 combined defensive stats and high volume 61% from the field  no one was touching Nicolas yolk in that category last year but Jana says ahead of him this time around weighted field goal percent impact folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run

fewer fantasy angles than game one Grayson Allen had a big ball game 21 points he had four three-pointers had three defensive stats he beat out Eric Gordon in the witch Fringe streamer will have a decent ball game battle in this one  but overall I'm not particularly enamored with either of them Grayson Allen technically right now is a 12 team starter book guys ranked 105 on the year and nine cat after this big ball game pushed him up from the 1:30  but it's not a sustainable number specially once Bradley Beal is back around he's shooting 90% at the free throw line and 48 and a half percent from the field  like in terms of what he does for that team he fits as a like a pretty good  role player around their Superstars but he's also a career 44% shooter from the field career 40 from 3 he's at 48 and 47 in these respectively he's a good fou shooter so that might not come down he's playing more minutes so you can probably assume the rebounds and assists stay a little bit higher but a lot of his stuff is coming back down and when they do then he becomes basically a schedule streamer much like the way I feel about Eric Gordon who historically does not have the world's greatest Fantasy game but he is inside the top 90 right now largely because he's at about what 7 8 ball game where he's been the number two option  it was Kevin Durant against the universe for like two and a half of the first six and a half weeks of this season  Booker's only played 12 games Katie's played 19  so basically in seven of those ball games Eric Gordon's been  he's been forced into you got to go be a high usage guy I think he ain't taking 12 shots a game all season long  and when he stops well  so fine if you want to try these guys now  I think it's your funeral  also Yusuf nurkic terrible ball game this does 10 to happen for him against Anthony Davis the Lakers are a dismal matchup for nerc because they just pull him into every pick and roll and then blow right by him because LeBron is strong enough and still fast enough somehow to just destroy nurse so just you know hope that they don't have to play Lakers that many more times for his fantasy value and everything will be fine and then LeBron I just I don't even understand how he's still able to do this stuff he just jumped himself about four no farther than that he jumped himself up about eight ranks slots with this game last night from basically the very end of the 20s back up all the way to number 20 mostly because of the five steals the other stuff for things we've seen him do 301 points for LeBron repeatable not every night and then the 25 shots basically this was the like go get it type of thing this whole in-season tournament deal the Lakers are taking very seriously  and they had a crap ton of extra opportunities in this game Lakers had nine turnovers Suns had I thought 22 although I have a couple been adjusted down  only 20 some of them were team turnovers I guess those don't show up in the in the Box in a certain way so the Lakers had all these extra opportunities  and nobody could really make a shot besides basically Braun and sometimes Austin Reeves this was I think it was  it  Justin Russo I think who covered the clippers for a while he might still cover the Clippers he had a really  he had a really funny note on this game and I'm trying to remember where it was if I get  find it in the Twitter sphere I can't find it right now this is like the third time in 2000 games that one team shot 49% and the other shot 37 and the 37% team won there was a crazy call at the end of the Ballgame they were like three crazy calls the end of the Ballgame Phoenix Suns fans are going to be livid because that weird time out although the pool report the officials are like it was actually still pinned to Austin's leg when LeBron was calling for time out it didn't look that way to those of us that were watching live as a Laker fan you know I'll take it although there was a play about 45 Games seconds earlier where both LeBron and Anthony Davis got a hacked on drives to the rim and nothing happened there so like if you go over the entire ball game they probably even out it's just that the last one we remember was maybe the most egregious either way fun ball game I didn't think the Lakers were gonna win this one they did defensively they played really well and if they make any shots they probably up by 15 for most of this one either way core 4 that's all you're going with on the Lakers side Dilo had a bad ball game he wasn't shooting well and if he's not shooting well they're gonna look at other directions because defensively they have better options they just ran long in this game Reeves took over at Point  reddish and Tori and Prince stayed on there for their length and so Dilo just didn't get to play as much he'll be fine though and then guys like reddish Tori and Prince Rouge Mora Jarred Vanderbilt these are not guys that you need to actually keep on your team they're for weeks like this one if you have those guys great you can roll them through to Thursday because they have the better schedule but otherwise nope  okay we got a nice 11 game

the old name that's how you get an extra three months free on the end of your one year membership  all right  big Wednesday  not as big as Friday but we're cooking what do we got what do we got here on this relatively large Wednesday Sixers Kelly oubre that's good news likely to come back for this ball game on how many minutes he's gonna play but we're gonna want to track that and see how it impacts anybody else on the team for the Wizards it's the same thing as always basically can they keep the ball game close enough for all of the regulars to have value or is it just gonna be another blowout work Kyle kuzma gets his 25 shots and then heads to the Pine and everybody else plays 23 minutes  it's the Sixers so unfortunately the latter is possible Grizzly's we've seen JJ start to ramp up a little bit we'll see if that continues here is Santee aldama a hold he is for me for the moment we'll see how it goes Pistons boy on bogdanovich on the ramp up that's fun to watch Killian Hayes look pretty good here the last two or three ball games but is it a flash where he's sort of getting in there and his energy is high does it run out or does he have staying power and what will become of us our Thompson I you know I don't think he's gonna be benched all season long it feels kind of like  they could see him running out of gas after this big adrenaline surge first month and so now they're kind of hanging tough  is he Buy Low  get up probably let it go a little longer actually you might even get him off the waiver wire if this keeps up  the magic I still think Go-Go Batavia is like right around the edge of the top 100 one ten as a fill-in that doesn't make him all that fun  they'll need him presumably for this ball game they're playing a very large opponent in Cleveland so maybe  and then we're keeping an eye on Cole Anthony as well calves nothing really the heat so many streams so many streams  so many streams Kyle Lowry go I met jacquez probably go Orlando Robinson maybe Duncan Robinson yeah  Tyler hero bam adebayo hopefully they'll be back in the not too distant future but until they are we just got all these  guys parachuting into fantasy value  Raptors nothing  the Nets I continue to wonder what does the cam Thomas return do to everybody else so far the answer is not all that much but it does feel like he's gonna have to sort of siphon something away from Dinwiddie  Bridges Johnson you know playing all these guys that that's fine I just I want to know where they all end up and sometimes that takes a few weeks  the great leveling sometimes we need a few weeks to assess but we are assessing  the Hawks nothing Spurs nothing wolves mostly just whether or not Anthony we're just gonna play  Hornets  do we think Gordon Hayward can get back inside the top 100  honestly goodness I don't know I still think the answer is probably but I admit that I may be too optimistic there which is funny because I was extraordinarily pessimistic on Hayward last year and you guys killed me for it  but I was right and then this year I was like well I don't know and then he was better and so I was wrong and now I'm on it and now I feel like I might be wrong again  like maybe I was right last year all the way around and I should have just been like you know coordinate words still sucks and I shouldn't have gone back on it but he was good to start this year miles Bridges came back that seemed to hurt him lamelo went down I don't know if that's gonna help enough  but that's why we're watching  we'll keep an eye on Brandon Miller as well he's been good enough to play Lately don't know how the rookie  sine wave will go for him but we'll keep watching on it  the Bulls  they've been playing better lately since since Zack Levine was rested you know and that's the thing like you can be a very very good basketball player is a Levine is all of those things but if you have a small nagging injury which I think is probably true I think he probably does have a sore foot  if you have a sore foot and you don't really want to be there that's the combination that ends up hurting the team so now you get him out of the way and you just putting guys in that want to be there  and again this isn't a knock on Levine he knows he's on the Block and he's got some nagging injuries and so it's like wow what's the point like why am I gonna blow my foot out here if this team's gonna unload me in a second anyway I want to be in better shape for some new team so they shut him down  I don't know if Alex Russo's playing or not I'd love it if he is because he's a guy that's always gonna give full energy but that damn toe and just generally his body can barely take it but then you got guys like Kobe white who's playing much much better since Levine went down I got into a Twitter argument with somebody about this who just could not  could not  hold the two separate thoughts he was like Daniel way late on Kobe white he's been great for a month  look at his rank over the last month  I was like okay now we got to talk about what an average means again and it just it wasn't it wasn't landing and if it got so frustrating for me and my kids were yelling at me that I lashed out and I do feel bad about that but I want to talk about it on the Pod right now because yes Kobe white over the last month is ranked number 64  but over the past two weeks he's number 25 so it's important to realize what he was doing before those two weeks basically since the news broke that Zach LaVine was on the trade block and he started getting rested first like every other game and now every game if you look at Kobe White's first well let's see two weeks would put us back into like mid end of November so basically like the first month of the year for Kobe he was outside the top 180  so when you look at an average yes over the last month he's in the 60s he actually happened to have one like slightly better weak in there I think that was one where they rested Zach LaVine for like two games out of the four either way the aggregate of the first four and some odd weeks for Kobe white was not even close to 9 Gap playable  outside the top one 80  and then over the last two weeks basically since they've said Zach LaVine is out Kobe you're in go nuts  he's been great  so once someone's like Danny's been good for a month that's not true  you have to understand how a player got to the point that they were yeah over the last month he's ranked number 64 but the two weeks before he was been top 25 stopped 25 the last two weeks the two weeks before that he was outside the top one 40  so no it's not about being too late on a guy look back is only as good as how you understand the individual chunks of it and there have been today's Wednesday and the season started on a Tuesday this is week seven there effectively been six full weeks of basketball in the season as of like two days ago so we're a little over six weeks  if you looked at each individual week for Kobe white the last two have been very good and there was one previous week in the first four and change that was decent not great but decent  the other three were awful  so please I beg of you guys  understand how you're using the board  before you come yelling at me about it  if you were sitting on Kobe white all year more power to you because yeah it seemed like the Bulls were in a little bit of a tough spot I personally did not have a roster spot to roster somebody who was performing at a top 200 clip with basically like an we didn't know indefinitely on how long the Bulls were gonna try to see if this thing worked then when it was obvious they were terrible then it became a much more prudent decision same story for Patrick Williams we know he's on the stash board as well anyway the list goes on and on iot assume would be there if they move guys like Caruso and DeRozan anyway let's get back to Kraken these These Nuts open how did I how the hell did I get over to the Bulls  I feel like I feel like I skipped something no I didn't skip anything Thunder nothing really Rockets are we seeing Jabari Smith Juniors rise or is this you know gonna be the sort of up and down of a thing either way he's been playing well lately so that's nice  the Jazz just repeating myself I'm in an infinite Loop here until Larry marketing comes back Jordan Clarkson by the way also out for this ball games you could probably stream Colin Sexton if you wanted some points on okay percentages can't they George not efficient enough  okay I don't want to go do the whole thing Mavericks it sounds like Kyrie and Tim Hardaway Jr are both back so you can punt on whatever streamers you were thinking about their Derek Lively is awesome so roll their nuggets Jamal Murray's health status is kind of the only thing in question  you know Reggie Jackson has been good the last couple the when he was in there a bunch  but basically like when Murray missed a three weeks or whatever it was before uh Reggie Jackson was not a nine cat guy  but if you catch him on the right night it could work  head-to-head he makes more sense obviously Clippers nothing really right now all the stars are actually playing pretty well at the moment so there isn't any Bi-Lo opportunity Blazers Anfernee Simons may be back for this ball game  maybe Jeremy Grant is out with a concussion DeAndre ayton is out with some knee soreness so this is gonna be a real weird one for the Blazers but we might get an interesting data point on like who fills in at big man's spots  and then the Warriors sounds like they're getting CP3 and Andrew Wiggins back we'll see if Wiggins can kind of pick up where you left off he was playing well actually did best ball game of the year before whacking his finger in a car door for goodness sake dude  and then what is this mean for clay he's been kind of coming on a little bit lately not great but certainly better the Warriors  it's really a question of like how can these old guys get it damn together get it together  all right that's what's coming up I think that's everybody on the board right yeah we'll shut that sucker down let's do a few questions here because we're only a half an hour and I'll do about 10 minutes of questions then I gotta get back to my day if you have them uh let's see what's the okay question at 10:41 that's the last one I'm gonna do so if you didn't get your question in now it's not getting answered today but I'm gonna try to get them all in up to that point here we go competitive nine cat wrote a league how much Fab to spend on buddy hield well assuming you started with a hundred  I spent like 27 on him in a league and I got him  but he's been good for like a week and a half since that happened so you might need to go into the 30s to get it done  and you said it's competitive so you might even need to go into the 40s  I know it's Tuesday recap and Wednesday look ahead but could you potentially spend some time going over options for tomorrow's four Gamers for your viewers can make sure to get the best options available yeah it's not a terrible idea actually  so the problem is a lot of these guys are going to be rostered already because they were picked up for their games yesterday and the day before Indy the sort of fringy players that you'd want to roll with would be Obi topping and Aaron neesmith Milwaukee campaign would be the very sort of basement level one but Bobby Portis is probably your better option there Pelicans you know they're they're pretty starter heavy right now and Trey Murphy is is fairly almost universally rostered  so there aren't many options but Jose Alvarado and Dyson Daniels would be the ones you could maybe look at Naji Marshall would be the fringy one and for the Lakers cam reddish Taurean Prince maybe really hachimura is about as far as I would go but I don't think I'm even going that far reddish and Prince of the ones you trust more because at least they're  generally starting and I'm guessing they'll probably go big here against Zion and Jonas valentina's I don't think they want LeBron dealing with Zion on all game long and they definitely don't want Anthony Davis dealing with Zion so the Lakers are going to have some Personnel decisions  what does that mean we get off like you might get an Anthony Davis jaxson Hayes front court for stretches Christian would probably doesn't play because he's a little bit he's not quite strong enough defensively  you'll probably see them put you know reddish on like McCollum or reddish might guard Ingram Vanderbilt did a pretty good job on brain and Ingram last year so you might see a little more Vando still I think Prince and reddish are probably the guys that you'd consider in kind of that that deep stream mode 10 team Roto Anthony Davis Zach Collins Klay Thompson one side Kyrie Gafford Nic Claxton on the other who wins the trade  uh well on one side you're getting Anthony Davis and then two guys who haven't really been 10 Team playable and on the other side you're at least getting all three guys that are 10 Team playable but add is so far out in front of everybody else in overall rank  I think a little bit has to do with team needs I know this particular person says they're punting points  so you know Klay Thompson becomes even less useful there but I'll also Kyrie Irving becomes less useful I probably go with the Kyrie Gafford Claxton side because you're gonna Kyrie I think is gonna end up in the mid-teens add is always an injury wrist so there's that hanging over yeah Gafford has been a top 60 guy Claxton could be a top 40 guy this year I think that's  basically you're getting a little bit more than enough for Anthony Davis alone if this was like Kyrie and Gafford for Anthony Davis I take the Davis side but getting klaxon an early round big  for kind of junk makes it swing back the other way predictions on where shohei ohtani lands you know what I'm having a lot of fun watching this crap I've got this tin foil you guys know I'm a Dodger fan I've got this tin foil hat thing going on that Dave Roberts I don't know if anybody watching this show pays attention to baseball but Dodgers manager Dave Roberts came out and confirmed they had a meeting with Otani and apparently his Camp doesn't want anybody to know who he's met with my tin foil hat says that Roberts doesn't want the Dodgers to sign ohtani because he's gonna cost 600 million dollars and I think he'd rather go get a couple of Frontline starting pitchers because that's really what the team needed  they got blitzed in the playoffs because their starters went like four Innings and four games  gross or whatever it was  but maybe he just maybe he just slipped up either way  I have no idea I don't have the first clue I know the Blue Jays are going like full bore Adam originally I thought he might go Mariners but they pulled themselves out of the running because the price tag was too high but Mariners have such awesome Japanese baseball Heritage there with Ichiro and so then the California made a lot of sense because he's already in SoCal and large Japanese population and you know closest technically to home I have this weird thing going on in my brain that he just goes back to the angels because I don't know why why not um I still I still actually think it's the Dodgers but I I really don't know I'm interested it's cool man I'm I'm excited about it  let's see here rodo strategy question if I have 12 start audible top 100 players do I start all 12 or do I only start 10 and play the others if someone sits  I'm basically playing all 12 by the way because I think at some point your guys are going to miss time and  at that point you're going to be glad that you're running kind of even with the games cap or maybe just the tiniest bit in front of it  as a post to falling behind and then having to scramble to figure out who to start in that spot so I'm actually okay if you got if they're all like legitimately good if some of them are like dangling at the edge of the top 100 maybe you sit them in a game where they're against a really good defense or something like that but if you're really have 12 guys that are like  ranked 88th or better you probably play them and then when you have time I know time is fleeting I have almost none try to package some dudes not not your guys at the end of the bench package somebody that's like a Top 40 with the top 80 and see if you can turn them into a top you know 28 or something like that because you've got more guys than you need and you can try to wring some value out of one of them  rank the following players Keegan Murray khris Middleton Trey Murphy Keegan Trey Middleton  because I just don't want to deal with Middleton this year  best stream for today out of Deni avdija Andrew Wiggins or land o' Robinson or stash scoot Henderson  I'll go avdija  catching the show drinking my morning coffee all the way from New Zealand Dan you are a legend thanks man that's very kind you've helped me to multiple titles in both head to head and Rodeo also funded know how does Jaws Return affect JJJ and Desmond Bane it's gonna take some stuff away from Bain I actually think it makes Jerry and Jackson better because jaw gets him open  and JJ is better when he doesn't have to focus so much on the offensive side he can go back to just fly SWAT and everybody  Bain will have to do a little bit less so he'll probably take a small hit their  train for your buddy hield rest of season um give me buddy I'll just take the guy who starting right now talk about breakouts I wish Lively got 30 minutes per game says Point Blank Mich yeah you and me both buddy but you know what we don't have to worry about it because I think at some point this year he probably will start to get close to 30 minutes per game just inching up the board right now  Dan great show thanks man or Galena you could be thanks human I'm in a 12 team League I had a rough start can I depend on hardened Kauai and Westie to carry me I also have women Jama and some decent bigs Westbrook probably know not in nine cat the others sure  re says I've been listening so long that yours and Bruise kids are literally growing up on the Pod it is crazy I feel like I need to like have them run onto the show and just permanent marker the year on their head so you guys can just do one photo of them every year as they blitzed onto the podcast from the side  life since covid basically  I traded William's for Collins and smart honest to God the only player on that list to I know is Marcus Smart there are multiple William's and multiple Collins  I'm sorry man I I don't know who you're talking about I got to have first names on these just a couple more questions here remember I said up to 10:41 questions I was answering and then we're done how much longer should I hold Duncan Robinson and or Killian Hayes hold Duncan Robinson it's all here Tyler hero comes back holds Gillian Hayes until we figure out what he is it's Santi aldama a must roster know but I am holding him for now  who benefits in Chicago Tori Craig uh nah Chicago the beneficiaries of all this stuff obviously Kobe white and then Patrick Williams and Iota Sumo were the other guys we've seen kind of Step Up  two more questions  this is a whole team thoughts on my team ah this is a hard one Darren Fox Donovan Mitchell Jayson Tatum Chad Holmgren bam Suggs delos attend Timur Walker Kessler Jamal Murray Keegan Murray Brook Lopez your team looks awesome but it's also hard for me to visualize how 10 teams work because everybody's team looks awesome and attend your job if you're in a team League or fewer  is to take as many of your 50 range guys as possible and package them up and try to turn him into 25 or higher it's easier said than done I get it but if you could take like  Jamal Murray and D'Angelo Russell and put him together and try to get like a top 30 guard you do it or if you could take you know D-Lo and Jalen Suggs and turn him into a top 40 guard you do it because depth is meaningless in a 10 team her because everybody on the wire is good last question for the day I just traded Lowry Markin and Brooke Lopez for Damian Lillard and Yusuf nurkic what do you think points League um  pretty fair you're selling a tiny bit low on marketing because he's out right now um  but getting something for Brooke is decent it's probably a little bit of an overpay but it's not it's not crazy if this was nine cat I would say it's a it's a big overpay but points not that much because I'm assuming is rocking pretty good one one request for you for all of you that are hanging out with us if you do a points League post please try to throw their average in parentheses for me because points have a bunch of different ways of doing the settings ESPN I know counts percentage is a little bit more this year CBS doesn't Fantrax has theirs Yahoo has theirs so it's hard for me to know exactly what these guys have done I have the nine Cat Board in front of me that one I can do on the fly but the other ones little more complicated  somebody said I missed his question but I clicked on every one of them so maybe it came up  Jordan says you missed my question I don't actually see it on the board here if you posted it maybe it got lost in some sort of Shuffle but I I don't see it so I apologize it didn't pop up in my stream yard I don't know if there's been some sort of glitch but I clicked on every single one that went through I'm really sorry about that throw it to me in the comments after the show all that make sure to get to those and that goes for the rest of you as well if you put a Live question in that I didn't get to pop it in the comments post show and I'll get to those at some point later on today or this evening thanks again to manscaped and expressvpn I am Dan Vespers at Dan best person on social again I
