welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast it's showtime  because I said so  second to last weekly review episode here on fantasy NBA today I  I gotta say folks  I feel  a little tired today  you never know when that's gonna kind of catch up with you it was today for me  after I mean how many freaking day like you know I know we had the All-Star break in there but effectively we are season started what October 20 something this year I don't remember this crap 24th October 24th November December January February March  about five and a half months  little less five months 10 days roughly 11 days 160 ish actual calendar days  and finally today is when I looked up  and I started to get ready for the podcast this morning about an hour ago and I thought oh  I am I am feeling it  which I realized is kind of stupid when I say it out loud because I'm a fantasy sports analyst so what am I actually feeling  but it's an emotional letdown  its  you know we got today tomorrow Sunday and then one more week so we really are now we're 10 days 10 game days from the end of the NBA season  basically everybody's done on the head to head side already and if you're not you're done on Sunday out of you know one out of every 20 weeks probably goes the final week on the head to head side Roto you're scratching  at Specialists basically at this point there's there's almost no reason and so I've got to keep up with your games cap so you're going to play your best guys because they're good in a bunch of stuff but outside of that you're going full specialist mode your hunting for some categories to try to gain a point here a point there wherever you can kind of chisel something off get a roto point  it's really hard  especially today because like yesterday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday in particular I can look at the card and I go all right look we're just gonna talk about what happened yesterday we're gonna break down the news for today I got to this morning and I was like holy crap weekly review show  how on God's green earth are we gonna put this thing together  but I think I did it I think it's decent  I'm hoping that what I'm about to say to you all which again is a little bit more on kind of the like emotional side of this not like feeling emotional but just like how do you push forward  this is a fantasy discussion I get yelled at sometimes for taking an intro that that veers off course but I actually think this is a really important thing so that's the background to why I'm doing this little show opening rant and maybe I should have gone rant first and background second but whatever this is what we're at so you're with me now  I don't know if you guys remember if you guys have been listening to or watching this program for a couple of years we've been in existence for think it's pods been around for about seven as a seventh season I think doing the show every day the not that you're that was ended early by covid but the following year the covid  like intentionally shortened season that began in December  yeah  and then so you had this  and the following one actually the two seasons after that you had all the covid absences by the way look how few there were this season  kind of cool and it will look back on that when the years over but  we have anybody out due to covid this year  one maybe I don't even remember I think it might have been 0  not that it's not floating around out there but it's pretty much just getting passed around at schools these days so the reason I bring that up is not because I want us all thinking about what a lovely time it was when we were dealing with covid absences all the time but what I want you guys to remember is the Omicron surge whatever winter that was last year year before I again I can't even remember but I had a lot of people coming to me in the comment section on podcasts or more specifically on social media because that's like the easiest place to just send a quick note and saying  Dan I hate I hate fantasy sports right now I'm like I'm dying I can't I can't do this I just don't  so right in this moment  it's not the same but it's not even close to the same but right in this moment you I think we a lot of us have that same kind of pit in our stomachs which is like how do I  grind out this last little bit now if you're Head to Head its easier because you probably have some chunk of change on the line that's going to come down to a movie makeover the next couple of days Roto I think it's a little bit harder if there's any other format that you might be engaged in I think that's all so probably tougher as well what I would say is just kind of a pep talk right now  dig deep  find a way to channel whatever you have left it's so easy to say oh so close to the end I just let's just get there but I want us to look at it from the total flip side of that and say  we've conquered this much now is not the time to let go of the Rope  hold on to the Rope just a little bit longer because the other teams you're playing against are having the same emotional feelings right now which is like oh I really come on I could just like just wing it for a couple of days and this is just hit the set line of button it'll be fine no  don't you just hit that set lineup button take the extra couple of minutes today tomorrow Sunday next week whatever it is and stay locked in stay piped in on everything that's going on in the fantasy side make those decisions that are just a little bit better than what your opponent's doing that's mailing it in a little bit and it'll pay off I promise you so stick with it I promise to do the same let's review what happened over this last week it is weak 24 I know it's period 23 I don't I don't care what period Yahoo and ESPN and whoever else calls it is the 24th week of basketball this season  count them up people  count them up  we're gonna check out what happened over the last week basically more or less it'll be the midweek not as much last weekend we're gonna focus on players independent of their current schedules this podcast I say again will not focus on schedule that will be up to you guys to dig into and we'll have our second show early this afternoon where we talked about schedules as well independent of schedule this is looking for players that can provide you great fantasy numbers on whatever term basis you make make sense for your ball Club  follow me on Twitter @dan Vespers follow Sports ethos on Twitter at ethos BK that'll be changing to ethos fantasy NBA once we hit the offseason by the way  and please  for goodness sake like rate subscribe I have not bugged you about subscribing and rating nearly as much as I should this year please please please do those if you guys are hanging out for the first time the second time the 10th time whatever and you have done it I want to make sure you guys are connected to us throughout the offseason and then rolling into next year as well we're starting with the injury Replacements as I mentioned a couple weeks ago when I flipped the order of how we cover things on our Friday shows I think it's actually really important that I do these injury names first because a lot of you were like hey where is player whatever whereas almond Thompson why wasn't he ever on your ads board obviously he's an ad but the reason he's an ad is because Alpine went down for the year I mean this is we're talking three weeks ago now but this is just an example of somebody asked about actually multiple times this not about the same player but always someone's like Dan why isn't so on your ads board and I'm like well they're on the injury replacement board and they will stay there basically indefinitely until we get some sort of confirmation that they would be good enough even if a team was healthy and even if someone's out for the year I've just noticed that on the board here if someone is injury replacement for the season great that means we won't get the data we need on whether or not there just a traditional ad on til next year  so that in mind a couple of repeat names on the board here I'm in Thompson Nas Reed slo-mo Josh Hart but silly a midsection those guys were all injury Replacements and have been for at least one week some of them two three four five six weeks it's that I'm not taking them off key on Ellis was on this board before I think over the last week we did get word that Kevin herder is out for the year we kind of thought it was going to be the case but now we know for sure and  I got a lot of like why are you so excited about key on Ellis and I'm hoping that the last couple of ball games with Malik monk out as well has answered the question of why I like Kion and  the answer is basically his defensive stats are the massive upside  but the fact that he's now pretty much guaranteed 30 minutes a night is where you just get enough of the other stuff so over the last week he's right around the edge of the top 100 and that's despite shooting just 39% from the field still only taking six shots a game over that strike but you're at six rebounds 1.8 steals two three-pointers over to assists  the  again if he shoots in the mid 40s over that his scoring goes from 9 to 10 field goal percent becomes a smaller negative he jumps inside the top 75 if he blocks one shot all these little things that like this is almost a worst case over the last week so that's why I like key on Ellis I think he's got a lot of good stuff in the tank uh deuce deuce McBride miles McBride that's a pretty easy one because he pretty much plays 48 minutes every ball game even if his last game wasn't all that great overall he's been extraordinarily useful I'm Gonna Leave Kelly oubre on this thing he's replacing the Anthony Melton even though both Tyrese Maxey and Joel embiid are back  U Bray and I guess we could you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna update this in real time it's Melton and it's Tobias  I'm just write the name Tobias everybody knows I mean Harris right that left enough shots out there  question of course remains that went Harris comes back are there enough shots for Uber a he's gonna be a lot more open now but we need enough field goal attempt so injury replacement now for a couple of guys will it stick went to buy Sarah's comes back  not entirely clear but it's good for right now  throwing Al Horford on this list he's been on there all season long because anytime a boss and starter is out you want to drop by a Horford in and it seems like I think we've already had Derek white ruled out for tonight correct  yep 10 minutes ago Jane Brown also out so you're gonna get for Daniel probably gonna get somebody else maybe I should be adding another name to the board we'll find out who the other starter is going to be if it's going to be Pritchard or Sam Houser  so I think  I think it's probably  gonna be Houser but we'll see I'm also going to take Malik Beasley off of this board because as we're talking Damian Lillard just got ruled back in after missing the last three ball games so that news happened like 10 seconds ago  Pat connaughton had also been like kind of decent over that stretch  Malik Beasley was merely okay  so this one's a pretty easy one now with Dame back you're going Dame you're going Brook Lopez you're going Giannis and you're going Middleton for the Bucs and then Portis is kind of more of a like points and rebounds stream but probably not a guy that sits inside the top 100  let's move back up the board here make sure that I'm I did that one out of order and I gotta get back into read mode Grant Williams is the next name here he's a filling for Nick Richards who was already a fill in for Mark William's I do love myself a nesting doll I think that needs to become a term  my my attempt to make a pre tank a term didn't really land but this one I feel like we could really do if we did it together it's a fantasy nesting doll meaning oh you can't start Mark Williams up pop the nesting doll open who's in there hey it's Nick Richards oh you can't do Nick Richards popped the nesting doll open who's inside there it's Grant Williams  what happens if he goes down I don't know there might not be another doll inside there Greg Williams is putting up really nice numbers as the starting center for the Hornets so again provided Nick Richards remains out Grant is a lovely play  she's amazing to in Detroit I really like the numbers he's been putting up lately kind of a nice little cross the board not a ton of points but some kind of League average number rebounds of late just slightly subbly averaging assist very good steals decent blocks good percentages I can see the field goal percent maybe even climbing a tiny bit of higher depending on how things go here but he's very much been a startable fantasy play over the last few ball games we finally we we is me it's a royal we I finally had the stones to say you know what go ahead and play the dude whatever it was won two games back and it's been good so far you know these top 75 over the last week top 100 over the last two weeks on 10 5 big defensive stats he's a 3.3 defensive stats but he's shooting only 43% which again not taking three pointers so you figure that's a number that could maybe creep up a little bit I just I like the across the board stuff you're getting right now  there's there's Intrigue there for me and if anybody else  takes time not that the Pistons need more guys to be shut down for this to be fantasy relevant but hey you never know  Delano baton in Portland with everybody out  there I put the name and princesses as just all the whole damn team is down except for DeAndre eight and which means there's there's just a boatload of shots left so Banton  his usage has been high enough to overcome the bad Nine Cats stuff you'll see some other Portland Trail Blazer names or we'll talk about them depending on if you're watching or listening on other parts of this Friday show button right now is the one that to me makes the injury replacement list the other ones are going to be more I think they fall into the watch board if I'm remembering right but we'll get there in a little bit Josh Gideon Lou Dort those guys are plays well Shea and Jalen Williams are out they're not great plays but they're playable not my far from my favorites on this board Corey kispert seems like Kyle kuzma May finally be pulling the plug but at the very best case scenario it seems like who's playing in every other game meaning you can get in every other game out of Corey kispert where the in between ones are kind of math like top 175 150 175 range and then when kuzma's down it's more like you know top 80 sort of stuff so yeah if you play them all together it wouldn't be very good on the road outside games cap you play Kiss bird on days when kuzma's out head to head if you want to play his birthday the whole way through you'd probably get enough on better scheduling parts  and yeah that's about where you can leave that and then the latest edition of the board Jalen Smith with Myles Turner out miles is questionable so there's a chance he might be back meaning that you know by the end of today we might have to adjust this thing but that's the injury report injury replacement board for now  a couple of names on the ads board I put Banton in there just because I feel like I don't know I remember why I did I was writing this up and I was like you know I'm a Banton on this board as well just so people know that I like it I don't think there's gonna be somebody that comes back this year that was why I did it so because the player that was out that made Banton relevant was the word all because the entire Blazers team is out I don't think any of those guys is returning for Portland  I and even if someone one of them does I don't think that it's going to knock an off so I wanted to put him on the ads board in addition to the injury replacement board just to kind of stress the idea that  if some guy comes back if Jeremy Grant magically goes from doubtful back to playing one game the rest of the way I think you probably still get enough out of Benton  and so this is my way of  trying to do it for anybody that's reading the list on Twitter and not listening to the podcast it may be like well why is it in both places well  I the takeaway there I hope is that oh Dan likes him enough to say here's here he is as well I don't know if Luke Kennard is gonna play in every game probably not but if he's starting on playing him and he had one bad ballgame in there but by and large he's been pretty good as a starter he's basically the point guard for the Grizzlies right now and he's point guard that can shoot the crap out of a three-pointer so I'm good with that Malachi Flynn I had to put on the ads board because the kid just went for 50 Off the Bench but he's also going to probably poo his pants in the next ball game I would be flabbergasted if Flynn is inside the top 80 the rest of the way that would absolutely blow my mind because he has massive efficiency issues that we didn't get to see in the last ball game because he made all of his field goals but he's not a good free throw shooter for a guard he's not a good field goal percent guy for a guard and he did have one absolutely colossal ballgame he makes more sense in points actually so does Banton frankly but Flynn makes it more sense in points with Cade Cunningham out for we don't know exactly how many  ball games Detroit has a back-to-back here so does do we see Cade in any of those he skipped game that wasn't back to back last time out so that's all so notable talking about cuttingham there for Flynn you know I think he's a guy where you're like look there's probably gonna be enough usage for him when cayde sits so it's worth a flyer but you might also get a game that's like 14 points for boards for assists and you're thinking oh great I'm in excellent shape  but he might do it on you know three out of 14 shooting I'm doing 14 is a lot in this one three out of 14 shooting from the field and like two for three at the free throw line and then overall that's actually not helpful so points leagues yes unquestionably for Flynn when cayde sits  and maybe Malachi I should have been on the injury replacement board too I don't know  it's a fine line here  but for Rodeo for nine cat whatever I think you want to be a little bit cautious and I get it had to head they have a back-to-back so that makes that call a little bit easier and then Brandon Clark who's sitting out one of the back-to-backs as we knew he would that's why in parentheses I wrote games cap  Brandon Clarke is a games cap add because you're going to get some points some rebounds some defensive stats good field goal percent as he's continuing to kind of slowly ramp up here and JJ basically I might be done for the year we'll see but certainly done for at least one ball game on their back to back and that's an opportunity for Clark to maybe collected another two or three minutes as he continues to get his legs back I just like he's had a good  nine cat game since the second he entered the NBA the issue is always been whether or not the Grizzlies would give him enough playing time and at this point  I just I don't see a Universe where he gets less than 20 minutes and less it's injury related  strong holds this is the easiest Board of any of them on this show because all I got to do is say the name and you're going to be like yeah that makes sense  Deni avdija crushing it Kelly Olynyk when he's playing crushing it TJ McConnell very consistent he's had a death of steals in his last couple of ball games you know those are gonna come rolling back around for him  trayce Jackson Davis  playing very well rui hachimura playing really well right now  not an injury replacement for the moment  if the field goal percent dries up that's when he moves back into a drop valuation Jaylen Suggs one bad game here and there but overall pretty damn good Max Drew's playing really well since he came back from injury  and I say a heart and shine whose a very obvious one not because Mitch Robinson is bringing being brought along really slowly Julius Randle got ruled out for the season yesterday so you know that competition for minutes of that Center Spot is not too stiff right now but now we go to the soft holds page and this one I think the guys need  maybe a little bit more explanation  Jonas Valanciunas who's been on the soft hold board for about three weeks in a row and every week it's like well what if this happens  in a funny thing is in between these Friday shows for those that listen every day you've heard JV bounce back and forth between droppable and soft holdable folks that only watch the Friday shows are like oh Danny always has Jonas on the soft holds list and I hate that I have to do this little preface but I do  I don't have valentina's on my teams I didn't want to drive him I thought this was going to be his job from the beginning of the year and for the first three months I was very wrong  and I felt kind of dumb about it but now they handicapped that I had on valentina's finally has taken shape here the last two months basically of the season and so I'm able to point and go all right well you know at least I didn't I don't have them so I don't have to worry about this but in my best  my best empathy here trying to put myself in your shoes to say okay well what would I do if I was sitting on JV and right at this moment this very narrow cross-section of time I would say hold on  and the reason I would say hold on  is because Zion heard his finger in the Pelicans last ball game and we don't yet know if he's playing  I haven't seen anything  to make me think he's not but we also haven't gotten any sort of definitive yes  at the moment we're gonna treat Zion  like he's questionable  and so if he sits out a ball game  sure they could go to Naji Marshall although Larry Nance by the way also got a little dinged up in their last ball game so he might be out as well and if all of that takes shape frankly even if it's only Nance it'll be hard for them to go under 20 minutes on JV it could happen but if Nancy design on our both out I would then think it's basically impossible for the pals to go sub 20 minutes on valance units and if you get him up to 22 23 24 then he's fantasy playable  so that's why it's a soft hold oh I put nope nope nope nope nope I don't want to run this one I'm removing Dentistry from this list sorry those on Twitter all right not gonna get this update but you know what it is what it is that's why you should watch The Vampire cast ah Trey man is the other one is another one in a very soft holds Department I don't it's not that good and we talked about this way back at the trade deadline when he got moved and then he had like two or three really big ball games and I was like okay this is two things wrapped up into one  he's an ad but he's also a cell High we talked about keyonte George in the same breath for multiple shows that was like oh these guys are hot right now but that ain't gonna stick forever and train man was getting like nine rebounds a game like guys this is this dudes like this dudes like six four 195 pounds soaking wet he ain't getting nine rebounds a game after the rigors of an NBA season start to knock him and now you're seeing it  it's not it's not rocket science people  he's a very soft hold because he can do a little bit of everything but he's also probably not going to be a nine cat guy so  Jonathan Isaac is a soft hold only in game Scout Roto League's because again when he plays 20 minutes he's really good and a lot of the time he is these days but not every time and that's the moment where you like trust this guy against the game's cap or Grumble grumble the answer is probably yes if you need some threes rebounds defensive stats if you don't need those things  yeah  now he's good enough at those  where the math basically says you could start him anywhere but it is a little bit specialist the  Gary Trent Jr in and out of the lineup for Toronto make some a very difficult hold on the head-to-head side but I think you have to at least hold the see if he's playing later on  today right aren't they going a little bit later today yeah they're in Milwaukee  for Roto you're hanging on because when he plays he's gonna be one of the better options out there and then Andrew Wiggins who would have been a strong hold but turned ankle last night and so his season from Hell continues he'd been playing really well but I think he got at least hold the sea how he responds to that  the nervous scared and drop contingent is five names long today a couple of them are repeats one of them in particular that makes me feel very sad all the way to my sad little heart is Chris Paul he's been bad for the last two weeks brutal time timing for my 30 deep finals against the great doctor a when I really needed to have a shot at a cysts and without Chris Paul getting assists I ain't got a shot at him so womp womp Chris Paul is a drop  and even if he gets good again we're talking about ten damn days  that's a nice thing about right now you can be extra aggressive kante's a drop he's been a horrible lately literally losing weeks for teams  DeAndre Hunter is more of an I'm very scared play you could probably hang on if you need some points and a couple of rebounds on an okay field goal percent but if you don't need those and I don't think the math is gonna suggest that he should stay and frankly we probably could put Trey man in here as well as guys that are a little bit more  you know doesn't matter range that were maybe a little higher than that before  and that's what Hunter is he was a little bit higher than that one Jalen Johnson was out  JJ's back and now Hunter is probably dropping back into that like 15 to 1:50 rain range and that's more specialist range  GG Jackson  whoa boy is the efficiency been rough  specialist all so just in points  is a points specialist maybe a little free throw maybe a little three-pointer and then Dennis Schroder more of an assist specialist you've seen some pretty bad games from him mixed in with like one kind of okay one yuck you guys know I don't like Dennis Schroder very much  for Fantasy sorry I gotta clarify that for fantasy  and finally an extensive watch list right now which shouldn't surprise you given that we are in the throes of silly season so there's just an absolute truckload of names that are teetering right on the brink of maybe relevant fantasy value  and I want this to basically have these guys kind of at the top of the list of okay make sure when you're checking box scores over the weekend where maybe you can't be quite as piped in  go and check to see what these guys did before you pour through every damn name on the board  and these names are Dillon Brooks and I could probably not the hell with Dillon Brooks don't even worry about him Mitchell Robinson should his minute start to ramp up in New York Jordan Goodwin I think it's played three games in a row now for Memphis uh  I don't know off the top of my head I've lost track of how many eligibility days he has left  but if they're gonna start to play him nightly he'd be a really really interesting rebounds a stiffness assists steals blocks stream out of a guard spot keep an eye on Haywood Highsmith Miami's playing for something right now so I'm I doubt that that one sticks but Duncan Robinson got himself heard again in the last ball game trying to Watford is a watch list guy in Brooklyn in case someone else goes down Jabari Walker had a huge ball game last time around but we've seen enough of him to know that it's really just points and rebounds and so unless he goes colossal on those categories like he did in his last ball game it's gonna be pretty damn hard for him to hold nine CAD value and same story for scoot Henderson who's gonna get you some assists and some points but he's also going to point the  blowtorch write down at his own feet and set himself on fire in Black of steals lack of blocks horrible percentages and very high turnovers so  points League much  Jerry Butler  not to be confused with Jimmy Jared Butler in Washington has a really interesting point guard style Fantasy game but we're very much a backcourt absence away from unlocking it  meaning we're close and with kuzma out it's closer but I really do think that Jordan Poole needs to take the last week off if we want maximum Jared Butler  Jordan Aura and Toronto you know this one feels maybe more like an injury replacement guy when a bunch of guys are taking rest days so like last ball game there was no Gary Trent know Kelly Olynyk know RJ Barrett and Nora had a nice ball game and manual quickly played but now it sounds like a Linux and bear it will definitely be back for the Raptors next game I don't know the status of Trent yet but if all those guys are in then it's hard to see more having enough stuff to do Off the Bench  for Utah who's gone now from Mostly tank to maximum Tang  Taylor Hendricks and Bryce sense of all have to at least be on our Radars I don't know  that  either one of them has that great of a fantasy game yet but we might be looking at a situation where it's like Colin Sexton keyonte George taking 18 shots and then there's just like  55 or 60 shots up for grabs among a who's who of who  and so then you figure Hendricks will get 10 or 11 and sensible will take 13 or 14 or something like that and that might frankly just be enough usage for these guys even if they're not  putting up outstanding per minute numbers  it just like you might just be out there long enough to have value so keep an eye on those dudes Utah plays tonight  in La they've got the Clippers in LA  I don't expect the Clippers to take this game all that seriously after they just beat the Nuggets yesterday so this is Max this is like a pure let down spot for the Clippers meaning the Jazz are probably gonna be able to hang in there for a little bit and then maybe you do get some okay lines out of Hendricks and sensible and maybe that's the thing that pushes them up above the watch list to go ahead and injury replace them  we'll see  a couple other injury replacement watch list guys julienne champagne in San Antonio because Kelvin Johnson is still out and Devin was out for the year and Jeremy sohan's out for the year and Malachi Branham is the other one so they just gonna be a lot of shots behind Trey Jones and Wembley  and chitty Osmonds out as well  and you figure that champagne will get you know eight to 10 of them Branham is probably gonna take a dozen or more I really don't like Malachi branham's nine cat game because it's all points and inefficiently so but he would make sense in the in a points League realm or if you're  like stat hunting the points the scoring category  for champagne he's a little bit more  actually a lot like she's amazing to in terms of like what do they do when they're on the basketball court and it's you know maybe they get to double digit points maybe they get to around five or six rebounds probably a couple of assists just from being out there for a half an hour  us like champagne is Gonna Get You Steal when he's out there just like me to is maybe they look into a block because they're kind of long dudes probably not going to obliterate your percentages may be a little bit better  give or take better and one worse than the other  those guys are useful  they're just kind of more useful in the dog days then they are right now because at the end of the season and we've talked about this before even early on today's show  you're more looking for someone even if they're ranked is worse like over if you over the next two weeks this weekend and next week champagne is probably going to be ranked higher than Jabari Walker in nine categories probably I know for sure but probably but Barry Walker might be a more useful fantasy player for your team just because you could be like all right I need points I need rebounds  I don't care if the guy I'm playing gets me zero defensive stats and one assist instead of a steal a block and two and a half assists those are a reason our collection of reasons why player B in this case champagne might be ranked higher over the next week and a half for these last two weeks but for my team which is basically now you're just toggling punt categories on the various rank boards a lot turn things on and off turn categories on and off and see how these players move around if you're punting both defensive categories that probably flips now that Jabari Walker's probably a higher rank player than Julian champagne  this is just one example of many happening right now where you know we we've talked about some of the other players already  all these guys that sit between honestly normally it's between like a hundred and 150 or between 110 and 160 right now you can probably extended even a little bit on both sides at this time of year so basically anybody ranked between like 85 and 175 I don't want to say they're the same because they're not the 85 ranked guy is a better fantasy player but the guy ranked down near 160 might just make more sense for what you're attacking and head-to-head if you need to win the week and you need rebounds more than anything else and you got a big lead and you know four other categories or Roto where it's actually even more I think  different this dichotomy regular season versus the middle of the Season versus the end of it in Roto you might have like a three hundred point gap between you and the guy behind you  so yeah you can play a guy that doesn't score for a week and that other team probably isn't gonna catch up to you  you can really go category hunting and Rodeo right now and you can kind of semi go category hunting in head-to-head all though again you know today's Friday so certainly more so than like a Tuesday but Sunday in head is the day where you can really Hammer a category earlier in the week you generally want to attack a bunch of stuff at the same time middle of the week you're probably can kind of laser into like two or three categories and then on Sunday you can kind of category hunt one thing and it changes and resets every week but again you know Saturday Sunday and head-to-head is going to be a lot like Rodeo right now where you're looking for one or two main categories earlier in the week and head to head you're probably not gonna play the lower ranked guy you're probably gonna play the higher ranked guy because they'll give you a little bit in more stuff  anyway that's sort of a couple of strategic things that are going on right now in terms of how player valuations are just different right now then they are  you know even like two weeks ago  all right we'll go ahead and save that board and then we'll go ahead and turn it off  and now those watching are stuck once again with just me  and those listening you've been stuck with me the whole damn time  coming up on fantasy NBA today what's next  data doo doo we will have a streaming show later on today we'll get you set for today sat Saturday and Sunday this is a very uncomplicated couple of days now because we've finally hit the overload part of the schedule today and Sunday being extraordinarily busy and NBA nights and then tomorrow Saturday being a much quieter one and  we'll try to throw a little bit of info in that streaming show for folks that do roll into next week in head-to-head which is just a terrible idea but bear in mind Monday is an off day in the NBA to open up for the NCAA title game and then Tuesday I think everybody know Fort it's a 14 gamer so the last week of the season is basically Wednesday through Saturday because Sunday Everybody Plays that's a 15 gamer so Monday's off Tuesday is basically full and Sunday is fully full so there's absolutely no reason for you to like hang on to move at the end and there's really almost no reason for you to hang on to use moves at the beginning so you're basically Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday of next week are the only days that matter  so that creates a very goofy set of stream situations Wednesday by the way if you're interested on next week and Wednesdays eight games Thursdays 5 Friday is like 1 4  Saturday's off and then Sunday is a big one too where his Friday 15 also Friday might be 15 also and I get that wrong  does anybody not oh crap it's everybody thought it was 14 so I mean shave it down a little bit more I mean yes you can't just say like oh skip over Friday because whatever decisions you make between Wednesday and Saturday are gonna involve Friday but Saturdays and off day two  so there's really almost no way to stream next week and all of that to say we'll spend a little bit of time on it but not very much because next week's streams is like three days basically  you're welcome for the pep talk to Tyler you in the chat room who threw it thank you on there oh I forgot to put Omar yours event on the list good looking out Keon it's too late for me to add him back to the board but oh Mary you're seven is a likely injury replacement play in Utah you could put them on the watch list for one game if you really want to but Walker Kessler is likely down right now so you're in probably gonna get a start and probably get close to 30 minutes the question of the chat room is trade Jameson versus Omar heard seven because with JJ getting at least one game off Trey Jameson's probably gonna get a start I prefer Omer  this particular user is looking for field goal percent free-throw percent and points  I don't know that yours events gonna score very much he certainly going to give you a nice field goal percent attack I probably go all my just because I feel like the minutes are a little bit more safe and you're sort of guaranteed those big man stats but if you're not looking for rebounds or blocks then it's kind of a wash  but between those two just like General do I need big man stuff oh my is the direction that I would lean  all right friends that was it second to last weekly review show is done for this season  we will be back later on today with a streaming show and then maybe we'll have a streaming show on Sunday I don't know if there's gonna be time this weekend there's a lot going on here on the family side and then Monday will probably do two shows as well a weekend review a weekly preview and then we'll just go one show a day weekdays  until August if we don't take the offseason off though if anybody's watching or listening this is your first year with
