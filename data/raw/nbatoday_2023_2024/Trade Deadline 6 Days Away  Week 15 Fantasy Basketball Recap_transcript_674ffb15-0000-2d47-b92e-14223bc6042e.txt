coming in hot that's how you know you're doing better when you're starting to get spammed  and not just by pornbots on Twitter these days well they are really coming in Fast and Furious no rest for the weary on pornbots I'll tell you what  those Bots are making porn 24/7  yeah yep yep it's Brave New World out there friends all right so weak 15 in review let's talk about the ads everybody wants to know who the ads are this week and they are these five names Jonathan come in Gus Santi aldama Jerry Vanderbilt Andrew Wiggins and John Collins we talked about two of these guys last week but we have three new names on the board the two repeats our Jonathan kaminga and Santi aldama mostly put him back on here because I just wanted to add a little bit more context to them I'm starting with comingo who's just cruising right now I just I want people to remember that this is a guy who like two weeks ago wasn't getting to play  and then he yelled at his teacher his coach whatever you want to call it and all of a sudden he was just like getting a crap ton of minutes I guess it was more like three weeks ago  it was a crazy thing that never works but it worked for kaminga and he is on a like a bender to end all Benders here with  activity he is shooting 65% on extraordinarily high volume over the last two weeks it's why he's like a second round or over that strike  he's also that 2.6 combined Steals and blocks after  not getting anywhere near that  in his career to this point he's never been a big steals blocks guy  we get extrapolated his numbers to 30 minutes before and it looked more like he was gonna be in the ballpark of like point eight point nine Steals and like point seven blocks which isn't terrible but it's not what you're seeing right now and frankly this year in 24 minutes a game before this recent surge was actually more like 23  it is a point six deals and point four blocks and all of the sudden now he's at 2.6 combined  in a little bit more yeah I don't it doesn't really add up so you're looking at all this stuff and long-term 5253 percent field goal seems very attainable  but we just we have to we have to be aware of where things are going well and where things are going well that are sustainable and  free throw over that stretch at 71% feels like something he could probably replicate that's about where he's at the entire season but 65% ridiculous volume field goal is just not going to be so this is one of those moments where I need all of you listening to hold two thoughts in your head at the same time  thought number one kaminga is dominating  thought number two it also probably makes him a bit of a cell High  do you guys see where those pieces can kind of fit together  strangest things are happening in the chat room right now I can't take my eyes off of that  so we can be excited about him and at the same time we can also be fully aware that he's not going to be a second round pick the rest of the way so then the question is like okay well if I'm if I'm going to try to sell this dude by the way this actually requires another explanation because  I had someone who I ultimately had to mute because I I can't I don't have the time of the energy to argue with people  say something like oh how can you call this guy a cell well  it's not  when you say someone's a cell I have to do this like once a month  forever so this is probably like the 50th time I've had this exact same conversation when you call somebody a sell  you're not saying that you don't believe in them you're just saying that you think you could get more for them right in this particular window of time  then they're likely to be worth rest of season  if you just wrote it out  so right now for kaminga based on the crazy stuff he's been putting up lately you could I think probably get like a top 75 guy back for him and so on my mind that's probably a movie you should make you could probably get like Michael Porter Jr back for Johnathan coming to right now you might be able to get a Tyler hero back while the heater struggling to incorporate their pieces  maybe a Devon vessel that's questionable there if you want to go get like are you doing if you wanted to assist like my Conley low turnover yeah you're not gonna get as many points but I think these guys that don't have a crap ton of name recognition that are hovering in the sort of 55 to 80 range  you could probably get them for coming right now because he's rolling second round value over two weeks and people have convinced themselves that he's going to be you know on top 40 either the rest of the way but reality is gonna set in at some point he's gonna have the week where he goes the other direction because that's just what happens even to very very good NBA players they go through ups and downs and coming because young and improving but he's not like a superstar that's just gonna sit second round at the rest of the way  and I think if you could lock in someone who is maybe say more trustworthy and again we don't know what the Warriors are gonna do in the next six days on top of all of that that's why he can both be at and a cell at the same time  thank you Sports Guru for the comment and if someone doesn't still understand sell high and Buy Low they don't understand fantasy the thing is you know I I want to I don't want to be condescending and maybe that was not the greatest way to present this exact same argument to say I've said this 60 times but new people come and follow the show and people just have the wrong conception of what it means to buy or sell someone they think that when you hear buy it means oh this is a guy who's a rocket boosting into the moon and actually just means they're value in that moment and sell the flip side of that so let's get back to the discussion now Santi aldama is the next name he's been on this board for me for a little while I'm maybe more bullish on aldama then the fantasy community at large so that's what I'm hearing here I I have a guilty admission to you guys I have no idea who other people in fantasy sports are into or not into it's a distinct lack of time  I swear to you all I would love to be able to read slash listen to what other analysts are saying I really would love to have the time for it but I barely have the time to do my own show and all these how many times I come on here I like I really want to do another show this afternoon and then poof I just can't do it because a kid like had to get picked up from school early or their having a weird afternoon where the nanny can't keep them from running into the bedroom or like my mom is babysitting and she can't possibly Chase both those kids at the same time I need time so if someone out there is high on with these guys or low on these guys I promise you I haven't the first clue unless someone tells me I don't know I cannot I wish I had time to go figure out what everybody else was doing I don't  anyway I like Santi aldama the Grizzlies are in full shutdown mode we've now know we've known for a couple weeks save your Tillman's on the trade block that's why they're not playing them very much unless they absolutely have to they want to keep him upright Obama and starters minutes can be a two three-pointer close to one steal one block guy and we just have to pray that his field goal and free throw percent don't turn out to be that bad  that's the big thing with him  last week to two weeks he's shooting about 46%  he's taking like four free throws and he's made them so again like you know thank goodness for that so he hasn't really hurt in those categories I think he's like two for two  oh and free throws over the last two weeks  he had missed a couple right before that but he's hitting his threes his shots are iffy he had a six for nine game and then he went nine for 25 in the next two games and he went seven for 12 in the last one so you just we just have to hope that it levels off the right way but if this was getting starter's minutes which he has now for the last two games and I would argue has been pretty close to them for five out of the last six in my opinion he's worth an ad because he can go top 75 in that kind of  opportunity  I mean last ball game at 18 and 9 with three assists four three-pointers and two blocks  if that didn't need more convincing well  I got no other convincing I can bring to you so apologies on that  Jarred Vanderbilt is the next one on the list and yes a lot of you have asked of the right question both on social media and here in the chat room is well didn't he just get hurt in the last ball game and yes I am trying to manifest okay health for Jarred Vanderbilt because when he's been healthy which is like the last three weeks  he is  very much and every day or  he's very much in every day or over that stretch on the season he hasn't been because he just wasn't moving right for a while but think about this last two weeks he's still only averaging 23 minutes a game over that stretch and he's at 10 points five boards to assist over two Steals on 66% from the field  last one week which also includes the game this last game where he left halfway through and another one where he got ejected like one game into it he's still top 100 over that stretch  his rebounds his steals his field goal percent of all picked up in a big way no I don't think he's gonna shoot 65 67% long term that's just not gonna happen but the rebounds in the Steels are gonna stay high as long as he's healthy and so  the ad here is more about the fact that I do these weekly review shows on Friday and so it's all like I can say oh Jarred Vanderbilt like downgrade him to watch list and then come back and do another show tomorrow I say oh look he's fine you can go pick him up if we get news this afternoon in the Vanderbilt is going to miss a couple weeks then yeah obviously you're not gonna hold on to him because you can't take zeroes and we're talking about you know top 80 top 100 and 20 range guy  if that guy's hurt for a couple weeks and you're fighting for a playoff or whatever that's just not a guy that you could afford to stash but if news comes out later today that he's dated a then that's why I have him on the add list because he's day-to-day 100% on him Andrew Wiggins is at a couple of good games in a row two actually truly good games in a row and they were like three or four before that that were bordering on good and I've said it  I mean how many you guys you guys probably can count better than I can because I can't keep track of what I had for breakfast but all season long I've been saying Wiggins is terrible  but anytime he has a good ball game you gotta pick him up because if it's the sign that he's turning a corner we want to be the the fantasy managers that have him when that happens and it seems like it's happening so you better at him and then John Collins who  you know I I gotta I gotta hit myself I gotta like ding myself a tiny bit on this one by the way while we were talking just got out for another week  it's back to the foot and not the ankle so this is very much trade blocs exact Levine so I mean he's out through the deadline  and as soon as he gets straight he'll play again pretty pretty sure on that one because if you was actually hurt then they would have a lot of trouble getting you know full value for him so I'm sure that behind the scenes there saying oh guys don't worry he's fine he's just sitting out but we got to put out this thing for the for the league so that news just broke all we were talking I wanted to slip that in there back on the topic at hand John Collins so one thing that I missed well when I downgraded columns to more of a schedule stream  was that the way the Jazz had this configured and this is why you got to watch the games and I'm I'm guilty of not being able to watch as enough Jazz games during that like sort of period where Collins had bottomed out and was starting to ramp back up a little bit  I think if I had watched the games super closely  I probably would have noticed quicker that the reason is numbers were coming back for Collins is that they were letting him play the five more on offense on defense whatever so it's improved his field goal percent  has been up over the last two weeks or so  his defensive stats have been up over that strategy and honestly that might be the biggest thing of all but it's it's it's sort of all of the above his rebounding has been better over that stretch on a permanent basis  since he started getting more minutes at Center and so when you looked like and you compare it to the whole season and his rebounding is fine it's not like that's going to be the one that jumps out at you but for the whole season he's at 8 and he was kind of like near seven and change prior to these last two weeks and yes the minutes have been a little bit better but this is a guy who like it's it's been a while since he was a legitimate shot blocking threat we're talking covid year 2019-2020 where he blocked 1.6 shots per game  that's the only season  I think besides his rookie year where he averaged more than one block per contest and this year he was at like point seven  and then all of a sudden now they're like all right by the way you're gonna play some Center and we saw him play a little center with Walker Kessler was hurt and that was kind of when he when Colin's racked up fantasy value at the beginning of the year but all of a sudden now he's had multiple blocks in four of his last six ball games and that's just not something like you got to go back to very early in the season to find the last time that he even had a game with multiple blocks  like you get to go all the way back to December 8th  I think that might have been a game when Kessler was out  he had a few in a row where he had multiple blocks in mid-november that was when Kessler was out so we had four blocks three blocks two blocks as like oh well this dude needs to play center  and now they've rearranged things here so that he is mostly playing Center  and that's a big reason why John Collins has made this kind of mid-season Swoon turn around because he was a quite awful for about  like end of November until the middle of January that's a tough that's like a six seven week stretch where he was outside the top 150 and then Utah started to get all wackadoo wackadoo and playing guys everywhere and they were like Colin's you're the center now and Walker Kessler you're gonna get 18 minutes off the bench and that's why John Collins is playing better  simple fact you get a big guy and you play him at Center they put up better numbers  and I should have spotted that quicker and so that's my Maya culpa because we saw a few better games from him and I was like oh like I could buy this cuz he's been bad for a while but there was a there was a very clear reason behind it that I missed I missed that  here's some holds on the whole board did Dennis Schroder is a whole mostly through the deadline he's been  even during his down periods he still was sort of close enough to Fantasy value and I'm not a big dentist shooter fantasy guy you guys know that about me so for me to put him on the holds board it must mean that I have some Measure of Faith that he's he has a path to Value I think that path is somebody getting out of his way I think Toronto's got a trade someone else a whether that's Bruce Brown I mean he feels like kind of the only guy who's really on the Block but maybe it's Bruce Brown and Gary tread Junior it's hard to say but again we're six days from the deadline now if Toronto doesn't move anybody I think Schroeder ends up a drop I think Trent ends up a very clear drop I think Bruce Brown ends up a drop but if we can thin the herd a little bit there knowing that RJ Barrett in a manual quickly are going to come back and those guys are sort of like the two I can call building blocks for Toronto around Scotty Barnes those two guys are not going anywhere  Max cruises a hold this one I got to give you like a different reason every week which is a real shame because Drew said just started to play better again right before Evan Mobley and Darius Garland came back  for the Cavaliers and now the reason to hold is to just sort of see how the dust settles because remember the beginning of the year that team was fully healthy and Truth is playing 35 minutes a game he was posting some of his best numbers ever so I don't think that it's  like and honestly it might be good for him to have these dudes around that are getting him wide open and he can go back to just doing more of the kind of hustle stats getting more rebounds more steals more blocks that stuff did dry up a little bit when he was asked to do more on offense and that went poorly because this field goal percent went down through the toilet drains so anywho hold Max druze because you gotta wait and see how the Cavs get this whole situation configured hold cam Johnson I said it a few times I'll say it another time hold them through the deadline I think Brooklyn thins to her there and he's a likely to be a nice winner from that  toughest one of the week is holding buddy hield he's been awful this week flat out awful there's no sugar coating it  but as long as he's starting for that Pacers team  I gotta continue to give him a shot  because over the last two weeks where it feels like he's been just about as bad as he could possibly be he's still sitting right on the edge of the top 100  because starter buddy Heald is barely you know he's gonna mostly get 23 minutes or more and I bunch of the time he's gonna get 28 to 3033 and in those games he's top 50  and as frustrating as it is they're just aren't guys out there that can post lines like healed can when he gets actual minutes  Walker Kessler back on the holds board again because people were like he's the most annoying player to roster at Fantasy  I promise you he's not the most annoying player to roster and fantasy yes when you drafted him at 45 you were hoping for better than top 75 he's three rounds down from where he was picked but he still averaging like three damn blocks a game while barely playing heaven forbid he actually sees okay minutes for a day he's a shot blocking Menace you can't get rid of that you know he's because of the shop blocking alone he basically is inside the top 100 and then anything we get beyond that will end up being gravy even if we don't get any gravy even if it's just a dry piece of Turkey  Terry Rozier is a hold and frankly he's kind of a little bit of a by low because Miami's trying to figure out where he fits in their whole scheme Miami's also trying to make sure they don't lose ball games because they want to or they lost a lot of them lately finally snapped their losing skid with a win over the Kings so they just like the heater in a weird spot because they have to figure out how to fit Terry Rozier in but they can't afford to lose game while they're doing it they start a blue that that  cash a that they had  by winning a bunch of games prior to the return of Jimmy Butler and Tyler like the team this is that this is what happens guys play over their heads for a while Superstars come back and then the teams like oh thank goodness we can let down now and then they lose a bunch but then the heat added another player so they're they got a lot going on at the same time  the good news is they'll figure it out because they're the heat they'll be fine the other good news is that Jimmy Butler's been on a pretty nice role since he came back from his last injury and he's pushed himself up to the edge of the second round on a per game basis so  Hank tough everybody and then Ben Simmons is on the holds board we actually just got a report while on air  that Simmons is probable for tonight so I don't know what the deal was with his knee in the last one I still remain somewhat skeptical  that all of this isn't  Ben Simmons dealing with mental stuff I don't I don't have any way to prove it it just sort of feels that way and like these feeling well enough to play then all of a sudden he's just out there but in any event that's our better with him on the court so  hold him  easier to decision to make in Roto it's an easier decision to make if you're punting points but had to head you're gonna have all these get these days off too so  I mean I get it we're always chasing upside and there is some with Simmons especially if the Nets move Dinwiddie or so Neil or Dorian Finney Smith or whatever then it's just like nothing's gonna get in his way and he's got all these shooters around him  yes  but  he's gonna end up being a big headache if you don't want to have to take any zeros on a head-to-head so I think you hold him but I get it in certain formats it'll end up being more trouble than it's worth  you know I left one name off of the I'm scared board and you guys are gonna get to watch me added in real time and that is Malik monk who I think we can probably drop now the Kings have gone in a different direction at that spot it's more Kevin herder these days and if they make us flash at the trade deadline that would also put a dent into whatever monk is doing Carousel is the other name on the drops board as the Cavs get healthy he's just not gonna be able to do enough to counterbalance his bad percentages  and monk actually has a little bit of that too good free throw numbers for monkeys were Levert's kind of a negative in both but Malik's value was tied up in being a distributor Off the Bench and he's just not playing right now  and on the season he's outside the top 150 so I just I don't know how I make the argument that he needs to be held I don't think he does  three ninja three names excuse me or on the watch list and two of them are members of the Orlando Magic Jalen Suggs and Mark helps I remain extraordinarily skeptical that either of these dudes can post full season 12 team 9 cat you know rest of your value a false has been better lately on the shoulders of a Gigantor steals game mixed in there because his other stuff actually hasn't been all that impressive 62% from the field over two weeks is pretty impressive but it's a 1.8 steals that's why he's inside the top 100 over that stretch and if he can't maintain almost two steals per game you know 11 points and three and a half assists is just not enough to get it done  now with Suggs it's a similar phenomenon  I'm I argue I have more faith in Suggs because he'll go shoot a three-pointer but I don't have a ton of faith in either of them  they're both trying to get me to Adam because they've been good for oh I don't know maybe the last week or so but even over that stretch you're like well  do I really want to go down this path  and for false he's at 2.3 steals a game over that stretch and 61% shooting he can stay near 50% from the field because he doesn't take any three balls but 2.3 steals is not going to stick and so again if you're talking about a guy who's like a 113 and 3 and a half with one and a half steals I mean that's borderline at best at best  so yeah he's warm right now and maybe he's getting his legs underneath him it's possible that this is like you're gonna finally get a little surge out of Markle but I don't think you'd be missing all that much even if you don't do this thing here  and Orlando is dealing with such a log Jam at every position all the time that  the chance of this thing really popping loose for faults or Suggs is not all that great  this dream while warm board we've added a few new names to it those names are Jalen green and cam Thomas I don't know why cam Thomas was on this thing before these are players who go on vicious heaters and look like they could beat the world and be rest of Seasons studs but we must remember we must remember who they truly are and where the numbers will end up and just quickly here lightning round these names the ones you know already Bobbi Port is not read col Anthony Danny Jordan Clarkson Ave by the way is maybe a little bit of this Jordan Clarkson RJ Barrett Kevin herder whose so streaky Jeremy Sohan has been added to this board he's been on a nice little run lately but I think we know that at some point that's going to level off Jalen green and cam Thomas are the new additions Jalen green is on a heater for the ages right now the Rockets might move him by the way which could actually potentially be good for green if he ends up on a team that just gives them sort of unfettered Chuck Chuck Chuck or maybe it's bad because that's kind of the story  with his career so far although I would argue Camp Thomas is a little bit more upside because he's not a terrible free throw shooter Jalen green has been bad both percentages it is career to this point where at least with Thomas you're going to get a trash field goal percent but if you get to the foul line he'll be you know 80 plus there so that would actually be a positive but either way  like you we've seen the numbers we've watched them all year  there's nothing magical that happened in the last week even though we want to delude ourselves into thinking that something magical happened Camp Thomas is taking 17 shots a night this season and he's outside the top one 70  because all he does is score you cannot be a one trick pony in the NBA  and Jaylen green he's caught cam Thomas Thanks this last Mega burst and by the way shout out to Jalen green for you getting his free throw percent over 80 so that is no longer a big negative but he shooting 41% from the field even with this insane heater going on he was under 40 I think prior to that or he was very close to 40 neither one of these guys get steals or blocks Jalen green gets a few more rebounds he's just a slightly Ranger player than Thomas both of them basically just score a lot and at some point that reality will come back  and so if you can stream these guys while warm or sell High  you do it  I don't know if you guys heard that noise that was my sinus  that was not something scraping the microphone that was like one part of my sinus scraping against another part  I'm unwell  maybe nobody could hear that noise it's possible that I could only hear it because it like occurred inside my head but it felt Audible  the injury replacement board is discussing right now I'm gonna have to make it bigger on the YouTube screen you guys aren't going to be able to see the names you might still not be able to see them but these are all the names will go through them quickly these are the guys you play and then who you play them for Bruce Brown for RJ Barrett Gary Trent Jr for Emmanuel quickly Dennis Schroder could also kind of fall into that department  I owed assume who's been crushing because aquiline and Patrick Williams or out Eric Gordon who I can't stand so even though he's an injury replacement for Grayson Allen I'm probably still not using him jaxson Hayes for Anthony Davis although I expect 80 back for the Knicks game which is coming up is that Saturday or Sunday on that next game we'll look it up  screw it will do it live it's the Saturday night ABC evening game yeah Saturday evening um I would expect add and Brian back for that ball game but if LeBron happens to miss another really hot tomorrow has been the winner there  Trey Murphy's been doing better lately with herb missing a couple of games and by the way you could flip that one too herb would be the guy of Trey Murphy was out  Josh Hart for Julius Randle  Russell's a Chua for Randall and Anna Nobi  Paul Reed and Kelly oubre Jr for Joelle embiid  Al Horford I leave him on this board forever because any Boston started being out gets him a run which at this point is like  every other game almost Nick Richards still filling in for Mark Wills PJ Washington with lamelo and Gordon Hayward out he's been getting enough shots to be a nice stream Malcolm Brogden your streaming with shade and sharp out and The Grizzlies I did in tears here oh did I skip talking about Scottie Pippen Jr I did I skipped talking about Scotty Pippen Jr we'll go back to that one in just a second Vince Williams and then Luke Kennard were the guys initially when Bane and smart went down and jaw then Kennard went down and John conchar took his place when I said I think on this show last week was that the Grizzlies are like a Russian nesting doll of Phil injury guys and then of course Tim Hardaway Jr is your Kyrie or Luka replacement though it sounds like Lucas good to go and Kyrie is questionable so it's possible both of those guys are in in which case then you make your adjustment so let me go back three pages here two pages here to Scotty Pippen Jr who  I don't think I can bring myself to stream in Roto he actually does make sense as a fill-in stream on the head-to-head side but the minutes are not guaranteed and so that also then means that the production is not guaranteed  that's I think all I really wanted to say on Scotty Pippen Jr I just it feels like with some of these guys reality is going to sort of set in and  that's one of those ones where we really just don't know if it can stick  and quickly here because we do have the trade deadline approaching this is a quick reshoot  of the possible stashes leading up to the trade deadline I'm gonna go through the chat room don't worry people you guys are you guys are getting  crazy over that away  stash list onyeka okongwu because we hear the Hawks are I think they were described this morning as the most active of any team leading up to the deadline Iota soon move if the Bulls move a couple of guys Marvin Bagley if Daniel Gafford gets moved Dennis Smith Jr if Spencer Dinwiddie and or some other Wings on the Nets get moved that's a possibility there presuming of course that Ben Simmons ends up heard again  DeAndre Hunter we're back in Atlanta on this one let's say that deje Murray gets moved and then maybe all so deep Bay could be on the move  be loud cool to believe this one I you guys have heard me talk about this one frequently I I do think that he needs more than tyus Jones out of the way I think if Kyle kuzma move actually might even help him more because we got to get him shots Jabari Walker most likely needs Jeremy Grant out of the way Gary Trent Jr most likely needs Bruce Brown  honestly I don't know that there's a path for Gary Trent it would have to be Bruce Brown and Schroeder probably getting shuffled if Trent is going to make an impact and then as her Thompson in Detroit who might have a opportunity to do something now Isaiah Stewart has hurt but we all know that Monty Williams would prefer to play Kevin Knox I just  and yeah that's that's the possible stash board we'll do a show I think  I would love to do one over the weekend where we rehash those stash names and kind of the upside the downside and just make sure that I've got them all covered because there's probably one or two guys that I'm forgetting to flip on that board but before we wrap things up here on our weekend review show you guys been very busy in the chat room and I want to kind of do what I've been doing towards the end of the show's during the week which is to go through and just see if there were any names that you guys brought up that I missed early in the show if you guys recall I got my attention got yanked away from me for a second there were three posts in the chat room claiming that they were going to expose me as an alt-right plant which is  extremely funny  I'm a little worried I don't know like it felt directed but I have to assume that this was  flukey  okay then um  let's see a question about Vanderbilt hopefully I went into enough detail on that one question is about Paul Reed  yeah that's reasonable so I think I did a little bit of a Paul Reed rant on yesterday's show and my rant was the only reason you wouldn't want Paul Reed on your team right now is if the only category you're trying to win his points  because he's going to rebound he actually can pass a little bit and he gets Steals and blocks on a good field goal percent without killing you at the free throw line  this is a guy who has five or six category appeal  it just so happens that the one that everybody pays the closest attention to is the one he doesn't he's not gonna score very much  he played 28 minutes yesterday that's all we can ask for that's that's well beyond my wildest dreams for Paul Reed he plays 28 minutes a game with Joel embiid out and he's a top 75 fantasy guy  I don't know that he's gonna get 28 minutes every night but it was great that he did and so I'm very much into him and nothing I saw yesterday move me off of that  a lot of good discussion here going on more questions on Paul Reed do you think Brandon put gemski is a stash  no I don't  I can't think of a situation where the Warriors move the right guys to clear out a path for pajam ski like if they moved Andrew Wiggins who we've heard to someone that they be open to moving they're gonna bring someone in to take that job and then some  and right now but Jem ski is Off the Bench and he's not doing enough behind the new looks starters so no I it'd be a weird path to get him like back into a feature role it would mean that the Warriors are tearing it down and I really don't think they're going to do that  any update on D Anthony Melton know we were supposed to get one yesterday I thought but you know boot womp womp nothing there which sucks because I did grab him in a in a league assuming we'd get some kind of information in the last two days and we didn't  I'm a Grizzlies fan how do you know Tillman's on the trade block oh it's been out there now Bobby marks talked about it I think a week ago and it's been actually circulating this morning I saw some more stuff I can't remember who tweeted it because I was frantically trying to get everything ready for these shows and whatnot and I did an appearance over with with my buddy Gil Alexander on Vincent but I saw it flash by my timeline as well he's a restricted free agent I believe and I don't know that they really want to pay him so it makes a lot of sense for Tillman to to get cooking there is Tillman a good ad no I don't think so I don't think so  um let's see what do we got here should I drop Josh giddey for Io in a 10 team her  yeah I mean I don't know they like giddy has not been a four we're talking about nine category League Josh Gettys number one 6 6 9 he's not really good enough to  to be a spot holder on a 10 team or even a 12 team or  so I'm okay with turning his spot into a streamer  much as it may hurt by the way  uh Daniel of a man crush on Max druce yeah I do have a little bit of a man crush on him and the problem is that he keeps getting waylaid by these problematic situations  the good news is he still a nine cat startable guys number one 14 on the year while shooting 40% if that even gets up to 41% he's inside the top 100  and as you guys may recall he did put up really nice numbers when the team was healthy  so I'm not really worried about the whole like who's there and who's not what I'm more worried about is how it keeps shuffling every time they shuffled the deck it gets confusing for everybody again but they want him playing gigantic minutes I believe he's also kind of tired he has been worse after that good start but every time I watch he's out there playing 30 damn minutes of ball game and he still had five boards and four assists at a steal and half a block on the year that stuff is maintained he just hadn't hit a shot and like two months and then he had like a three game stretch we started to make buckets again and then they brought everybody back and nobody knows what the hell they're role is so that's why I get it if you guys want to move on you know whatever but when he's healthy and he's playing 33 minutes  he's doing enough  he may not be healthy that could be another problem  hey cam Thomas isn't that bad for field goal percent  ah I mean  over the last like three weeks that's true  but on the season he's at 45 and you like 45 doesn't sound that bad 45 is pretty brutal when you're taking 20 shots a game we have to remember about volume here  Dante even so I think is a 45 but he was only taking like eight or nine ten shots a game or whatever it was so a lot of it is just like weighted it's a weighted impact thing  he is a small positive for free throw percentage we're talking about cam Thomas right now he's a small positive in three-pointers he's a big positive and scoring but he's negative and rebounds no matter what position you put him out he's a sis from a guard position negative steals negative and blocks negative field goal percent  and that's why he's ranked one 70 despite being a furious chukar  but at the same time he's on a heater so ride it or sell it get something out of it do do do do do do do  Mario 2 all right let's wrap this thing up I got a lot of things I want to cover  and I'm gonna say it again because I keep saying I'm gonna do it  try to get another show it may not be this afternoon it might be tomorrow but we're gonna get some extra shows going here especially leading up to the deadline because this is a time when we got more stuff to cover oh are you at all is a good question are you at all worried that that Paul Reed didn't finish the game I don't actually care when he plays  if he gives me 25 to 29 minutes I'll give a crap when they come so I'm not super worried about it they'll  mix and match and whatever  and however he gets there I'm okay with  but he started and that's a big deal it's hard to play less than like 22 minutes when you're starting do I prefer Paul Reed Andrew Wiggins or Josh Hart at the moment  hmm  it's probably heart  oh Randall could be back before embiid  but it's probably heart  I think I go hard over read over again because I still I'm not fully sold that Andrew Wiggins is just like he's fine again all right thanks everybody for
