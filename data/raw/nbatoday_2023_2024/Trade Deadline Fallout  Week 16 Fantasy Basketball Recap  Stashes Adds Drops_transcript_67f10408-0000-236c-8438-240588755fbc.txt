welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast you may not believe it  but I actually still have my voice today so sort of  it's not at Full Tilt but it's close enough at this point I'll take it  yesterday was a  an amazing day a bit of a harrowing day but an amazing one yesterday we had our five-hour trade deadline live show and then personally I drove out and did two college basketball play by play games back to back with about a five-hour break in between so all told I did about nine and a half hours of broadcasting yes today and  by the end of the night I felt like I was going to speak in dust was just gonna come flying out of my mouth it didn't survived I'm okay but it is part of why I wanted to show to be a little bit later I just whatever hours my voice could get today where critical as far as yesterday goes I'm just like I'm still over the moon thank you thank you thank you to all of you from the bottom of my heart for tuning in for liking the video before or during the broadcast there were two a 1,242 likes on the video Far and Away the most we've ever had  there were over 18,000 views on the video Far and Away the most we've ever had I think the previous high was 13,000 the trade deadline showed two years ago and just absolutely obliterated that almost by 50%  I mean there's there's like almost nothing close you know there was a  an episode there was a video that the great Alan stroke he uploaded of Steels and busts in October of 2021 and that one like hit the algorithm with all the fattiest fat juice that you could possibly find and that got up to 12,000 so 18 is crazy we had over 2,000 people watching live at one point  again I just I don't like I cannot express to you guys how excited I was to see all that happened in real time just to be a part of it and then does a fun show you know I know the trade deadline didn't have the big names moving but we had some cool stuff that happened and we got to break it down and I tried to do some you know little mini Graphics getting the tweets up on the board as fast as humanly possible so as you guys can know what I was talking about we'll do a better job of some of that stuff next year on Dre has already reached out to say that he can help with keeping the live board up to date so that would be one thing that I'm not trying to do while talking and then obviously next year we'll have Brew back in the mix who's in recovery from surgery on his shoulder neck arm forth thoracic outlet but anyway  what a blast thank you all  today it's a week in review show which is  complicated today because the trade deadline happened yesterday and we mostly won't see the results of that until tomorrow or Sunday so there's a very real chance that I convinced my family to let me do a show on Sunday  just to talk about what happened tonight and Saturday because you might get a couple of guys that suit up for their new teams today like the trades that went down on Wednesday you probably see those those guys suit up if their teams are playing today the trades from yesterday deadline day probably you won't see those players until tomorrow  and obviously I'll be tweeting about it rampantly at Dan best burst d a n b e s b r i s some of you are actually watching on Twitter right now so make sure you hit the follow button if you're doing that if you're watching on YouTube like rate subscribe all that good stuff and if you're listening after the fact or watching after the fact subscribe rate like all that good stuff whatever you can do to continue to helping us grow that is all so a really big deal uh but I just like I don't want to make you guys wait all the way until Monday to get the results of trade stuff if you're not following on Twitter if you're not the social media type and you're the Pod type I'd like to try to get that to you sooner if at all possible so we'll see if that all adds up this is of course fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation there's the other side of this for me again on the personal side as we start to dive into the stuff we're talking about today which is how do I get my energy level is high as yesterday if we're back to you know between 50 and 150 people watching live and you know like a thousand to 1500 people that take in the show like  yeah I'll admit it's not as easy there's like one 20th the audience  anyway let's get let's do some fun it's week 16 in review we're going to cover stuff that happened over the last few days this was as I wrote here on the screen a hard one so I added a new category because it's a chaos week that'll come up you'll see it as we work our way through make sure to follow me on Twitter at Danvers follow ethos fantasy BK wish we had picked an easier one but that's an awesome Twitter news feed like rate subscribe blah blah blah let's go ads of the week Andre Drummond and I put that out on Twitter in the middle of the night I scheduled a tweet for that one because I basically was going to sleep at like 12:30 in the morning I thought you know what this would be better if I schedule it for a few hours from now and people on some Coast are awake  why a bunch of people said why on Earth  would you put on Andre Drummond on this list after just a day and a half ago you said I don't expect Andre Drummond to keep his starting job and for the Bulls to go big starting five like they did against the Wolves well guess what egg on my face because Drummond didn't start the game but did play 30 one minutes against the hapless zombie Grizzlies  it doesn't mean he's going to get this kind of run every single day no it does not mean that it 21 and 13 he shot 10 of 11 from the field again it's just it's not gonna be that good and he missed two of his three free throws which is always going to be a problem for drumming  but it does seem like and maybe some of that it's because Patrick Williams is out right now so perhaps that's a thing that shifts this back in another Direction because he gives them sort of a more ranging type as a right now I owe to soon move Alex Caruso Kobe white Caruso is awesome defensively but they are not a big back court when those three guys are all playing at the same time the miter Rosen I guess then the power forward in that lineup also not a particularly big dude so they're lacking in size when they're running that small  they've swung the pendulum all the way over to the opposite polar extreme they've gone from a very small lineup to a massive one with vouch and Drummond rolling side by side  this has been kind of interesting for vooch because for whatever reason it seems like he's much more willing to get a chucken at the four as a supposed to the five he's taking a bunch of shots here in this ball game and yeah you know some of it has to do with who's in and who's out but still interesting to see him lead the team in field goal attempts in that last ball game he also led the team in plus minus  he still hovering in the 40s 405 on a per game basis which mind you is still about 15 slots ahead of where he was drafted and by totals my fine Feathered Friends he's number 35 so he's  blitzing his ADP again you know he's not a first rounder by totals he's not a second round or on a per game basis  but he's a win I don't know why people still clowning on him like he's not a win  he's a two-round win on the per game side he's at 3 round win on the total side talking about voucher as far as Drummond goes there's so much Nuance to this that I can't express on social media and why I need these podcasts to get into the weeds a little bit more  if Patrick Williams comes back and knocks Drummond off of this increased  playing time  then we move on  but the reason that he's on the ads board right now is because for two reasons number one we don't know that that's going to be true Patrick Williams could come back and it could have no impact on drum and it could ruin Iota Sumo instead  so we don't know is the first one we don't know what's gonna happen when Patrick Williams comes back whose the big loser there because he'll play  and two we don't want to be behind the curve on this one because Andre Drummond in starters level minutes is an absolute Goliath  he's going to be weighed down considerably by his free throw percent which is dog due  but if this dude's playing 30 minutes I mean like we have lots of seasons to look back at to say oh what is under a drum and do if he gets mid-20s or higher in minutes he's a walking Double-Double up with the rebounds generally the easier part of that equation for him  you don't have to go all that far back you know he was a backup in Philly a couple years ago he's been a backup in Chicago as a backup in Philly he averaged nine rebounds a game in 18 minutes  he spent half of that season with Brooklyn also averaged 10 rebounds a game in 22 minutes  he was back up for the Lakers  the year before that it was a was that a buyout or a trade I don't remember averaged a double-double in 24 minutes  13 and a half rebounds in Cleveland earlier that  right here or later that matter my brain fried anyway we only need about 24 minutes at a Drummond for him to post a double-double and to be able to probably get close to us steel and a block per ball game  we're always going to be staring down that damn free throw percent and just praying that it's at like 55 to 60 and he doesn't take more than three of them but you know it happens  and you got the field goal percent is  fine which it usually is it usually is okay yeah that one year mixed in there where he couldn't shoot the ball those with the Cavaliers and 2020 and it was a half a season mostly he's you know mid 50s so punt free throw at this is an absolute no-brainer but I think even without that  you got to be in front of this one to see how it plays out because if suddenly the Bulls are just like you know what screw it we're going jumbo package the rest of the year and Drummond's playing 2627 minutes  then he's dominating fantasy reality whatever  he doesn't really have a year that you could just say you could point out and say oh here's a season he played 27 minutes the closest would be somewhere between that Lakers and calves split 2020 to 2021  that was the planned shortened season  he was at 25 minutes with the Lakers he was a 29 with the Cavs played about the same number of games with each so in about 27 minutes a game and again you know we may be overextending ourselves a tiny bit here he averaged about 14 points and a dozen rebounds  you don't think that plays that plays  next name on the ads board is Buddy hield and that's a direct result of the trade deadlines some of this stuff is trade deadlines related in some of it isn't Drummond is not buddy hield is  could he turn into a pumpkin when Joel embiid comes back that's a distinct possibility but look Sixers also moved Pat Beverley they brought in campaign who seems likely to play less than Beverly Beverly is a better basketball player than Cameron Payne is  yeah the Anthony Melton is due back at some point here but the Sixers need some spacing and I expect I look they went out and they got this guy this is a dude they were aiming for they wanted to get buddy hield he's gonna play  he's gonna play he's gonna shoot  and when he plays in shoots he's fantasy asset so make sure he's on every roster as far as the eye can see because look I'm beat is probably not come back any sooner than it at least six weeks from now probably more like eight so you're kind of talking about heeled like he's basically just a rest of season guy  do I need to go into that much detail here do people think he's gonna get less than like 26 207 minutes  I don't  it's like they went and got him I'm gonna jump around in this list a little bit these lists that I write up if you're watching the video is just the order that I look at teams as I'm scanning the NBA to make sure that I get all the names possible into these shows Marvin Bagley is the next one also trade deadlines related he is injured right now dealing with a low back thing which could be a game could be too could be five we don't actually really know but when he comes back I expect Bagley to be the starting center on that Wizards team  and while I admit I love the Marvin bagley's Fantasy game it requires a lot for him to actually get to a playable number meaning how many minutes is he have to play to be fantasy relevant he basically needs full starters minutes on impeded  unimpeded  and there aren't that many spots like they're really isn't a time in his career that he's had full starters minutes unimpeded even back in Sacramento when he was young and he was this fresh new thing that they took and of possible Superstars all around him whoopsies even then you know some days it was 30 minutes and some days it was 20 it's got to be 30  every day for Bagley did fantasy value because he's a bad foul shooter his field goal percent is a bit unpredictable it's been very good this year but throughout his career it's kind of bounced between like 46 and 53 and it's hard to honestly it's hard to know which iteration you're gonna get  the rebounds are fine you know starters slightly sub starters minute so you can still get you like seven of them but the seals and blocks generally not all that great they were okay right at the very beginning of his career it's weird to say that he's kind of in the middle of it now but you're talking about one combining  in sub starters minute and that's why there needs to be more because this is a guy who in you know 20 some Oddish minutes a game what's he at this year right now Bagley and 20 minutes a game he's outside the top two 50 so he isn't even in the vicinity of fantasy value  and that's why we're talking he really needs like a 60% bump over what he's doing right now to hit fantasy you he's got to go from 20 to like 30 to  it's a big big leap because then presumably the field goal percent will be a notable positive now is it seven and a half field goal attempts per game right now adding another 60% to that which I might make sure I'm doing this right is about another four shots per game so seven and a half goes like 11 and a half or 12  the free throws a bigger negative that's true but points goes from 11 to 17 rebounds goes from five and a half to like eight eight plus  assist doesn't change all that much  one to maybe one and a half steals goes from point three to point five blocks from 0.5 to 0.7 these things matter they don't seem like a lot but those matter on the sort of small counting stats so now you're talking about somebody who's at 17 and 9 with 1.2 defensive stats and his helpful and field goal percent so he's got to get all the way to full kind of maxed out starters minutes which even when he's healthy might not happen  but I don't want to be behind on this one what's the possibility that it doesn't happen possibility that it doesn't happen is that Rashawn Holmes gets 20 minutes and that keeps badly stuck at 27 or 28 which might look good he'll have some 20 and 10 games mixed in there but the awful percentages and the you know 12 and 6 games Blended in with poor defensive stats that will sag that down you got to remember law of averages law of averages on Marvin Bagley  if it's a zubats is all on the ads board I think he's generally been reacted we got dropped in a lot of spots because his timeline on the calf thing was super nebulous and then he just showed back up again and now let's talk about the Grizzlies  I jumped over the Grizzlies because they're a super complicated team right now and our our buddy David Williams who had to miss the trade deadline show yesterday because he has flu B is he's in recovery now and he wants to talk in Chrisley sorry that's fair let's talk Grizzly's  so Memphis yesterday  you know I think this this loss to Chicago at home for the Grizzlies was a decent example  of what to expect from Memphis going forward meaning Vince Williams started played 37 minutes he is a must play in every format a JJJ until he gets shut down started took 22 shots must play in every format  and beyond that there's some question marks  let's start with Santi aldama he played 37 minutes yesterday if he gets 13 shots a game he's very much a start  provided he doesn't you know have like 42.65 splits like earlier this year and it's much more like 4575 so more like last year you know mid to high 40s from the field mid-70s from the free throw line you can stomach those size negatives in the percentages you cannot stomach 42 and 60 something if that's where the percentage is end up I'll download will be a drop  I want to be a perfectly clear  I remained bullish on him though this season I don't think he's gonna be a factor as the Grizzlies get healthy and following years but right now especially with JJ still kind of lingering out there as a shutdown risk and he will at some point  I don't think I'll dhamma is old enough or skilled enough to be part of the shutdown Brigade he might get some games off here and there he's feeling sore in any capacity and that'll be the case for pretty much anybody on the team but if he's upright healthy not in foul trouble and not playing horrendously on a given night he should see starters minutes as well  Jacob Gilyard is a no for me trade Jameson is a no for me John conchar is a no for me unless a couple other guys end up missing some time he just doesn't really want to shoot so that gets us down to two names on the board that I haven't talked about yet  those players are GG Jackson and Scotty Pippen Jr  and I'll admit I think the verdict is actually still out on both of these guys for nine cat  Scotty Pippen Jr has a better Nine cat game then GG Jackson Morris assists more defensive stats  I would venture to guess on a night tonight basis slightly less rough percentages because he's less of a ball chukar been Juniors at 50 and 70 one on the percentages right now so the field goal percent actually is helping a tiny bit for free throw not so much GG Jackson is at 43 and 71 so hurting you in both but Jackson is also seemingly more likely to have the higher usage the rest of the way so we kind of have to try to balance these two things in our minds can Gigi do enough in the fire in a way  department to overcome the fact that yeah I'm sure you know yesterday he had good percentages 50 and 5 for 6 at the free throw line  great  that's a one game sample size  over the season so far and again this can change because he's young and Technology he's played all that much the 4371 probably a better indicator of what to expect at least the rest of this year  whereas with pit in the 50 and 71 negative in one very small positive in the other  has made him much closer to a fantasy play  it shouldn't be surprising that Scotty Pippen Jr is number one 70 in nine cat in 22 minutes and Gigi Jackson in the same number of minutes is outside the top 200 which doesn't separate them by all that much players in that Ranger are pretty close in ranking but here's the thing Pippen Jr gets assists he gets steals  not that many threes but some Gigi Jackson is going to be more scoring more threes  I think he's a little bit sort of unseasonably high and blocks that feels flukey so fewer defensive stats  I'm spending a lot of time on this I know  the point I want to make is  I think I would prefer if I'm talking about Roto games cap I don't think I'm playing either of them  Head to Head  GG Jackson is probably the safer play just because he's gonna go get you a bunch of counting sets every day  Pippin's minutes have been a little bit more in flux lately  if you're looking for the better Roto Guy the one that's less likely to hurt you on any given day that's piping  if you're looking for the can I catch lightning in a bottle guy which tends to play up a little bit on head to head you know if you're punting a particular percentages that plays up all so on the head-to-head side that's GG Jackson so I don't think there's a correct answer for everyone between these two guys you guys know me I'm more of a nine cat guy meaning I don't punt all that off and unless I have to I play a lot of as well I play both so for me I prefer Scottie Pippen Junior in nine cat points leagues GG Jackson is a must add guy Gotta Throw That caveat in at the end because who cares if he's chucking and missing because he's out there getting a ton of usage that just plays in points leaks  those are the ads of the week

please take a second if you're liking what we're doing here to like rate and subscribe that's the big button subscribe no matter how you're taking in our various podcasts and contents  follows and subscriptions that is the way that we push this boat out into the ocean but I need you guys to actually be the ones clicking the button to do it  holds some Big Font for you guys I can go big on the font when there aren't that many names cam Johnson is a hole  luckily he's been playing better prior to the injury so that I think made this one a little bit simpler  week and a half ago I would have had to beg you guys to hold cam Johnson I don't think we need to do that right now the Nets got thinner at the deadline they brought in dead his shrouded her and that young but they sent out Roi so Neil they sent out Spencer Dinwiddie I don't think Ben Simmons is Gonna Last the rest of the year but even if he does I actually don't think that that hurts cam Johnson at all in fact it may even get him more open looks his aggression has been better since he started shooting the ball well again three four games back hopefully he doesn't have to miss much more time but look if you go for the full season run right now he's ranked right next to Darius Garland and ain't nobody asking about starting him night tonight so leave me alone on the cam Johnson front  leave me alone he'll be fine  hold and start frankly  Terry Rozier is a hold I'm not sure he needed to be on here either this is more for posterity starting to put up some numbers in Miami they're not outstanding but you know they'll get it done and this one's this one's a weird one I threw Sadiq Bay on this list because not because I think he's good but because I think he's warming up  he's been awful like career worst in  corner three point percentage where he was like pretty good actually prior to this season  and yeah it's possible that he's just terrible from the corner of the whole year guys have up years and down years but it seems like he's been shooting the ball better last couple of games he's got some confidence back  and that would actually go a long way towards sort of fending off DeAndre Hunter and and or book number Donovan honestly because of City Base suddenly goes on a heater he'll just get more playing time  so I don't know that he's gonna be a hold the rest of the season but if he's about to go on a warm run uh that buys him a little bit of time even as the Hawks get healthy so this one's a more of a temporary Play here's the I'm scared board Karis Levert I believe he's a drop Max druce I think he's finally a drop  I'm getting I'm beyond irritated with the field goal percent I know he gets you rebounds and he gets the nessus and he gets some steals get some blocks in the minutes have been pretty good  but he just can't consistently hit shots  I never thought he was gonna get up to 50% but I thought we could get to like 42 43  and it just doesn't seem like it's in the cars I know he's number one 11 so technically he should be a star but he said 40 and a half percent from the field and honestly it just hurts too much  feel gold or the free throw percent is weirdly low all so  I keep looking at him like surely these are going to improve and then they just have it I mean this is a guy who shot 88% of the foul line last year 79 the year before that so maybe that was the maybe the 88 was the outlier but 78 feels low and 40 and a half from the field feels low and frankly 34 from 3-point land feels low he's a 35 last year and 41 the year before that  some of that's that Miami Magic  I just know the second that I put him on this board as someone that I'm probably dropping he's gonna start cooking for a few weeks again but you know it is what it is I gotta go with the data that's in front of me Jalen Suggs Markle fault someone was asking me why I'm not higher on these guys it's the inconsistency more than anything Suggs has been pretty decent the last few weeks  or felt like it and even despite that he's what like  150 range two steals per ball game because he's shooting 38% from the field in 63 at the free throw line and then false who's actually been a little bit better over that run he's at 53% from the field and one point seven steals per game these guys are both basically just steals streamers the reason Falls is ranked higher is because he hasn't been that brutally horrible in the percentages but we're talking about guy averaging nine and a half points three and a half assists and then just a bunch of steals  and that's why I'm not higher it's sort of an unsustainable model that frankly if you extrapolated that fantasy line over an entire year he wouldn't be ranked as high as he is right now it's sort of a it's kind of like the small sample size board effect as opposed to like is he doing something over a small sample size know it's what everybody else is doing and now that's how he ends up ranking as high as he is  I'm putting Ben Simmons on this list because honestly I just don't want to deal with him  I don't want to deal with him head to head size he's gonna get a lot of days off this is gonna be a very slow molasses speed ramp up for his minutes per game I don't know when he's gonna get to 26 27 minutes and even then he wasn't inside the top 100 earlier this year  Rodeo if you really want to hold on you can treat him like a injured player and just leave them on your bench for the next two to three weeks see if his minutes Trend up far enough  I I throw back moment here I don't know if you guys remember the first years of this podcast with my buddy Vince Miracle where we had a sound effect  for someone else's headache we stamped him we stamped him for the s e h someone else's headache  Ben Simmons right now is an s e h  stamp ya  I don't want to deal with it and then boy zdanowicz this is and I'm nervous play right now the Knicks are luckily so thin at the moment that he'll probably play and shoot a bunch for the next couple of weeks but as OG and obese comes back from his elbow surgery and then when Julius Randle comes back the job is just going to slowly shrink the walls are gonna kind of come in on bogdanovich in similarly they're probably gonna come in on Josh Hart they're probably gonna come in on Donte divincenzo there are four guys for the Knicks that weren't there in their last ball game that are just gonna slowly trickle in like you get boy on and Berks coming in and then you know a couple weeks down the line You'll have OG come back they said reevaluated in three weeks and then a week or two after that you'll have Randall back and so yeah you can ride guys for whatever link of time  a week here a week there sort of do it until you do it and yeah maybe I'm done with gives you another couple of weeks here so this is not a drop this is an I'm nervous this is a lookahead kind of thing and I probably should know tape that what it's a little more clear so boy on not a drop yet Levert is a drop stress a drop Simmons a headache  Suggs droppable faults I believe droppable and that I maybe gave a little bit more context to that board  your watch list we already talked about Scotty Pippin Junior the other three names on my watch list or Josh green and Dallas I think he's just sort of playing over his head right now so I don't think I'm adding him Corey kispert in Washington who is just chucking away right now oh I don't know if the Wizards pull the plug on anybody like maybe kuzma get some days off  I'd love for them to just take Jordan Poole out of the lineup altogether they didn't trade tyus Jones  I was already to make Corey kisper to trade deadline add cuz I thought for sure when Gafford got moved that meant that tyus was right behind him and it just you know you needed to open up some more stuff but keep an eye on kisper suddenly he's out there and he's just taking a whole bunch of shots and if that somehow sticks that would be a pretty good 3-point scoring type but I think we need to see it for at least a few more games and then Gordon Hayward with a parenthetical remark and the parenthetical remark for those that are listening and not watching is the word black  I don't like Gordon Hayward  he's still multiple weeks away  but we'll put on the watch list just in case there's like a 2% chance that he ends up as a 12 team or  that's not 0 though  click update on the stream while warm guys all so I you know what I meant to add something so you guys can watch me do it I want to call these guys the stream while warm or sell while hot group  so some of these guys get hot  some of them get real hot and then you could cash them in  uh I'll try to  distinguish between the two if possible Bobby Portis he's a stream while warm No One's Gonna Buy on him nazri same avdija um it might be able to sell him when he gets hot Clarkson's definitely a cell wall hot guy because remember like a week and a half ago Jordan Clarkson was averaging like 30 points a game for a few days and suddenly everybody was like oh this is gonna last a whole year and then  it didn't  RJ Barrett same general thing someone in my Twitter mentions was like the disrespect I'm like what what do you mean the disrespect he's just super streaky and he's not going to magically become a 55% shooter  he's gonna run hot and he's gonna run cold  and he's hot these days so do it man see what you can get think of the what is it been about a month since he got traded little less than that it's averaging like 236 and 4 over that stretch on 54% shooting  and he's barely inside the top 100 because he's a free-throw tank turnovers are high Steals and blocks are not all that outstanding they're okay  that's the thing if you can find a punt free-throw team  or if you're on a punt free throw team obviously you could stomach a little bit better if you're a punt both percentages team you can stomach in a lot better but just realize he's not just gonna shoot 54% the rest of the year  it's one of the clearest sell highs  so go get something for him  because there are people out there that are yelling at me that I'm disrespecting him by saying to sell when he's hot which I don't understand how that's disrespect this is just a very streaky dude we've known this for years  it's not just respectful to just say what it is but when he gets super hot like this  it lasts long enough sometimes that people were like maybe this is the moment even though we're like I decade into it not being the moment Kevin herder I don't think you're going to be able to sell on him so probably just ride it out same story for Malik monk Jeremy Sohan he'll probably get hot again at some point in the next two months like he was for a couple weeks and you're gonna get people saying the same thing and look it doesn't I don't want I don't want you guys listening to think that I'm like calling you a name for believing in it when you see it it's just that these things they happen in I'll rotation a grand dance guys get hot  for long enough sometimes like they hit this this this this this needle tip point where some people start to go hmm maybe it's real this time and that's the moment when you can sell  Jalen green  same thing although with Freddie Van Vliet out maybe maybe you ride it but man if the percentages come back off again you get crushed and same story for Camp Thomas he got so hot he got so hot the people were just like yes this is it he's gonna be top 40 forever and then he started shooting 22% on massive volume and we're like oh no it's not so these guys get hot see what you can get there's sort of like an honorable mention to Jonathan comingo on this list but I also think that he's probably he's good enough to maintain a nine cats start so he's a play all the time but more of a more of a traditional sell high is supposed to like this sell High streamer group that I felt like I needed to separate from the pack injury Replacements this is a fast one because we just get to tell you who the names are and who they're replacing to soon move I still think is worth playing even though we've got this Andre Drummond thing going on that's with Pat Patrick Williams and and Zach LaVine out for the year Patrick Williams not out for the year exact leaven out for the year Eric Gordon I loathe streaming him but he did have a good ball game yesterday he's with Devin Booker out Josh Hart for ogn and Obi precious Ochoa for Julius Randle and now Isaiah hartenstein miles Deuce McBride for Jalen Brunson Paul Reed and Kelly oubre Jr for Joel embiid although we'll see what happens there with Buddy Heald and  D Anthony Melton coming back what that does to a brave  Al Horford  any boss in starter although I mentioned it on a show two days back Horford is actually inside the top 90 on the year mostly because he's had all of these fill in games  but that's actually good enough number to just play them like Roto he should just be on rosters this year  haven't been on your bench if you want to for when somebody sits Nick Richards because Mark Williams is never coming back they say he was going to be reevaluated in four weeks  Mitch kupchak was quoted as saying they expect him to play at some point this year I don't know about that and then with PJ Washington gone one would hope that this helps Nick Richards a little bit  he'd been trending down pretty hard lately so maybe this buys him a little bit of time Brandon ski with Klay Thompson out it was Wiggins before that and it was Clay before that he may end up being playable even when the Warriors are at full strength but for right now we're just gonna take this sort of conservative route and say  he's a villain until I see otherwise Jake Crowder and Malik Beasley with Damon khris Middleton out but now I think all of those guys Middleton is out Dame is questionable and if he plays I think you just toss any of this this bucks stuff out the window which would make all of our Lives easier  great comment in the chat room I'm gonna get this up in a minute great comment from Jeff  Batista steibel and Jabari Walker in Portland because they were missing four guys in this last ball game I remember which ones no shade and sharp know Malcolm Brogden a no Scoot and then Simon's went down mid game oh and no DeAndre Aiden and no do up wreath  so actually was six  you guys are asking me how many guys I think needed to be hurt for Jabari Walker to have value and I said three well six we'll get it done same story for Bible but if half of those guys come back in the next ball game I don't think that I would take the plunge  I presume that Rashawn Holmes is gonna put up some numbers in Washington while I'm a modern bagley's out because he's the only Center on the whole damn roster and even if Holmes is sort of like a shell version of previous Holmes  he'll have almost no choice but to log mid-20 or higher and minutes and that's kind of double double good percentage is steel block kind of thing  oh he's gonna blow anybody away but maybe he goes into and I said it on the trade deadline show maybe he ends up here in basketball hell and kind of reinvigorates himself with no pressure  he's in have no pressure spot right now  Larry Nance Jr is a play with Otis valentina's  questionable  so if he plays don't do it and if JV doesn't play then you can stream Nance and I'm in Thompson who I almost forgot about but I snuck him in there at the very end of the list this is with Freddie Van Vleet out Dillon Brooks might also be a villain with Van Fleet out but I have trouble trusting Dillon Brooks as we all probably should and here's the hilarious post that I wanted to get on their Bays numbers won't improve if you keep calling him surely this is an airplane reference well done Jeff I enjoyed that immensely  and here is the final board that I had to add for this week and we'll spend a minute or two on this one  this board is called the trade deadline names of intrigue some of them we've already talked about so we can zip past those like Marvin Bagley others we have not in fact most of them we have not  Gary Trent Jr is a name of intrigued because Dennis Schroder got shipped out from the Raptors they brought in Spencer Dinwiddie and waved him  so the Raptors basically just cleared out minutes Gary Trent was starting already does he continue to start with Ochoa bogie and Kelly Olynyk in town who up you know what  damn it I forgot to put them on the list here let me add  Gary Trent Jr  Kelly Olynyk I'm not super invested in a body I don't think he's gonna play enough or do enough but Kelly Olynyk damn man I feel bad he should have been in the ads board everybody were going back to the top of the sheet we're going back to the top of the sheet and we're adding Kelly Olynyk to my ads born so let's talk about Kelly and Gary trans Junior I think Olynyk is gonna play 25 minutes in Toronto because they're so small without him and he's a floor spacing Ball moving big man who there's no reason he shouldn't he couldn't play alongside dentist shooter it would give Scotty Barnes some opportunity to play the three they could  play Kelly at those backup center minutes as well it just feels like  you know yakka pedal  what is he gonna play 29 minutes or something like that what's purple out on the year I should talk look this up before I say he's a 29 minutes right now  that leaves 19 back up Center minutes which are basically all gonna belong to a Linux now so if he gets sick power forward minutes I think that probably makes him a top 100 Guyanese you know oolitic is inside the top 200 this year in 18 minutes a game because he's at seven boards five boards five assists and he hasn't gotten that's over the last couple of weeks excuse me not on the year I should be more clear here he's number 152 in 20 minutes on the year on 8/5 and 4 with frankly lower Steals and blocks than I would have expected but a positive in both percentages this is another situation where we just say okay let's add 20 to 30% to what he's doing here  20% of 8 is 1.6 25% would be two so now he's at 10 points  you had a rebound you added assist you add point one to point two steals probably point one and a half  now you're talking about 10 six and five with over a three-pointer near a steal probably more blocks honestly and positive in both percentages that's definitely a guy that's in the top 100 unquestionably  and to me there's room for growth on top of that  but does that mean that if the team wants to go big does that ice out Gary Trent Jr yeah it would I don't think that both of these guys can be winners Trent Jr and olenek I think it's gonna have to be either one the other or neither if they just sort of cannibalize each other around the guys the Raptors are definitely gonna play like quickly and bear it and Pirtle and barns  but again those four guys what all together  I we could just look up the numbers here they're probably somewhere around 120 ish say four times 30 120 to 130 minutes and  that leaves a lot of minutes on the table  no 48 times 5 is 240 and those four guys even if we very liberally say they all play 35 minutes a game is only 140 there's plenty of ways to squeeze enough minutes to Kelly Olynyk to get him to Fantasy value you need more to get Gary Trent there but that's why he's a name of intrigued I added Olynyk in a few spots specifically nine cat Roto where his game really plays up Gary Tran I have a couple of spots I'm a little bit less bullish on him and that's why he's more of a name of intrigue as is Dennis Schroder who I think is probably get end up as an ad in a playable guy in Brooklyn we don't know for sure if he's just gonna get a Stranglehold on the starter's minutes could he end up splitting them with Dennis Smith Jr who's also by the way on this trade deadline names of intrigue board dsj I think is more of a watch guy Schroeder's probably more of a of an ad stash guy to see how this goes  Walker Kessler and John Collins are both going to World beat in Utah for the foreseeable future  and now I am beyond pissed at myself for dropping John Collins in the one League I had him in because he just stepped into even more sentiments and he was doing enough barely in the sentiments he was getting before this but now a Linux gone and that opens up 20 minutes basically of big man stuff in Utah and they're not going to just give all that to Taylor Hendricks you'll get more of the Obagi stuff Kessler use I mean we saw it in yesterday's game and I know Utah has some guys that are on the on the way in but Walker Kessler played 27 minutes and John Collins played 30 in yesterday's loss in Phoenix and they both put up colossal fantasy lines anyway it might not always be this outstanding but Walker Kessler could easily be a top 50 guy the rest of the way John Collins could easily be a top 75 guy the rest of the way and that's those are pretty big wins Chris Duncan keyonte George other Utah names that I'm more keeping a watch on George played 30 minutes but he has those young ball-handler issues or he'll probably play up a little bit for points League Style  Kris Dunn is more of a nine cat kind of guy because he doesn't score very much but he does bunch of other stuff as I've said before if if Utah runs Kris Dunn out there for 24 minutes or more every game I would probably add him it just hasn't been that reliably consistent lately  it's been closed last month he's at 20 minutes per game last two weeks he is and where the hell is he has his last two weeks is he still at 20 over that stretch or do my internet just junk out  24 minutes over the last week and he's number 100  so barely repeatable but watchable  Detroit has four names that are on the names of intrigue board Asar Thompson who  probably should have been back on the ads table also how did I do this twice that I missed maybe I was like oh don't worry dad you put them on the players of intrigue list you don't have to put them on anything else  let's get out there on the on the ads board although I will admit I have some fears still about  how his game is gonna hold up as the energy now is just not the same as it was the beginning of the year but Thompson is kind of an ad first  kind of intrigued name and then the other names on this I think are probably more watch list all the Marcus Sasser had a nice game for Detroit yes today and their overtime winning Portland he took 13 shots and had 17 points and 11 assists which yeah probably not a number that pops up every game we always saw sassa early this year he profiles as a more of a three-point type guy 16 minutes a game on the season he's at 8 points 3 assists I don't think that's a thing that just sort of doubles to 16 and 6 could the Steelers get from half a steal to like to one maybe I like the fact that he's not a negative and free-throw percent that's helpful for guys that are young and he's a rookie he's played big minutes and two games in a row and the numbers have been okay but not outstanding and that you know that 11 is such a massive outlier for him that I almost feel like we have to just dump it  so I like Sasser I think he'd be probably the first guy to look at in Detroit here Clinton Grimes is hurt he's a guy that I do want to see how he does in Detroit because it feels like the way they're talking about the return on the boy and bogdanovich deal  I think they're going to play him  but he also has some stuff some issues with his Fantasy game and then Simone funky all who they got from Utah is also probably gonna play a little bit and then do these guys all just sort of eat up each other's buckets  that's all so a possibility there's a very real chance that none of these guys end up with value because Detroit got some young guys that can shoot in their gonna sort of see which of them fit better if I had to guess I would say the odds among these four players that they have value down the stretch Thompson would be number one Sasser number two Grimes number three once he's healthy and then fonte number four but I can get that completely backwards and it wouldn't surprise me and then the Hornets are the last deadline team of intrigue Cody Martin who's going to go crazy while nobody's there  which I think we heard that nobody none of the new Hornets are suiting up for their game tonight  right yeah they're in Milwaukee and I think the news broke that the you know the players have an all past their physicals and stuff like that but if you look at back at the Hornets most recent ball game Cody Martin  he left and came back in the middle of that one or the minutes could have potentially been a little bit higher but this is a team that  sent out PJ Washington from that team that we saw on I guess that'd be Wednesday night and PJ played 31 minutes  so this is really a who's who of who  so mi bridge is gonna take 30 shots like just gonna be wild Brandon Miller's gonna take 20 shots I'm exaggerating a little bit and then as much as Cody Martin doesn't want to be a feature offensive guy  for the next game one game he's kinda have no choice  so this is one of those things I I've referred to it before I haven't been able to use this term all that much this season I don't know why I think probably just bad luck uh but you guys remember the term streamer with benefits  we use that a lot during sort of the covid era where guys were coming and going and we had no idea who was gonna stick in a lineup and if they end up with long covid they might just sort of like lose their job for a while  streamer with Benefits was a term that I coined two seasons back to  basically talk about kind of like the Wally pipp situation  which maybe now I need to go even farther back while he pip was a baseball player in the 19th I think that 19 teens in the early 1920s  who is best known for getting a hurt  and losing his starting job  2  Lou Gehrig  it's not a thing that happens all that much  and the reason it was notable for while he picked is because he was actually very good  he wasn't bad it wasn't like he was a bad baseball player he got hurt and then he just got passed by an all-world baseball player that kind of describes this whole idea of the streamer with benefits as in  is Cody Martin a terrible basketball player know but  was the guy in front of him  like all World know and and the parallels drop a little when you're like oh is Cody Martin Luke Garrett know  but it's a situation where a job opened up for him  for reasons  that didn't really have much to do with him that's the parallel  Lou Gehrig wasn't the starter got the job because somebody just got her  Cody Martin not really a stud but has a job now because half the team is hurt and the other half got traded  and there's some overlap there Gordon Hayward is both hurt and traded  let's go Cody Martin good to do when lamelo ball comes back or when Trey Man shows up or midget or whoever is rolling into these days we don't know  but there's a non-zero chance that he keeps the job and keeps doing stuff  and so it's one of those things where  if you saved your moves all week  it doesn't really hurt you to pick up Martin right now  you know like you know he's gonna be good for one game and then there's a chance that he's good for more than that  we just don't know  could he be good the rest of the season well maybe  what is good what are we even trying for with Martin  because so far this year is percentages have been really really bad  is he a 45% shooter from the field or is he 39 because that's what he's been so far this year  he's a bad foul shooter  he gets deals and blocks and assists and Boards a little bit  don't score all that much so look at this last ball game you're like well  195 and 8 that's a guy who had to do some stuff  why did I not pick him up in a bunch of leaves myself well  because I don't trust those percentages and I also think that at some point he sort of  repped enough ice  but there is a chance that he's a streamer with Benefits someone who just has to do a ton for one night that then ends up falling in love with doing more stuff and then Trey man is another name of intrigued I am not as high on him as some others and the only reason I know that others are high is because people keep asking me why I'm not high on him and I keep getting yelled at on Twitter about it  I think Trey man might be a guy that perhaps  profiles better as a points League option because he is a I was shooting 50% from the field this year but small sample size is the understatement of the universe he's done that in 13 and I think he's taking a total of 40 shots I think he's 20 for 40 this year  yeah  that ain't much previous two seasons where he actually played more for the Thunder he was shooting 39% exact same percentage both years by the way 39.3  he's a sub 80% foul shooter  he doesn't rebound very much nothing all that much  Mike get you some steals that's a possibility I don't think we know for sure  doesn't block shots  so what's the best case scenario here for him  15 points three boards two assists and a steal  on bad percentages that would probably play in points leaks that would not play in nine cat that's why I haven't been higher on Trey man but I am in a a you guys know I call it sort of my goofy League I'm in a goofy league and former hoop baller Josh Millman picked up Trey man and that one because maybe free throw and feel goal volume push him over the the hump  nine cat I don't think so  and that I believe yeah that's our board for the week whoo I am gonna try to get a show to you guys over the weekend I don't think it's gonna be tomorrow tomorrow's gonna be exceptionally busy day we got some kids stuff in the morning I've got some more play-by-play in the afternoon and evening but let's see you know what you guys can watch me check my phone to see what the family calendar looks like for Sunday  okay  yeah that looked too bad Sunday's pretty open I think I'll get you guys to show on Sunday  how do you like that  because I really would like to get some information out there about what we see tonight and tomorrow as players start to make their debuts but again like you heard was Charlotte when the hell does Charlotte have another game today they're not on a back-to-back are they that would be really nice they are on a back-to-back so you probably see the new players on Saturday there so that's good you'll probably see the new Brooklyn players on Saturday you'll probably see the new Toronto players I'm guessing on Saturday so a lot of these teams have a back-to-back today tomorrow that had changes meaning we might not get the information today but we might get it tomorrow so show on Sunday would be I think a really good time to kind of dig in and get you guys some a report on that we'll probably see the new pistons on Saturday as well that's gonna be a critical day to see what's going on and we'll probably make some moves that night as well and if you guys want to know what moves are making immediately that's what social media is for come on over at Dan best briefs at Dan Bass Pros on Twitter I'll try to get you guys the goods as the games are ending and again I say it now I really do think that's Saturday's card is going to be a Difference Maker for us down the stretch there are a long you guys know we talked about the ebb and the flow of a fantasy season sometimes we go three four weeks where the only pickups are because guys get hurt this weekend is an opportunity to find rest  of season players in a way that just hasn't really been a thing for the last three months it's a critical time don't lose your focus Friday Saturday just because you're going into a weekend or whatever just because the trade deadlines done stay locked in something big is gonna pop up today or tomorrow we're gonna want to be there for it again thank you everybody like rate subscribe like rate and subscribe those three big things I need you guys to take just six seconds to do it I know it's it feels like a lot but I promise you it's not that's how we keep growing this thing we're at an hour I don't know why I did an hour long show after doing nine yesterday  I need lunch how about the rest of y'all anyway at the investors on social we'll talk to you over there and I'll see you guys back here for a show on Sunday later
