welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  good morning everybody welcome back from Thanksgiving break I hope you all had a lovely holiday just a few weeks until we're into another holiday break I don't know if you guys have children out there and if they're in public school but I do know that public schools off for three weeks this holiday season again I think it's the 18th through the 5th  ridiculous  but that does give us what three weeks of normalcy here between I've got a  I say I've got to figure out my schedule I know my schedule I just know it's gonna be  wacky as all get up I am Dan Bass Pro welcome welcome welcome it's fantasy NBA today we're back for a new week of shows  two for here on Monday this one is our waiver wire show will be going over the weekend in review reverse chronological lightning round you guys know the deal there anything that happened to any of the 30 teams over the weekend we will be profiling that will give you the ads we'll give you the drops as it pertains to what's been going on there and then just a quick little five game Monday preview as we roll into these kind of weird weeks coming up mostly because of the in-season tournament  um I don't think it's that nuts this week if I'm not mistaken I think this week is  mostly okay until you get towards the end of it and then next week you'll have the in-season tournament like quarters and semis and stuff like that and or maybe the quarters are at the end of this week but then some eyes in the finals like the finals doesn't count for fantasy and then other teams are off and they've got to rejigger all the state schedules to make sure that everybody's got enough games going so you know what date teams are playing but you may not know where or who their playing against  that's coming up though luckily we don't have to do a ton with that but later on today we will have our week ahead show that's what Derek ball usually airs around 2:00 Pacific time so make sure to stay tuned to that And subscribe to the YouTube page  or Spotify or iTunes or however you take in the our various contents so that you can get alerted when we have that show this afternoon  and I would like to once again remind everybody to please come hang out with us over on the Discord side you guys may have noticed that I've been doing a little bit of a push on that front lately and look here's the here's the lowdown on that before we dive into all the fantasy stuff for the the weekend here we'll just we'll go through a whole bunch of stuff and so get ready don't worry it's coming  basically here's where we're at  there is  a at least a medium sized likelihood that Twitter gets more and more messy over the next six 12 18 24 months whatever it might be because so far under Elon Musk Twitter has gotten more complicated however you want to like whatever you want to how are you feeling about a right now Twitter is still the fastest way to get your fantasy information  is it easier now than it was a year ago absolutely not it's more complicated it's harder to use you have to use weird plugins to get tweet deck to work if you even know what that is the app is bugier finding your stuff at a feed of edible weed ads is extremely annoying at times so with to that end we want to make sure you guys have a place to go if anything does ever truly befall x / Twitter where I still am doing almost all my stuff I'm not abandoning it in any way I'm gonna continue to use it like it's gonna be there forever but I do also think there's a chance it's not so come hang out with us in Discord I put the link on the board there for folks that are watching on YouTube it's in the show description for folks that are listening on traditional podcast channels that's the place to be already folks are kind of hanging out in a fun little Community there but certainly it's nice to have it as kind of an emergency backup  okay enough of that nonsense enough of that stuff I know you could call it promo I actually think it's sort of us just covering our bases  let's talk about the weekend that was and see if we got anything we can do to fix up your fantasy teams it's a 30 team reverse chronological lightning round will go through Sunday and Saturday and then we'll play The Weekly game of who didn't play over the weekend because Dan's too stupid to look it up beforehand  anyway here we go Portland Milwaukie that was the early game Milwaukee this is a 32 point turn around in this basketball game portal and led by a bunch this was the Damian Lillard if you want to call it a Revenge game which again like Revenge games are not always a thing  I think it's more gray than black and white on that one because certain players do get a little bit feistier to play Old teams like we saw DeAndre Aiden I think play harder against the Suns than he did against some other clubs but this was a different one because  I don't think the Blazers really begrudged Dame  departure you know he was their leader there for a decade  he put everything into that thing like the only people that are annoyed with Dame about this are the fans and it's like they could show up and play in Milwaukee on behalf of the Blazers so there wasn't really a true which you call Revenge angle at play here and frankly Dame didn't shoot the ball that well I know he did big fan of fantasy game but if you want to say oh he did more because it was the Blazers I don't think so I think this is just what he's been doing against teams that aren't that great defensively  in any event there will be times when you could exercise that rule there will be other times where you can't point is here there aren't that many fantasy angles that play in these two teams Shane sharp continues to be a much better points League option than Head to Head his rank actually is one ninety in nine category League's but if you want to punting field goal and turnovers like it kind of has to be both unfortunately if it's just one of the other you're punting only field goals that gets them up to 126 which is playable in most formats but not great  and if you're punting both that does finally move them inside the top 100 there's this weird disconnect though on Sharp where like two weeks ago I think I asked on Twitter who's been your favorite pick so far this year a lot of people were like oh Shane sharp and I'm looking back at that like are we  are we looking at the same year  now if you're punting both field goal and turn over he's number 75 so there you go that's how you get him inside there this is what we talked about on this show and on Twitter it's harder to do because you don't you have a character limit on a show I am where as long as I want  what I say someone is Better Built for head to head this is what I'm talking about  a player who excels in a few categories but is also quite bad and if you categories and that's what sags their value down it's not somebody that's just sort of like kind of okay and everything or like just so average and everything  those guys either make sense for Road or nothing at all the guys that have this anchor this weight dragging them down for Sharp its field goal and turnover these are guys that play better on head to head because most Haddad teams are punting at least one thing  scoot Henderson is probably the only Angle worth looking at on the Portland side he played 27 minutes in this ball game Off the Bench 13 points for boards and an assist did pick up five vowels they're gonna bring him along  I think it's possible that Portland realized that sort of shoehorning him into the starting lineup and just saying go get him scoot was maybe not the best way to get him acclimated to the NBA so they're kind of bringing him along now he'll get to play against him second units better way to kind of get used to the tempo of it NBA game the length of an NBA season all that stuff now these back injury that one more an issue that it was before  do I think he's gonna be in the starting lineup as the year goes absolutely to Monte Kamara is not gonna stick as the starting power forward for that team they'll move some body's around it'll probably be Jeremy Grant sliding up a slot  So my answer to the question which is the one that keeps getting asked what do I do about scoot is the same can you effectively kind of luxury stash him in whatever format you're playing until I would say January at the earliest  for me the answer is typically no  for others it might be yes but we already know how this Arc is gonna go it's the same as it is for almost every rookie ball handler coming into the NBA where people have sort of the consensus this guy's gonna be very good  it takes three or four months for them to figure it out  every time  DeAndre ayton is leveled off I suppose he's worth a very brief mention got off to that crazy hot start because of sort of an unsustainable steals number now he's settling back in he's number 40 that's kind of a round where I thought he'd be this year and so no surprises there  Malik Beasley and I said this in the Tweet storm last night he's in one of those can we guess if this is going to be one of the Malik's League good game type of moments  and lately the answers been more yes than no which it's weird to say like we should have Malik Beasley on our fantasy teams but he's number one oh six which Tech technically makes him a startable player in nine cat but he's also shooting 48 and a half percent this year on what is basically a career low in usage rate so a lot of the stuff with him feels wildly unsustainable and if you're like oh he's just getting all these open looks next to Damian Lillard Giannis not a Cooper yes that's true but he steals rate is well above his career mark his three-point percentage is a career high 46 right now his field goal percent is the best it's been since she since 2018 and it's actually still better than that so there's a lot of stuff going on with Beasley that does not feel like it's gonna stick and if you're looking at the up and down of his season he's had like three or four  megagames and then everything else has been kind of crap  do you want a risk that in a games cap format I'm a big no on that Fred Haddad I guess you could kind of throw him out there you know you're going to get some three-pointers but overall it's gonna be generally more complicated than it's worth and Bobby Portis is another one of the guys I wanted to talk about on that buck side because he's been a little bit up and down also a guy who technically belongs in lineups right now coming off of two crummy ball games but he had four or five before that that were pretty good and then this one was better again he got some defensive stats which is not really the norm for reporters you can't expect that all the time but it does seem like he's generally doing just barely enough with Jae Crowder out where he belongs in lineups and you guys know I can't get past this game without talking about Brooke Lopez who now is up to number 18 in nine category leagues he's been ridiculous of late I think over the past two weeks he's number five in all of fantasy sports behind Shea Kevin Durant and bead and Tyreese Halliburton  over the last two weeks Brooke Lopez is averaging 17 and a half points two three-pointers a game six boards a steal four blocks on 60% from the field and 85% of the free throw line and if you're like yeah that's not sustainable you'd be right  however his slow start to the year also wasn't because he was shooting 39% we need that wasn't gonna stick  where is Brook Lopez fall probably somewhere between where he started and where he's at right now do I think he's gonna be number 18 all year unlikely  but it doesn't matter because you're not going to get proper value back for him if you sell on Lopez because the people that have him are the people that went and got him which is generally us those of us who love the old man stuff  out well hey I forgot to tell you guys to follow me on Twitter at Dan best person I know I talked about the old Discord Twitter thing but I am at d a n b e s b e r i s over there let's keep moving Minnesota trounced Memphis the Grizzlies are in a bad way nothing really to talk about on the Minnesota side we had this sort of passing thought of  would anybody get fantasy value with Jaden McDaniels out and nickeil Alexander Walker's soaked up most of the minutes but he's not really doing much with them so I think the answer is just no  Memphis on the other hand  okay  so Jaren Jackson Jr we need to talk about him he finally played a full complement of minutes in this ball game and he finally got more than two defensive stats  to get his season mark up to 2.2  coming off of last year where he had four his field goal percentage down about nine year over year  and then between those two things that's really the difference in JJ from last season to this one he went from a guy who was getting four defensive stats of ball game to two he went from a guy who shot 50% last year to a guy who was down near 40  here's the thing  number one  he's basically at a career low in 3-point percent at 30 so I do think that number comes back  I don't think it's field goal percent gets all the way back to 50 or 50 one which was pretty unusual for him last year given that a solid third of his shots were coming from three-point land  and that's still where he's at  so it's 2% was extraordinarily High last season and without jaw around to get him open this year you've seen that 2% Fall using the three-point percentage fall  everything else has been kind of normal with the exception of the defensive stats steals are down and blocks are down  do I think JJJ gets back to that number 12 spot that was always gonna be a tough Landing point for him because he needed to reproduce three blocks of ball game which is far easier said than done over an entire year  he could still get back there anything's possible  but I think you have to adjust a little bit for maybe not getting all the way to that do I think he gets up from 2.2 defensive stats where he is right now yes do I think his field goal percent Trends up at some point this year yes so to that end JJJ feels like one of the bigger by Lowe's on the market  question is where do you think he's gonna go and how much you think you could you you'd have to pay to get him right now we'll talk more about that tomorrow on our Bi-Lo show of the week where he will probably be back again  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with

must be 21 plus not available in all locations otherwise from Memphis I think you can stream Santi aldama I know he wasn't as good in this one with just 14 and 7 but overall he's just simply getting enough shots up and playing time where he should probably be in lineups  no I'm not starting bismack biyombo we've seen this story one too many times and that's kind of where I'm at with the Grizzlies  Charlotte had some news as well lamelo ball went down with an ankle sprain basketball monster you can see on your screen if you're watching they have it listed or a strain actually excuse me they have him listed as expected out for two ballgames I might go a little higher on that expectation just because of balls ankle issues historically so this sucks the good news I guess if you want to call it that is that Terry Rozier came back  and now he I mean he was bad as the point guard last year but at least he can sort of slide into that role he'll get a lot to do  he won't do as much as lamelo was doing so that means that there's going to be usage for other guys to have miles Bridges is doing a ton Brandon Miller's going to get to do more I would assume Gordon Hayward jumps back up to doing a little bit more so definitely a hold on Heyward I always bad and yesterday's game because he missed a bunch of free throws and shots but overall his role is going to increase here with lamelo out I think and then his Brandon Miller goes  I'll be honest with you guys when he had this better ball game and I was I looked at it I was like hmm as he done anything recently  and the answer is kinda you know you had 15 points in the previous game he played 40 minutes the night before that at 9 7 and 4 then he had a 29 point game before that so we've been coming on a little bit hotter of late that certainly plays a role he has 113 pointers in his last four ball games probably not a number that sticks since he had two in his previous seven game's  and this is a spot I think where we just have to look and say all right somebody's running hot right now right in Miller's running hot he'll probably continue to do so for I don't know how many a couple more games and he'll have more usage with no lamelo so you could probably play Miller in all formats you don't almost definitely play him head to head Roto is more the question mark there  Bridges if you're comfortable rooting for him obviously he's a goal was a goal I don't have Myles Bridges and then Gordon Hayward for me slots back in as a go as well  or land as a team that didn't have a ton of story lines up until about three or four games ago and then Cole Anthony just caught fire I mean he's gone completely nutso and this was like the mega game to end all Mega game is over the entire season col Anthony is still outside the top one 50 and so when I typed stuff like that in on Twitter over the weekend people are like what are you talking about coal hanley's been incredible well he again fits more that head-to-head profile where over the last two weeks since he's sort of kicked it into a higher gear he's been a nice positive impact free-throw guy he's been a okay impact points boards and assist guy from a guard spot but he hasn't done too much defensively his field goal percent has been kind of a medium-sized negative and so those things do counterbalance each other  what does that mean well while he's running this hot you can probably play him in every format  okay  we have to react to this stuff that's happening right in front of our eyes over the last week Cole Anthony he's been extraordinary and he's been a top 50 play for the seven days which I think for his three or four games for him  weighted heavily by this last one where he went for 30 points 7 boards seven assists two Steals and a block  he's Steals and blocks have been up the last week his free throws have been very high the last week the magic been playing out of their minds  and you'd like to say oh well you know defenses help yeah Charlotte defense stinks but he did some of it against Boston they're a good team he did some good against Denver they're a good team so it's like you can say oh well he just had these cake pastry matchups he just been really hot and while he's running hot Orlando's giving him extra playing time so play Cole Anthony while this is going  some of us to do with the fact that Markle faults has been out for a few weeks okay that's fine but it's okay to ride a hot hand  it also seemed like at the end of last week Goga kind of won the center job and then move Wagner had a huge game against Boston and then they basically split 37 minutes  in this one and we're back to our  what do you get when you cross an elephant in a rhino there's the answer to your question of who to start between bats and mogra  elephant oh  so I'm gonna probably go back to neither  son's without Kevin Durant last two ballgames and if you thought oh boy Devin Booker gets to do a lot when Bradley Beal is down  Devin Booker gets to do even more when Baal and Duran and Grayson Allen for whatever that's worth are all out  this is the Devin Booker show 25 shots and 11 assists this is like when Trey young didn't have anybody running next to him either  you're gonna get some absolutely ridiculous fantasy lines out of a book or right now so enjoy the hell out of it is it a sell High a little bit but you're not going to get anybody better than where you drafted Booker anyway so stick with it I still think that he cools substantially when both book Beale and Durant are there but we are now more than a month into the fantasy season and such a game has not yet happened  this is reminding me an awful lot of last year when I was like yeah Trey Murphy you just keep rolling them out there until the Pelicans get healthy and people were like Dan he's better than a streamer and I was like maybe we haven't seen it  obviously Booker's not the same thing he's he's you know a top 30 play no matter how you shake it out the question is is he a top six play which he is right now when everybody's cooked on that team or is he more like 20 when they're fully healthy we'll find out either way you're in good shape right now  would I stream Jordan Goodwin if everybody's out again for the next ball game  maybe I think him playing well and being hot helped Eric Gordon is your safe play if we can even call it that with both Durant and build down because he's the most likely to go take 15 shots and that could hurt you in a lot of ways but he's made he's liable to make three to five three-pointers  if he's getting that many looks at a bucket and you kind of just have to roll with that Katie Bates job is the guy who got to start for KD he can do some across the board stuff but he profiles more as just sort of your standard run in the middle streamer as opposed to someone you can use in all formats  I really have to be careful with my words when I call somebody a streamer  I'm probably talking about head to head when I call somebody an injury fill in or an all formats guy that should be a little bit more across the board  by the way the Jalen Brunson Buy Low window has officially expired he's now inside the top 50 and 9 cat after another big ball game here so no surprise is there a manual Quickly's minutes have been trending up a little bit he's another guy who profiles much better and head to head than Roto because again pretty good in points decent in threes very good free throws  not much else so the bad outweighs the good for Roto on quickly but the good probably out ways the bad in head-to-head because presumably  you're hunting something in had to head is it steals is a block is it boards if any of those things quickly adds a big boost in value he's a very good punt steals guard  those are all these weird little Hoops you got to jump through but it all makes sense if you look at it deeply  RJ Barrett finally had a quiet ball game I like he's been one of the easiest cell guys to start the year and now he's kind of petered out he's number one 47 and nine cat this was the least surprising thing on planet Earth so let's just keep on going  oh Josh Hart probably droppable I feel like I'm now made up my mind we've seen them in some competitive ball games he's in minutes have been more like 24 to 28 as opposed to 28 to 31  when RJ Barrett is healthy Josh Hart does not get to play enough  Hawks  I forgot I haven't done a show since Jalen Johnson went down that's sad  that makes me sad it makes me frown  Jalen Johnson out for a month maybe a little bit longer with it pretty bad wrist sprain  that sucks saddiq Bey is likely you're feeling guy I know he didn't do all that much in this ball game buddy he's almost definitely gonna play 29 or more minutes most every ball game was it 29 exactly in this one or he was like seven second shy of it he'll have more than seven points in most of these games he'll he'll get you some rebounds we'll get you some threes we'll get you some steals it should be good enough for all formats I think on Bay because the other options there are just  not  how's that for analysis  DeAndre Hunter is back into one of his ridiculous heaters you want to talk about like one of the streaks players in the NBA Hunter is that guy he's uh it was nuts he started the year shooting like 55% for two weeks and he was a top 50 guy and then he just vanished I mean completely and a totally disappeared after his first five games he scored nine 27/15 26 and 23 points and then over the next let's see what is that one two three four five six seven eight game he went for four eight twelve ten ooh 16 59 and 7 points and remember he doesn't do much besides just score and then his last three 25 20 and 24 I mean this dude is all over the damn map so you know the heat is wearing off at some point and when it does saddiq Bey is going to be the guy who likely benefits from that meanwhile Bogdan bogdanovich one of the really good late grabs in fantasy drafts I did not have him here that one feels like a guy that just sort of slip through  I think we all still assume that his knee is gonna act up but they're mostly keeping as minutes in check not so much in this ball game and maybe he has to play a little more with Jalen Johnson out but  keep running about their  and I know on Yoko Kong will only had four points in three rebounds but he played 27 minutes to steals a block made both of his shots I don't want to hear questions about him he is a very easy hold he's number 86 and he still hasn't even really had a chance to bust out this year  be cool be cool honey bunny  hey first game for the Celtics without Chris stops for singers he's gonna miss a one-word assume a couple of weeks calf stuff is not a real fast recovery time although it didn't sound too bad  Big Al Horford man I don't I mean Celtics grubbed 58 rebounds in this ball game so that helped everybody it was a very high paced ball game even though the teams didn't score all that much Big Al's six points 15 boards three assists to steal and two blocks I mean the only thing he didn't do in this game was hit a three-pointer and he he tried it just didn't go down he's in all all formats play with poor sing out we've seen this already when the Celtics are missing either their power forward or their Center or for the guy that drops in there but this is the best case scenario for him because he gets to play the five when he and forcing us are out there together they're sort of interchangeable four or five playing the five is great for big men  playing the five is great for anybody remember when Rob Covington was a five  remember when LeBron was a five  so good to be back near the rim specially on defense rebounds blocks field goal percent on offense  juicy man let's roll with big out and just remember  he still Big Al Horford he still 900 years old and so there will be a game in here where he goes for four points eight or  four points five boards and a steal and everybody's gonna like you suck Dan and I like just remember it's over the whole period it's a roto guy he's not gonna score that much he's a roto guy  but I did get I can dig it  Sam Hauser played 32 minutes off the bench in this one that was kind of surprising  how the whole thing shook out I guess but a Celtics were also missing Drew holiday for this game so that played a role I don't know why my brain farted on that a little bit the little bounce Banton I still want to call him Blanton I know everybody wants to call him Blanton it's just Banton got the start didn't do very much that's why Hauser got more playing time how's it seems more comfortable coming off the bench he's a 3-pointers stream and let's keep going  this is taking me a while everybody I'm fully aware of that but I thought we could really go through it kind of fine tooth comb  and so we might not get to as many questions but hopefully we'll basically cover every player in the damn NBA and maybe you won't have any hey yaak a poodle is fine thank goodness he was such a weird start to the year I admit I was starting to get nervous but he's been really good last guess it's a bit about three weeks give or take  top 60 last three weeks Steals and blocks are starting to come around he is one of the best two-point percentages in the NBA so few as we wipe our brow  that one started to make me a tiny bit nervous but he leveled off Dennis Schroder has officially Fallen outside the top 100 and I am not an idiot after all or I am an idiot but at least I'm not an idiot about this particular thing remember when he was top 50 and I started to think I was a complete idiot only kind of one now  that's over the last three weeks sorry I gotta get my stats right shooter does still just hang on inside the top 100 overall but last three weeks is just outside the top 100 and that feels more like the sustainable Mark for him also Scotty Barnes starting to slowly Trend down after the world's hottest star in the universe rebounds are down from 10 scoring is back under 20 defensive stats are at 2.9 we always knew he was gonna come back down that was just not a sustainable start Scotty Barnes over the last three weeks is number 30 which again feels like a number that could probably stick a little bit easier and that's okay  he'd still be a draft day when and still amiss for yours truly but first round was always a bit of a reach  hey how about Macross so look I don't want to spend that much time on Spruce because you guys know I love him he's just basically been top 60 almost every single week all year long remarkably consistent he's number 58 right now  he's rebounding like a monster and it's been consistent All Season he's always up there with the top minutes played on the team they just love it he provides a floor-spacing element they didn't have last year he defends better than George niang although there are a game there's some games here and there were any I gets a few extra looks  but I just I want to remind everybody of like that first week of the year where we saw Spruce go nuts  and I I want to feel I want to say I learned my own lessons so I want to make this more about me than it is about everybody else because a lesson that I've learned over the years is that sometimes  I was too bashful about a pickup because I didn't believe something was sustainable  or I felt like it was because somebody was missing or I just sort of talked myself out of it but we saw screws put up those really big games right out of the Chute and remember I think the first game of the year maybe Garland was out but one of those what are two of those early games this year that team was fully healthy other than Jared Allen and he still did it  and so in those games I'm looking at it like okay you know what am I doing here with this dude what am I do I treat him as though this is a flash in the pan or do I treat it like something that we just missed  and finally this year I said I think this is something that the whole analyst Community missed because almost none of us had screws on our board I'm sure there's someone out there that did and I don't know I don't have the time to look through and see what everybody else is rankings are but most of us that are sort of high-profile I guess we didn't have him on our boards we thought he was gonna do the same crappy did it in Miami last year  but like that first game even when you put up a big line sure that was cool but it was a 39 minutes that caught my eye and then the second game his line wasn't as big but he played 38 minutes that's what caught my eye and then the third game I think was an overtime game he played 42 minutes so basically 37 for regulation that's what was catching my eye and I thought  this guy's gonna go through a slump at some point but if we can continue to see minutes that are like he's among some of the league leaders in minutes played this year  is that nuts I think he's like 20th in the league in minutes per game this is Max truce were talking about  that's why I stuck it out  because the minutes were huge and so you knew everything else would love off but those giant minutes meant just more involvement more rebounding opportunities more assisting opportunities the Steals and blocks which is not really like a claim to fame for him and they're still not frankly he's at what point nine steals point six blocks but 35 minutes a game was never a number that he sniffed in the past he's like 20% higher than almost every any season he's ever had  and his role is bigger and Donovan Mitchell and or Charis Levert or Darius Garland they seem to be out like every two games so that's not bad either  so that's why I came on this show and on Twitter and I said this guy  is an ad and I want you guys holding him for a while because something new is happening  this is not my way of trying to my own horn in fact it's a way of me trying to say I made idiotic mistakes in the past or I saw something like this and I was like I come on this is player X he's never done this type of thing but this year I finally learned from those mistakes and I said this is a guy who's being given a different role and a different opportunity and I'm gonna believe what I'm seeing as a post to what I saw in the past  and I hope we can all learn a lesson from that because it took me 20 damn years to learn the lesson but I finally did and it's paying off with this guy it's fun to have an example of yourself this is a self-improvement moment for me a good to see Darius Garland in this game all so he heard his neck against the Lakers left that ball game in the third and didn't come back but he played in this one and he actually played relatively well  minus five more turnovers Garland what are you doing man do you not know what your own team's Jersey looks like  pass to the proper team  and Jared Allen's back by the way he's inside the top 70 now so that Bilo window is gone  careless Lord okay look I mean I'm taking too long with everyone of these games but screw it we got a lot to talk about  Carousel was a guy I had sort of softened to my stance on earlier this year but he's now falling back into the oh this Carousel over type of thing and it's not about a usage dip  it's just about efficiency he needs to be getting so much usage to to overwhelm the inefficiencies that he now falls back into a head-to-head only kind of play  he's simply too bad at field goal percent free throw percent  for me to use him in a roto I can't do it  he scores  he gets steals he sometimes it's threes all of that stuff is good if you're just trying to compile on a head-to-head side but Roto he's no longer a play and I probably should have said that last week but I forgot so I'm saying it now  Chicago they got to be on the cusp of blowing it up at this point I mean the Bulls are an unmitigated disaster from an actual basketball standpoint at least fantasy wise they're kind of hanging in there to this point Zach LaVine got off to a slow start he's gotten better he's now inside the top 60 on the year I feel like it happened and nobody even noticed that it happened remember when he was in the 90s only takes a couple of decent ball games tomorrow to Rosen is right next to him they're both basically right at 60 which is um I guess a little bit disappointing but certainly not backbreaking bad I think vouchers right around there also isn't he yeah all three of those guys are right at 60  all three are slightly behind where they got drafted to Rosen was going in the late 40s Levine actually vouchers going around 55 or 60 so he's basically right where he got drafted Levina I think was maybe five slots in front of them  effectively they're all basically 80P matches to this point but I want them to blow it up because I think all of these guys would get a fresh take on life if they were somewhere else or Hell start to blow it up take one of those dudes away and the other ones will have plenty of usage to pick up for it but they're not even the point point is they're fine you can keep trying them out there Kobe white is the main guy I talked about it last week and the week before once the Zach LaVine is on the trade block news dropped  and I've been vocally anti Kobe white as a fantasy play because he's very bad at field goal percent he doesn't rebound actually doesn't score as much as folks were giving him credit for in the past is defensive stats didn't sort of cover up the other stuff and he's consistently outside the top one 50 in fantasy even when things are going well for him  but  I want to once again iterate so reiterate I believe is the appropriating English word for that  what I said is as soon as the news broke which is  figure out how long you can stash Kobe white because if the answer is any medium length of time you should do it  do I think he's playable right now I mean this is a good ball game but generally the answer is no because of his fantasy problems the holes in his stats at you could probably get away with playing them on the head-to-head side if you can get him in Roto I think I would do it and then just sit on him because at some point the plugs getting pulled I mean this team stinks  they stink  they're one of the worst net rating teams for their like for a healthy core in the NBA  they're 5 and 13  they're four games back of the play in tournament  I feel like we've all thought the Hornets have been really bad this year and the Bulls are a game and a half back of them  black anyway try to stash Kobe white however you can try to do it  no Nick's in the Brooklyn side and cam Johnson as folks watching can see left with leg cramps hopefully this is a very small thing for him because cam was coming on baby  worked his way up inside the top 70 after a slow start this game pushed him just slightly out of the top 70s and he didn't get to finish it but he's doing all the things we wanted him to do scoring three Steals on good percentages  I like cam Johnson a lot so hopefully gets better I think the more interesting stuff in this ball game big games from Roy so Neil and very productive game from Dorian Finney Smith that's because Nick klaxton and Ben Simmons are both out it also doesn't hurt that campus is still out cam Thomas and Ben Simmons being out is very good for Spencer Dinwiddie  I got yelled at on Twitter for saying Dinwiddie was kind of a maybe for me and frankly I was probably being a little bit too cruel to him he's a play with Ben Simmons and cam Thomas out  I don't know that he's I frankly I don't think he's gonna be a nine cattle level guy if Simmons and Thomas both come back  he's if he when Camp Thomas comes back  and possibly a no on that front too  because Dinwiddie generally doesn't do much besides points 3 is in a sis  struggles with steals typically struggles with rebounding struggles with field goal percent a lot turnovers usually kind of High free throw percent is meh not great but in this ball game I don't want you guys to use this one game as the example  but when all these guys are out and his usage is through the roof and he's basically the last initiator on the team he's going to be good  okay all these things can be true at the same time I need everybody to hold like four thoughts in their head all at once  by the way when Nick klaxon comes back Roy so Neil and Dorian Finney Smith they go away when Clarkson's out we've seen Finney Smith in particular has been useful and then Roy so Neil was the guy who picked up when Simmons was all so out so you got all these streaming options with the Nets question is who's playing in their next damn ball game well it happened guys Victor wembanyama had the true line of the night  one of the lines of the year with 10 combined defensive stats  and a double-double 22 points 11 rebounds 6 steals four blocks two three-pointers this is crazy  these are the kinds of wild lines that you're gonna get from time to time from Wendy this year  he's still learning the NBA I think yokich had the quote after the ball game was like look this guy's gonna change the league he still learning he's still making mistakes and that's fine that's basically what you could say he's like he's gonna make mistakes this year yeah  and you drafted him probably at 15 or 17 or whatever he was going on on those last two weeks before the season starts and you're probably looking at it right now like  well  yeah that's the reasonable way to feel about it because  he has one of the most imbalanced fantasy profiles so far this year he's been atrocious and turnover is very poor and feel goal percent amazing and blocks wonderful and steals rebounds have been great like everything's all over the map at the end of the day he is going to be forget this year for like hopefully a long time one of the most fun players to have on your fantasy team  it's just that this year there's also going to be some stressors along the way where he's gonna have a game where he shoots like four for 25 but also blocks five shots near me going I don't even know how to feel about this damn ball game  Spurs are terrible by the way tried to warn you guys about that and hopefully it doesn't creep in on games played for these guys but it might at some point this year  or maybe they're pre tanking like the Wizards and the pistons pistons were supposed to be getting better this year trying to warn you guys about that one too  anyway I'm Zach Collins is a whole this wasn't as good of a ball game I do think he had a little bit of foul stuff early  his turnovers can continue to kind of sag his overall numbers  because if you're hunting turnovers and he's inside the top 100 I think you can probably weather that storm even on the Roto side  because he's not really hurting you a lot elsewhere and if you draft like I draft you're pretty good internal overs going into late rounds so you can take that hit bigger story in this one I think is Jeremy Sohan coming out early with some knee issues we didn't really get a chance to see if Trey Jones would make up for Sohan but he's the guy that you're looking at like oh okay maybe maybe this is finally the opportunity for trade Jones to get in the mix he's  outside the top 180 on the year  and I feel like people also need to remember that trade Jones got plenty of opportunity last season and he was right around the edge of the top 100 13 points six and a half assists 1.3 Steals and no outside shot that's basically what he would be if I think if Sohan misses time I don't know that that's necessarily like all systems go anyway but it is playable for whatever that's worth Denver's side a little bit of a lead bearing moment here one of the news breaks of the morning is that Jamal Murray is getting close he's now been upgraded to like in the mix for this week I think Shams had a tweet that was like he's not playing tonight but he's getting there which means the Reggie Jackson I couldn't deal with it stream is close to over this is a better game for Reggie Jackson which meant that over the last three weeks he got inside the top 200 I don't want to hear it from anybody about him he's not been good enough for any format while Jamal Murray's been out other than if you needed like a three games in four nights kind of thing schedule play only kind of dude and even then you probably could have found better options unless the only category you needed was points  anyway it's soon to be done Aaron Gordon sat this game out as well just in Holiday got a weird little spots starting didn't do anything with it so who cares  that's my big story for that one wolf all right well that was a busy Sunday we'll brought our party's just getting started we got plenty more teams to cover here so let's continue on and while I do that I want to welcome in the many of you that joined to watch live since the last time I said hello to everybody hi to the very large group of you that's joining and taking in your fantasy basketball here on this lovely little Monday I am Dan best you're listening to Fantasy NBA today please take a moment to find me on social at Dan best briefs d a n b e s b r i s and also please take a second to go hunt down our Sports ethos Discord it is free to get in there if you upgrade and get a fantasy pass at sports you can get cool other things unlocked in Discord but you don't need to I wish you would because it helps power the website but you don't need to just come hang out with us there it's a community that's building right now folks are asking each other questions I love when people in Discord do the  sort of an A or B thing and like click the red circle if you agree with that side or the yellow like you don't have to type anything you just vote  that's my favorite there's a lot of that going on in there right now and every time every once a while I'll pop in and do it as well so come hang out with us there and again if you can't find it in the chat room and you can't find it on your screen right now it's in the show description let's talk Saturday  well Nick buttom had a good ball game on Saturday  and Kelly oubre is supposedly somewhat close although  Sixers play the Lakers but tomb always has a good game against the Lakers any  feel like you could probably take a chance on him for one game but I know as soon as I said that out loud I'm gonna regret it  otherwise there's nothing else really to monitor on the Sixers side and be missed a ballgame and Paul Reed was awesome let's just remember that that's a thing not that anybody didn't think that was coming  I don't even really know what to say about the thunder right now Josh giddey played in this ball game but for how long  so if you guys haven't heard the news and I'm going to do my best to sort of tap dance around it Josh giddey is involved in a story that has him allegedly  having inappropriate relations with a high school softball we don't know the legitimacy of any of it  presumably the NBA is investigating what's going on and at some point in the next I don't know how long a couple of weeks we will get a report on it and if there's anything nefarious we might not see giddy for a while now maybe it comes through clean also possible  you guys know I was  well this is certainly not why I said to avoid drafting Josh Getty it's just because I didn't think he was gonna have much nine cat Fantasy game and that part is turned out to be accurate  uh what do you do if you had him on your team and you ignored my pleas he was on my bust list coming into the year  I don't think you can sell him I don't think anybody's gonna want him with all the story stuff swirling and he certainly hasn't been good enough outside the top two hundred and nine cat right now so you might be stuck with a drop at some point  oh well  Jalen Johnson still out with a hip injury I still think he's a buy low because I don't think he's gonna miss that much more time but yeah do with that as you see fit  Miami they were without everybody for this game in Brooklyn know bam know Jimmy know Tyler hero those are the big ones so the expectation for this one was probably a decent game out of Kyle Lowry which he was fine he wasn't great he was okay probably a decent game out of High may hockey's Junior and he was much better there was a chance that Josh Richardson would have an okay game and he did have an okay game we thought maybe Thomas Bryant had a chance to do like a 20 some odd minute performance and he was terrible and then Caleb Martin kind of came out of nowhere to get the 31 bench minute but hey it's playoff Caleb Martin getting hot from shooting kind of thing  here's the deal I don't know who's gonna be available for Miami's next ball game I believe they don't play again until tomorrow he says very slowly while trying to look it up on the fly yes they play tomorrow  I would assume  that Butler's back at the very least maybe bam as well  this felt a little bit like an opportunity for a team playing pretty well to give their guys a back to back off and then earn them what was effectively like three days of rest for it you know four games stretch between ball games  so I'm thinking they probably get bam and Jimmy back for the next one tomorrow I can't be certain but when those guys were in  and heroes been out Lowry Hopkins and then Duncan Robinson who was also out for this ball game where the guys that were streamable I don't know what the status of Duncan Robinson as well we'll just kind of have to attack this tomorrow  we already talked Brooklyn so let's keep moving along from that one we talked at all ready how about washingtin this was like classic Washington Wizards getting destroyed Saturday ball game they lost by 28 I wanted to make sure I had the exact number right on that one so nobody got normal minutes again Jordan Poole was also a very late scratch I think he was scratched actually between the official start of the game time or the listed start time and the official start time this is a game that was supposed to start I think it like 4:00 Pacific time but you know in the NBA all the games start 10 minutes after the hour and I think he was scratched between 4 and 410 which basically meant that nobody could move him in or out of their lineups  that sucks Corey kispert got the start and you know fart sound effect to streaming him into your lineup I wouldn't make an adjustment from this game  to any of the starters you know tyus Jones had actually been on a pretty good run before this one got himself inside the top 100 because of it this game bumped him right back outside of it  Jordan Poole prior to the late scratch he'd been on his slow climb up the board again there's really not a whole lot you can do about that any obvious been the guy who's actually cooled off a little bit and he's now falling outside the top 100 I think it can hang out pretty close to where he's been though which keeps him playable Daniel Gafford has been the you know big numbers in low minutes dude there great just keep trucking and then a lot of questions that keep coming in about Bilal coola bili he's number 176 on the year in 26 minutes of ballgame I've said it a thousand times I'll say it a thousand and one he's really more of a stash for later in the year if guys get out of the way and he actually gets to take a few shots as it stands right now even when he's getting the minutes he's not getting to actually touch the basketball and you kind of need to do that to put up numbers  Lakers beat the Cavs on Saturday that was a pretty good win for La actually considering they're down to eight rotation guys Lakers are missing let's see if I can do this off the top of my head they're missing Gabe Vincent cam reddish really hot shimora and Jarred Vanderbilt of whom are game-changers but all four of whom were expected to play probably about 20 minutes a game maybe in a tiny bit more for some so you think of that way you know that's like 70 to 90 minutes that are getting wedged into the remaining players and in this one it meant a whole hell of a lot of time for the starters and one of those was Max Christie  who I don't know how many minutes he was supposed to get all year but he got 33 in this one damn ball game Izzy a fantasy add know is Tori and Prince of fantasy I'd Maybe  not that he did all that much more than Christie it's just that Prince gets some defensive stats you know he's gonna take some three-pointers out there even if he's been ice cold from three I think you could probably get away with a prince stream for the Lakers game against Philly just because there's literally nobody else who's gonna take those minutes from him he's gonna play 30  and less I guess there's a chance camera I just pops back up I think he's questionable for this one so I guess that could put a hole into it but as it stands right now you know just put him on the floor for 32 minutes and he'll probably get you something like this a few points a few boards if you assist a few defensive stats a three or a couple of them  otherwise everything's pretty straightforward with this team the core four  which Brawn add Austin Reeves and D'Angelo Russell  LeBron cool the little bit last couple of ball games which has dropped him now to number 20 in nine cat  and likely he does continue to Trend downward not because there's anything wrong with LeBron he's having an unbelievable season but because he's actually physically doing less this year except for this ball game we took 23 shots and not surprisingly the efficiency took a hit He's listed as questionable he is for every ball game you know I'll worry about that when he actually misses one Pelicans lost in Utah that was kind of weird this is a team that's been playing pretty well lately uh once the Pelicans record right now  New Orleans they're nine and eight which I thought they were doing better than that  color me surprised  anyway they tried some other lineups here and some of them work some of them didn't Jose Alvarado got 23 minutes  that's something to keep an eye on Dyson Daniels still played 34 minutes but her Jones saw his minutes clipped in this ball game Jonas was in those mid-20s again  there's a lot to sort of monitor with New Orleans now this was all the Zion rest game so that meant a whole lot of extra shots for Ingram for Jordan Hawkins  I'll admit I am not set in how I feel about the pills right now Dyson Daniels had seven defensive stats he's been a guy that I loved to stream while CJ mccollum's been out but he's also been kind of quiet a couple of games where there were some blowouts he got he didn't play his full 30 minutes he's never gonna be a loud offensive player Dice and Daniels he's gonna get his fantasy stats from boards assists and Steals and you need to be out there to get them do I trust throwing him out there in their next ball game  honest to goodness I just don't know  I wish I had a clean yes or no answer for you guys on that one if you're looking for steals the answer is probably yes if you're looking for the full Roto package that he was given for a little bit and he did in this ball game the answer is I don't really know and when I don't know I tend to shy towards a no  you do what you like to though keep an eye on Jose Alvarado I don't think that he's gonna get up to enough minutes before McCollum comes back for it to truly matter but I suppose you never know and then with Hawkins he's not a guy that said fantasy value when Zions been in there and so I'm gonna go ahead and assume that this was more your one off  and take it from there on the Jazz side they were with without Lowry marking in they were without Jordan Clarkson for this ball game but they did get Walker Kessler back and in 21 minute it's he doubled doubled with two blocks also had five fouls  Omar you're seven started over him I cannot imagine that that continues for the long term this felt like an ease Kessler back in kind of ball game and I have to say this is about as good as he looked in every ball game this year putting up a double-double in 21 minutes can you still buy on Kessler probably not because whoever had him during his injured stretch is probably now excited to get him back you probably needed to buy when he went down for his injury but I do think this is going to be a pretty good run for him coming and if there's any chance you can get your hands on him for slightly less than full price then you probably do it  I don't think that I'm fully bought in on Kelly Olynyk I know he had a good ballgame here fantasy wise but the 24 minutes is typically not quite enough for him to get it done  you saw the reserves play extra for Utah they were the the group that made the comeback you know tailored and Tucker was out there for it Olynyk was out there for it oh Chia was out there for some of it  so this is a little bit of a weird fantasy line game everybody on the team basically played 19 to 26 minutes that's wild by the way five ten players and I think every single one of them was between 19 and 27  that's something in it  freaky little footnote on this ball game Collin Sexton had 16 points if Jordan Clarkson misses another game he's someone you could look at if you just need scoring  and then counting George who had the prototypical young dude running an offense game because the guys that are supposed to take the usage of Burden off of him or out 15.6 boards five assists for three-pointers you're looking at those four categories and going hot dog and then you realize zero steals zero blocks 31% from the field 60% of the free throw line five turnovers rut row  all that said I still like keyonte George as a hold I just think he's better served as the guy giving the ball to the more established dudes around him  Dallas got blown out by the Clippers somebody told me that Derek Lively was not worth holding and  I don't know if they meant just because he's hurt or because he hasn't been good enough but he's very much has been good enough this year especially if you eliminate the game where he left early due to injury  he's basically like number 100 on the nose without that ball game he's won 11 when you included  that's a 12 team 9 cat guy in all formats  so yeah you can hold on to Lively I think I would I also think he Trends up as the year goes because if you can see the Mavs are not as good with him these are all things and I admit I was a little skeptical the first week or two of the season with Lively because I'm like look this team has Dwight Powell they have actually Cleaver Sean Holmes they have three other veteran options at Center  khalib has been basically hurt the whole damn year but right now  Lively is the only guy that's giving them an edge at that spot the other dudes all aged 100 years in the last two seasons  also wanted to point out as all analysts have said this is not me saying I was right this is me saying that we've all seen it a thousand times Tim Hardaway Jr has finally cooled off and he's now number 100 and 50  ride him when he's hot  Abandoned Ship his fast as you can when he's cold  I have mixed feelings on Norman Powell right at the moment they are more positive than negative because it does kind of seem like he's embraced this role of coming off the bench with this Clippers team and being the guy that receives Russell Westbrook passes and then just firing like a madman like but then this ball game happened and he almost took no shots but he made all of them so I don't really know what the hell's going on with Norman Powell I'm gonna call him an ad right now to just see how it shakes out  because he's been getting more fourth quarter minutes lately the 24 and a half minutes in this ball game was somewhat blowout related although he's kind of in that range most of these ball games and normally I'd say that's not enough but he's just out there and he's firing  so I'm gonna give Norman Powell a look I'm fully aware that if he goes through a cold spell and the minutes Trend down or just the overall value Trends down with it then you could fall off a cliff but  I don't know I kind of like it right now and I kind of want to see where it goes  we're up at an hour aren't we holy crap I'm talking a lot okay let's play our weekly game of did Dan forget any teams from Friday or did everybody play over the weekend uh doo doo doo doo doo Boston good or Lando good Phoenix good Memphis good Miami good Nick's good Chicago Toronto Detroit we didn't talk about Sacramento we didn't talk about  Houston we didn't talk about and Golden State we didn't talk about so we got four more lucky for you guys those teams are not all that complicated but let's spend a minute with Detroit because they are very bad by and bogdanovich is gonna help them when he comes back he's likely to play a decent chunk of minutes because frankly they need somebody that can score the damn basketball  I was happy to see Jalen Duren come back he came off the bench and he does find me he played 29 minutes that's sort of the more important parts so get him fired back up Marvin Bagley is now a no longer an option Isaiah Stewart was okay and this ball game but he also falls off the cliff  the other name you're watching there in addition to the fact that Ozark Thompson has slowed down which should be a surprise to literally nobody because like everything he was doing was way out over his skis  I probably profiles more as like more this top one hundred kind of guy  is Jade and Ivy who has these big issues with his Fantasy game  do we know if he can overcome them I'm inclined to think know people keep asking me if you live like is he in automatic pickup he's had a couple of really good games he's had some very good shooting games to get there he's not a great foul shooter he's typically not that great field goal percent guy he's not going to be the biggest assist dude because Kate is back that's the way that he could have potentially floated his numbers so I you know I picked them up on a keeper League team I think it was I can't remember where I had him in like one or two spots just to see what happens but I'm I think the odds that Ivy has 12 team value are pretty low but not all the way at zero  what he has done is rendered poor Alec Burks unusable and so that's fine  what was the other team I mentioned the Sacramento Kings not a ton of surprises there Keegan Murray's missed a couple here and Harrison Barnes has been the guy to do a little bit more  a couple extra shots from Malik monk as well  both those guys profile more as head to head tie plays as a to Roto and then there's a chance that Keegan's back for the next ball game anyway so  cool man  what was the other team I said we were missing here a Houston and Golden State all right we're zipping down the board everybody watching is going to get dizzy from watching me slide up the the list of teams here  Jabari Smith Jr is that a couple of really good ball games in a row admittedly he's shot the ball better but you could also call that a bit of a leveling off for him and that's good and I dedicated one a full tweet to Jabari Smith Jr over the weekend I think  which is basically like I'll admit I was too nervous to draft him because  I didn't know if his stats that would come around fast enough  and  like I said I think the way I phrased it during the draft season was like this is a guy who has fantasy appeal because he can score hit threes rebound get steals blocks  and there's like he's not awful at the free throw line and he'll do it on low turnover so there is a peel there but my great fear was really actually get any opportunity with all the new bodies they brought in and the more that Alpine is doing this year and if he does even are we sure that the percentages are gonna follow  so I avoided him because I thought this too many question marks here and right now he's  doing about where he was drafted and he's number 85 and 9 cat and and honestly you take that  and I'm happy for the dude even if I don't have him on teams I'm happy for him I was just too nervous to take the plunge  I think that's really the only note on the Rockets Freddy and Lead has been a top 40 guy the last week or two but overall that hasn't moved his numbers very much steals are still going up guys he's only a 0.7 so you can still buy on him although I don't know anybody's selling on Van believe because he's averaging 17 and nine and I think they're probably aware the only thing he hasn't done is get just deals  Golden State's the other one Draymond Green is coming back so everything's about to get a board shuffling for the Warriors Chris Paul was a lot of fun well Draymond was out he will likely take a little bit of a hit but CP3s sitting around number 60 right now and nine cat while still only shooting 40% so even though presumably the assist will come down I would assume the field goal present eventually ticks back up to something in the mid-40s and so those will kind of counterweight each other and no I'm not super worried about it Klay Thompson's been a little bit better lately at least he's pushed himself back inside the top 200 for the year I know shutters you're holding on Clay your probably not worried about the shark on Looney thing now with Raymond coming back and then Andrew Wiggins man I  don't know what's wrong with him  I've said it basically every week since this season started  I think he's broken  I don't understand how or why I just think something's mentally wrong or physically could be physically too but if it feels like he's mentally snapped it and so I don't really have a problem with dropping Wiggins in most nine CAD formats and there's a chance he wakes up at some point later this year but I mean there's no guarantee because if he really is like kind of semi broken  he's killing your fantasy team while you're waiting on it  let's do a quick look at Monday I don't think we're gonna have time for questions today sorry guys this shows running very very long I'll do a quick scan of the chat room for any sort of big picture stuff I want to do but I don't think we'll have a whole lot of time luckily we talked about all 10 of these teams because we just profiled all 30 in our weekend review but very quickly in case you guys forgot what we're looking for tonight Detroit very little J and Ivy and then the health of Jalen Duren Washington you know this presumably should be a tighter ball game so hopefully the starters get to go Lakers health status of any of those sort of fringy rotation guys but then if they're all out do you give a look at Tori and Prince Philly do I or don't die try Nick button  hmm  screw it I'll play him  I'm gonna regret it I know it Blazers you know the scoot growth Arc you can watch that every game if you want to but you know  I know we all like watching young guys so when he does have kind of the Breakout game You're Gonna Want to be there to see it when it happens but even when that happens it's not a guarantee that it'll happen again for another two weeks so just know you know it's gonna be a sign wave I'll be ups and downs the trend line will be upward  we'll get there  Pacers did we talk about the Pacers at all  I think I skipped the Pacers guys sorry about that I did miss one team did somebody in the showroom tell me that let's go to the chat and see if somebody was like Dan you didn't talk about the Pacers  no but I didn't anyway starter iteration buddy hield is magical um honestly bennedict mathurin coming off the bench is is he's not gonna be a 12 team or but at least it's probably a little bit better for his confidence  Aaron East Smith has missed time and that's allowed Obi topping to do a little bit extra but that's a path you don't want to walk down unless you're feeling real saucy  and that's kind of it for Indiana I think it's just nice to see buddy hield getting a chance which again like I didn't draft him because by all accounts he was not part of their plans this year but the poor play of mathura and other fringy guys on that team kind of forced Rick Carlisle's hands they all right buddy I know we haven't got an extension with you on the trade block but frankly we need you in the starting lineup he's embraced it so if you squatted on him have at it he got dropped in a couple of leaks I'm in I put in a big old Fab bid in him on him on a in a Yahoo public prize league and I got him and cool  Pelicans we talked about you know what's the do I do I or don't die on Dyson Daniels is kind of the only one there you can keep an eye on Alvarado if you want Utah's all about health tonight we need to know who's playing is marketing back is Clarkson back  who's if one of them is back and not the other that could also determine how we roll with this team and Walker Kessler as well nuggets nothing  nothing and then the Clippers  I know we could say we're watching the the three stars but they're figuring out slowly but surely they figured it out it's really more about Norm Powell for me is Norman Powell gonna be playable  by the way Clippers are five and a half Point favorite for this game that's what surprising all the Denver's on a back-to-back so maybe that's the culprit there if I did Denver play yesterday  yeah they played yesterday  okay  quick very quick look at the chat room because we're already an hour and 10 minutes in you guys are gonna hear me scanning the questions to see if anything I think I may be didn't talk about but should have okay I like this one where do you see dejounte Murray and Jimmy Butler as this season progresses  I don't see any reason why Jimmy Butler won't continue his like reasonably paced a scent up the board he was down in the 7080 range he's at 36 right now the assists and the steals have been trending up and I have every reason to believe that they will continue to do so dejounte Murray was someone that I thought would be in the mid to late 30s but would be healthy so he'd be better totals than per game right now he's had a couple of bad ones in a row that's dropped him into the 40s he'll go on a hot stretch here in the next week or two that'll probably push him back up into the late 30s and that hopefully takes care of that question  let's see who else on this chat board did I not talk about all ready  hmm Merry Christmas Middleton I haven't talked about someone on Twitter said I know you said to avoid him like the plague but what do I do if I'm stuck with him right now and that's basically what this question is Brian says is a time to drop him  I don't know is my answer if you have him right now because now he's dealing with Achilles issue he was just finally starting to get to playable level and an injury popped up and I don't like hearing about Achilles I don't think you're dropping Middleton if you have him you probably have to stick it out but hopefully you guys he did to my warning and don't have to deal with this  what else do we got  um question about selling Michael Porter Jr I think I'd rather do that in its own separate show but honestly guys like top 60 is a pretty reasonable spot for him to be in so I'm okay with that  is the time to drop Jonathan Isaac yeah probably I don't know I mean we picked him up when he had 20 minutes and then he went back down to 13 and if it feels like they want to keep him in the 13th range unless he's playing extraordinarily well and like ate his Wheaties that day  I don't know that he's a guy you can just have sit on your team  um let's see here should I stash Ben Simmons guys I'm real pessimistic on Simmons and I have been basically my entire adult life  I honestly don't know if he plays again this season which is probably not fair or maybe he does come back for like a game that goes back down I would not actually I have him on one Roto games cap team because it doesn't really hurt to do so but if he's like giving you zero and you can't I have no problem with the drop their uh let's see here what do we got  lots of folks chatting amongst themselves JP says Pistons are gonna win their first one tonight in a long time I hope so man I don't want to see a team win that lose that many games in a row that's sad  let's see here anything else that needs to be discussed Oh Marcus Smart he came up in a couple of questions should he be stashed so  kind I mean he's probably still out another couple of weeks my guess would be two more weeks out  and he was not a top one hundred  Roto guy when he went down although some of that was because in a very unsightly High number of turnovers if you're hunting turnovers he was inside so I'm gonna say yeah I think we're close enough to stash Marcus Smart assuming we get him back in about two weeks that's about the length of time you'd stash a guy with his  per game performance level and I think an hour and 15 is enough don't you guys yeah thank you for all the good questions folks I'm sorry I didn't get to all of them
