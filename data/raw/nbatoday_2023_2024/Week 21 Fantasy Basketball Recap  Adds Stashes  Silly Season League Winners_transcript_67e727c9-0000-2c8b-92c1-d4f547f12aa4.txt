welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast hey everybody it's happening show number two here on this lovely Friday  it's a week in review episode of fantasy NBA today this is a sports ethos presentation I'm your host  Dan vests  even still after all this time I remained investors I'm at Dan Vespers on Twitter that's really I say follow me on social media but I don't use the other ones I'm too old  I'm too old  for ticket and talking or Graham and I know people my age using Instagram I get it  my age does not match my internal clock  so sorry Twitter only but that's fine because that's like that's where you go if you want the quick stuff that's what we do anyway  click no here before we dive in on a big show I want to remind everybody that baseball season is upon us if any of you that listen to this show follow baseball please go listen to my good buddy Joe's show its fantasy MLB today easy right this is fantasy NBA today it's fantasy MLB today that is available on all normal platforms some of them episodes also showing up here on the YouTube page  and go check out the baseball draft guide which is available in the baseball fantasy pass or the all-sport pass which is quite probably my top suggestions since many of you have the NBA one anyway  we're going to be talking about is and you can see this on your screen in fact we'll make it a little bit bigger for you there we go it's a weak 21 and review you guys can tell me it's weak 20 it's not it's period to 20 but remember two weeks got combined over the All-Star break this is actually the 21st week of the NBA season  so I'm just going by chunks of seven  okay keep it simple no weirdness for scheduling quirks  it's gonna Focus mostly on the the games over the last four to five days it might creep into the last weekend but more than anything I want to remind everybody this show as all of our recap shows is not about schedules  that's what the other show is for this show is about guys you can potentially hold for  extreme small you know short length production  rest of season guys things of that nature if you're looking for your quick hitter streamer  that's our other Daily Show that's why I did two shows every single day this week  and last week come to think of it  and a reminder of course to follow me on Twitter at the investors follow ethos fantasy BK and like rate and subscribe if you're new

right there right the show  and all goes a long way  let's get into the ads is your favorite thing of the week so we'll break these suckers down Matisse five bull but he's died ball and yes obviously some of this has to do with games in Jeremy Grant is out games and Anthony Simons is out game's Warehouse in continues to be out  well I get it player shooting sharp the you know Portland's got a lot of guys that rotated into and out of the lineup but here's the thing  now that they've fully embraced the tank things often change in just the way a team plays basketball  it gets more open  they don't play much in the way of like legitimate defense guys are not gonna sell out and take a bunch of charges  when they know their team isn't really trying all that hard to win so what you're going to get is this weird  flip and it happens every year with teams that are tanking  and frankly it happens a lot just at the end of a season because you get the closer you get to the end of the season the more teams that have basically given up on the year and you start to see players say oh they're still trying out there yeah but it's just a slightly different kind of try and I say this because  it reflects favorably on guys who get big-time fantasy stats in junk ball  so for thigh bowl a guy who I mean this is a dude who and starters minutes can average four defensive stats even when a game kind of matters a little bit he can average over three but once the game's get so wooly like this nobody's taking care of the basketball nobody really cares no one's taking the Blazers seriously there's gonna come in and throw it around and they know they're going to win at the end of the of you know 48 minutes Bible is going to be getting Steals and blocks  and even better rate than prior Bible the way that he pushes himself up the board farther is by hitting a three-pointer or grabbing a rebound and some of that stuff happens some of that stuff doesn't somebody has to do with the other guys that are on the court but right now just the way the Portland's playing games as a team  it's pretty easy for him to hit Top 100 value almost on two categories alone  I'm in Thompson he was a  probable add when operation went down a week ago about a week ago a little bit less than that with an injury that now we know is keeping him out for the rest of the regular season the Assumption there was that Thompson would pick up at least four or five of the scoan minutes with the Rockets going smaller indeed it looks like that's probably going to happen and he has a an extremely robust Fantasy game that now we're getting shown a little bit more and we saw it a bit when Freddie Van fleet was out that was sort of like the oh I'm in Thompson this guy can put up some damn fantasy stats  well Shane being out is creating the same  ish not the same slightly less but  a similarly interesting is probably a better way to describe it Avenue and so Thompson someone that needs to be rostered everywhere  I generally feel the same way about Bible now obviously if a couple guys come back for Portland then maybe his job shrinks up a little bit but it doesn't feel like like that's not gonna happen Portland's given guys rest days all over the place that  as long as I was not one of the ones getting it  anyway Andrew Wiggins is a little bit farther down my board but I do think he's an ad for Golden State he sort of a low-end guy but belongs on rosters as he's now sort of gotten his legs back underneath him  not my favorite if you don't want to pick him up honestly I don't care and frankly maybe he belongs in the doesn't matter group that we talked about on the show now guys that are just gonna sit between 100 and 150 and there's almost no difference between them and there's almost no difference if you play a more you don't  there's all a shot that this next named Bruce Brown also ends up in that group  but with Gary Trent out I think Brown stays above that threshold that means that there's enough  shot basically field goal attempt available to where Bruce can be more than just five rebound five assist and hope for some other stuff guy it's now it's suddenly okay well you know we're probably Gonna Get You 10 shots of ball game when Trent comes back I don't know and maybe that's in a few hours we'll get an update on the Raptors game here in the next hour and a half probably if Gary Trent is back okay maybe Bruce Brown doesn't belong in a full you know all the way in add maybe he becomes more of a watch list guy but for right this moment we don't  we don't have an update on  Gary Trent so I'm gonna assume that he's out and so Bruce Brown belongs on rosters while that's going on so I'm gonna call him an ad because I think he might actually stick even after Gary comes back call it a 30% chance that's reason to add a guy  cam Johnson is on the ads board he probably didn't get dropped in your league because it wasn't out off for all that long but you know their playoffs out there were guys that are hurt for a week and a half whatever it is they get up getting dropped cams roster ship is down to 77 that's that's falling pretty hard so again odds are he's on a team odds are this is a name that won't matter to you but if Cam Johnson got dropped you better go out and look for him immediately and then TJ McConnell is a really interesting one because he's not playing that much  and yet over the last month he's number 85 in 19 minutes per Ball Game 12 points 5 assists 1.3 steals they're not asking him to do a whole lot more than that now if Halliburton happens to miss the game or if nem heart misses a game you'll probably see those minutes tick up and then you sort of tap into the upside with McConnell  but really outside of one bad game TJ has been pretty freaking good for about the last oh I don't know does in games in a row  he pretty much always gets you between four and seven assists  he shoots a great percentage because he doesn't shoot three-pointers basically at one game early as your way you made like four or five three-pointers mostly it's zero or one his steals are always super high because he's just a ball Hawk and  you know keeping his minutes around 20 has actually been kind of good for TJ because it gives him the energy to go a little bigger every once in a while he's had you know one or two games over this hot spell where he got 27 minutes and he exploded in those games but in the other ones they're just like Go full motor gets deals run run run run run run run make some passes get into the pain hit those weird little baby jumpers shoot 50% or better  and go get your sort of normal fantasy stats and it's one of those things where like  I kept looking at it like how can this possibly hold but I do think the matter injury has now played a role here it's just opened up a handful of extra minutes that weren't there before at least not regularly so all of a sudden McConnell's guy that belongs on rosters just end Hotel  a couple of reminders guys that were on last week or the week before or both nasri Daniel Gafford Kelly Olynyk please do just a quick sweep through your league make sure those guys are on rosters you know nine out of every 10 League's the answers gonna be yes but maybe you are in that one out of 10 League's where one of those guys isn't somebody may have dropped nazre if you're in a playoff battle because you had two game week maybe someone forgot assumed Gafford was on a team Kelly Olynyk people are still asking me on Twitter if they should you use him as just a streaming slot  I don't know man  like I don't know why this is still happening but it happens from time to time again you're gonna hear this and you're gonna be like no not my league and  by and large you're probably right but just quick check it  strong a whole is the next name on the board Trey Murphy who finally had his first slow game in a while but the Pelicans got blown out there is a chicken and egg thing going on with Trey Murphy and Pelicans good game versus Pelicans bad game he is sort of  the barometer if Trey Murphy's hot they're destroying teams because they can space the floor and a trademark he's not then everybody can collapse and the pills get run out of the building like there's no there's very little in between for that New Orleans Club  Denny obvious is a stronghold although I think he just got listed his questionable right before we went on air  he  yes and tyus Jones by the way just got listed doubtful so that'll  open up something else down in Washington yeah and you're going to see more guys starting to get some rest on that team they're moving into a back-to-back so I would assume these some of these guys sit and one and play the other whatever  Trey man who was back for the Hornets he was a strong hold while he was out I didn't think he was going to be out for all that long and now he's back Grace and Allen who never should have gotten dropped but did in some spots he's a stronghold keyonte George for Utah specialty now moving into a very good scheduling pocket Klay Thompson maybe belongs in the soft hole but I'm going to keep him because you know a guy that can it for three pointers a game is even if a lot of his stuff has been kind of annoying this year as he's aged very rapidly there is something to be said for a guy that can go that level of elite in a category herb Jones still a hole out in New Orleans he's been very good pretty much since Dyson Daniels went down us our Thompson who's been battling and nasty flew all week I expect him back at some point soon there's just only so long a guy can be out with a cold or a flu bug unless they tell us something else is going on hold and then Gary Trent Jr who's dealing with the groin thing he's been questionable before every game so far this week he has got downgraded a doubtful and then now we sort of hold our breath for tonight  he's a strong hole in any League where you can use putting up some very big numbers before we went down and there's every reason to believe that those generally picked back up when he returns  soft holds Aaron neesmith Marvin Bagley Vince Williams Junior these sort of three two really different kinds of players these Smith is a soft hold because I do think with the minutes he's going to get for Indiana he probably does pretty reliably get to the top on 100 range and that's a guy that you should have on a roster even if just a few things don't break his way he falls back into that doesn't matter group I just with Nesmith at feels like  maybe a better than 50/50 shot he gets to the top end of that doesn't matter collection which is basically a startable player and then Bagley and Vince Williams these guys are soft holds but only because I don't really know when they're coming back we've heard very little on either of them  unfortunately Ron Holmes is also out in Washington that's just then just on vukovich just came over so maybe he ends up playing a little bit  in the meantime  I'm assuming Marvin back well  because that's your brief phrase that I think Vince Williams is probably back at some point in the next week or two Bagley I really don't know the he might just be done for all we know try to hold a little bit longer basically I'm trying to hold these guys until we get some sort of injury reporting on them  at that point then we'll have a better idea of what to do but without any kind of report  can't really do anything on it  sorry lost in thought for a second there  your internet did not break  the I'm scared list Derek Lively the second um earlier this week I said I thought he was gonna be  kind of in that doesn't matter group and I think I still stand by that particular valuation on lively probably plays about 1920 minutes off the bench although if Cleveland's out then Lively moves A Cut Above that if Cleveland's in Lively probably hangs out he probably finishes in that like 120 130 140 range which again you could start that it wouldn't be the end of the world but you could also not started and it wouldn't matter  these next two really make me sad  needed a deep breath before it Isaiah hartenstein sadly is a drop  and it's the Achilles it's not because I don't love Isaiah hardest times Fantasy game you guys know that we've been massive proponents of him for as long as we possibly could be  but in 1920 minutes of ball game he starts outside the top 150  he also doesn't really have his spring so not only have the minutes been super low but the blocks of tapered off the steals of really tapered off  the rebounding is tapered off like everything is just tapered with him  and in a lot of instances more than what you'd think it would based on just a decrease of playing time it's the decrease of playing time on top of the fact that he's just not as jumpy as he was when is Achilles wasn't perpetually sore  and for a while the answer was to sit on hardenstein with the hope that maybe the Achilles gets better in the minutes that the you know the restrictor plate comes off and he gets to play 27 28 29 minutes or whatever but it just isn't happening  we are  I think we're like two months into this thing now that can't be right can it  I mean I don't think it's all that far off when did the when did the minutes cap start getting instituted know I guess it was sort of like beginning of February so it's like a month and a half at this point where limits just aren't there is a couple of games mixed in where his rebounds were all right he hasn't have a steal in a block in his last three games combined which yeah I mean that'll even out he'll probably have a you know three steel three block game coming up and we'll be pissed that we missed it but overall he's just not the same guy  and frustrating as hell because he's awesome for Fantasy when he's healthy but he's not healthy  and we're at a part of the year now where you just you can't sit on a player who's not doing stuff for you and sure wrote all you could just squat on him the whole rest of the season but they're gonna be a bunch of guys popping up here silly season mode that are just so much more fun to use the roster slot on  and the other one that makes me sad is Buddy hield who came into Philly and was just tearing the damn roof off the place but also now he's just not even playing all that much I guess that's not fair he's playing some  but not nearly as much as you'd want  21 minutes in the last ball game Off the Bench  look  me he's playing less than kind of Lowry  which frankly feels a little bit dumb but it is what it is right now  with heel you could hang on a little bit longer if you wanted to just to see if this thing pivots back in the other direction  but Lively I think he's a doesn't matter guy hardened shine I think you could even call him a doesn't matter Guy trayce Jackson Davis is the other name here liable to be dropped once Steph comes back and Steph is targeting a return tomorrow Saturday in the Warriors game against the Lakers  trayce Jackson Davis was getting bonus run because the Warriors wanted a rim Runner a big jumper alongside Chris Paul who likely now slides back I would assume Chris Paul Comes Back Off the Bench with C with Steph coming back so Chris Paul will probably play with Jackson Davis and those lineups but they don't need him in the starting five anymore because they can go back to the sort of the Steph Klay  space the other guys not providing much in the way of space but Steph running pick and rolls with Draymond Dre gets on the short role that kind of thing is that same stuff the worries have been running forever that trayce Jackson Davis  you know passing I'm sure we'll come along but it's not really quite there yet  big watch list coming up but before we do I wanted to re welcome everybody to the show a lot of viewers on Twitter right now big big number over there it's been very

I'll pause on a few names where I deem necessary Dillon Brooks is on the watch list because of Alfred and Schengen being out we saw Brooks actually became fantasy playable when we was down he has hasn't quite taken the big usage Mega bump  with shengwen out that I thought was possible  but it doesn't mean that it won't still happen  and the brook starts taking 15 16 shots a game then he ends up on fantasy rosters if he doesn't he doesn't great  keep it business like  slo-mo out in Minnesota Kyle Anderson I've had him perpetually on my watch list and I know a number of people ask me why he wasn't an ad  and I'll say the same thing again that I said on that show early this week he's just not  he doesn't have the same job on this year's Wolves roster that he had on last year's Wolves roster  for whatever reason the pieces fit differently so he doesn't have to distribute as much Steals and blocks haven't been as high and without that stuff then he's not a fantasy play at least not in 12 team members Jordan Goodwin if he starts you start me actually was active for the last ball game but he came off the bench and didn't play all that much so start if you if he starts you start among Goodwin Santi aldama generally borderline playable when JJJ is out otherwise I don't think I'm doing it Jake laravia I mean this watch list is all Grizzlies for the next quarter like of the our Jack Jake laravia who is pretty good at rebounding and getting steals but can't shoot so makes him a pretty tough 12 team her John conchar who actually quietly has an amazing nine category game specially if you're punt points but he's another guy we don't really if he knows he's playing every game so Trey Jameson back up to the backup big man  uh and that's all the Grizzlies I have on the board is scant six of them think I said on yesterday's show that all repeat here for this weekly show when it comes to the Griz  you pretty much just have to wait until like an hour before the game to make your call if it's head to head at least and then wrote a lot of League's the moves are for the next day so you can't even really do it so what would you do in Roto well of the six names I just mentioned you try to figure out the ones that you like the most and you just squat on until they're getting a start so for me that's good win it's conchar that's Luke Kennard and if they have a start and enough guys are out around them then I would use them for you know one game or whatever it is against the game's Gap and say all right  maybe we can do this  Grant Williams is on the watch list you could also probably put him on the doesn't matter Club although he's been better than that lately so then the question is is a cooldown coming and  I'm inclined to think the answer is yeah but we haven't really seen it yet and his role is staying relatively large you know a lot of guys have been out on Charlotte  I'm kind of whipping out with Grant Williams and I'm okay with that doesn't hurt my feelings to know that I'm not really playing all that much Brandon pajama is on the watch list for me he was streamable with Steph out and he would have been on the injury replacement board but now that we assume step is back tomorrow for jameskii drops back from injury replacement to watch list Rashawn Holmes is on the watch list only because of his health status if Holmes is in then you play him because that means he'd be starting if holds his starting then he has the oh like easy 100 range that's that's a freaking no-brainer their games are tomorrow and Sunday so we probably won't know more about homes and til tomorrow so you don't need to really worry about that today but he is definitely a player to keep an eye on Norman Powell depending on what the Clippers do it sounds like Kawaii is not missing this ball game neither is Paul George we don't know about James Harden but as we saw in yesterday's game bones Hyland was actually the guy that stepped up and had a big role really hot tomorrow is on the watch list in case he ever starts to rebound I mean I don't expect it given what we've seen so far but he is shooting the ball at an extraordinary clip so if you had one more thing  then he'd be playable but I don't think that one thing is coming  and here's some far-reaching names Jonathan Isaac this is not a head-to-head move  but if ever there was a time to consider it in head-to-head it would be right around now or Lando plays every other day starting from Wednesday of this week two days ago until Saturday of next week so the schedules not particularly heavy but they go to day they go Sunday they go Tuesday Thursday Saturday of next week if you are in a dog fight in threes and defensive stats Jonathan Isaac could potentially help when you a week because no one else is gonna touch him because he's a disaster waiting to happen  but again he's liable to play in all of those ball games and that's the thing you really worried about with him Alexi poker chefski's a watch list guy just to kind of see what his job looks like in Charlotte he played a decent chunk of minutes in the last ball game and he put up an okay fantasy line  but I gotta see that again and again and again and probably honestly two or three more times from like all right fine I buy it  I don't yet I don't yet  but he has an interesting Fantasy game we've known that for a while  when teams going to Big Time tanks  weird stuff happens  key on Ellis out in Sacramento though it sounds like all of the king's normal starters were  participants in practice today so I would assume that key on Ellis goes back to the bench and then jock landale out of Houston is interesting as the backup center is minutes have been around 26 in each of the two games since it sengun went down  which is borderline and that's why he's on the watch list up and now everybody's favorite page  ta-da the injury replacement board this is actually my favorite page even more so than the ads  the injury replacement board at this time of year  has some like legitimate studs Blended in on it  and for me a guy who plays mostly Roto being able to isolate and play dude stepping into a giant role that just didn't have it prior to an injury happening  that's like gold  because you can just pluck those guys off the waiver while throwing a huge line into your lineup and then move on two days later if you need to  its Roto streaming it's that have had to head Roadhouse streaming is you're looking for the one game sample where a guy goes crazy head to head you're looking for the guy who plays the most games the fewest number of days even if they suck on half of them you just want minutes  Roto you want numbers  and so there's some big names on this list the big names of course are Josh Hart who's been dominating for a while now and continues to do so nearly at a 2020 triple double Al Horford who's been great with porzingis sitting big outputting up those nice numbers Brazilian mitsch with Cody Martin out in Charlotte has been putting up some nice numbers Duncan Robinson  Tim Hardaway Jr with Luca out  these are guys that are putting up like big fill-in numbers and then bones Island actually  had a way better than expected ballgame with no Harden I don't think it would be that good again but felt like we needed to give him a shout out and then there's sort of like the next tear down of injury replacement guys that are still putting up pretty good lines but maybe Trend a little bit closer to the maybe pile the doesn't matter pile  Kelly Huber Jr Sam Houser Payton Pritchard  those guys of course with Boston playing back-to-backs against some really bad teams so you'll see more guys than just forcing his out for those  Nick Richards with Mark Williams out is very much kind of like an inbetweener Malik Beesley who missed the last ball game but Middleton being in between her kind of guy I don't know I started to slouch a little bit there let's stick let's let's sit back up again Pat Beverley if Middleton Plus  uh that's time it was Beasley but if Dame sits Pat Bev would be sort of a middling one Dennis Schroder I think is middling now that camp Thomas is back Georges niang is kind of middling with Max Drew's out  Corey kispert I actually like a fair amount he doesn't have a super robust nine cat game is typically points threes on good percentages which is kind of hard to get  but I like his Britain you can put them at the top of this secondary group and then Simone fontecchio with us our Thompson out because he much like kispert doesn't have a super robust nine category game but does but does score and hit threes and get some Steals and so there's oftentimes enough there it's just there's no guarantee that it's gonna be enough every day and then the only name I think I skipped one I was trying to going out of order on this was Paul Reed who I can continue to look at and go  why am I so skeptical after I gave  a glowing recommendation to this dude and I just keep feeling like the other shoes gonna drop  and he puts up good fantasy numbers and even when his minutes were a little bit lower he was still able to squeeze out a little bit of stuff something about Paul re just makes me nervous and I can't put my finger on why but that said  he's a start right now  unquestionably Paul Reed is a start right now so nervous or not nervous Dan you better get over it because this is a guy that belongs in lineups  Quick Check of the chat room see if anybody brought any names up that I didn't talk about um  we're not doing the like do I start this guy or the other guy  uh someone says trayce Jackson is a strong hole I think I disagree on that one I you know a lot of his big surge here was was without Steph and as I said earlier on I think you'll see him move more to that smaller Reserve role although did he earn himself a few more minutes maybe  I just think the Warriors are in a weird position because you know c3's not gonna lose much in the way of minutes and Wiggins is now ramped back up to normal minutes and Clay's got his normal minutes and got his normal minutes and you just got to slot step in and say all right well where  where is it coming from  and it's going to be  you know a little bit from a couple different places but like if you look at the last ball game you say all right well where you know who got more minutes than usual come on Looney played 17 minutes  maybe that goes to maybe all of his minutes go to trace Jackson Davis who again like 25 minutes for him it doesn't seem likely to repeat itself  so I disagree on the stronghold if you really wanted to put them in soft hold you could uh but I would beg of you guys to look at the numbers he was putting up in the games before Steph got hurt and a couple in there where he started to get hot and Steve Kerr tends to reward guys as they start to play a little bit better but yeah I mean we're talking about a guy who went a month without  clearing 12 minutes ballgame basically  so call it a soft hold if you want that's his aggressive as I'm willing to get  on Jackson Davis who  the field goal percent is kind of floating him lately he had a couple Big Blocks Games mixed in but he also had a couple games where he got none  so don't don't overextend yourself here  even if he is what you'd call a soft hole  over the two weeks without Steph and weakened some odd um  he still  yeah I mean these last couple where he's played 25 26 minutes he's been better but he's also shot 30% at the foul line he's actually outside the top one 40 because of free throw shooting over that span you say oh well if you take that out yeah okay maybe but he also shooting 76% from the field over that stretch 25 minutes 11 and 8 with 1.3 blocks could you call that sustainable that part is if you don't worry about the percentage is leveling off and that's outside the top 100 barely but it is  so uh I'd go as high as soft hold  one of the names that folks bring up that maybe I didn't Kai Jones not interested  um  many names here that I didn't cover on today's show nickeil Alexander Walker  no  people asking questions like I didn't do a whole thing at the very beginning of the show saying this is not a streaming show  this episode is a weekend review show where if you're trying to figure out what to do with streaming go listen to the other one I went into a lot of details almost a half an hour on streaming because we talked about the weekend we talked about early next week  we talked about which teams to isolate it's all in there I promise a bad schedule is good schedule pickups drops all that good stuff this show is about the guys that I think can make an impact in that sort of 100 range or better versus outside of it are they schedule plays or are they playing every day guys are they hold through bad schedules as it that kind of thing that's what these shows are about these are the big overarching ones and then in our other show right now because we're in the playoffs we do break them up into two episodes that's where we really take the microscope to okay what guys are good enough  now because they're
