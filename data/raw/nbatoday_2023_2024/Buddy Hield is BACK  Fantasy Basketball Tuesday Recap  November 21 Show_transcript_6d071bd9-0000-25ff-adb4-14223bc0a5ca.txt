welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  show two on this Wednesday morning my voice remains in a state of disarray but we will power our way through the show best we can because there are things to discuss from a five game Tuesday and be a cup Tuesday mind you and a fortune game Wednesday lookahead God help us all as we prepare for the insanity that is coming up this evening of course there are the reasons behind this are obvious tomorrow is Thanksgiving Happy Thanksgiving in advance everybody because we won't have a show tomorrow  and Seasons passed I put out a show on Thanksgiving morning for reasons I don't entirely know I think I just had this bee in my Bonnet about making sure I had a show out every day but now we're doing multiple shows on Mondays Tuesdays Wednesdays some Thursdays they're just sort of isn't a reason for me to feel like I need to have a show specifically on Thursday when we've got like eight shows a week happening right now anyway so anyway all that said I am Dan bass Bridge Welcome to our Tuesday recap show and Wednesday preview edition of fantasy NBA today this show is as all shows are a sports ethos presentation  if you guys do one thing for me today in addition to liking and subscribing and finding me on Twitter at the end best but it is absolutely positively to check out Sports ethos.com their news feed is amazing I'll say this and like full disclosure  I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie to you guys that would be a bad way to gain listeners  underdogs feed is faster  but their feet all so doesn't have any analysis so if you're confident then you can make all the right calls yourself with just the new okay but if you'd like a feed that may be is minute on minute or two behind because someone is typing analysis on fantasy news ethos fantasy BK is that feet I'm gonna type it up it's not in the show's description perhaps that's a bit of an oversight on my part but I am going to put it in the live YouTube chat throw it up on the screen for folks that are watching now or after the fact that is the ethos fantasy Newsfeed its ethos fantasy BK it's one of the better decisions you'll make today if you go give them a follow that we get your Android NBA news with analysis from the best Minds on fantasy planet Earth all in one sweeping Twitter feed  let's look at what happened yesterday and we can just sort of Mosey our way through the card today  Toronto  let me take the  Twitter feed off the board so my head slides back down into the YouTube Corner as it were Toronto got smoked by in Orlando team that is playing some really good defense these days very impressive defense from the magic they're winning at home and on the road and that's that thing defense translates they always talk about you want to go win on the road you got to be able to guard somebody and the magic are garden somebody they're doing it without Wendell Carter Junior who may Place holder at this point golgappas he had seven defensive stats yesterday he went one for four at the free throw line but again who cares when you have seven defensive stats he and Moe Vagner continued to kind of alterat who has the better ball games and if you really wanted to sort of dive down to the very Nubs of it  but Todd Zay has been streamable  while Wendell Carter Junior has been out  the funny thing is that he wasn't even really playing before that a mo vogner is hanging around like near the edge of the top 150 well Wendell's been shelved mostly because he hasn't had any defensive stats and that's not to say that that is going to keep up three and a half defensive stats long-term as you see a fly whiz past my face on the live video feed here  golga 8.7 boards 1.4 steals about two blocks per game since Wendell Carter Junior white down and doing a 24 minutes a night  we've seen but today enough to know the blocks are something that he can often sustain the rebounds he can usually sustain the field goal percent is better than usual right now for him he had a tendency in the past to take kind of ill-advised shots and it seems like maybe that's not happening right now because he's just not really taking any shots at all  and so not again I don't think that these numbers hold because they've been floated by two or three gigantic games but if you aggregated the gigantic game's have weighed heavily enough to counterbalance the weak ones so you can play despite he and Wagner basically most nights splitting the minutes down the middle go go got extra in this ball game just because he was very effective in it  uh so yeah feel free if you need Center stats it seems like he's actually good enough and and we don't have an exact timeline on window Carter Juniors return so  enjoy game got out of hand somewhat early the Raptors were able to play a lot of their starters around 30 minutes which I guess is sort of like a Saving Grace in an otherwise ugly ball game yakka portal fouled out in 23 minutes so don't worry about that he had been trending up I think he'll continue to Trend that way when the foul out is not on the table Dennis Schroder did have 24 points on very efficient shooting all the way we've continued to see him sliding he's about round one one 20 range or so over the last two weeks which is more like what we expected of him overall he's still around 80 because he got off to that towards start I just I still feel like he's gonna slide back towards 100  Scotty Barnes you've seen a little bit of a Slowdown there as well his gigantic start his continued to sort of float it but he's been more like a top 50 play over the last couple of weeks after a top 10 play to start the year  he's at number 16 right now ah Pascal siakam is very slowly moving up the board but then the guy who was on our buy show yesterday was ogn and Nobby who actually got off to a quick start in this ball game with a bunch of blocks and whatnot but then it didn't hold and he's still sitting kind of near the edge of the top 100 and remains a pretty firm by low candidate if you can get him  Jalen Suggs has been amazing this year and he continues to be amazing he's number 66 in nine cat despite not shooting the ball all that well overall mostly because he is freaking everywhere on defense two more steals for Suggs shot the ball better in this ball game and if you get a good field goal percent game out of sucks you're really cooking you only play 21 minutes because the bench was actually building a lead and so the magic just let him roll in the first half and then we had garbage time in the second half so guys like Cole Anthony got 29 minutes in this ball game Gary Harris saw 23 Off the Bench those are the sort of the big ones impacted by the blowout and sort of the bench running a heavy but first of all you're not picking up Cola Anthony after one good ball game Suggs has been the guy and he will likely continue to be Cleveland beat Philly and overtime without Donovan Mitchell and without Charis Levert which is pretty amazing Darius Garland finally got it goin 32 points 5 boards eight assists three steals two three-pointers for Garland one big ball game enough to push him inside the top 100 finally finally  still at 4.7 turnovers per game that's a number that is just it's gonna have to come down at some point or you just won't get anywhere near his actual potential in ATP but the other stuff starting to look a little bit more like what we expected and so that's good news on the Garland front probably not a low after this ballgame Max Drew's I just want to take a second to celebrate again he's back inside the top 50 after this ball game at number 49 on the basketball monster board we need his blocks number was going to come down and it has he's now at 0.6 blocks per game remember when he was up at 1 steals are at one which again I don't think that's going to get really any higher the resounding an amazing thing with stress this year is that he's rebounding in a way we just never expected  but as minutes are consistently among the top on the team he actually played the most minutes in this bowl game at 44 out of the 53 total available mids and there's just no reason to think he's going anywhere yeah he got more to do with no Donovan Mitchell and no Charis Levert more shots but like  the boards the assists the steals the blocks they're better than we expected and then when guys missed a game we get a little extra scoring  Jared Allen was a Buy Low yesterday he went for 26 and 13 on a terrific volume and he's been a big reason why they've been able to beat up on some large and substantial opponents  and we saw his minutes finally get up to 35 so the cap may be lifted I don't know if that means you can still buy low item after this ball game I guess is probably not but still that's why we had him on the Bible board because eventually the minutes Gap was gonna get lifted and then we could take advantage  nothing really on the Phillies side we got new news yesterday that Kelly oubre could be back within a week amazingly I think it'll probably be more like between one and two weeks but even still that sort of dampens whatever we might have thought we could get out of a Nick bottom who had 5000 27 minutes and just sort of didn't do enough to be fantasy relevant here so you can just cast that stuff aside  don't need to worry about it I need occupied any of our brain space let's go to the next ball game well how about this one 309 combined points in regulation between the Pacers and the Hawks this is the craziest number I've seen  possibly in my life actually  because I was a baby the last time that teams were trying to score this many points in a ballgame  Tyreese Halliburton absurd absurd game he's now the number two player in nine cat and let me in this is why like you guys remember the preseason when I said Joel embiid  is a very good pick Shea and Tyreese Halliburton are the other two guys I wanted at the top of the board and I just felt like they were a click above the next group of dudes and look there they are because we just like okay I didn't know this type of game was coming but you just knew that next step was coming for a team that wants to win now  it's a big difference for Indiana there trying to win ball games all season long this year Halls gonna have to stay healthy but they're eight and five to start the season off to a good start  lots to like  and from a fantasy standpoint  a lot to like to for buddy hield who finally got a rare start play 31 minutes of this ball game at 24 points at 63 pointers yeah I shot the ball really well he didn't get steals blocks really any rebounds or assist but if he's gonna play 30 minutes in the starting lineup he needs to be at roster and he needs to be started this is a big big change for buddy hield because coming off the bench they had sort of cast him aside it seemed like they had just said look if we're not gonna get an extension going with this dude he's not part of our plan but now they're seeing he kind of needs to be part of their plan because they're not as good when he's not Benedict Matthew and it hasn't taken enough of a step forward for them to to guarantee him those small forward minutes or shooting guard minutes or whatever you want to call it and then everybody else is just sort of a mishmash of mixed pieces  so in this one what do we got well Myles Turner 11 and 9 with four blocks it's not entirely clear  why there wasn't more Miles Turner Obi topping was having a very large game Off the Bench which I you know 34 minutes here I don't think we can expect that'll happen every ball game because Jaylen Smith only played five  Bruce Brown is  getting a little bit frustrated with Bruce I got to be honest he's number one 14 he's still very close to Fantasy value all he needs really is like one big game and he's back inside the top 100 so I don't think you can drop Bruce but I also understand that if you're in a 12 team Roto League he's sort of just outside of a guy you'd want to start  we should also keep an eye on Aaron Nesmith he played 25 minutes in the starting five if he can somehow lock down starters minute if things change like  so many times we've seen the Pacers or Rick Carlisle specifically kind of tease us with  guys getting what look to be more consistent minutes and then sort of Yanks the rug out from underneath and that could happen here with Heald I mean it could happen with Aaron East Smith if we think he's gonna start to get more minutes I have no clue what the paces are going to do in their next ball game and it's coming up a few hours from now  but if he'll still the starting lineup he's a goal absolutely and if needs Smith sticks in the starting lineup which I don't think is going to be the case but we'll see then we should at least pay attention to him as well and then he'll be topping is the guy where you're like in no I don't think I really want to power forward who's not gonna be rebounding all that much  and his minutes are not secure  let's talk about the Hawks luckily there are quicker one on Yoko Kang woo quiet game when a team puts up 150 points you kind of expected everybody to have a bigger one he's in one of those little lulls he goes through but this is a game where they didn't run a normal lineup for stretches you know capella and alkaline accounted for 41 of the 48 Center minutes on the court so they had to run small first stretches and whatever the hell that means for Fantasy value  both of those guys were okay but neither one of them was all that good the nice thing is here you can probably Buy Low on a combo because every time he goes through one of these little leveling where he doesn't get as many defensive stats for a couple of days or whatever people start to freak out because he doesn't score very much they don't see the other stuff and think that the sky is falling but if you can get him for you know 90 to 100 range guy you probably should do that especially knowing that at some point this year Clinton is going to miss a week or two  just inevitable  and it'll conquer was gonna go nuts  otherwise no real surprise is there we've talked about saddiq Bey basically being a head-to-head schedule play and a Bogdan bogdanovich being a guy you can play pretty much all the time I expect Bogdan steals will continue to come down he didn't have any in this ball game buddy hit it crap ton of shots and so that kind of pasted over it but he's been good to go so far  Malcolm Brogden returned for the Blazers in a loss not expected to play in their back-to-back we'll see we don't have final word on that but you know if he sits you could probably stream Skyler maze for one more ball game I already dropped him I didn't feel like I needed to sit on Skyler maze for one more day cuz he wasn't that amazing anyway  but Brockton is a go anytime he's in there he is gonna make everybody around him better all so because you know now they have a sort of a more competent  NBA grade point guard on the floor  and that's kind of it  really from this ball game as a whole New York Kevin Durant Devin Booker the only sons that you can trust every single day grace and Allen is kind of a maybe Eric Gordon is more of a head-to-head kind of dude  and then they just sort of wait on Bradley Beal  Kevin Durant meanwhile is rolling now he's up to number eight in nine cat because as we knew it would his free throw percentage is back where it needs to be believe it or not his blocks could actually go a little higher than they are right now and the turnovers are very high for Durant he's cruising Devin Booker kind of cruising also and I think of these guys are all gonna Cruise until Bradley Beal comes back and then we'll see what they are and the Lakers in the Jazz this ball game was over by Midway through the third quarter so nobody really got normal minutes that's why Simone fontecchio played 27 on the Utah side  but John Collins survived it that's all you can ask for if you have a Utah asset Larry marketing I didn't really survive it and that was kind of it we knew the bottom was going to fall off for Jordan Clarkson at some point he was running hot and now he's sort of not anymore  you guys remember that ridiculous website am I hot or not.com well Jordan Clarkson is currently back into the knot  you know what's coming I know get hot again and when he does you want to sell it's the same story every time with Clarkson because he's not a nine cat Roto guy most of the time but they'll go through two three four games stretches where he is and he got to try to cash in if you can  get a George also a quiet ball game I mean the Jazz were terrible in this one so you can't great amount too much by it I'm not dropping George because it just feels like this is a guy they're going to let grow as the team grows because the team is bad you toss not the same Club they were last year they are down a bunch of NBA capable players and they're down Walker Kessler right now too who will help them if he can get that elbow healthy  and the Lakers took advantage so all those guys got  took care of business in three quarters  Christian Wood had a big game did a lot of work in garbage time in this one some of that was because cam reddish left early with a groin  let's say strain but it was thinking is a soreness like Lakers are on a back-to-back so I'd be pretty surprised if you saw reddish for this one which means well Max Christy actually started the second half for La I don't know what direction they're going to go in this ball game against the Mavs pretty different Personnel then Utah but in terms of the players on the Lakers you're looking at it's just the core 4 add  LeBron D'Lo at Austin Reeves those the four guys you're starting on La and I would not trust anybody else closest player I think to trust after that would be really hot tomorrow but you're not going down that path unless you basically just need scoring because that's kind of all he does for this team all the once in a while he goes through a little stretch where they asked him to rebound harder and he does it for a week or two and then he kind of forgets how all right okay I am tired just looking at this board  so um  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up

discounts and funzies over there  okay and I have to do the Ace Ventura deep breath thing except if I did it right now I'd probably cough all over the microphone although you guys haven't heard I have not a coughing fit in this show yet  we actually just got some injury news while I was looking at coughing Fitzgerald is questionable Donovan Mitchell is out for the Cavs ball game tonight  boy zdanowicz and Jalen Duren practice so we might get them back for the Sixers Sixers the Pistons here in the very near future Devin vassell says that he is going to play tonight Jayson Tatum is listed as questionable for the Celtics Aaron Nesmith this questionable Andrew nembhard his questionable and Damian Lillard is considered available which I would basically call probable for the Milwaukee Bucks  okay that's the injury news that just popped up in the last little bit let's turn our attention to this insane Wednesday card and let's see if we can make it through it without losing our minds Wizards and hornets which  you know if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all  but from a fantasy standpoint we can say a few things one is  I do still want to know what the Wizards tank philosophy  evolution is going to be  and  my guess is that they can continue to do the same crap they're doing right now because they want to lock in a bunch of losses but the one thing we saw on their last ball game was Jordan Poole finally said you know effort basically I'm gonna take all them shots and he took all them shots and so if you have Jordan Poole this is probably a time to hope that he makes a few and gets himself involved but he didn't really do anything besides shooting their last ball game the passing iteration of Jordan Poole might be done for a little bit but what does that mean for the other guys on the team does that make them all worse possibly does the team get so bad that they can afford to play their regulars a little more  and maybe we're Galaxy bringing it a little bit more than likely they're going to keep everybody in check and just keep racking up losses  but then also what does that mean for Bilal  or Bilal excuse me  could have believed  who is continues to be interesting  but not nearly as good as the hype may suggest  in that you know 26 to 30 minutes of ball game he's still not really that close to the top one hundred but we can see the outlines of it good steals good blocks  from the sort of wing position his field goal percentage has been solid so far  he's just gonna have to be more involved you know he's only taking six shots a game so far this year we need to get him up to eight nine ten shots at night  now you start to cook with something  I don't like to see the free throw percent come up but you know we'll see  Charlotte we're tracking Gordon Hayward after a couple of bad ball games he had a better one in their overtime win over the Celtics does he keep that going I don't think that Miles Bridges is going to completely detonate Heyward but maybe I'm wrong so let's just keep one eye on that Denver nothing I've made up my mind on Reggie Jackson he is not a 12 team 9 cat Roto games cap level guy so when I say somebody's not a start that basically means that I wouldn't use a games cap on him you know if a team has a really good schedule that's a different universe and a lot of guys jump into the playable if they've got three games in four nights kind of thing on the head-to-head side but  Reggie is not a guy you're using a game's cap on  Magic uh Jonathan Isaac is a question mark I mean you know we played in their last back-to-back but I do think that they kind of artificially depresses minutes you can see in the ball game yesterday Isaac only played 13 minutes still by the way managed fantasy value and only 13 minutes but does that mean that that's all he's gonna see in this one is well is another 13 when you've got the non back to backs maybe you get him up closer to 20 so how does that play out and then you know we were just talking about Go-Go batsy a moment ago  Milwaukee the well with Damian Lillard in that takes some of the stuff off the board for them Malik Beasley has been running warm lately and on a long that's going to last Bobby Portis is very much on our Burger board play Burger board being the injury guys so I think that's all pretty good Celtics the only thing we'd watch now is whether or not Jayson Tatum plays because it was gonna be a big fat nothing for them but if Tatum sits do we see them go big with an Al Horford or do they go real rangy with a Sam Houser either way you're looking at a possible plug-and-play guy there  possible  heat I spent a bunch of time I think it was yesterday's show maybe the day before talking about the Kyle Lowry's stream situation because Duncan Robinson is such an obvious fill-in for Tyler hero  but technically over the last two weeks Lowry and jacquez have each been right around that top 100 range also meaning technically they should be startable in all formats I just can't bring myself to do it for some reason  probably because I think Kyle Lowry's gonna just like his knee is gonna fall off in the middle of one of these ball games and you're going to end up eating at one point four rebound night or something like that  and he  calves well now we we already know Donovan Mitchell is out as of 10 minutes ago  Carousel if he comes back he'd be a play that's sort of it we talked about Jared Allen in the show Raptors are we witnessing the Scotty Barnes slowdown and it could you still get a top 25 for him if we think this is who he's gonna be the rest of the year which would be more like you know 40 to 50 range as a top 10 I if I could lock in a top 25 guy for Barnes I think I'd probably do it right now  Pacers we just talked about them they're on a back-to-back but he healed their in Nesmith they're kind of the guys you're paying attention to Brooklyn  can Spencer Dinwiddie clear the 12 team hump  I think the answer is no but  in Mick World anything's possible  hearty har har Hawks we just talked about as well there's not a whole lot going on there other than the Bi-Lo on okongwu Grizzlies are interesting Santee aldamas been going nuts does anybody else have a chance to step up a little bit and then they still have the Bilo on JJ Rockets nothing Sixers probably nothing I'll go like I guess I could throw the note out there that with the news that ubreak could be back within you know a week week and a half make sure somebody didn't drop him thinking he was going to be out for half the season on that first batting injury report and nobody then maybe folks forgot to add him  after the better report last week seems doubtful but you know you never know with your league  Timberwolves mostly nothing Jaden McDaniels is gonna be out for a couple of weeks with his ankle tweak and I don't expect anybody to move across the cut line but slo-mo would be the guy that's probably closest to it so keep one eye on that for the Kings Keegan's health is kind of the only thing going on here I think he missed shoot around so my guess is that he's not playing and then could you potentially Buy Low on Keegan Murray  if folks think he's gonna miss time or if they're concerned about what do you have one or two kind of slower ball games before the back injury  shut him down I mean maybe he was playing through it in those we don't even know but he's a guy that's like coasting at top 70 and he hasn't even hit his stride yet this year  pelicans have a few things going on I think JV is a cell High because his block rate is nuts I want to know what was the Alvarado's role is ultimately going to be I'd love to know what that means for dice and Daniels and then all so it sounds like CJ McCollum is not that far away so does that blow up all this other stuff and Trey Murphy is not all that far away what are the Pelicans going to be when all of those guys are back in can they all get back in at the same time as I guess another good question like  does zion get hurt before CJ comes back or whatever and knock on wood I don't want these things to happen but it just seems like the Pelicans have been snake bit for so long how could we expect that to stop now  Clippers I have been needlessly cruel to Norman Powell who is actually been  a fantasy play over the last week or so and  you know number 160 on the year in 25 minutes free-throw number is down for him over in a career Mark for Powell he's always been a very good free-throw shooter at 83% typically a pretty good positive there right now he's a small negative  you know if he gets back to what he was doing last year which was about 12 shots and 26 minutes and I don't know that that's happening because they just have so many usage guys but all of a sudden now it does seem like his role has jumped the way the team is situated and the way the team thinned out in the hardened trade it seems like Powell's the big winner you know they sent out all these power forwards and we thought all right well who the hell is gonna soak up the power forward minutes is it all gonna go to PJ Tucker but he's been old and slow and the team's been bad with him on the floor and so the Clippers are going smaller they'll run Kauai at the power forward spot if they have to they can just play more Wings basically and so suddenly Norman Powell looks kind of interesting yeah 19 points and five boards in the last ball game with two Steals and two threes and seven out of seven at the free throw line last four games he's scored 20 1410 and 19 points he's not doing much else which is reason for a little bit of concern but he's heading threes he's usually a pretty big free throw positive guy he's had a couple of weirdly bad games mixed in there but if he's gonna start scoring 14 15 points and night  and elevate your free throw number and give you a couple three pointers a game that's a guy that would then belong on a fantasy team I don't know that you need to necessarily get out in front of it but he certainly deserves at least some of our attention Spurs I just don't care sorry guys I can't bring myself to care if you have a Spur you're probably stuck sitting on them Zach Collins has been fine he's inside the top 100 that's good vessel has been in and out of the lineup where the hell is he right now he's just inside the top 100 as well keldon Johnson has been more efficient this year than we expected they rebounds and assists of actually been better than expected if that stuff comes down he could topple like he did last season the first have all these guys between 80 and 100  and that's all fine but I you know I just feel like people expected more and then when be his having his percentages issues and turn over issues he's a points League darling right now and the 2.6 blocks are sweet and he'll slowly figure the game out  I'd say it's a buy low but I don't think anybody's trading away weapon Yama that drafted him so probably you can just kind of ignore and that's why I mostly ignore the Spurs  Bulls the question is how soon are they blowing it up we didn't get any indication over the last day to have so I don't know that we need to sort of flog that dead horse  so  let's kind of keep going Thunder I think you can get a Bi-Lo on Jalen Williams specially with him dealing with his hip injury Jazz we just talked about them Jordan Clarkson you just try to sell when he has a run keyonte George Etc Blazers we just covered as well Warriors it have Clay and Wiggins woken up or are they still going to be terrible and how long  draymond's almost backed by the way but in the meantime Chris Paul's been amazing he is ranked number 55 in nine cat right now eight assists per game and only 1.2 turnovers that is the magic of assisted turnover ratio  and there's the one coughing fit per show  Chris Paul still shooting only 40%  so believe it or not there's room for growth over what he's doing right now  and that's when people were like oh no Chris Paul he had a few quiet game should I drop you know dude come on he's shooting like 37%  still Chris Paul  in reasonable minutes he will continue to put up numbers  simple as that  Sons nothing  Mavericks I'm starting to get kind of excited about Derek Lively and what he might be in the next month or two he's been decent so far but it does feel like he's a guy who's arrows pointed up  Tim Hardaway Jr is a guy who feels like his arrow is pointed down I don't know when it's going to happen still but it's like it's already begun he missed a few free throws which you know he wasn't gonna shoot 1000 from the line and so all he's doing right now is points in some threes and he's falling out of the top 100  great if you need those stats but not great if  you don't  and the Lakers we just talked about cam reddish is injury is kind of the only stat there I know the Lakers big names we don't know if they're gonna play on the back-to-back my guess is that they do this isn't really a team that can afford to just throw a ball game for the sake of throwing it and  the Mavs have slowed after a very hot start and LeBron and Aiden didn't play in the fourth quarter yesterday so I got to think those guys are gonna go  we shall see  all right let's try to do a few questions on this one please do by the way take a moment to like And subscribe if you made it this far in the show there are nice chunk of you hanging out with us live and then many of you were going to watch or listen after the fact  I expect to see the likes and subscriptions tick upward over the course of the day  all right how many questions can I get through oh there's a lot of them all right we're gonna give it about 10 minutes before my voice goes out  Dan should I start Duncan Robinson over Jalen Johnson  hmm  I don't think you're going wrong either way on this one both those guys are gonna have good numbers  they're both like top 60 Guys these days  yeah you're not going wrong Dan what do you think Austin Reeves rest of season value is in nine cat Rodeo I'm struggling to evaluate since he's coming off the bench thanks and hope you feel better soon yeah I'm fairly certain that I'm gonna die from this cough but we'll ride it all the way to the finish line  for Reeves he feels like a 90 range kind of guy his field goal percent is on its way back to where we needed it to be and that's the thing that kind of was holding him back for a bit so I his numbers were weirdly low he's right outside the top 100 over the last two weeks while shooting 40%  and very much I started will play over that stretch he's getting a lot of assists too almost six per ball game and at some point LeBron's going to get a game off at some point ades gonna get a game off and those ones ads usage is going to go through the roof or sorry Austin's is going to go through the roof and that's where he gets to add a little bit more on top of it so very much a hold reminds me a lot of on Yoko Kong and that he's gonna be fine when the team is healthy and then he'll cash in a big way with anybody gets a day off should I buy high on Jalen Johnson I don't know that you should ever buy high on anybody but Jalen Johnson has been awesome he's number 41  I still think it's free throw number or 41 over the last two weeks Excuse Me overall in the year he's actually believe it or not better than that I think he's number 37  I don't know that he keeps it up all year you know 60% shooting with three pointers with rebounds all that stuff he's awesome he's a very good player but the price you have to pay to get him right now is all so someone inside the top 50 and I don't think that I would give that up to buy him right now  someone offered Zach Collins from my Jalen Johnson would you take it no stick with Jalen Johnson  thoughts on Santee Alma this week hard to know for sure I am Pro Alma because nobody seemingly is coming back for Griz it this week  and Obama's that just out there taking a crap ton of shots over his last three games I'll Thomas taking 57 shots  that's enough for me man give me all the usage in the universe and then we'll just see what happens so I'm I'd say go on Santee thoughts on zubats his numbers have been consistently mid yeah that's zubats man  that's always what he's gonna be  and I think his block rate comes down so it might even get worse free throw percent probably comes up  he's just not he's not a top 100 guy he have a one or two week stretch where he can be but they have Daniel theis to cover up his backup minutes Tice can actually space the four little tiny bit better than zubats I don't think he's gonna take a bunch of his minutes but  it Mason Plumlee he'll be back at some point  I never wanted to do on my fantasy team and I still don't  who should I aim to get back if I'm selling Paul George well he's been great top 10 so far this year steel rate I don't know if it's sticks at 2.3 steals per game field goal percent probably comes down a little bit free throw percent like comes down a little bit he's a guy that's going to tape her off but if you can get anybody inside the top 20 I would do it  and when I say anybody inside that I'm not talking about like a herb Jones I'm talking about like  crap I don't know Kyrie Irving I just I feel like you might as well just ride it out at this point whatever you're gonna get is gonna probably be lower per game than PG's performing right now and I don't know that there that many of these guys behind him that he's gonna fall behind at least not substantially  you know  the guys that are probably gonna work their way up or guys you're probably not going to be able to get for him anyway  I have keyonte George and picked up buddy hield who to keep in a points League it's probably healed but we don't know if he's gonna start forever so that's why I said probably  who would you cut first out of false Simmons or Jonathan Isaac  probably Jonathan Isaac but  it might also be Simmons I honestly got I have no idea if Ben Simmons plays another basketball game is life every day every year it's the same thing oh he's out he's just you know nervous issue  I don't think he's ever gonna be okay  maybe I'm too pessimistic there I just don't think so Dan I need to Center Jaylen Smith Daniel theis other  uh you're screwed buddy sorry there's no solution there Ty Scott bonus run because that last game was a blowout Jalen Smith's minutes are all over the map you only played five in their last ball game  I would trust Jaylon Smith over Daniel theis but I don't know who sits on the other board in your waiver wire so  you've  in nine cat what range can I trade my Ozark Thompson I don't think people have caught onto the fact that he's been much slower the last week and a half to two weeks everybody still seeing the 10 rebounds and the almost three defensive stats per ballgame so I think you should be able to get somebody near 60 60 to 70 range is probably attainable for him still even though he's been trending hard down  he's just I mean he's a fun fantasy play but he's gonna he's getting a little gasped that that happens to rookies that come out with all the adrenaline in the universe  would you trade Jimmy Butler and Zach LaVine for Jayson Tatum  no  I don't think I would  I think Butler basically catches up with Tatum per game as this season goes and Levine's gonna get moved somewhere and then he's going to try again Caruso Caruso Jalen green is a disaster for category leaks points leagues it's the opposite by the way  play Duncan Robinson tonight or Bogdan bogdanovich I'll go Duncan  but I don't I mean  six of one half dozen of the other I think  who could I trade Chet for in a 10 team Roto League  uh I don't think you should right now  he's rolling  I get it you're punting points and rebounds you know he's helping you in rebounds me he's not helping you that much in points feels like he's a good fit for your team  there's nobody ranked around him that scores fewer points than he does  he's the JJ so far this year I think you should stay put  choose two out of melting shade and sharp County George slo-mo and Devin vassell tonight who do I play in a points League  points League  of a cell and sharp  category League gets melted in versaille  should I trade Jalen Williams for Jared Allen and Aaron Gordon um  I mean I guess I'm okay with that I don't really want Aaron Gordon though  and Jalen Williams and Jared Allen were both sort of bylaws right now  I wouldn't trade Jalen Williams away not I mean his value is gonna go through the roof when he starts getting steals  should I play Jordan Poole tyus Jones or neither in a roto League I might go neither although  this game could be closed do they bother to play them though if they're trying to lose  I've no idea what the Wizards are going to do with this one feels like the kind of game where the starters could get normal minutes so maybe you go both  but all so you could go neither I'm not playing them in my own League's but I this is the kind of game where that could hurt me because it should be high scoring the defense should be whack  so maybe you go both roll the dice screw it  rank the following players Melton Klay Thompson Andrew Wiggins Alex Caruso Devin vassell  category League's I'm gonna go  meltan over the cell over Caruso now well no no no no weekends is at the bottom I know that I think Clays it right above him right now yeah okay that's fine  Melton over the cell over Caruso over the other two Warriors  is Jaden McDaniels worth stashing in a 16 team her with no injured list  probably  need to know without knowing who's on your waiver wire but I'm leaning towards no  false ties Jones Ben Simmons who's gonna have a better rest of season I'm gonna go tyus Jones  listen to your Bilo yesterday thanks buddy it was a fun one is Suggs enough to get ogn and Obi  or is Suggs plus Draymond or plus Reeves and overpay  I like  basically all of those actually those are all good I would start by trying just Suggs  then try subs and Reeves and then try sucks and Dream On  he's healed at and appoints League yes  I traded Jalen green for a Kong great trade in category League's bad trading points great trading category leaks  what do you think about Ben Simmons I am very pessimistic I don't know if he plays basketball again in his life let alone this year but it's also possible he just resurfaces in two weeks and his like I'm gonna try again um I would rather have Trey Murphy then Ben Simmons out of the names you're giving me on your board here right now  so you can make that swap because at least we know Trey is getting close and wants to play  and then the following question is what do you think Trey Murphy's per game is gonna look like it's a great question and this is one of those ones where I truly don't know because he put up giant numbers last year with half the Pelicans hurt  he got ten shots a game he was extraordinarily efficient from three got some steals great foul shooter no turnovers but Zion was out and Ingram was out CJ was out for a little stretches and then one guy came back and another guy was out he always had a much clearer deck  this year I don't know if he gets 10 shots a game  does he need ten shots a game no but he probably needs 30 minutes again  if he's not gonna get usage  so my guess is like a 90 to 100 range kind of fringy but I do think he's gonna belong on rosters once he gets healthy I just think it's going to be more barely as opposed to last year where  everybody was out and so he was just cruising as a full-time injury replacement guy remember last year we saw four games  where the pills had their three main dudes in and Trey Murphy and he was not inside the top 100 but again that's a small sample size and he's better and now they know how to use him better so  I'm gonna say probably has fantasy value  Drew holiday or Jalen Williams give me Jalen Williams I I was fading Drew holiday I know that that left me a little bit on an island  but I just I didn't I couldn't see the usage being quite enough and he's doing all the little things right now but he's outside the top 80 Jay Williams is also outside the top 80 those guys are both by lowish but I'd rather have Jayden Williams  Dan when a trade his fair when talking about General ranking or when is a Trade Fair  is trading for a 15 to 20 player worth it if you're giving up to 40 to 50 range guys or is wrong to think like that yeah I mean you might find a team that needs depth and that's the way to do it you know that's okay typically the side getting the one best player wins in a trade like that  my favorite trades and I make a lot of them mid-season in League's where everybody wins that's the way I try to build the trade out you can get him done if you're trading for basically Roi I'm gonna give you a category you need you give me a category I need I'm not really that worried about ranking I might take back the guy who's lowering ranked by five ten fifteen slots or whatever but if they fit my team better than that makes sense what should I get if I was trading a wage Jalen Johnson could I get ogn and Obi for him  um  I think you probably could get OG  I'm actually not sure that Jalen Johnson Falls that far behind Anna nobe this year  it probably fine either way on that one yeah go ahead I mean if you want it if you picked up Jalen Johnson you might just enjoy it at this point though  do I pick up boy on in a 10 team her no I don't think he's gonna be a 10 team guy I think he will be a 12 team or but I think he's gonna sit right somewhere in between because like think about last year but Donovan Chad a very large role on the Pistons last season and he'll probably have a pretty good size role again  averaged 22 points a game last year  49% shooting 88 at the free throw line and he was still ranked outside the top 100 because he's a he's very much ahead to head build kind of dude big points good threes good percentages and just a total mess in almost every other category doesn't get any defensive stats doesn't pass doesn't rebound  he is the magic of how categories work good in three bad and four head-to-head great if you're punting rebounds assists deals or blocks  he's a must-start play Roto if you're trying to win all those categories he's fringy  so ten Timur I don't think he gets there 12 team I do think he gets there  are you at all worried about Devin Booker's games played number this year yeah I was worried about it coming into the season him missing time right at the front end of the year doesn't make me any less worried but also maybe he's getting them out of the way  like he's been a little bit dinged up the last couple of Seasons so it's hard to know for sure  I think he was giving more durability credit than he deserved in the sort of General space  but I'm not like any more worried about Booker than I am about some of the other guys that Miss games regularly like a Paul George or a kawaii letter or something like that you know maybe more than like a yoke itch yeah but  you know not a whole lot you can say about him the rest of the way that's like oh he's definitely gonna miss ballgames because we don't really know  ogn and Obey or Oscar Thompson rest of season I'll go OG and we're about to wrap things up by the way we're at 50 minutes what is your rank order from embiid Shea and Halliburton from now on guys it doesn't matter on this one I'm sorry I know that's the cheap way out but those are four of your top those are three of your top four fantasy players on the board they're all amazing you cannot go wrong with any of them I think she's steals probably come down from Two and a Half and that brings him back closer to the pack of these other guys right now he's kind of boat racing them  but like halliburton's been incredible  Anthony Davis has been amazing and bead yokich these guys have been so amazing so far this year and you can take any of them and you can win with any of them  Dan when do you expect and Wendell Carter Junior to return I have no idea markelle fultz is already ruled out for tonight doesn't seem like he's getting all that much closer so I assume he's out at least another week same thing with Wendell Carter Junior I assume he's out at least another one to two weeks just set your expectations down the line and then if they pop up for any reason then you go for it all right let me see what questions here apply to everybody and we'll try to do one or two of those before we wrap it up not going to do trade or add drop questions so much let's see here I was offered Kawhi Leonard for Tyrese Maxey know I think you'll probably stick with maxi there  what about Scotty Barnes I think I'd go Maxie over Kawaii over Barnes  been Roto I had maybe you go Barnes over Kawaii if you're worried about games missed down the stretch  do you see decent upside on cam Johnson I sure do I sure do that's a good question because he hasn't really hit his stride yet at all he's number one sixty nine but that's because he's shooting 40% everything else is exactly where we need it to be  12 shots a game is fine I think that actually Trends up as he hits full starters minutes get him to 13 shots at night and start hitting in the mid to high 40s now you're talking about a guy scoring not 13 and a half points but more like 16 to 18 points a game a bunch of Threes rebound steals yeah yeah I see upside there  let's see here trying to get one or two  OG or Melton in category leaks I'll go ogn and Obi on that one and I think here we go last question uh oh here two two last questions quick ones Bruce brown or Alex Caruso I prefer Caruso and what is Nick Nick claxton's Outlook the rest of the season well remember he was a top 30 guy last year and he's number 48 so far this season with pretty repeatable numbers you'll see guys kind of move around the board around him I think klaxon can get inside the top 40 again this season and that doesn't frankly sound all that hard to me all right voice is tired later
