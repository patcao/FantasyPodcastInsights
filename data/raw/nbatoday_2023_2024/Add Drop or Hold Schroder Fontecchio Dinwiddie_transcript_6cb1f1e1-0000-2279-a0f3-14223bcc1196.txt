straight in I don't want to spend a whole lot of time on other stuff I don't know when I'm gonna run out of my clock on today's show Thunder beat the magic yeah it's gonna be a shorter show we're going 20 to 30 minutes today instead of 50 Thunder beat the magic 127 113 on the road zero surprises as per usual on the Thunder side there hasn't been a surprise for the thunder in a bazillion years but as far as the magic goes we have a couple of things to consider Gary Harris left this ball game early Mark L fault they have a back-to-back so who knows what's gonna go on there Jonathan Isaac on a back to back we got we got a couple of things  first thing is  Jalen sucks 17 and 443 pointers in a stealing up to a hot shooting star in this game and then cool substantially as the game went on but a good to see the rebounds  I still can't fully get myself back in on sucks it's somebody asked me why I wasn't back once it's like well I don't know that even need to go into detail on that Suggs has at times this year kind of nuzzled up against pretty good fantasy value but he's had a lot of trouble maintaining it lately largely because his percentages have been dog due oh last couple weeks is it 40% from the field 60 some odd at the free-throw line like that's just not gonna get it done  I like this deals don't get me wrong but  nope  window Carter Juniors minutes we're back up in this one  nope he continually loses minutes to some backup center on this team it's typically been moving or lately and Wendell doesn't get defensive stats sort of a tough Center to invest in when you're not getting defensive stats out of said Center at least he doesn't tank percentages so that's a slight uptick but no I don't want anything to do with that  and then Jonathan I Isaac who we talked about a couple days ago on the show he played 25 minutes for the first time in almost five years I guess more like four years and  three months something like that four years three months ago was the last time you played 25 minutes before over the weekend and he had 15 minutes in this one they have a back-to-back going tomorrow tonight it was tomorrow when he played this ball game  so you need the minutes were going to be held in check a little bit I have put him on my bench in some Roto League where I'm not super far behind in games played because I just kind of want to see what the rest of this season brings you know if he starts getting 22 20 to 25 minutes in  like non back-to-back situations then I'll start to deploy him if he doesn't I won't and I don't think you could put them on your head to head roster because there's just way too much inconsistency and how many minutes he's getting to play  and so you know that bigger headache that it's worth  Boston I was chasing a kid when the news broke late yesterday in the evening that Kristofferson was gonna sit out the front end of the Celtics back-to-back they have a Brooklyn home and home going on here this one was on the road they play at home tonight against the same Brooklyn Nets team so sadly I was not at my computer to throw Al Horford into the lineup  oh  and we missed out 16 six and four on a perfect six of six shooting and two for two at the free throw line the Horford filling is just like the easyest rotol game's cap play  and at this point Horford actually belongs just on rosters because he's filled in so often that his numbers on the year are just good throughout like you could make the argument to just play him every day but at least we know when to play him you play when poor singers sits or Jalen Brown sits or Jayson Tatum sits or Dare quite sits or Drew holiday sits because he drops into the lineup When anybody on the Celtics is out on the Year yes his value is inflated by the fact that he only has 0.7 turnovers a game but even on the season now he's number 84  that's including the half of games where he's not playing reasonable minutes  I can't properly just dissect it and tell you what is exact rank is when one starter is out for the Celtics but I can tell you it's pretty damn good  and he should be deployed in all of those spots and now he'll sit the second half of the back to back and saying this will likely come back and blah blah blah so you know nothing else nothing new on the Boston side mostly just wanted to complain to you guys because I didn't get a chance to get offered into my lineups  Brooklyn has a few things going on Ben Simmons played 24 minutes had five six and eight with no defensive stats mystery of his free throws and went one of five shooting from the field  it's going to be a better bigger headache that it's worth  I get it some of you guys want to throw him on your bench on in a road only and just see how it goes and if he gets up to 30 minutes at any point then you're like all right I guess maybe I can throw them out there okay fine  if I told you I'm doing it with Jonathan Isaac I can't really get on your case if you want to do it with Ben Simmons both of those guys are probably gonna be hurt in the next two weeks neither one of them is reliable for minutes the difference at least in my eyes is that when Jonathan Isaac plays 24 minutes he's a Fantasy value when Ben Simmons plays 24 minutes he's not he wasn't a fantasy value first couple weeks this year when he was playing full starters minutes  so there's no guarantee that he will be again he's just like bigger and slower than he used to be  health or no Health he's not the same spring chicken he was four years ago before all the stuff  if you wanted to the Ben Simmons thing you do the Ben Simmons thing I'm not doing the Ben Simmons thing not certainly outside of any kind of keeper format that would be the only place you're like well you know maybe I pick him up I can spend like a 12 13 round pick to hold on to him for next year because who knows might come into a seasonal healthy  little easier than sitting through whatever this  what's is  Cam Thomas shot 50% which means  I need to sound effect but sell High when he shoots 50% you sell high and he doesn't  you don't  straightforward  and then the dentist is Dennis Smith Jr just 15 minutes so I think we can probably not worry too much about him Dennis Schroder not a good ball game three turnovers one of three free throws three of ten from the field but 32 minutes that was the number that jumped out at me  32 minutes  which is Starters minutes  and again there's no guarantee that it turns into  perfect fantasy value but in 30 minutes in Toronto basically he was at about top 125 or so  uh  his role wouldn't be that different so what you know you can't look at it and be like oh he's gonna get a bunch more shots in Brooklyn then he got a bunch more assists know he'd be about the same guy the difference is could he go from 30 minutes to 30 or 33 that 10% would get him up to the top 100 threshold not that that's like a difference what's the difference in starting a 100 ranked guy in a 120 ranked guy very little  very little um that's where guys are pretty heavily clustered really starting from around like pick 7 80 the guys get super duper clustered  from 80 to like well basically the end of it all though again like at a certain point the difference between pick 80 and the difference between pick 1:40 is pretty different it's just that the pick between 80 and like 90 is not that different the 10-player Gap is small the 40 player Gap is significant whereas at the top of the draft at the top of the rank board a 10 player Gap is huge  oh like a three-player gap is small  so that's just sort of a sliding scale thing  so what do you do what do you do that's the question what do you do with Dennis Schroder we saw a bad line 9 points 5 boards three assists a couple of three pointers bad percentages no defensive stats and again like this is a thing that is going to haunt him he's not a big defensive stat guy average about just under one steal a game and maybe he can get back to that doesn't shoot that many threes so hard for him to float his value there he's a good free throws guy typically I know this game small sample size theater  the assists are probably going to be decent the scoring is probably gonna be fine but not spectacular you're hoping he can get you kind of up to like lie average or fantasy league average  what's the upside not a ton  outside like Tom 90 top 85 if guys start pulling the plug on their season which they won't because it sounds like cam Johnson is hopeful to make his return in this ball game I don't know if he's gonna play enough minutes to be successful but like where are these extra minutes coming from  does it come from Schroeder Ben Simmons sitting out the back-to-back I guess that's where some of them could be  why isn't Dorian Finney Smith playing more minutes is that injury related probably  will they go up maybe  Brooklyn is looking at a bit of a log Jam so reason to maybe stem the tide on any optimism but I do think we need to hold on to shooter in the short term because again how many point guards you got floating out there that are playing 30 minutes a game  that are on the waiver wire I guess I should add not many  he beat the Bucks won 2397 and this ball game was over early but we were able to learn a few things about Miami so Jimmy Butler so Terry Rozier Soul Josh Richardson that's right I did the French pronunciation  sweet cultured Danbury on today's show  me a kiss came off the bench for 28 minutes keep an eye on him but you don't have to add him right now Kevin Love had 1983 in 23 bench minutes he is a usage monster has been all season long the issue is that you know 15 16 minutes is not enough to get him to Fantasy play but the way that Kevin Love has put up numbers in super low minutes this year  kind of tells you that in like 24 25 minutes he probably would be around a top 100 guys so keep one eye on Kevin Love as well if you badly need a few threes and a couple of rebounds from a center that can shoot free throws okay it's a little more you know specialist e  Nicolas yovich  not to be confused of course I had 24 points and five three pointers in this game after basically not playing for the last two weeks so watch list him on for me  and then Duncan Robinson you see where I'm like circling  towards my target here Duncan Robinson when he starts he's a go that's the way it was earlier this year when Tyler hero was out and they didn't have Terry Rozier yet and Jimmy Butler missed some time in there so there were a couple guys out when Duncan Robinson starts Duncan Robinson is a play  he has gotten better at cutting  like substantially  and he still gonna hit a bunch of three pointers maybe not six every ball game and then of course you've got the fact that Miami schedules sucks so for head-to-head you got a game today and then they're off until Friday of next week and then they're off again over the weekend so after today Miami is one game you got the All-Star break which obviously inflates the numbers but one game over 11 days that ain't gonna get it done but Roto it makes a lot of sense because you squeeze out one game you can just move on after that if you think anybody on Miami's back after the All-Star break  Kevin Love is a 50/50 he's a coin flip he's very much a do you need these categories kind of guy whereas Duncan Robinson is more in the yeah I mean he'll be mathematically a guy you could play as far as the Bucks go Malik Beasley continues to be your khris Middleton fill in and not a supremely exciting one at that but he's been like generally good enough although upside 3-point streamer basically and that's it  Jae Crowder sucks  get that one decent game in there but otherwise it's been  super ugly and there was video of Giannis like snapping a towel at an official in this ball game be careful what you wish for bucks man you unloaded your coach and you are crap in the bed  congratulations on your bed defecation  bucks did get a win in there they beat a nuggets team that's thrown into hard cruise control the Hornets but you know who cares  lost to the Jazz lost to the sons lost at the Wolves lost to the heat without their entire starting five  yeah trouble  speaking of the Timberwolves they are good they're the number one seed in the western conference right now game up on the Thunder wolves are 38 and 16  impressive that they're 1911 on the road  so home heavy schedule the rest of the way 195 at home they've got six more home games than Road games left  that's good sign but they win anywhere this game was over early ish game was not as close as the final score would indicate all the Rudy gobert and Anthony Edwards still got to play a pretty healthy a lot of minutes but they were able to get Mike Conley out there early cat had some issues in this game don't worry about that Jayden McDaniels played 24 minutes so he didn't miss any time  and then with the sort of kooky minutes you got extra kill Alexander Walker extra slow-mo extra Nas Reed you can mostly ignore that stuff when the Timberwolves are healthy  and then as far as the Blazers go they are not healthy but they're not not healthy enough that make any sense it actually did make sense if you sort of slow it down we need the Blazers to either be healthier so we could start someone like a Malcolm Brogdon or more unhealthy so we can get to Fringe your players as it stands right now you've got Jeremy Grant downright Aiden and Anthony Simons are three safe plays at this exact moment and then you had this sort of one every three to four game decent marker for scoot Henderson he's still very much learning the NBA level  but when all those guys are there that's enough guys healthy to render anyone else useless  I've had to knock back so many questions about when it's time to pick up Jabari Walker not yet  I don't know that there's ever going to be a time to pick him up but we definitely need Jeremy Grant out we probably need shade and sharp not to come back which isn't gonna happen he's gonna come back he's a young dude who's gonna want to get some minutes under his belt like I mean Simon's is still a young dude even if you think maybe they shut him down at some points gonna play it out  eight and is gonna be here in there they'll that'll probably sniff of of shut down so what happens if we get eight and out and we get Jeremy Grant out is that enough in that instance I'd probably rather pick up doop wreath at least as your backup center it's sort of easier to get fantasy stats than praying that Jabari Walker can do something besides hit a three-pointer and grab 8 rebounds  if I'm looking at Portland and I'm looking for somebody that I think could be you know March stash wreath would be that guy  to money tomorrow might be that guy is a little bit more variety to his game Henderson if you think scoot start to figure it out here at the end of the year  you know my feeling on rookie ball handlers it's after February or not at all  and frankly if you're looking for sort of like return on effort not at all is a lot easier on your conscience  your anxiety level  Sacramento Phoenix I was a fun one King's couple of mistakes down the stretch cost of a chance to maybe steal this one on the road so bonus with a huge ball game he got off to a slow start this year and you kind of always knew that he'd eventually work his way up the board he's back to number 25 now  not because necessarily his counting stats got bigger this is obviously a huge ball game but he's been in this sort of 20 12 in some odd to 13 good assist numbers eight and a half this year it's the free throws they were in the mid to low 60s for a while they've slowly ticked their way up to 70 after he went seven out of eight in this ball game and it's that like you never even really notice it's happening but it's happening  and I don't think you ever really able to buy low on him because the low free throws people are like hey those fees fine you got the good Dr and fox game after a few bad ones he's been bouncing back and forth between like 35 and 55 he's at 45 right now right smack in the middle largely because he's bad in the three points League categories negative field goal free throw and turnovers  it's been pretty awesome in a bunch of other stuff but I play nine cat so  there you go Malik monk continues his little heater here  you guys know and I get it I'm a little bit more conservative than your average fantasy analyst but you've come with me this far so I presume it's because you like that I take fewer risks in any event monk very much ago it had to head League's very much a going points League's I can continue to be somewhat reticent about dropping him into a lineup on the Roto side because his value tends to be pretty tied up in points in a cysts the other stuff comes and goes a tad and feel goal percent fluctuates wildly turnovers fluctuate wildly he's uh  100% over this last day is like a week and a half or so he's very much been a play in all formats over that week so I get it I'm being too nervous about it but he's also not going to shoot you know 55 to 60% long term and that's the cooking rate that he's on right now  he's also blocking like he's blocked like seven shots in the last week or something crazy he's way out over his skis and stuff that you know is coming back to Earth  if you want to try to ride the wave and Rodeo against the games cap hope it lasts a few more games that's fine I just I'm always worried that I'm gonna drop him in there and it's gonna be either that game where the next game where it the cliff he hits the cliff and then you end up doing damage to yourself of course the opposite side of this is that if monk is playing well  and for some reason they really don't want to take Harrison Barnes out of the lineup then Kevin herder is his run of better play is probably about to end  he is his minutes of trying to download the last two ballgames he was on a heater before that he actually shot the ball well in this ball game but he was part of some lineups that were getting their butts kicked so out you go I'm giving her exactly one more ball game to prove to me that he can continue to get 30 minutes a night and if not  bye bye Bradley Beal left after four and a half minutes he's hurt again this time it's a hammy at least we have the All-Star break coming up here I think Phoenix has one more game yeah they played Detroit tonight so they should be able to win that one without him sons have a very much turned their season in the positive direction since they got healthy that's been a big part of it  but the you know Detroit on a back-to-back from La flying to Phoenix there gonna be freaking cooked  so in the short term Grayson Allen obviously gets a bump he was already a start Eric Gordon gets a bump and we saw Royce so Neil got a nice bump so now it  comes down to what's the pecking order behind Booker Durant and I would say Grayson Allen who's safely kind of in that top four top five would be listed their top four when he's not is it going to be Gordon or is it going to be Roi so Neil that produces in this game  personally  I leaned to Royce  I think Gordon probably starts I don't know that that's actually necessarily true they might want him as their bench Gunner but Royce O'Neill has the more varied Fantasy game meaning and we saw this  I guess would be was last year the year before I don't know I lose track of seasons ever so quickly  Royce last year that was already in Brooklyn yeah 9.5 boards for assists 1.5 defensive stats and two three-pointers  in 31 minutes that's a nice variety pack so yeah he's probably not gonna score more than 9 points during his little fill-in run here but he can get me five boards and four assists and a steal and a half a block or maybe you go a little bit higher than that who knows  that to me is more interesting than hoping I catch the Eric Gordon good shooting game the lightning in a bottle game which he's had a bunch of them I got to try not to be such a jerk to Gordon because on the season he shooting 40 six percent which is way better than expectations and if that holds and he drops into this bigger usage took 17 shots last night then yeah he's inside the top 100 I just can continue to look at Gordon goal is he really truly gonna shoot 46% all year is it really about the fact that playing with with Booker and KD has just launched him you know three four percentage points higher than he's been basically throughout his entire career it's not that the three-point shooting has changed all that much you know he's at 39% this season he's career 37 he's had some years where he's I mean he's a plenty of years where he's been 39 or better but he was still 4041 402 from the field his two-point shot has been much better this year and you know maybe that's the spacing that that that that team gives him or maybe it's something that's due to regress  I don't know for sure I can't tell you sometimes guys just have better seasons  and that's what's Happening Here for Gordon then I'm being short-sighted and too conservative in not grabbing him points you grab him head to head you probably grab him because you're not as worried about the damage he could do to feel goal percent this my discussion right now is really more about would I use him against the games cap and the answer tonight against Detroit is probably not  same deal for Roy so Neil leaning towards no  you know Phoenix after this one there off for a while but they do have three games on the other side of the All-Star break if you think Bradley Beals not back by that and if it's I don't know if it's just sore or actually strain I think they called it a strain it's really a strain Beal probably misses time on the other side of the break  so there might be a path there  and then the Lakers beat up on Detroit this game it was funny it was like a semi blowout  I watch a lot of Lakers games live  I call it a semi blowout because the Lakers were up by like 18 for the entire fourth quarter they never really opened it up I don't think like there's ever led by more than 23 points in the game but they were up  double digits basically the entire ball game and so the Lakers yanked Anthony Davis with like three minutes to go in the third quarter and then you could just see like can we hang on to a comfortable enough lead that he doesn't have to come back into the ball game  and also I kept looking at it like why is LeBron playing so much right now because he frankly looked tired he wasn't guarding anybody on defense and I think this is one of those situations where they're like look we can  we're gonna score enough in this game where we don't have to worry about it once we build a lead but then we got the news after the game that LeBron was knocking to be playing the back-to-back in altitude in Utah that's a really difficult back-to-back I mean if the Lakers are going to lose a game going into the All-Star break this is absolutely it Utah's not been playing as well lately  but there's a reason their favored by five and a half points in this game and it's because LeBron is out  I don't think anything Davis has been ruled out yet I think it's just LeBron but it's all so a back-to-back where Utah has had rest  they're not the only team hosting a club on a back-to-back and altitude Denver has Sacramento on a back-to-back in altitude those are tough man you gotta dig Realty  so normally we jump over the Lakers but I do want to talk about them in just a second as far as Detroit goes this sort of a good news bad news thing with Simone fontecchio 26 minutes in the starting role and he was basically just gonna roll with the starters but this game ended early so Kade didn't finish the Ballgame Jalen didn't come back late start Thompson did actually get a few extra minutes in this game and he looked good hang on to him Lakers were just letting him dunk for a long stretches Jade and Ivy who is always going to be a much better points League option than to traditional 9 cat you got a bigger James Wiseman game because he was all so dunking a bunch but this is a this is a goofy one uh here's the short version fontecchio I like him with the starters unit so hold for now he had a weird ball game but he seemed willing to sort of fire and he also ended up getting blitzed by the Lakers a bunch of times so let's give him another one again I don't think he's gonna average 20 and 9 like that first ball game it'll probably be a little bit better than this  Cade Duran obviously you're hanging on to an all formats Ivy is gonna be a little bit fringy for Roto I think he'll probably be outside the Roto nine cat play if you're head to head and you're punting one of the things he's terrible at then  yes that makes more sense obviously points that's a go and then I got to give a shout out not fantasy wise just like LifeWise to Evan Fournier who played 24 and a half minutes in this game  after Tom Thibodeau has you know what was the what was the planet in Thor Ragnarok where all the junk got dumped  dumped it oh sent Evan Fournier to that planet so he'd been hanging out with you know  president Jeff Goldblum for the last little bit but he got to play and the funny thing is 48 didn't look that  bad made a couple of dumb mistakes but honestly like I expected way more dumbness from a guy who hasn't really been involved in basketball and got know how long now did 48 see the court this year I gotta look that up now I know I haven't seen much of him but sometimes it's like I haven't seen much of a guy did he actually play it all and the answer is yes he got into three games previously this year and one of them was okay  December 30th oh that's I was in Yosemite Evan Fournier played 17 minutes at 10 2 and 2 and 3 steals I don't think he's gonna play enough in Detroit to be a fantasy dude but  honestly keep one eye on it because Detroit is going to need a veteran in there now that bowling bag of an Alec Burks are gone and you know nobody that they brought in couldn't Grimes is not a veteran he Motif ones not a veteran  the guys they got coming back from injury Grimes me one of them Isaiah Stuart being the other these guys are not veterans  so they may actually use a stabilizing player but again like we're not talking about starters minutes so it would probably be fringy and then as the Lakers go oh I maybe brought it at a time here as the Lakers go you know one game situation here they just they can't afford to push LeBron too hard maybe they can steal one on the road their thought is like there's also have three and four days coming out of the All-Star break and and again altitude I haven't really been a proponent of adding rui hachimura despite the fact that it is starter's role he has been a you know more involved player but with no LeBron you'll probably see you know a dozen shots at a rui in this ball game you might maybe get enough out of Spencer Dinwiddie I don't like his Fantasy game typically but he's gonna get some assists he's gonna get some steals you saw him actually he was busted it on defense for his new team  not a good nine cat  situation and as the sort of the new guy I'd be a little surprised if he was like taking over you're gonna get a lot of Austin Reeves a lot of d low a lot of Anthony Davis and probably just enough hachimura to be a one-day  you know spot play kind of thing I don't think that I would take the plunge on Spencer didn't witty although he did look competent in his first game with the Lakers he looked like he was really hustling in a way that I most guys in the NBA don't have energy to do right now  the middle of the Season man these guys are tired and dinwiddie's playing like it's the first week of the year okay that's all the time I had for today I didn't do any promo I just wanted to get through the information fontecchio Schroeder those were two of the really interesting ones and then Dinwiddie I probably should have put him on the list as well check out our buddies at manscape.com use promo code ethos 2-0 to get 20% off your
