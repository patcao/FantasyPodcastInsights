welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I got a bit of good news this morning Bradley Beal expected back as soon as this weekend  this is again why we had him on the Bi-Lo board figured he was coming back soon there hadn't been any news on it I thought maybe like  three to five days after the new year but perhaps maybe it'll be about five to seven days sooner than that  even a slight Improvement on our already somewhat optimistic expectation the thing about the beal Buy Low and why he was on our Bi-Lo show on this most recent Tuesday and the previous one is that not only has he been hurt and there wasn't an updated until this morning but people are frustrated with him and rightfully so because he's been hurt the whole damn season and so now there's this expectation that's like oh well this is just going to be one of those years where he's hurt the entire year that's not necessarily how it goes and maybe it does but prior to this morning you probably could have gotten him for basically anybody who's had top 100 value all year and now Whoever has him is probably going to stick this thing out so I told you I do a better job at getting some of the  news out there to you at the beginning of the show  did it before I even said hello so now  we'll say hello what's happening everybody this is fantasy NBA today I'm Dan Bass Pros Sports ethos presentation you can find me over on social media at Dan Bass Pros please do make a point could to rate like subscribe however you're taking in the Pod whatever little thing you can do does continue to go a long way we'll tell you about our buddies over at manscape middle of the show who did indeed re-up for another few months shout out to dalonte on yesterday's show for buying manscaped while we were live on air that's sweet ethos 20 by the ways that promo code  we got kind of a short card yesterday to go over I want to dive into that basically immediately here because they do have some things I want to tell you in terms of scheduling for the show while so take a look at what's coming up on the  you guys I guess it's sort of a slightly larger than average Thursday car tonight we got eight games  I've told you guys a million times I love the seven and eight game cards these are my favorite you get just enough action to where you got to be locked in but it's not super overwhelming so I love it anyway we'll dive into that in a minute first Toronto at Washington Raptors tried out a new starting lineup and it worked at least for a game I mean you know doesn't hurt that they were playing the Wizards who are not good but at least had been kind of competitive lately yakka Portal's been annoying just 21 minutes again in this ball game raptors have been running small more often lately if you have Turtle you're pretty much just sticking it out he's kind of a little bit of a Bi-Lo right now then they'll play some teams where they need him in there more and he'll put up better numbers and those ones  that I don't think was the main point of this one couple of main points ogn and Obi was better every time it seems like he's getting going he falls apart every time it seems like he's completely Fallen apart he has a few they get some going  meh he's also well he was kind of a Bi-Lo maybe not as much after this ball game but I thought the bigger news was Gary Trent being inserted into the starting five and Dennis Schroder being shifted to the bench  it didn't change the minute distribution all that much I'll be at this game was a massive blowout so it's hard to know how the you know the final five would have looked we can't necessarily know for sure  if you have Dennis Schroder you're probably holding he's number one 115 and 9 cat a lot of that is because he's decent and assists and hasn't really done much else good free throw shooting also  and I get it assists are hard to find on the wire so he's not he's not a drop he's  kind of like right at the very back end of startable  and that's fine  but as far as Gary Trent goes  I picked him up in a couple of spots I didn't pick him up everywhere because I felt like the drops that I would have had to part with were  I don't know maybe not necessarily better but as good or better  you know I just I felt like I would have been  parting with someone I had more confidence in I'm trying to think of an example of this yes yesterday someone like a  Patrick Williams I think was the player I was debating whether or not I wanted to drop now he's coming off a bad ball game last time out but Williams has been pretty good for about a month now think he's like right around the edge of the top one 100 over the last month over the last three weeks he's like number 85 there's a chance that Trent could go higher than that  my reticence on on Trent and I know he had two steals in this ball game is that nobody on the Raptors now that Nick nurse is gone is getting the with the exception of Scotty Barnes basically is getting the kind of defensive stuff that they got under Nick nurse some of that was the big minutes some of that was just schemes  and if Gary Trent isn't getting one and a half steals per game they're just isn't enough else there because he's not gonna score that much little bit more as a starter just because he'll be out there longer so okay three pointers but it's got to be threes points and Steals and if two of those three things aren't there then he has kind of no way to get to actual fantasy value  still  looping back around to the front end of that conversation I did pick him up in a couple of spots where I was able to drop you know short-term feeling kind of guy who I thought all right well this guy's got maybe you know one to two more injury fill in kind of ball games I would rather have Gary Trent because if this sticks maybe there's a shot he now is like that type you know one 15 range kind of guy long term which is actually sort of useful he probably more so in head-to-head than Rodeo but whatever  wizard side we can throw it right out the window they got blown out luckily tyus Jones survived it with 11 and 5 and a couple of steals Daniel Gafford survived it 12 and 8 with 5 defensive stats and nobody else really did Jordan Poole I guess 14 4 and 4 was not so horrid  Kyle kuzma was 14 four and seven but five turnovers bad shooting numbers I mean I I tried to warn you guys  this is one that hurts me when people didn't listen because I warned and I warned and I warned and I was like look how cool is gonna be a guy who scored a bunch of points but he's probably not gonna be a good fan he play and now here was Where We Are  who's Miss going 22 1/2 points a game he's a positive there he's been a positive and assist from the power forward spot but no steals minimal blocks bad feel gold bad free throw bad turnovers  the bad is out outweighing the good if you're not punting any of those things  and you know I do a show that basically talks about nine cat Rodeo  you can apply it to your league  your rolling head to head and you know if you're a punt steals team he makes more sense for punt free throw or field goal or both yikes team he makes a little bit more sense  but it's been this not that slow anymore pretty steady decline off the crazy numbers he had to start the year that just aren't there anymore  anyway this is a blowout so again don't do anything valuation wise this is stuff that we felt even before this ball game but it's kind of wanted to etch that farther into the stone that we've already been  etching on for the last five weeks or more  Philly was without Joel embiid again and you know the reports on him are not great I I'm not super freaked out about it but he's getting ruled out a day in advance  the next ball game for the Sixers is the one that I'm a bit more interested in because he was just like didn't make this sort of  two game jaunt for Philly down to Florida Miami and Orlando their two games now they'll  all right I mean they the team will probably head straight to Houston because that's easier than going home and that back out again  but if MB now rejoins the team for the Houston Chicago back to back I'll feel a little bit less nervous about the thing we talked about it on yesterday's show though if I'm beat isn't to 100% And he misses these two games there's basically one game over the next five days for the Sixers so it's possible that they're just like you know what we're in pretty good shape maybe we can steal one of these games in Houston or Chicago maybe we beat Chicago one out of the two home and home sets and get him beat back after New Year's that would be January 5th I think is when after they're sort of like low tide era  they might just do that teams try to sort of grayed out what they can get versus what they're going to miss  we'll see in the meantime Paul read was good I know he had foul trouble in the previous one I wimped out on playing him here because I thought Orlando would get him back in foul trouble and he was able to sort of find his way through  good  I still have him on a couple of clubs because we know he's a good and bead filling play people give him a hard time Paul Reed what I don't know what they did not gonna score 30 he's not indeed  you want to guy who's gonna get you some points some boards some steals some blocks some field goal percent and not kill you anywhere and then you know again that foul Trouble game obviously heard a lot but  by and large he is playable when he is out  Kelly oubre was bad in this one that I think surprised a lot of people myself included at least he had two Steals and two blocks to kind of keep from totally ruining the night generally when MB is out I would say obras are relatively safe play you gotta figure that he's gonna go get some shots but he just sort of didn't in this game I don't exactly know why but I would probably play him in the next one if M bed still down  because you can't make our decision on one game and he was good in the in the one before it  for the magic this was just kind of an ugly one Jalen Suggs was fine Franz Wagner was all so fine  I mean I guess you could say Paolo was fine although you know 21 shots and missing almost all of them is not great I think the only thing to look at  you know maybe there's two two things to look at with Orlando right now one is that the center rotation is a disaster but Todd's they played nine minutes Wendell Carter Junior played 22 mob Wagner played 16 not of those guys needs to be rostered in nine category League's and then Cole Anthony is someone I mentioned as a guy who was going to run out of steam off his extremely hot streak and he has and I think we can officially put Cole Anthony into our inaugural for 2023 stream wow warm category of players which now includes Bobby Portis Nas Reed Cole Anthony and oh I'm forgetting somebody  doesn't matter you guys get the idea let's keep going  Milwaukee Brooklyn was the story of the night not for Fantasy purposes but because Brooklyn basically tanked a game right in the middle of the season and you've got to believe the NBA's not gonna be happy about it and the players frankly weren't that happy about it because basically like 80% of the rotations sat the game to begin with maybe more like 60 and then Mikhail Bridges cam Thomas and Royce O'Neill played most of the first quarter and then didn't come back  that's rough  Brooklyn didn't really give any indication that this was happening either which made it extra goofball I feel somewhat fortunate that I talked about streaming Dennis Smith Jr on yesterday's podcast and then I did it in a couple of spots and he had 14 7 and 8 with his steel not a great ball game but a fine one certainly because he was one of the ladies basically the only starter who actually played normal minutes and then the guys that ended up playing yesterday Jalen Wilson who I can quite frankly tell you I did not know was at NBA this guy is Armani Brooks who I think last time I heard of his name was one I ended had his like Top Shot debut card for years ago or something like that oh what the hell's going on with Top Shot these days is it dead yet it's dead right Noah Clowney who I thought was a football player so I like and this sucked No Way Around It Like if you played Mikhail Bridges Camp Thomas or Royce O'Neill who all seemed like they should be pretty good feelings  they were not only bad villains but they also blew a roto games cap if you're in that format playing just one quarter of a basketball game  that should get in trouble for this this was bad  better fantasy players whatever you know we wouldn't have that big of a problem with it if they just told us what was up but hiding the fact that the other three rotation guys just weren't going to play after the first quarter that's the kind of crap you do at the end of a season and Mikhail Bridges was mad about it he came out after the ball game he was like yeah I mean I guess whatever like I'm not happy about it  because they wanted him to keep his games played streak going he wanted to play the ball game there were like you need rest he was like no I never need rest  so like it's almost like  they couldn't even get their soldiers in line for this one to go you know say the company line  yeah we're all tired blah blah go on work but good well about our day  so on the other side you can't read too much into the box either like you know Brooke Lopez he didn't have to do much neither did Dame Janis did well and his minutes Chris Middleton actually had a nice ball game Bobby Portis got defensive stats which was kind of weird and he's always gonna pick on teams that are sub NBA level but then campaign  margin boat champ these guys had good ball games nobody knew that crap was coming  Malik Beasley had five three pointers he's been a hold for me I only played 22 minutes but again I I cannot bring myself to care about any result that happened in this ball game  Phoenix blew out Houston behind Kevin Durant's big triple double 2017 and 16 for KD  not that anybody was worried about him but it moves Kevin Durant back into the first round on a pregame basis he pushes James Harden back out  those two flip-flop the 12 and 13 slots last night  folks pictures this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friend's turn on you you're forced to go on a last second

want to take away from this ball game not much Eric Gordon had one of his games where he just exploded in this happens you know once in every like three weeks for him Grace and Allen's been excellent lately Devin Booker was you know for him kind of perfectly average  Devin Booker's such a weird story because it's so strange to see somebody averaging like 28 and 8  that's sitting in the third round but  that's where he's at a nine cat right now  some of its turnovers some of its low defensive stats some of its low 3-pointers it's and a lot of it in my eyes is just how unbelievable the top 20 is this year these guys are putting up its to me it's not closed like this is the most fantasy plush  thick  top of the board that I can ever remember  it makes handicapping the players a little bit harder but you just sort of have to remember how impossible it is to get inside the top 10 anymore  anywho if Bradley Beal is indeed coming back I assume he takes Eric Gordon spot in the starting five some of you might think it's Grayson Allen I think it's Eric Gordon that gets bench because I think they'll want a little scoring Punch coming off the pine  which means for the moment at least I'm not pre-drink Grayson Allen I never had Eric Gordon on my team I don't like his Fantasy game he got off to kind of a hot start this year and this ball game pushed him back up to the edge of the top 100 but he was more like in that 125 130 range  and he's done a lot of his damage obviously with at least one Superstar sometimes two out  Gordon to me has almost no chance of holding 12 team value when Bill comes back right now and has like a 30% chance which is still sub 50/50 but not a pre-drive level and that's the story on Phoenix you know let's hope we get beel back this is a Shams report so it's a legit one and he's targeting the weekend which in my eyes I guess is either Friday or Sunday  but it kind of feels like  you know first game in the new year would pretty much be the latest for Beall because they've got a back-to-back  Phoenix does their hosting Orlando and then the Blazers maybe they just wait and play them on the tail end of that back to back  the Silver Lining on the Bradley Beal stuff is remember he missed like a month or whatever it was with a back injury he's been out with ankle thing this time  and For Better or Worse it's giving his back another month to get right  so I think we can hopefully put the back stuff behind us I assume he's been  doing all the back exercises his body can handle during this ankle absence  so that's why I'm okay with buying low it just feels like you know these guys come back from ankle stuff all the time if the back thing that's the one I was more worried about it this now has had more than enough time to get right heel should be able to walk his way towards top 80 on the year  use it at another player go down there in a little bit of a bad spot right now Jabari Smith Jr played about half of this ball game and then turned ankle he joins Dillon Brooks on the Shelf and it didn't look great for Jabari I don't know what kind of timeline that is but the Rockets have been in a little bit of it it's not a tailspin but they've been in a little bit of a funk after getting off to a very quick start this season  and right now and this is what hurts a lot of teams some clubs are deeper than others and can withstand this kind of stuff the Rockets are not one of those teams  this is a club that went healthy seemed comfortable playing about 1.2 players Off the Bench meaning tari Eason when healthy and like a 0.2 of Jeff Green  and now they're down Dillon Brooks and probably Jabari Smith for at least the next ball game and Brooks has been ruled out for a couple of weeks at this point  so yeah you're gonna get a lot of Alpine Boone you're gonna get most likely a lot of Freddy van Fleet when the game is more competitive you're going to get a lot of tari Eason when he's healthy and the game's competitive and I know he didn't do the game you all want wanted yesterday but he had five damn steals so that alone is worth a start  and then I guess the question is does Jalen green now is he forced into doing enough  or his percentages so bad that even with an overwhelming amount of usage is he still not good enough to play and I don't know that I have the answer to that  I do wonder about a guy like a j Sean Tate could he creeped into fantasy value could Aaron holiday creep into fantasy value I'm doubting it for 12 team you know certainly anything more than just like a schedule play what is Houston have coming up here  not much this was the back end of a back-to-back and now they play one game over the next four days they do have a four game week next week  so if Smith and Brooks are still out and maybe you look at some of those more fringy guys but it feels like shengwen Van Vliet Eason are your safe place and then Jeff Green is like though well when in Rome kind of thing  not I  said the fly not I said me Dan best Bruce I don't want it  before we talk about the Nicks the Thunder and then that that late Mavs game  I do want to again give you guys the code ethos 20 over at manscape.com I'm gonna shout

the handyman you can take care and get a tighter shave with that bad boy without you know traditional blades if that's not your jam  so go check them out post haste thank you in advance for that  Emmanuel quickly is the is all a buzz these days he's been playing well he's been scoring well he hasn't been doing a whole lot else but mostly the notes on quickly right now are ah that  Knicks people want him playing and they don't know why the hell he's not  basically that he was part of a unit that got the Knicks back into this ball game and then he got yanked for the final four minutes for reasons we don't fully know and the next don't really talk to the media so everybody's getting pissed and rightfully so what are you gonna do with this dude  you didn't extend him  you're not really playing him enough to be an impact guy  so what's the plan here  the answer is I don't know does all this smoke create a fire like is it kind of working reverse where everybody is sort of bullying the Knicks into playing and manual quickly more that you know Tibbs doesn't seem like a guy who's gonna get bullied into playing somebody  do they move him  because perhaps he's not part of the long term plans and you know there's a lot of teams that would love to give quickly the basketball for 30 minutes of game and go see what he can do like a young team take a shot on him hell yeah  I suppose there's a certain element of stash value to quickly because he at least is doing some stuff in the interim not enough to be a traditional 12 team her I'm not I'm not stashing but I also understand that there is a pathway to him and ending up someplace else or even someplace here although it would probably take a Jalen Brunson Brunson injury to get him there  but quickly it is the story right now  although perhaps the story should be Shae Gill just Alexander being  unguardable honestly he's one of the most unguardable players in the NBA right now more more than some of the guys who have bigger name value nice to see Jalen Williams with another big ball game he's worked himself up into the 60s so we you know calling him a by low was a pretty easy decision and he's on his way up the board  and there's really not much else that happens with a thunder on a day-to-day Lou Dort had one good ball game and went back to being terrible and so you got shade Jayden Williams and Chad Holmgren and that's all you really need to worry about  and then Cleveland came back and beat Dallas I think they were down 20 at one point in this game Jared Allen 24 points 23 rebounds almost caught on Andre Drummond  he's into this 60s on a per game basis in fantasy so that one's coming around I thought there was almost no chance to have a Mitchell was going to miss this ball game but he really got laid out by this illness it sounded like he was almost good to go but they just let it dangle one more day and then the Cavs came through with a unexpected win they've got Milwaukee at home tomorrow they're on a really low tide part of the schedule too so maybe they just take the L against the Bucks we'll see I thought eventual for sure was playing in this last ball game now I feel like maybe he's less sure to play in the next one because if he skips the Milwaukee game that then sort of finishes up a stretch for the calves where they had two games over eight days you can rest and rest and rest and rest and rest then he comes back potentially on January 1st in Toronto I don't know if he's out Craig Porter's been streamable Isaac Ira is actually been stream of all though you know a lot of his values tied up in a field goal percent that we know won't stick forever  Max Drew has been very up and down lately the shot has kind of fallen off for him he's now shooting just 40% on the season he's actually a Buy Low in my eyes because still averaging 14 5 and 4 with 33 pointers of Steel and half a block but 40% from the field if that works its way back up to like 4344 then he just jumps back up into the 70s and 80s which  is probably where he goes and the way you get there is by shooting better than that for a couple of weeks  it's possible that he's just a guy who's going to be better when the stars are there all so Carousel bird is very much a go I know he's gonna have his percentages issues and that was certainly a problem in this ball game missing a few free throws no defensive stats although usually he can get you steal but he's a certainly a start well both Superstars are out in Garland and Donovan Mitchell and then Levert to me is still a start even when one of those guys comes back just not both  and I swear every day I say the same thing I just can't believe that Dante Exum is going to stay this efficient all year long and he just keeps doing it  he's number 70 over the last two weeks shooting 66% from the field  this is not a sustainable number  and yet you have to play him while he's this hot  so Dante Exum also can kind of go in this dream while there's certainly there's also kind of a fill-in situation going on here with no Kyrie Irving  and  you know that's creating a lot of shots for Seth Curry actually yesterday's game but Tim Hardaway Jr Jones Junior more for Dante eggs and he'd be getting otherwise I keep wimping out and he keeps having these efficient shooting games made all four of his free throws again like this dude just is not missing right now it's crazy  it's absolutely Wild  I can't explain it Seth Curry also got hot you can probably ignore that Derek Jones Junior floated his value with some blocks in this ball game  and that's the thing with both of these guys that I mean like  I get it we might be missing out on a few games from these dudes here and there but like look Derek Jones Juniors outside the top 150 over the last two weeks because just like with exam a lot of the value is tied to feel goal percent Derek Jones Junior field goal percent has been lower the last two weeks and so his valued fell by 100 which is exactly what will at some point happened to donate eggs and I just don't know when  so keep playing him I guess until he gets cold but it's gonna happen and I just know the second that I'm like fine I'll put him in my lineup that's the day it's gonna happen which I realized is bunk that's just a thing that humans feel in our hearts Were Somehow responsible for  and yet at the same time I do feel somehow responsible for it up Tim Hardaway Jr is also to some degree tied to field goal percent although given his usage is usually higher than these other guys with Kyrie Irving out I feel a little bit safer with him even if yesterday's ballgame he was actually the worst of all of those guys but you just sort of feel safer with the guy you know is going to take the second most shots on the team and then you just kind of have to hope that he doesn't only make 30% of them which is precisely what he did yesterday  hey throw a like and a subscribe on something while I flip between yesterday's scores and the and today's upcoming games won't you  won't you my friends won't you  at the end of this show I'm gonna take a quick look in the chat room see if anybody's got some sort of overarching questions but quickly here before that let's talk about the upcoming schedule  Boston is a 17-point home favorite to the Detroit Pistons  nobody wants to lose to the Pistons Celtics look like they're going to try to get some of their guys a little bit of a rest looks like Jalen Brown is gonna get this one off they're gonna call it a back injury which is fine he took a LeBron leg to the back in their game out in Los Angeles Tatum is going to play we'll see if anybody else gets ruled out later on today I don't have any great guesses on who that might be but keep an eye on it  and if you're a betting man I don't know how you don't take 17 points that's a lot of points  um what do we got fantasy wise yeah I mean Detroit you know there's nine cat there are three trick horse right now with Jalen Duren back  Utah as a team to watch I don't know what the hell's going on with them they keep rotating starting lineups  it feels like Colin Sexton is about to lose his his Gusto but maybe not they George is he kind of working his way back up  does John Collins ever get his job back or have they pivoted a different way what about Walker Kessler there's a lot going on there not much that we can just say like oh this is a thing I know is gonna happen I just like I'm curious what you told looks like from game to game and if you can watch this one that's even better  I kind of ran out of patience with her Jones in the last ball game and I feel like that means he's gonna finally have a good one here but  that's it on the Pelican side Dallas we just talked about Minnesota as long as everybody's healthy not a whole lot to pay attention to their um what's cats deal we have a cat update  hmm nothing yet this morning  um  yeah so that's it keep an eye on him if cats sits you can probably extend the nas read thing even if he wasn't that great in their last Blog game I'm sure you'd be better in this one  Pacers Bulls  Pacers tried a new look lineup in their last one  Aaron Nesmith and Jalen Smith  the nesmith's the knee and then parentheses Smith's all got into the starting lineup and look pretty good in their time out there I don't know how many minutes that means gonna get we put him on our watch list after last ball game he might end up as an ad depending on how this one goes and then Chicago no vouch for a week and a half so fire up the Andre Drummonds let's see if Patrick Williams get a cat back going  Indiana's defense is usually good for all fantasy participants we'll see if that holds on the Indy side keep an eye on buddy hield see if his minutes fall back kind of off to the Wayside with him coming off the bench they didn't in the last ball game by still played enough but I am concerned because bench buddy hield was not very good to start the year and starter buddy hield fantasy at least was pretty good Grizzlies are feeling their oats these days Denver is without Aaron Gordon I think we can just watch and see if anybody's worth an actual fill in grab Aaron Gordon was a bit by a dog like a lot it sounds like face and hands so he's out for a little bit  I don't know that anybody that the drops in here for the Nuggets is gonna get to do enough with that starting five but we'll see  for the Jimmy Butler is questionable so we can make any real calls on them until later on today  Warriors are favored by three and a half which kind of makes you feel like Butler's gonna sit but who knows  for the Warriors but gems he's been good  Steph and Klay have been good lately  I am not totally sold on trayce Jackson Davis as a long-term thing and certainly if if Draymond Green is back in like the next two weeks and that takes whatever Shine off their  and kind of the same story for Jonathan kaminga let's see if Andrew Wiggins can put together two okay games in a row that would be a first for the year  for the Spurs when banana sitting one half of this back-to-back in Portland I think they said the first half but I don't know if it's fully confirmed today yeah so keep an eye on that and whichever game will MB sits you can start Zach Collins keep an eye on champagne keep an eye on whatever else the Spurs are doing in their infinite tanky wisdom this year  trying every lineup they can put together besides the ones that actually involve Trey Jones because I think they're afraid he might actually lead them to a win  Portland it all in my opinion any decisions we're making here come down to shade and sharp we know DeAndre Aiden is out but I also know that I'm way too big of a wuss to throw doop wreath into the into my lineups in a rotiform and anyway I had a good ball game last time out but I just  okay so the Spurs would certainly be the time to try it and you've got them two times in a row because San Antonio can't guard anybody but I am so kind of nervous about it and then with Charlotte Brandon Miller I believe is questionable I think we got that news was that first thing this morning or late last night I was late last night he's questionable Mark Williams still doubtful Gordon Hayward is already out so Charlotte is kind of terrorism versus the world right now Nick Richards still seems to be a good feeling PJ Washington this is this game has big PJ written all over it  like there's gonna be floating through this game and with maybe they're gonna continue to use that idiotic new starting lineup and it's of course they're going to its gonna work because Charlotte's terrible oh Lakers  you idiots um  I still kind of like Tori and prints on the Lakers side he's been doing enough but you know keep an eye on how these rotations shake out I'm holding the Angela Russell almost regardless of what happens over the next few days because I just can't believe that he's suddenly going to just be a 16 minute per game guy long-term  that's nonsense he's too good offensively for that  and I know the Lakers have rebounding and defense issues but just find a way man  he's better out there for your team then cam Reddit issues  find a way  because it doesn't rebound defense better but he's also useless on offense  I don't get it like Lakers I really don't I watch all of these games and I just don't understand what's happening right now  Charlotte's side I think Cody Martin was the name I mentioned as someone to watch his almost no chance that I drop him into my lineup Bryce mcgowens has been getting the starts and I just really don't care about that  and that's about as far as I go with what's going on this evening and that is about as far as I go with what's going on on today's program as we glance into the chat room what do we got going on over here anything of extreme note a lot of folks helping each other I like that  oh Joey asks with Jalen Brown out tonight Who's the best streaming option it's usually Sam Houser when a guard or small wing is out  but we'll see if Hauser gets to start or if Al Horford gets the start Boston is  on a back-to-back  so my guess is that Horford or poor Singas sits this one  possibly both if they think they can win because they've got a tougher game against Toronto tomorrow not like not the Toronto's bunch of world-beaters but they got a much better shot to win the Detroit does so keep an eye on this Boston thing because you know if Horford sits and Jalen Brown said you got to figure that house gets into the starting lineup and it gets the bad team he's going to get five or six three pointers up into the air  and then tomorrow if porzingis is down we may have an opportunity to sort of get out in front of an Al Horford thing because kp's been sitting back to back Boston has a back-to-back this week next week the week after that I think they got how many weeks in a row that's it three weeks in a row they've actually go back they've had five weeks in a row with the back to back so you may have an opportunity to flip Horford in for two or three games here over the next two and a half weeks and on the Roadhouse side that actually makes a lot of sense but I don't know that I actually answer the question but whatever  uh yeah Shahar says let us know when you pick XM so we know in the slump is coming I'm telling you man it doesn't feel like we have control over this I know for a fact I don't  but it sure feels like I I will  ask Scott Foster says been here since the days of the Hawaiian coffee sponsorship yeah Hawaiian Isles that was like our first partnership  and they kind of ghosted us I'd love to work with them again they had they gave us prizes we could give away these nice like three five pound bags of beans people love those things  oh well  um but upon doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo lot of Bradley Beal questions I hope that I answered those on the show if I didn't all throw a little bit more about that on on social media  and again anything else that's not sort of relevant for everyone make sure that you throw it in the comments section and I'll try to get over to that tonight  what is your gut feeling on Joel and Beads return I'm thinking after the Chicago game but I don't know for sure they've got a couple of those and if they give them all that time off they have this really light schedule next week it and I feel like they'd love to give embiid that part of the calendar to kind of get right Sixers or 21 and 9 they're three games up on the four seeded heat they're in a really good spot right now I know they'd love to catch the Bucks and or the Celtics but I also know that Joel embiid is more important so if that means missing whatever it is three more games to get like a full week off they might roll it that way you know it's not like missing two games for a guy that maybe isn't actually hurts like he actually does have something going on but if that means you know a couple more games buys him a week week plus they probably lean that way but again I don't know I think we'll get more news maybe even as early as later today when we find out if he's traveling for the rest of the Sixers road trip and then you'll have a much better idea of whether he's even trying to get into those games or if they're looking at perhaps when the team gets back home I want to quickly let you guys know what's coming up on fantasy NBA today because the schedule is going to get a little bit weird here over the next like four-ish days through the New Year the best brisk crew is going on vacation going out of town I'm hoping to get a show out to you guys later on tonight with The Weeknd review and possibly also kind of a quick look ahead at next week which is despite New Year's a relatively normal week by the way a quick skin of the calendar I don't know that any team even has two games next week I think every single team in the NBA is either three or four which makes it one of the easiest weeks for streaming because you can turn some threes into fours there's not there aren't really any obvious avoid teams other than maybe you are like Charlotte because they got five games or one game over the final five days of the week but everybody else's space pretty good in there and then Philly who we just talked about kind of comes into the week on a slow part of the calendar  but ramps up by the end of it and then they go into a bad schedule Phillies schedule actually gets really light here over the next little bit but again that's what I'm hoping to get to you guys tonight it'll kind of be like a speed round version of that we'll try to do it all in 45 or 50 minutes instead of rolling over an hour but that's the plan because then there will not be another show until Tuesday after that we're gonna have Monday off because I'll be traveling that day and that's why I'm hoping I can get you kind of a Friday Monday combo show late tonight that will be good and relevant all throughout the weekend so bear with us a little bit on that again I don't go anywhere  kind of ever so that's why I don't almost don't really know what to do with myself but thank you again for watching everybody that's what's coming up here in terms of like weird scheduling on fantasy NBA today I am at Danbury so over on social and I will again hope to talk to you guys later on this evening make sure to subscribe however you're taking in this content so you get an alert when that very large many day combo show probably maybe comes out we'll figure it out on the Fly either way see you guys on social between now and then we'll talk Bradley be all over there later now
