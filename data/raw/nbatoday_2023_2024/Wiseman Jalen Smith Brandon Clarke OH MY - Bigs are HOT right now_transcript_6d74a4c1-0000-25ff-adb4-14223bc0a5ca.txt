hustle though we're gonna do a little hustling today there's only six question mark games from yesterday's card so we'll break them down I think we can get this show done in under a half hour today  we'll do a quick check at the chat room with the end of it as well just in case so welcome everybody especially if you are new I love when there's one I always know there's one new listener somehow  Brooklyn sucks  there's your fantasy analysis Brooklyn stinks I stink  got smoke again  what a rough year Mikhail Bridges has forgotten how to shoot  but you still start him every day because he's Iron Man and he's going for Iron Man related records Bridges cam Thomas Nick Clacks and those are the easy choices the hard choices on this team are numerous really Dennis Schroder is one that we've talked about on the Pod and I know I'm lower on him that I think the consensus NBA feeling on truder I am as you guys know someone who plays nine category and truder is not a great nine category asset he's pretty good at assists and he's okay at free throws and then beyond that they're in the whole lot else  to roll it up into it you know he's outside the top 150 on the season he's number one 52 and 31 minutes of all games I don't know what people feel like they need to see anymore the key for him is that there needs to be a key usage guy down so the dentist can go get a bunch of shots and he can't right now because mostly because Camus is in there so if you're playing Schroeder you're a cist hunting and you're okay with the fact that he's probably gonna take a deuce on your field goal percent  also a question mark right now interestingly is Trend and Watford who's been trending up oh yeah oh I did it  yeah trending up 21.2 Boards of Steel Block in a three-pointer he shot the ball really well over his last couple of weeks months sustainably High although  Watford is I say historically like he has a long track record but you know in his brief NBA career he's been a pretty good field goal percent guy  added that sort of big wing spot on the floor he's not a traditional Center I don't know that you'd call him really a traditional power forward because his rebounding is really only okay  buddy get some steals that seems to be a pretty consistent theme  the field goal percentage is good the free throw percent is not  so don't get too caught up in that he's shooting 83% of the foul line this year but that's probably due for a negative mean reversion  who knows maybe he'll just magically be better but I don't  it's one of those things where you kind of have to see it over like a lot of free throws to believe it and I mean it's been better  what could we get  out of trend and Watford because I got a couple questions on him on Twitter yesterday and I thought you know these are good questions I don't know why I didn't bring these up soon or why I haven't I spent any time on Watford  reason is as Fantasy game is really only okay  I like the field goal percent  from a guy who can hit a three-pointer  in  you know on starters minutes but you know that that range of minutes  and you put those two things that one three-pointer decent field goal percent okay you're on your way towards something but he's not gonna block many shots he's eighteen point three and 12 minutes a game this year he probably you extrapolate that to starter's minutes you're probably looking at something like about point five half a block steals you could probably make a case that he gets up to about you know point eight point nine so not horrendous but no assists still be very low rebounds will be met at best he's not a great rebounder so where how do we pile up the value if he's not gonna score a bunch and when I Bunch I'm not talking about a dozen 13 points I'm talking about like 17 points which is not gonna happen the answer is it's probably not there but the way that it gets there is shut Downs  so in my opinion yes I like the extra minutes for just getting I like the fact that suddenly he's now getting 10 11 shots of ballgame which is definitely a big step in the right direction suddenly the field goal percent can actually be working kind of in your favor that can get him to 14 15 points if he's taking 10 11 shots of ball game is my draft board falls on my head in the background  but I do think we need someone out of the way  who is that someone  Dorian Finney Smith would probably do if he was done that would probably get what for up to playable in most formats  cam Thomas being out would Elevate everybody on the team not that I'm trying to blame him for something he's one of the only bright spots all season long for the nights but his very high usage doesn't really help the guys around him all that much and I don't know how many guys on this team that do  you could also take a look at around sharp if it Clacks and gets shut down there's a bunch of sort of fill in level guys on the Nets but not really any of them have crested over that hump yet so Watford was interesting I wouldn't call him the big news of the day but he certainly someone that's kind of near the top of the watch list the big news out of this ball game was Myles Turner dislocating a finger  I chose not to watch the replay of it because apparently it showed his finger bending sideways at 90 degrees they popped it back in he shot some free throws left-handed just in case he needed to come back into the Ballgame later but that was the power of positive thinking yeah he didn't come back he didn't play in the second half he finished with five blocks anyway miles was on his way to  maybe a triple double with points boards and blocks  so if you have Myles Turner this sucks because I think you have to assume that he's gonna miss a ball game  it didn't look good and there's gonna be swelling  like your best shot of playing would have been right after they popped it back in  but the Pacers were smoking the Nets in this game so it was no reason to push it  if Myles Turner has to miss a ball game Jaylen Smith who came in and had a double-double in 15 minutes before getting himself ejected would be a terrific fill in play if Jalen Smith has to miss any time because he's been banged up throughout the year for any number of reasons then you move all the way down to Isaiah Jackson so you've got these nice fantasy backups but it's hard to make a call without knowing for sure I would say Head to Head side you probably don't do much of anything because you're not going to typically not gonna gain a games played Advantage by making this move  but in Roto I can make a really strong case for picking up Jalen Smith  he's number 188 this year on Yahoo in 17 minutes of ballgame 10 points five and a half rebounds that's in 17 and a half minutes on a big time positive field goal percent so if you start to roll that into more of a starter's minutes profile and there's no guarantee that he gets more than 24/25 even if he starts as a guarantee that he gets more than 22  but if you look at the games this year and it mean count on one hand where Jalen Smith got 25 ish minutes even 24 Franklin they've been buying large pretty good  and we'll go through them real fast here November 8th he played 24 minutes and 45 seconds and win over the Jazz he had 16 and 11 with two steals in a block on five of eight shooting  December 28th he played 24 and a half minutes against the Bulls he had 15 and 7 on 6 out of seven shooting in that ball game but  he absolutely destroyed your field goal percent so not as great January 6th and January 8th he had a couple of games of 26 minutes in a row seven and seven not great but 11 and 9 with 3 blocks in the next one was pretty good 25 minutes about two games after that only eight and three 25 minutes couple games after that he had 17 and 13 with a block  30 minutes on January 28th I was a season high for Jalen he also had three three-pointers in that game 19 and 10 with two blocks as well  so basically what you're looking for here is where are the Avenues for him to increase his minutes up to 25 or higher and this presumably would be one of them  there is some interesting upside with Smith because he can step out into three while still elevating field goal percent you just kind of hope that he doesn't take too many free throws but he also can look into a block every now and there and you got an interesting stat profile  so I think Jalen Smith is an ad  Roto I mean again where you're not gonna get punished by using a movie and had you got away you can't do anything this far in advance of a ball game that's  asked recipe for total disaster on the head side but Rodeo you can pick Jaylin Smith up stick him on your bench and hope that he gets a spot start coming up here and if he does and you just sort of roll with it you probably get a pretty good line  Boston's a pretty easy team to handicap Jaylen Brown sat this one out and call it a rest day and so I'll Hartford slid into the starting lineup easy peasy game was a pretty easy win for the Celtics so Sam Houser got a few extra minutes off the bench as did Payton Pritchard Hauser at 73 Pritchard didn't do a whole lot with his time those are guys  at least in my eyes I feel like two guys generally need to be out to get to Houser  not that 7 threes wasn't good enough but it in 24 minutes there's no guarantee that he had fantasy value and then for Prichard you need someone in the back court  more specifically down and Drew holiday and Derek white were both healthy for this blog you wouldn't know about looking at Drew's line  so it's Al Horford Horford's the feeling when one guy is out on the Charlotte side we had a few guys out the most important of them being Nick Richards  which we saw this before when both Mark Williams and he's been out the whole damn year basically and Nick Richards are out Grant Williams gets the bump up to Center we talked about on yesterday's podcast I was like look if we find out Nick Richards is out you got to go Grant Williams because he suddenly adds Center profile stuff to his Fantasy game so a couple extra rebounds he had seven of those if the field goal percent gets better because he's near the rim more  and just more opportunity and great William said 23 and 7 was kind of hoping for a defensive stabbed but hard to argue with the rest of this one two three-pointers seven boards 63% shooting on 16 shots pretty good all around game for Grant and he's a play if Nick Richards misses any more ball games  if Richards comes back you probably I mean Grant Williams then slides back into basically a threes and light rebound stream in the don't in the doesn't matter grouping  also kind of in the doesn't matter group but silly I mean Stitch he had nine assists again he's been racking up assists which is nice it didn't do a whole lot else and he doesn't do it on great percentage is either so wow it looks good because we all get a little salivary when it comes to a cysts  the other stuff isn't quite high enough to make him in All formats play but he's a very clear assists play if that's a category you need like a reliable consistent one  poke was back only played 16 minutes though  Memphis beats Detroit a battle for the seller  what are you doing Detroit you had this one you had this one Piston's  apparently they had to rest Cade cutting for a few minutes during the ball game and that was really all it took JJ had a big one Kate had a big one so those guys are locked in that's nice but then you've got all these other dudes that are maybes Luke Kennard I think is above a maybe when he's starting we've talked about that before when he's starting for this Memphis team he's a play because he becomes their de facto point guard right now and he's the best shooter on the team by I would reckon a large margin so all of you get a game like this one 19 points 538 assists that's a big game for Kinard  I'm not playing GG Jackson outside of points leagues I'm not playing Santi aldama at all he's really cool off Jordan Goodwin is always fun when you know if he's gonna get minutes but we don't know if he's gonna get minutes  and so that brings us to Brandon Clarke  after his last ball game I said this is interesting because let's remember he really only needs about 24 minutes to post consistent fantasy value and he got 23 and a half in this ball game  where did the remaining minutes come from yeah that's the question because we've seen the Grizzlies are more than willing to put people ahead of Clark in the pecking order  but man can he rack up fantasy stats field goal percent bored steals blocks he is  a well-rounded fantasy big man type not a massive rebounder by any real stretch but I mean look at this line 15.7 boards a steel 2 blocks a three-pointer 7 out of 12 shooting  that's a good stuff in that game  and he's close the problem is we don't really have a whole lot of time to work with it right now we're under two weeks from the end of the regular season so  if you're kind of like stashing and the traditional sense but semi stashing Clark to see what happens over the next couple of ball games  you wait a couple of ball games this season's over  Memphis plays again tomorrow in Milwaukee maybe we should just say this if Clark gets 23 minutes again in the next ball game you pick him up and you stash him and then as soon as he clears 204 you can probably start it  on the Detroit side Jalen during left early he got a tooth knocked out about five minutes into the ball game which means  if you need a nice empty Double-Double James Wiseman is back on the board usually will get you some scoring in the teens it'll get you around 10 Reed yesterday he got himself a Curt Thomas and this ball game 10  that's the old Curt Thomas  sorry guys this is like an early 2000s throwback reference to Kurt Thomas's fantasy lines this is what James was going to do he's gonna mess up your free throw percent so you just hope he doesn't go there he's not great with turnovers even though he doesn't pass really he'll probably get you about 14 points in 10 Rebelle else great if you do not so great I'm still waiting on metu  to convince me that I should make a play on it and I really want to  its 17 and 8 in this ball game  and two blocks and a three-pointer he's been playing really well but he hasn't apparently earned the starting job yet I don't know what more he needs to do  but that's why I'm nervous  I'm a nervous Man by Nature  met who's putting up really good fantasy lines but there's this risk with him coming off the bench the minutes are just going to be like 20 one game and you're not gonna get what you need  so right now he's a very interesting high priority watch list Guy where again Wiseman is your feelings stream over on the other side Brandon Clarke is also kind of a high priority watch list guy these guys can do it again you probably make a play on him then you got Grant Williams as a fill in yeah a Horford as a filling you have Jalen Smith as a likely fill in trended for his kind of a mid-range watchlist guy that's a really busy early part of the fantasy card yesterday  that's when I was like oh six games we can do this in a half hour and I'm sure you guys were all like whatever Dan stop talking Dan  laces out Dan  Banton  Banton 17 more shots Off the Bench 8 free throws also man this dude is a usage monster right now  and he's very much a play he's in that situation where even though his efficiency numbers are horrible he's just so involved in everything going on with the Blazers right now that he can overwhelm the bad efficiency with good other stuff  I mean three steals two blocks five boards five assists for three pointers 26 points you can Overlook the field goal and free throw percent being negative  so Banton is a play deandre's a play these are your nine cat decisions technically Chris Murray is probably a nine category play but in my eyes kind of in that slow-moving he's gonna give you a little bit of a bunch of things not so much in assists but he'll never give you a three you'll give you some rebounds to give you some steals he's gonna do it without blowing up your percentages he's a very boring 100 to 125 range guys so he's kind of like a doesn't matter like a better than average doesn't matter range dude we're talking about Chris Murray here where you probably play him if you need to make up games played if you're looking for steals a couple of boards trying not to ruin your percentages it's hard to find these days Jabari Walker at 18 and 9 he doesn't usually do much besides point and rebound  and he had five assists here so that was something but it's hard for him to maintain fantasy value because he's really sort of a two trick pony and then scoot we talked about he's pointlessly it has to be points League  he's also super involved in everything going on like Banton but even worse in the efficiency stuff field goal percent worse turnovers way worse  not as many defensive stats and he's going to be good scoot could be sort of a post type guy for next year but hey  don't draft rookie ball Handler's for the magic Jalen Suggs continues to rumble a long France Vagner is another nine cat guy Paulo is your points League option it's the same stuff as usual there  Jonathan Isaac back down to 17 minutes again he had six and four with a couple of blocks but it's hard to play unless you know he's getting over 20 minutes which we once again don't even know it kind of seemed like he was gonna  owl and then Wendell Carter Junior goes on these little mini heaters where you're like oh maybe he could be a top 100 play and then he cools back off again he's number one 63 per game on the season he has won ten range upside Wendell Carter Junior more of a points and rebounds play  and I would obviously prefer him over someone like a James Wiseman we also talked about is kind of a points rebounds guy  just a safer job for Wendell Carter Junior but both those guys kind of profile somewhat similar not the same not the same window better free throw shooter but not that different  meanwhile vitre 18 points on a perfect six for six from downtown this is a guy where I look at the Hawks schedule and I was like okay and I picked him up last week and I dropped him going into this week even though he has a great schedule I was like I can't I just can't do it again I can't get another 4.2 rebound one assist ball game and then crutches like it's cool man  exploded on the Wayward wire  this will undoubtedly be the best game he posts I'll season  with Jalen Johnson back and likely ramping his minutes up close to 30 by the next ball game you're gonna like me see crunchy continue to Trend down the Hawks you can play now have shifted a little bit because I don't know that the DeAndre Hunters Gonna Get Enough usage with Jalen Johnson back Hunter comes I think more of a scoring stream and your starters are Jalen Johnson Clint capela Bogdan bogdanovich and dejounte Murray your schedule plays amazingly beat crunchy was one but I don't think that that's really a safe one Bruno Fernando is a schedule play DeAndre Hunter slides down to a schedule play and that good friends is as far as you go on that front  the Chicago Bulls ladies and gentlemen start the starters Andre Drummond at 18 rebounds Off the Bench in 20 minutes but again that's it he's a rebounds only stream and I'll admit I'm actually using him in a league where I was looking at the Roto scores and I was like damn if I could like up my rebound average on a per game basis I could actually pass one or two dudes so yeah I got drama on a club I think I might even have it I'm on two teams believe it or not but that doesn't mean you need to all so it's a situation where you are really hunting a category and this is a guy that's not even in the doesn't matter range because it's free throws her bad and his minutes are way all over the map  you get like six points 10 rebounds and who the hell knows what else yeah I mean there's a use to that  without question there's a use to that you know last two weeks Drummond's averaging 11 rebounds of ballgame and he's number one twenty five over that range in 18 and a half minutes so sure like again  you know what you're getting  do it if you need to  otherwise start the starters  Phoenix also start the starters this was lava Booker game he does this every once in a while it's very cool to watch he moves a couple slots up the board then he has some normal games and he slides two or three slots back Booker mid second rounder I didn't think he was gonna get this high I'll be honest I thought he was gonna be like more late second or early third range but he managed to keep his usage super high despite adding Bradley Beal who obviously is the one who took the big hit there and you know even Kevin Durant took a little bit of a small hit all though his was more about the free throwing percentage being down usage only down a little bit for KD Bookers just been a pillar of efficiency all season long but I will take credit for one thing which was saying there was no way he was going to average ace ball game and he's now down into the mid sixes which is I think where we said he was going to be six to seven he's at 6.9 so he's at the upper end of that but he's been really good this year other than the injuries  now 61 games he's hanging in there  it's been a healthier since the beginning  anyway you start the starters I don't know why I'm talking about the Sons there's really nothing there and then for the Pelicans  you understand finally got enough minutes to actually do some damage but he went one for four at the free throw line and that blew up that pop opportunity  what do you do with JV I've said it before I'm having a lot of trouble kind of  with empathy on this one I'm having trouble putting myself in your shoes  because I don't have valentina's and this was the season I thought he was gonna have from the beginning of the year so I got it very wrong the first three months but I'm finally write for the last month and a half  and so you know my advice is he's not a fantasy play but at the same time if you had him the whole year I don't know how you're just like all right goodbye because he's also at this point basically just a points rebound stream maybe even more just a rebound field goal percent stream  So then you're comparing him to the other names we just went over on this board scroll back up on Andre Drummond who's basically a rebound stream Wendell Carter Junior whose points rebounds guy Wiseman not so much Brandon Clark he's has a little bit more of a varied Fantasy game for getting one name oh Jalen Smith who's also kind of points rebound Z  now he's got a little bit of upside too so what is the big driving force for holding on to Valentine's right now the driving force is none of those other guys we just talked about are on the way for wire because if they are I think they're probably more interesting  right now there's pretty much no chance JV gets more about 24 minutes a game this is kind of him maxing out  Larry Nance is playing a bunch at Center Zions playing a bunch of Center Dice and Daniel's is back so they got Deeper by the way Dyson Daniels not a bad steals stream  if you're into that sort of thing Jose Alvarado being out has been good for dice and to slide right back into a decent chunk of minutes but for the most part on this club you can only play the four key guys right now which is Trey Murphy who is stayed hot herb Jones has been a defensive Force Zion and CJ  man people believe how long CG McCollum stayed a second rounder this year before reality finally said in now he's right around number 50 which by the way that's still a win for him on the year what do you do man what do you do with the Pelicans big men I don't think you can play any of them  I'm saying Nancy Valentina there's just no safety there  luckily they don't have a great schedule anymore or not any better than anyone else really so they last week they were such a priority where it was like wow we got to get a pelican in there they're playing on the low traffic days now it's like who cares  just start the main four don't worry about the rest JV you can drop  who cares he has one big game the rest of the way there's two freaking weeks left in the season there's literally nothing you could do right now that would be that bad for your fantasy team other than like accidentally dropping the wrong Johnson  or Jalen oops didn't mean to drop that guy  oh no I accidentally dropped in certain third rounder when I meant to drop insert waiver wire guy but in situations like that if you email your commissioner within the first like 12 seconds usually they can turn that joint around and yeah who leaves are overnight Fab so it doesn't even happen when you click the button and it happens in midnight  there's literally nothing you can do to your fantasy team right now in Roto  that is that big of a deal because it'll cost you six games of something  so you can be super aggressive this time of year  we try to stay really patient in October and November December January even February by March patients can wear a little bit and my April it's freaking April 2nd people you don't need any patients at all somebody's doing something you don't like just cut them because by the time they come off waiver someone else is going to pick them up and if they're good they've got four games out of them who cares no change at all  you need to be category hunting on the Roadhouse side and head to head you need to be dodging zeroes anybody that's a zero you dump them peace  set him free  you know they say if you love someone  click check at the chat room see if they covered anything in there that I forgot to let's see here is trade Jones worth streaming is you just gonna go up with the cell Sohan out for the season I would say yes I actually kind of like to trade Jones as a play anyway here's the problem their schedule so sucks this week there playing today in Denver which is not an easy game and then they're off for two more days Pelicans on Friday and overload day and Philly on Sunday a 13 gamer so head-to-head Spurs are a terrible business to get into right now Roto yeah absolutely I like him a lot  Kyle Anderson Lowry or Reggie Jackson pending various injury news who do I like the most safe play there is slo-mo  hello Dan thank you for helping me win my first seeds and I drafted pool 23rd and I got the dub anyway you are very entertaining thanks man I appreciate that seems like you didn't listen to the show early enough or you would have heard me talking about how I didn't want anything to do with Jordan Poole but guess what you want anyway so who gives a crap  should I dropped I owe to move for Charis Levert Chicago stinks the rest of the week or their schedule does yeah you're right about that it is a terrible schedule I have both Myles Turner and Jay Linda and on my finals team oh I'm sorry man  that's a rough day  I think Duran's back soon  he'll probably just play with a mouth guard while they figure out how to get the two three attached they'll probably have to do some dental surgery clear out the hole and then basically they kind of like screw it in  like a friend in high school was missing one tooth that just never showed up so ultimately they had to put a retainer in that was slowly slide teeth apart to create an opening then they did a surgery to put basically like I'm trying to think about like the construction equivalent would be  and I brain farting on a on a podcast in real time as to what it's called but it's basically what you jam into a wall  that allows you to then put a screw into it and that's what they did they put like a tooth with a screw on and they  just popped it into that hole  so I don't know maybe that's what they do okay I don't think they can just glue that sucker back in  saying a plastic kids toy who's the better team replacement Pat Bev or miles McBride well one of them is not a Dame replacement the other is a OG&E replacement miles McBride is the safer play there  Delano Banton on the overload days or Duncan Robinson on light days I think I mean if you're overloaded you probably got to go with the guy who's you can use now Benton's been really good but presumably  this is a math equation basically all right calculate what you think you're going to get out of Duncan Robinson  but don't they play on overload days too  Portland is Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday the heat are Tuesday Thursday Friday Sunday  Friday and Sunday are the overload days so I'm guessing that means that your Wednesday is overloaded I yeah I don't know I mean the thing here is of course you're getting four games the rest of the week out of Duncan Robinson  three out of Banton  um  but if you're debating of who to use on an overload day I I feel like  um  so you may be they may be the question here is two Duncan Robinson games versus zero so like four Duncan Robinson versus two of Delano Banton if Banton is an overload on Wednesday am I interpreting that question right the four beats the two  even if Benton's gonna be doing better numbers on a you know individual days but the four beats the two there so if that's the question then that's the answer  think I'm maybe getting that right  all right I did it around a half an hour not exactly but that was my target we'll have the afternoon show kind of late today I think it'll probably be pushing right up near the start of the Ballgame but I do have some streaming thoughts for tonight so make sure to join us for that one again I am at Dan best so over on
