sure to check out Sports ethos.com and Ethos fantasy BK on social media for your goodies over there this is by low for week 12 and I've got some new names on the board for you guys actually but you know how we've been doing things here lately what I'd like to do  is spend the first couple of slides discussing some of the stuff we've  kind of been talking about over the last couple of weeks and so let's start and I reorganize it a little bit this time around so these are the most recent prior buys  Mikhail Bridges who finally you're starting to see a little bit of something I know we're we're talking about a very limited sample size of basically like  one good game is it now but you know what I don't I don't care I'll take any signs of life top 50 over his last two games better than that over the last one that was one big one and but every little bit is going to change things and I think for Brooklyn they have this really nice easy week where they're largely gone this is a Paris game I believe right and France so everybody's gonna get rested that'll be good for all of them and I think he comes out sort of continuing to swing so good start on that one Jimmy Butler is heard again he was  the previous week and then he got her and I left him on the Bi-Lo from this last week because everybody's so fed up with it so he's kind of a  verdict not out yet on the Bi-Lo wreck and then Carla Anthony towns who had a really good game yesterday to kind of start his re-assigned to the mid 40s with the good ball game last night he's now back up to number 37 that one again was I thought one that was a pretty easy call guys have dips guys you know there's the whole up and down thing throughout the season and for cat you knew after a couple of Quiet Ones a couple good ones were coming so an opportunity to kind of get in on him so a good start on that one good start on Bridges not so great start of the Jimmy Butler one that's what we were talking about last week along with the what we call the risky one and I'll have one of those at the end of this show as well that's lamelo ball who again we did that show on Friday so it's only been five days I said I thought he'd be back you know to some odd two to three weeks from there so we're only five days into my 14 to 21 that one sort of again can't really judge it just yet but we'll check back in on lamelo soon the previous Bi-Lo wins so this is how I kind of recategorization these are some of the names that we've given this year that have actually cashed in DeMar DeRozan who has moved up from the mid-60s to the early 40s he's actually been number 20 over the last month Jalen Williams has been rolling Julius Randle has been rolling since we gave him out a long time ago oggian and Obey took him a while took a trade actually to kind of make it happen but now he's finally getting better Walker Kessler's minutes are all over the map but remember he was outside the top 100 and he's number 68 in nine cat now so that one is worked out and then Bradley Beal was one we talked about buying while he was injured kind of before news was gonna come that that he was coming back I mentioned buying on Bradley building that was maybe a day or two two three days before Christmas and I was like look I think he probably comes back right after the new year he actually got back sooner than that he hasn't hit his stride yet but that's not really the issue here you were labeled to likely get him for pennies on the dollar  and now he's gonna slowly work himself into shape so I like that one a lot  previous by low is that haven't cashed yet and it's really just two Jimmy Butler is the one that's annoying right now steals just haven't been there and he's currently hurt which actually makes him a really easy Bilo call and then cam Johnson who  looked like he was going to make his move up the board and then started to and kind of leveled off  because he was at like 115 I was like this is a Bi-Lo this guy could jump up into the 60s he's been rolling it kind of like an 85 to 95 Clips since then but that's not really what we were looking for we wanted more  and so technically he's been a little better than when we said to buy low but I don't consider that a win because the price you paid for him is probably equal to or maybe even slightly more expensive than where he sat right now so I'd rather be harder on ourselves than we need to be if anything so I'm looking for more out of Cam Johnson I haven't read either of these guys off I still think I still think they've got a pretty good shot to get it going  but let's transition into today's name and the first one is the guy who's in the thumbnail and that's D'Angelo Russell who's been  really bad lately not a whole lot of opportunities to sugarcoat it but largely it's because the Lakers have pulled the rug out from underneath him  he was playing 30 some odd minutes a game at the beginning of the year he was confident shooting the ball well assists were nice deals were nice feel goal percent actually hasn't changed that much for him but the free throw number has plummeted kind of a weird twist he just like didn't shoot any for a while and then he got to the line and he started missing them and then the Lakers just stopped playing them all together he's coming off the bench and he's playing 1617 minutes a game he's basically like a oh you're filling in for the starters while they're resting kind of player and we know that Dlow offensively  is just better than that  but he's at odds with the Lakers right now there's again there's really no other way to look at it if you watch these games he's getting in  I say fights with opposing players but he's playing so chippy and he sort of like trying to force getting hot and he's making weird decisions and he's throwing no look passes and he's just he's doing all these things that are  like young D'Angelo Russell like he's trying to like Grandma a round Peg through a square hole  and I think it's because he's either afraid that he's on the way out or he's about to actually be on the way out  whatever the case may be whether it's a fear that he's on the way out or that he actually is on the way out  either way this is a bottoming out point he's number two and 16 over the last month in nine cat he's dropped from remember he was in the 6570 range to start the year he's dropped at number one and 19 on the season in nine cat but this is a guy that with even close to starter's minutes can get inside the top 90 and with actual starters minutes he could go much higher than that  someone  it could be the Lakers it could be some other team is going to eventually have basically no choice but to play Dlow  more minutes than he's getting right now  there's just no way around the Lakers need offense and yet they kind of refuse to play and I think some of it is this sort of negative feedback loop going on where he got benched and initially it was like oh it's okay and then  re and or like Reeves got benched and then D logo got benched but then those two guys were trying to share the floor together and now they've flipped it and now Reeves is back in the starting lineup which ultimately does make more sense to have those guys separated but delos minutes are not at all guaranteed even when he was playing better in some of these games he's not getting longer so there was one where he got additional playing time he's getting yanked around and then he's getting annoyed about it  so then he gets yanked around more because he's not playing focused and he's in trade talks so then he's not playing focused either  and on and on and on and on and on and at some point something's going to give let's say he gets traded to who are the Lakers being linked to dejounte Murray Zach LaVine DeMar DeRozan Alex Caruso the Lakers are linked to these guys if he ends up on one of those teams like Chicago is not going to wave him they're still trying to win as long as they don't blow the whole thing up  Atlantis still trying to win as long as they don't blow the whole thing up most of the places he goes he would have a better opportunity than whatever is going on with the Lakers right now  or the other side of it Lakers make some other trade and D'Angelo Russell's not involved in it or no trade at all  eventually  I have confidence that Darvin ham in this Lakers team are going to look and say yes our issue these days is if Anthony Davis is not other worldly we don't have much offense going on  LeBron remains truly incredible at age 39  but he can't play with the speed that the modern NBA dictates and that's again not to take anything away from LeBron he's clearly a cyborg knowing I don't know that anybody will ever do what he's doing at this age again but the Lakers have no speed and so they get into these weird half quart situations guys start to do whatever like if they don't have their best horses on the floor the offense gums up quick they're gonna need Dlow out there  so at some point he's gonna play more  the nice thing about this Bi-Lo is it might cost you nothing  that's the thing someone's be like  what like what am I even offering up for D'Angelo Russell right now nothing  I don't think you need to spend anything on D'Angelo Russell right now I think someone's gonna drop him if they haven't already and you'll just be able to scoop him up  and if they haven't you could probably give up somebody like oh I don't know I may have Kaz  because look is great he's been he's not going to be the same when Jimmy Butler comes back he's just not  or I don't know if somebody thinks Mark Williams is never coming back maybe you could give up Nick Richards or John Collins who is just the most boring player of the year two boring even for me right now or streaming Carousel Levert who I think is going to run out of gas and then the next two to three weeks when Darius Garland likely comes back which is by the way a wink nod nod or something coming up later in the show  Dennis Schroder at 110 who has almost no way to get higher than that given Toronto brought in two horses  in that ogn adobe trade  I gotta believe that someone in that list of names I just said Has a chance to get it done  hell Tree Murphy who's probably like right around in 9100 range guy if you lose him you'll be a little bit upset about it but it's not really gonna cost you all that much in the long run  it might take some time I should add the precursor on this d low chat that I don't think this is gonna take I don't think it's gonna happen tomorrow  he could get traded tomorrow but it might also take until the trade deadline like this might be a Bi-Lo that you have to sit on for four weeks  but  he's in this gunning mode right now off the bench so you know the last what do you want to call it week or so  he's been especially bad but he had a game in there where he was a little bit better you'll just look at a few points in a few assists if it's Rodeo benching him if it's had you're like all right just please don't detonate everything  this one again I think it's gonna take a tiny bit of time but I do think it's gonna pay off next name on the list is his teammate Austin Reeves and this one's a smaller one this is a fringy like around the edges by low because it hasn't Austin slowed down has not really been  tangible in the fantasy universe  he's basically been rolling he got off to kind of a slow start he was like 121 30 140 range and then he's been kind of rolling in about 85 basically ever since then and even though the last couple of weeks he's still in that 85 to 100 range but what folks haven't noticed is that he's become extremely cold from three-point land  his role has increased  but he hasn't seen an uptick in numbers because he hasn't shot the ball particularly well jump shot the ball particularly well I should probably add that little qualifier  at some point here in the next game or two and you know  it might be starting right now because I think he missed his first five three-pointers against Toronto in their last ball game as of when we're recording this episode and he hit his last one which is like a 30 footer he was a step in a happy on the three-point line if that way wakes him up Reaves might come into their next ball game and hit three or four threes and all of a sudden you're looking at Big Line's for a couple of weeks like you might get a top 50 top 60 run out of Austin so while I think this is a small one  meaning Whoever has him is probably not thinking why would I sell on Reeves right now everything seems totally normal and fine they'd be right but what you'd be aware of that we're talking about in this sort of shorter segment on Austin is that  he can be better based on the role he's being given right now  so he's ranked around 100  I think you can get him for someone with a little name power in that same range which is kind of like what we just talked about with Dilo but maybe you go a little bit higher for Austin so guys around 100 like if Derek Lively was healthy you try him okay who's about to have an interesting game because I think Clint capela is questionable if he has to sit one that would be a good time Trey Murphy who I just talked about  you're not gonna be able to sell Chris Paul for anything right now um  whether names in that area  tari Eason would be intriguing as someone to maybe give up Jalen Suggs is notable he's been playing well Marcus Smart off a couple of big three-point bombs away kind of ball games Schroeder we just mentioned Malik Monk  that was close  I take that one back keldon Johnson absolutely  I don't think you're gonna get Reese for Kelvin right now Mr window on that but he healed if he starts a couple of games for whatever reason  boy on bug zdanowicz he's gonna put up some big numbers while Kate is out that would be an interesting one to throw out there so see if you can get Austin Reeves because again his numbers aren't bad by any stretches not in a slump just watching his role right now and his inability to hit a jump shot it could actually be better so this is like a by medium but with a little bit of upside built-in  and then finally we're circling around on a name that I had on the show a long time ago someone that when he was out I suggested baby you buy low on him because I figured he was gonna get traded is Zach LaVine because he's back with Chicago and he looks all out of sorts he's number two twenty seven since his return it's you know small sample size theater but people are probably panicking he's coming off the bench right now he hasn't taken many shots is usages weird he doesn't look like he fits in all that well the Bulls have been playing well with him  there's a lot of ways that this could get better and very few ways that it could get worse so what you've seen and this is a phenomenon that happens all the time but it's exacerbated in Chicago by the fact that Levine is all so on the trade block is that a guy gets hurt or is shut down or whatever the situation may be you can buy low on that player if you're willing to stash them  when they're getting close to coming back you can no longer buy low because the person that held that whole time is not going to want to give up the player that they just blew an injured slot on for four or five weeks or whatever  but when that player comes back they usually have a little adrenaline boost  they play well for like two or three games and then  you see the sluggish kick in oh yeah right the NBA's a long season I gotta get my legs back  and you get a little bit of that from Levine right out of the Chute here because he didn't get to play all that much he was rehabbing his foot so that kind of stops you from really getting into much in the way of basketball activities  which means that people are gonna look at him and go ah this guy sucks now  I think you could get Zach LaVine for someone in that same range we just talked about is Austin reefs  the same list  Eason Trey Murphy  Austin Reeves himself even though  which way I go on that one pretty close  Yakima portal who's out right now wrap probably doesn't get it done I'll Kong will Marcus Smart Dennis Schroder Malik monk I think I actually would go that direction now keldon Johnson buddy hield I'm akez  some of those names I said probably won't do any done Suggs  Aaron Nesmith probably not enough name power to make that one happen Jabari Smith Jr  who's kind of a cell hi guy right now all the whole team has hurt  I don't know that Zach LaVine is gonna be  ever again  the guy he was whatever was two seasons back where he was shooting the lights out and he had every bit of usage in the universe and he was like number 30 days are probably gone  but he easily has the fantasy game to get inside the top 70  and I would say it's not that crazy to think he could get inside the top 60 and now let's say he gets traded some place  what about the Lakers are we afraid with LeBron and Anthony Davis that he just wouldn't have a job there now he'd have a job  and he'd probably be more confident and he's probably score better  not more  better more efficiently  so I'm not worried about Levine there's like there's almost no Universe where he completely falls off the map not with the athletic and basketball ability he has if you can get him for someone between  call it roughly 80 and 115 to me that's a no-brainer because he looks slow he looks Rusty and people are probably getting frustrated explore this one I think this one has maybe the biggest margin for win of the names we've talked about so far but maybe also the hardest to pull off because he does have probably the biggest name of anyone we've talked about so far  and finally the risky play me the injury stash I've tried to throw one of these out every week this week it's Darius Garland who's been out since December 14th so he's a couple days away from a full month on the Shelf  and I mean it's a jaw injury and I just I don't know I don't see two months happening so I feel like we're looking at two to three weeks it's a guess a little bit I'm trying to read the tea leaves attached  but again if you're thinking about a guy who has sort of that 50 called 40 to 60 range potential  are you willing to stash him for two to three weeks  yeah absolutely are you willing to do it if it costs you a top 80 range guy I think the answer there is yes as well so now you're looking at guys like Mike Conley  uh DeAndre ayton who's been probably not exactly a cell moment right now for him  Drew holiday  Jabari Smith Jr we just talked about if you could I mean you kind of need exactly mean to get hot for a minute but that would be an interesting name to throw out there  um but  I don't think I would give up Jalen Duren that kind of feels like a little bit too much  Tobias Harris is intriguing as someone again maybe going a little bit too high on that a better way to look at it might be to see you who's in that same range oh for the past month to two months and said of perhaps the entire season  so if you look at that like 80 range over the last month Chris Middleton is in their Yusef's in their Conley's in their miles Bridges is in their low field goal percent hiding holding him back a little bit Austin Reeves is interesting could you turn Reeves into Darius Garland I don't even think about that one he's a boy but he's also a possible sell in this instance  Aaron Gordon Kobe white I think because when his percentages all settled in together he's more of that you know 80 range kind of guy  so they're you know Darius Garland has a world of upside over the most of the players that I just listed off and a lot of them because they're simply healthy and posting numbers that people are like oh that's kind of interesting could get that job done so think about it if you think you can handle two to three weeks  call it 15 to 20 days is Maya assessment there it's again it's a little bit of a guess but just trying to read on how the whole thing shook out I think this one has some legs  and I think you should explore it you could start lower too if you really wanted to before working your way up the board you want to start with somebody who's more like you know top 90 five over the last month but has named power again someone like a Dennis Schroder who everybody's overvalued this year because of assists  Maybe  Karen still hurt who's filling in for him you'd have to pair that up with somebody  that would not get it done alone  we just talked about Malik monk maybe that's a pair with someone like Levert Emmanuel quickly post trade here perhaps people are getting very very excited I like quickly a lot I don't think he's gonna be better than 75 and 9 cat but I like him a lot there's a lot of Buzz there you might be able to aim higher with quickly post-trade  if I was doing a sell High show as much as I like quickly he would almost definitely make myself hi list  want to throw promo here at the end of the show  my good buddy Joe orrico host of our baseball fantasy stuff  at uh 5:00
