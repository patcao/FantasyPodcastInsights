covering things from that sort of week to week standpoint not so much the individual schedule's let's get going ads only to this week's so I got to use exception large font  DeAndre Hunter and Chris Paul  and I don't know that like how much explanation do we need on these it's weird that the ads board is going to be probably our shortest explanations also  but you've seen it is effectively the explanation for this I know that Atlanta got blown out yesterday so Hunter only had 12 points in 26 minutes but with Trey young out and if you want to call them an injury fill in I'm fine with that also  it's not clear that that's what it is he was kind of coming on anyway but Hunters getting the minutes he's getting the shots again yesterday's game was a rough rough blowout or he would have had a few extra minutes there's just a lot to like now  the one thing to keep in mind with the player like Hunters is that  things can also dry up pretty fast a lot of his values tied up in his percentages which tend to be positive kind of positive for both  but look he's number one oh six on the season in 28 minutes of ball game 10 and a half shots a game that ten and a half shots is number that's likely to be higher with Trey young out I know he was only ate yesterday but again blow out stuff mostly of late it has been higher  prior to that it was a 10 there was an eight 16 12 14 the shot number is higher than the minutes are around 28 and they could go up he really sort of shows that he's healthy enough to get another small minutes bump and then Chris Paul this is one that just needs to be on the list because he's back and again like a lot of this is because this is a week to week show we haven't had a  we haven't had a Friday we can review show since before the All-Star break because of coming back and then only having this sort of one day of games last week before Friday and then the Chris Paul news broke on what Tuesday I think Monday or Tuesday so  that's why he's in there this is the most obvious one on planet Earth this is Chris Paul we're talking about again even if he's not getting the massive usage that he's had in the past he still Chris Paul he's still number 85 and 9 cat League's I sat on him anywhere I could  he's going to be elite in assists he's going to be solid and Steals and then we just have to continue to hope that the field goal percent comes up from 42 and a half but even if it doesn't he still a 12 team 9 cat guy and you just sort of play him so this is the easy board what about the harder ones let's go to strong the holds next and I broke down the hole into strong and weak holds this week  because I felt like it was easier than me trying to explain what like how how much I wanted to hold each individual player so here are your strongholds and these are the ones where I don't think we need to explain it as much because I feel like there's gonna be decent consensus on it Klay Thompson stronghold he's played well since coming off the bench he's never gonna get back to you know old fashioned clay but he's been a start Aaron Nesmith is a strong hold he was great before he got hurt and it sounds like he could be back as soon as tonight  Trey Jones kind of up and down I'll give you that the Trey Jones experience in San Antonio started very poorly he went on a pretty good run he's kind of kicked it back into gear over the last week or so so that's elevated his numbers you should like 70% over the last five games that's one of the big reasons why you've seen things kicked into high gear for him but that's the thing sometimes he'll have a week and a half where she shoots all well sometimes it'll cool it had in general the assists the steals the sort of combination of percentages and not a whole lot else is usually going to be enough to get him into that department but again I don't think people were dropping  Grayson Allen had one off game absolutely no reason to drop their keonte George is both a hold and a cell when you can guy because he's shooting a high volume 37% over the last couple of weeks and that's tanking teams but he scoring he's getting assists he's getting threes uh so what you kind of have to hope for here is that at some point he does have a spell where he shoots 47% for a week or two weeks or 50% for a week or whatever it is and then you're like okay I got my window because when he does that on 13 14 15 shots a game or whatever he's getting these days you're looking at a guy that could put up like a 20 and 7 kind of night with three three pointers and people are going to want that because they're going to start to think oh this is just what's gonna happen now  but no we're clever we are clever we know what's what  Denny obviously stronghold Trey man is a strong hold kind of in the same vein as keyonte George what was slightly less impactful  field goal percent because he's not shooting as much as George's so man is a probably a little bit of an easier asset to hold on to and or move  Marvin Bagley is a stronghold he was a soft hole about two games back and then he started a rev it back up again herb Jones very strong hold these in their I don't even know why he's on this list  I saw Thompson is a strong hold the fact that he still got minutes even after Isaiah Stewart came back was a good sign for him moving down the stretch and then maybe the hardest one in this whole category Isaiah hartenstein because the latest report on him is that he still dealing with the Achilles soreness which I mean like you look at any box score or watch him move and it's pretty obvious that their stuff going on the problem of course is  like you can't play them against the game's cap because he might just play 20 minutes we might play nine minutes on one night if the Achilles is kind of acting up a little bit I'm on it like this feels a little bit like malpractice doesn't it  you play a guy on a sore achilles  what like what's to stop that thing from just popping loose in a week  if I'm art and shine and I'm going into I think he's I think he's unrestricted free agent at the end of this year I like I'm telling somebody look I want to win as much as the next guy I get it Mitchell Robinson's out and Julius Randall's out and if I'm not playing even a little bit then we got no size at all but like I got a whole career to think about  if he blows out as Achilles and has to miss all of next season that's gonna cost him like probably 10 of millions of dollars  and that's probably one of the reasons that he's not extending himself too far in these games as if he did he's at risk of maybe blowing that thing out but you got to hold on because we've seen what he can do and I know the next are hoping to get Mitchell Robinson back but there's no indication that that's super close to happening and we just have to kind of hope that for harvesting this thing Mellows  over the next week or two weeks or whatever it is and it may be it does maybe it doesn't but like you can't put that guy on the waiver wire he's too good  the soft hold board is much shorter Daniel Gafford Derek Lively in Dallas because they both had decent ball games with no Maxi chleba but when was in all three of those guys were terrible  and that's super annoying but it's also super exactly what we just saw happening  so again like  I would love to try to hold onto these guys I'm gonna try desperately I have Daniel Gafford in a couple of spots you know that he was on the old man squad and he was destroying everyone for the first four months of this year  but if it's really gonna be a three-headed monster then at some point we'd have to move on and I'll try to give it a little bit longer same thing for Derek Lively I'll try to give it a little bit longer but it can't be indefinite  if it's really gonna mix and match time in Dallas which feels a little bit silly like you should probably have your guy but they don't and then Trey Murphy the third which I believe is now considered redundant because Trey is the third that's junior junior  that's how it goes senior Junior and then a lot of folks go by Trey when you're the third of something believe his first name is actually Ken  again that right I know that was the case for  yeah pretty sure that's right by the way common misconception the Griffeys are not named Ken  their name to George  you guys know that about the Griffeys  George  Kenneth Griffey  Senior Junior and then there is indeed a tray and that family as well  thank you explain football at Arizona like six years ago I don't he's doing now anyway so train Murphy  Ken Murphy the third whatever you want to call him he still had a good ball game last time out but the pals ran extraordinarily small you notice Valentine's just basically didn't play in that ball game like eight minutes and then Larry Nance I like 20 and so there were these extra sentiments they went to Zion and so that allowed Trey to slide in and get his wing minutes into the 30s which I mean prior to that ball game anytime the team was fully healthy which they basically all right now minus you know a couple of guys that were not severely impacting the trade Murphy playing time the tray was playing around 2526 minutes a game which was Fringe fantasy value he was he was frankly going to be a member of the doesn't matter Club but his minutes jumped when CJ McCollum went down  and his minutes will jump anytime that Zion takes a game off  and then they jumped just due to matchups in this last one so he's on this role right now for a variety of reasons but if none of those reasons happens in the next ball game he was go he immediately drops back to kind of that doesn't matter group which if I had to guess you probably see it in their next ball game which is that tonight they played tonight  they are their hosting the Pacers  5:00 Pacific start time  so there's your soft holds here's the guys that I'm scared or nervous about or I'm dropping  and I'm putting Ben Simmons on this list every week until the end of time  until the sun swallows us all  Ben Simmons is not fantasy roster bull he is a broken down mule  who's trying to prove that he still has something in the tank when he doesn't his body just cannot take the punishment anymore and maybe someday and a magical Universe maybe that universe is next year I don't know maybe there's a time where he gets back up to high 20s whatever it was because he played that in what couple of ball games to start this year a couple ball games to start last year  but then how long before it all comes apart  I had the over under five games I don't even know if we can call it like did we even get five games out of him since coming back and he's played in them but has he really played in them  drop him stop hanging on to this nonsense boy on bug Donovan you New York he's a drop Simone fontecchio in Detroit he's a drop I don't think you guys need me to go into excruciating detail on those guys do you  yeah  Brandon pajami is teetering bad ballgame yesterday Andrew Wiggins is out in definitely due to personal reasons so I'm inclined to try to give pajam ski a little bit longer  because it was like okay well Chris Paul comes back then he takes pods minutes but then we didn't have Wiggins going out in that handicap so those minutes come back in but most is Moody's taking a bunch of those because they don't want to go too small  and ultimately it probably just means there's kind of not enough guard work left for a gem ski it's all just hustle play at this point which is great but there needs to be something on top of that it can't just be a few rebounds and a steal there has to be a point or uh pass or something  and then I'm in Thompson is the other one on this nervous board I'm gonna give him one more chance it does seem like now with Jalen green playing a little bit better last couple of ball games that that's meant that Thompson doesn't have nearly enough room to I mean he's gonna need to get into the 20s to have fantasy value and if green is playing in the mid-30s and they're just sort of isn't enough there  watch list  but before we get to the watch list I don't remind you guys one time here mid-episode to come hang with your pal Dan over on social media at Dan best person and please if you're enjoying this and if there's somebody watching

it's cleaned up cheeks or cleaned up the out of bounds hairs they're all they've been taking care of I really want to push I know they want me to push the lawn mower 5.0 Ultra but I really like the handyman this is been the coolest thing so look like the first lawn mower amazing the lawn mower three has been my favorite I'll say that that's one that I still keep around I use a bunch  but you know difference between lawn mowers I'll be honest with you guys small there are differences but I don't I didn't feel like I needed the lawn mower for when I had the three it was working fine it's a great absolutely great tool this I didn't have  this is just a straight electric razor I had bought one of those in a really long time because I mostly just shave with a side burner because I'm extremely lazy and my personal hygiene is lacking and then they sent this bad boy out which is just so cool it's just this little capsule  looks like a pill almost and Pop there's the top comes right off it's magnetized so it's not gonna fall off unless you give it a pretty good  pull you can see this giving a little bit and then there you go a little bit more to get that top off and it's just like it's an actual electric razor  which is so great that they make these bad boys now and I wouldn't recommend using this on your whole face or whole body all the time but like for for cleaning up

free shipping on your order at manscape.com all right let's get back to the watch list there's a lot of names on here and these actually probably do require a little bit of attention or at least a few of them do to kind of let you guys know how we arrived at this destination  Jordan Goodwin is on the watch list he's on a two-way deal so he can't play every single ball game and that's frustrating  and honestly that makes him probably a guy you just simply can't add on the head-to-head side unless we somehow find out that he's actually gonna just play in like a dozen straight ball games  and not take you know not take zeros in between  when he was on his 10 day he was playing  but then you know every other game he would skip it and it was never a guarantee  and you know two hours before game time we get the word that he's going to start or something like that that obviously makes it a simpler call but you might have to use a move to get him and then use a move to get off of him in head to head if he's gonna just skip the next ball game Roto I can make a pretty good case I think that Jordan Goodwin could just be thrown onto your bench and then when he starts you just drop him into the line I'm sort of the owl Horford play this year I've kept him on my bench and two rodol leaks basically the entire season for every back-to-back Boston's had or every game that kristaps Miss for injury or Jalen Brown took a day off or Tate him took a day off or white or Drew or whatever and so then Horford ended up with you know whatever that I don't remember the number now like 20 starts so far this year and puts up top 60 type of numbers in those that's really that's pretty useful and there will probably be a handful more  and he was basically a waiver wire pickup  but a very hard one to use on the heads I just took off half of the back-to-backs himself  anyway we're not talking about we're talking about Goodwin I just think we might be able to use in the same way which is Roto stash had to head probably avoid Santi aldama is on my watch list it sounds like jjj's Gonna Miss memphis's next ball game is this the beginning of the end no probably not Memphis just has kind of a loaded schedule over this little stretch there are back-to-back today tomorrow with Portland and then they basically go every other day until March 12th and 13th you'll see JJJ skip one of those and then he'll probably play until the last two weeks or so and then maybe you'll get a bigger clump of aldama at that point so right now spot playing is the way to go can't really be considered a full add great William's bouncing back and forth between making bunch of three pointers and not his I don't think his Fantasy game supports every day roster ship wait because of how lean his Fantasy game is without three-pointers so as per my watch list guy Kelly Olynyk  I wish  every time I say I wish I want to quote The Simpsons I wish I wish I hadn't killed that fish  Kelly Olynyk is not sadly going to be a thing until you have a Pearl Mississippi time which may be never or possibly the very end of the season sad face over here but that's the truth of it taeler Hendrix and Utah his minutes have definitely increased into the mid to high 20s but we haven't really seen enough fantasy stuff yet to put him on a roster bol bol same thing but probably needs nurk to not play to be a functional player daily  Corey kispert has been real damn close and we've talked about him a bunch on this podcast and I've been yelled at frankly for talking about kisper too much on the show but he looks confident these days number 87 over the last two weeks which by all accounts means he's a guy you could add although he did get a couple of spots in there but he came off the bench yesterday and had 20 points and each game last two games in a row he shot exactly eight out of 15 for 20 points one of them he made a couple of free throws the other he had an extra couple of three-pointers but he's in threes he's making free throws he's been  pretty good lately  and so I think you could probably roster kiss bird in most formats right now  because he gets you three on a good field goal percent and that's not easy to find  he's better than people give him credit for he's on an awful team  you know there's no denying that Mark nonsense but you could probably call him and add if you wanted to he's like right at the top edge of watch list  Carousel at a big ball game in there whatever that was seven over time but you know he's done almost matter it doesn't matter almost what he does I'm almost definitely not putting him on my roster I just I can't it's this Santi aldama thing too where like maybe at least with Levert we kind of know what his percentages are so we can make the call easier with odama we don't know as well but I just it's so hard for me to go full bore into guys that are bad in both percentages  because I play Nyan Cat  the Clippers man that's Terrence Mann not Trey is on the watch list mostly because we've seen this thing he wakes up for two weeks he disappears for two months it happens twice every year  and has for like three seasons in a row now do up wreath is on the watch list not because of anything that I think is about to like shift in his Fantasy game but mostly because we're waiting to find out if DeAndre Aiden's Gonna Miss more than a game or two with this wrist injury  and frankly even if he does we're waiting to find out if we can put Reef in the injury fill in board  because the last time that 8 was out wreath was only good like one out of every three ball games  so it's not a guaranteed that he's even a safe injury replacement so right now he's a watch list see what happens if he looks like a safe injury play then we'll move him into that part of the board which is coming up here in a moment  but first to money tomorrow he put up a decent line for the Blazers in their last one I don't have a whole lot of faith that that's gonna stick but you can at least watch list him  the stream while warm bored it got PJ Washington added to it he's now a member of the stream while warm contingent along with Bobby Portis Jordan Clarkson RJ Barrett Kevin herder and Malik monk who kind of alternate Jeremy Sohan and Jalen green those are the stream while warmers if you're wondering if some name is missing the answer is yes that name is Nas read because he's been temporarily placed in the injury fill-in board with Kyle Anderson out and then nozzle likely return to this stream wild warm contingent when the wolves get healthy once again the brand new doesn't matter Club I know you guys are all very excited about this one which is the most possible excitement you could ever have about a page that doesn't matter the players currently on the doesn't matter Club Max druce Gary Trent Jr saddiq Bey these are guys that no matter what happens over the course of every two ball games over every 10 they're going to be right in that doesn't matter window which in my eyes is between picks roughly 105 110 and about 140 you can play them you cannot play them they'll help your head to head team if they're healthy enough to go they won't really help your Roto Team all that much but keep you from falling behind against the game's cap they'll get you whatever it is for Spruce a couple threes some boards if you assist on not great field goal percent Gary Trent will get you some threes maybe a couple of steals who the hell that I just say was on here was the last one saddiq Bey he'll get you some threes on bad field goal percent but he'll also get some rebounds  like it shouldn't surprise anybody that when you look at the numbers here he said he'd pay is ranked 129 on the year strews is 18 Trent is on the season much lower than that but lately he's more like in that one 30 range this is just who these guys are it's who they are in their current role  admittedly for stress this is a lot better than any of us expected playable and he was a lot better than this for a long part of the Season then he went through an ungodly shooting slump but he's kind of leveled off and we'll probably continue to add players to this doesn't matter board as the season winds down here but it is something I'd like to carry over into next year because I think there's gonna be a bunch of guys like this we if we're kind of starting to isolate them earlier in the year I think this board would have filled out quicker but ultimately that doesn't matter and here is your uh Hefty injury replacement board we'll give you the names we'll give you the replacing and then we will wrap things up  iodine will continue to replace guys that are out  and with these guys just out for the year I suppose I could just call him arrested season guy and you don't need to be here anymore cuz Levine ain't coming back Patrick Williams ain't coming back so sure I would assume oh  call him arrested season guy I think still we need to classify him as an injury replacement because he's never done it with those other guys healthy and in my mind is a better way to keep things organized Andre Drummond all of the above plus Alex Caruso if Caruso plays Drummond that's the one that it's attached to right now Royce O'Neill with Bradley Beal and Eric Gordon out Josh Hart with ogn Adobe out precious of Chua with Julius Randle out Paul Reed and Kelly oubre Jr with Joel embiid and an Audi Anthony Melton again both out Al Horford nobody's out for Boston  as far as I know in this ball game but I'm just keeping him on the Perma injury replacement board Nick Richards  by the way he's injury replacement but he's also kind of in the doesn't matter group  Malik Beasley for Chris Middleton Duncan Robinson for Tyler hero Reggie Jackson's a baby for Jamal Murray I put him on the list but he's very much a maybe Dennis Schroder and cam Johnson for Ben Simmons and cam Thomas  I would assume that if Cam Thomas comes back it probably ruins both of those guys because of how much usage he uses Ben Simmons hard to tell if he ruins either of them I think he would probably not Schrute her out quicker because Simmons is sort of more your point guard he type where Cam Thomas is firing away nazri is on this board with slo-mo out and Benedict mathura is on this board with Aaron neesmith out all the it sounds like that one might be evaporating here as soon as later today and that is your week in review we're a hustle and man one question the chat room that I want to get to is what about beef stew Isaiah Stewart has garbage Fantasy game yes it's true it's true no one seems to notice because he gets a few rebounds and hits a three-pointer from that power forward spot but he played 31 minutes a game before his injury and he was number 192 in nine cat bad field goal percent bad free throw percent uh not very few assists not a ton of defensive stats just very I mean 11 points per game not enough to float value their 11 and 7 with one and a half threes is fine if that's the only stuff you're attacking but he is a long way off from fantasy value  the only way that he climbs would be if the number of shots per game goes up which is possible because again they got rid of boy and but zdanowicz and they got rid of Alec Burks  but you know we're talking about a guy that averaged eight and a half shots per game how much do we really think that could move nine and a half 10 that's still doesn't get him close enough he's gonna need to get up to a dozen I would think and I really don't see that happening  Chris 31 minutes go to 33 I mean all these little things could add up to get him into that doesn't matter group but that to me is kind of a best case scenario unless his Fantasy game dramatically changed during this last injury which spoiler it didn't it just doesn't  and that'll wrap it up for the week in review edition of fantasy NBA today again I have a grand designs of getting a streamer episode going that'll probably be first thing in the afternoon just a little quick hitter to kind of get you settled for Friday Saturday Sunday and then rolling into Monday which is likely the start of a playoff week for a lot of you anybody that sets up your own leaks I know I was doing it I'm pretty sure that Josh was talking about it a lot of analysts these days are making a concerted effort to tell people start your playoffs six weeks before the end of the regular season so you Lop off the final three weeks so if you're getting going we'll have these shows to sort of help you out and frankly even if you're fighting for a playoff spot you'll probably enjoy these streamer discussions because it's about how to maximize games played and how to be pretty Cutthroat with the guys on your own team so battling for a playoff spot already in one playoff starting all that stuff is going to be a head-to-head only special show hopefully  daily or at least Monday through Friday but between now and my aim is like the last week of the season but at that point you started don't need anymore because everybody's in overload mode and most had leaks should I know Yahoo's not which is horrible I don't think I can be in a Yahoo Head to Head League again next year those are not uh thank you for watching everybody thank you for liking we're eating subscribing following retweeting  quote tweeting  joining Discord whatever it might be all of that stuff remains very appreciated shout out again to our baseball guys who have that draft guide going hit me up if you want to upgrade your fantasy pass NBA to an all sport or just jump aboard man go get the ranks they're gonna be awesome baseball guys are crushing it right now and I see a few of you already have so that makes me very happy something like maybe four or five of you have reached out to me to upgrade your your NBA to All Sport keep them coming keep them coming the beauty part is if you think it through like if you upgrade now that'll take you into the NBA draft guide at the end of this like baseball season will take you into the start of NBA  and if you get that all sport now if you upgrade for the one dollar we're not going to change that price you can lock that in forever as long as you don't turn it off by the way the NBA fantasy pass is probably gonna go up by a dollar for next year  so if you get the All Sport now  you'll have all three major sports probably for the same price as NBA alone next year up so no brainer  I'll talk to you guys later today or on social or both  heaven forbid clutches pearls bye-bye everybody
