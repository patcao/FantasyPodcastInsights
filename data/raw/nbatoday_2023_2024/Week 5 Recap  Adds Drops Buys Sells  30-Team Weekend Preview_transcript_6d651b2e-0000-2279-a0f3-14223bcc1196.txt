welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I hope everybody had a lovely Thanksgiving welcome back welcome back just for one here one big one on this Friday November the 24th  we likely will not have a show over the weekend if I'm guessing I know I always have this hair brain plan to get something out there but I don't know that it's gonna happen just a lot of family stuff this weekend and I'm guessing for a lot of you that's kind of a similar feel we've  realizing that my board is is kind of too far back today so try to bring It Forward a little though is that doing any good it's not doing any good at all I will maybe I can pivot things a tad I don't great start to the show Welcome to it everybody it's fantasy NBA today I am Dan best briefs thank you all for tuning in and spending your Friday morning with us here on the sports ethos fantasy NBA Today feed it's a big week in review Friday show you guys know the drill on this one we're gonna go through all the ads drops by sells holds watch lists injury names that have emerged basically over the last week of basketball I've ported them all into a very handy dandy little Microsoft Word window I know it's extraordinarily low Tech but you know what I don't care that's the way it's going to be and before we start going through all those names very quickly here at the front end of the show I want to remind all of you guys to come hang out with us in our Sports ethos Discord it's really become a pretty fun place to be these days with people helping people  that's kind of what I've always hoping that it would come to is folks you know by post a question in a room you might not get the analysts on it but you're going to get a whole bunch of other very smart Sports eat those followers and just crowdsourcing good opinions things like that if you want to get into the analyst side if you want to talk to the the pros upgrade to a fantasy pass and pop it over there find me on social act and best press over the weekend at some point please do I'll still gonna be doing my stuff on social media this weekend and that's probably the promo I wanted to get in at the beginning of the show so let's get to some names here we go fantasy basketball week in review  we're off and running and  as noted on the board we were talking about really this is more of a seasoned long type of approach to things but let's go through some of the names and see which ones require any additional explanation  we'll begin with the ads and most of these are fairly straightforward most of these the reasoning you guys will know immediately but let's just bring him up real quick then list starts with Buddy Heald who just in case you guys missed the news earlier this week slid back into the starting lineup for the Pacers for the first time this season and really for the first time since I think it was like mid-march of last year remember they went young they were trying him out and other parts of the order uh well as a starter he's gonna smash everybody so that's the beauty part of Buddy hield since his since inserting into the starting lineup he's been like a second round kind of guy and no he's not gonna shoot 70% from the field long term but you get him in there taking a bunch of Threes alongside Halliburton he'll usually fall into a steel along the way good foul shooter although he hasn't gotten to the line I don't think over the last week or two  regardless he was someone that was getting dropped and for good reason because he was doing next to nothing coming off the bench but he starting now and so at least like triple check your league to make sure somebody didn't punch on him because I mean thinking back to what we had said we're like looking if you're sitting on buddy hield it's because you're hoping that he gets traded or something shifts and then that thing happened  he was dropped in one of my one of the Yahoo exams I met I put a very large bid in on him and so now I have a buddy hield and I you know I he wasn't really a guy that I was planning on targeting this year but with this shift you kind of have no choice Alex Caruso is the next name on the board he's been an ad for most of the season but I wanted to get him on the ads list today just so we can talk about the fact that he's now been inserted into the starting lineup over the season he's averaging 24 and a half minutes per game he's inside the top 70s but that  it's not going to dramatically change his per game production because the minutes are always going to be held  a little bit in check simply by the fact that his body can't handle playing  an extraordinarily High number of minutes but they said look you got to be a part of what we're doing here bringing you off the bench dropping you in Paris shooting after all we're already down 15 points is not working  please help Alex you're our only hope and he's continuing to put up that you know 60 to 70 range stuff so he has been an ad for a while but I wanted to get him back on the board here and so I did  next name on the ads board is keyonte George who was on the ads board I think last week all so and continues to have the ups and downs associated with a rookie stepping in and running point for an NBA team when you look at the fact that over the last week he's posting numbers that are outside the top 150  but we also have to look at a few key things number one he's shooting 30% on 11 shots per ballgame he's basically been a tank free field goal guy over that stretch where 11 shots a game is actually more than enough to get George into legitimate fantasy value because over that same stretch he's averaging about two three pointers a night and six and a half assists which is this really nice starting point now that is minutes are crawling up towards 30  if and look we don't know exactly how many shots per game he's going to hit but one can perhaps assume he'll get at least into the high 30s I don't know that he gets to 40 maybe he does maybe he doesn't  but that takes away a giant negative it adds 3-pointers it adds points I think the assist rebounds and steals are relatively sustainable and what they've been the last four or five ball games Roto side you're probably not using him until the field goal percent starts to take up a little bit head-to-head you drop him in there every day and you just sort of prey you get a week where he is not destroying your field goal number but he definitely belongs on rosters and I don't think I need to explain too much more on that one Malcolm Brogdon is an easy one I think we all thought he was going to be out longer he's actually the part of the cover art on today's podcast  ah when Brockton gets hurt he tends to miss a whole bunch of time but he's back and you know that they're easing him back in his minutes haven't been huge it is two games since returning buddy did play in a back-to-back  and he posted what you know 20 points six assists being those games on average  this is another one where he's probably not on your way over but you have no idea of somebody was just like crap I can't sit on anybody else write down I have to make a move I gotta unload someone who's hurt and if that guy was Malcolm Brogden if folks were like oh when scoot comes back doesn't matter what's happening what's gonna happen to Malcolm then maybe he got dumped to the wire and one of your League's and so you should at least do sort of a quick pass on the waiver wire and see if he's available in any of the League's you are in Derek Lively the second is a repeat offender on this adds board I wanted to get him back on the ads list because I know he heard himself in that game against the Lakers but he's young he's sprightly I would assume that he'll be back in the not too distant future it's a back contusion I could take I mean that's what Bradley Beal was listed as and then we see what's happening to him but feels an older dude Lively's young we've seen him trending up basically every two weeks and you kind of got to get him in your in your lineups when he gets healthy so hold on to Derek Lively I could have probably put him in the holds board but I wanted to make sure he didn't get lost in that shuffle so I put him on the ads board and you all just gonna have to deal with it  those are the five ads this week which you know we had it wasn't anything on Thursday  I think the adds and drops are probably going to be slightly less as we hit this sort of mid not midpoint but like rolling into the dog days of the NBA season and you're going to see more and more players that arrived on the injury streaming board instead because that's where a lot of the value is right now but let's go to holds next I managed to get a whole bunch of stuff fit onto one page so YouTubers I think are feelings bro right now they can see what's coming up holds the Wizards the whole damn team because they did finally in their last ball game get to play actual starters minutes kuzma 35 pool 33 Gafford 34 tius 35 only Denny audio was under 30 minutes that game and not surprisingly basically all of them put up some sort of fantasy numbers  losing to Charlotte and the terrible Charlotte defense certainly helped the situation  well we got this sort of Point Coos thing happening tyus Jones had seven assists and a couple of steals  Gafford and 16 rebounds even Jordan Poole had a serviceable game even if he couldn't throw a damn shot in the bucket other 21 field goal attempts to get to 24 points but that's the kind of stuff that we're hoping persists  might not Washington's play and who the Bucks I think tonight so another blow up maybe on tap but we finally got to see it we finally got to see their starters actually go starters minutes and it all made sense as to why guys were drafted where they were  let's open up again but this is I think a pretty good example and an easy one to just point to and say this is why you can't dump these guys because look what happens when they actually get to play legitimate starters man it's Gordon Hayward is on my holds board he is a bad ball game again on Wednesday Four Points nine boards six assists three turnovers no steals no blocks no threes two out of eight shooting  I don't like the eight shots I do like the six assists I like the nine rebounds  miles Bridges took 18 shots in that game against Washington and was very involved in everything going on and then Brandon Miller took 12 shots and so there is a fear I have some fear that Gordon Hayward is gonna Peter out here is that his miles Bridges gets right and then Terry Rozier will come back that'll be sort of even bigger pinch on whatever he's doing  but I'll say it I said it once I'll say it again I do think more of what we're seeing with Hayward is stemming from the fact that little ball has gotten warm now  he started the year very slowly now you've seen lamelo on kind of a vicious tear to get his field goal percent up to 44  and at some point he'll probably go through another shooting slump I don't know when could be soon could be months out  that's when you saw earlier this season that's when you saw Gordon Hayward take over and do more of that in game orchestrating and be kind of more of a feature guys so you know the end result of all of that is let's give Gordon Hayward another week or so I put one or two games on the sheet here but it could be just call it a week to see if he can settle in to see if he can find the role that he had a week and a half ago or some facsimile of that role  next hole is onyeka okongwu I was really hoping that I was never gonna have to talk about him again on the show not because I'm upset about O'Connell but because I thought it was clear enough that this is what he is when Clint capela is healthy he's number 85 and 9 cat right now 0.6 deals a block nine and seven with good percentages you can't expect much more when he's going 20 20 22 minutes off the bench  capella gets hurt Google goes rocket boosting up inside the top 40 on a per game basis and you just hope that we can squeeze a few games out when he's the starting center but even if you can't he's startable right now anyway  so I I I'm starting to get those questions again and I was just I was wishing that they wouldn't emerge but here they are  there is not a single player in the I'm scared nervous or Drop Zones this week Hayward would have probably been the closest to that and then everybody that's on the watch list at like maybe those are guys that got picked up and certainly where you could call them I'm scared guys but not for me it and so we get to just zip right past this one there wasn't an obvious drop this last week how about that for fun  the watch list is five names deep and the first one everybody's gonna yell at me about but it's Bilal coulibaly who look like I'll repeat myself a little bit here so sorry if you've listened to every show the last couple of weeks you're gonna hear something I've already said cool please minutes have been trending up over the last two weeks he's averaging 27 minutes per ball game I think about the last one week he's at 25 although that last ball game was one where his minutes were lower  and the thing is  he's showing flashes he's showing flashes of what the fantasy value could be  the problem is we haven't seen it stick  so he had a few games in there where this this deals were super high and he was shooting 56% from the field which is a number that we know isn't going to stick because he's taking some three-pointers and Washington is not exactly great at getting dudes wide open shots  but  if things break his way you could see the rebounds the steals the blocks as being kind of a nice supplement to whatever he's doing in the actual scoring categories which I don't expect to be a very large number the reason Bilal is on the watch list for me is that I don't think that with the Wizards healthy and not  I know that they're they're sort of  monitoring or  capping out minutes for the starters regularly on that club but it's not every day  and no one's out  if  Abdi was out or if tyus Jones was out or whatever then do you see cool Belize slide into the starting lineup and lock in 30 minutes per ball game possibly  but can he shoot 55%  probably not  can the defensive stats be around two per ball game maybe  maybe do we expect him to score more than 11 12 points per game probably not  because there's too many guys on that team that are in the pecking order in front of him in terms of the actual offensive production stuff  I added Below in a keeper League because I think at some point you're going to see the Wizards dump the veterans whether it's trading them or just shutting them down and that's when he can step in and you'll start to see  because I don't know they necessarily be like a running the show kind of dude but just getting enough opportunity 7 shots becomes nine or ten something to that effect these things that seem small in the moment but are actually really big deal because then you're not just praying for a good sample size like let's hope the percentages are good for the next week and that's how he's inside the top 100 at that point you can just get it by him doing stuff on the court  circuitous explanation I know but the point I'm arriving at here with Bilal is  that I don't think that he's a role to playable guy every single day I think that he's a little more stashy but he's been just good enough on the head-to-head side where you can call them over an active stash and you know for rotow you can just sit on him  the other Hunters on the watch list in case he Heats back up again he had a nice ball game for Atlanta and that crazy high scoring one against Brooklyn put up 25 at 11 with three defensive stats and made all of his free throws but he'd been going through this very pronounced up and down so far this year and at the end of all of it Hunters ranked 172 so this is not a guy that I'm expecting will be a long-term solution but he gets super hot then you probably want to roll with them for a week or something  Norman Powell is on my watch list I wanted to talk more about him and then he promptly got himself hurt in that Clippers win over San Antonio on Wednesday  I don't know what the timeline is on Powell it's a sore growing those things do tend to linger a little bit but prior to that he had become their feature bench score so basically if Paul George Kauai whoever wasn't out there on the floor Norm was going and taking it to the rack over and over again so it was a good free throw percentage helper typically and his career at a couple three she's just a gifted offensive player but then he got hurt 14 minutes into a ball game we don't really know what to do with that information and so I got to keep him on the watch list instead of the ads board because  we just don't know what his roles gonna be exactly  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start

today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  Rashad Holmes is on the watch list he played he picked up most of the Derek Lively minutes against the Lakers in the Mavs last ball game but that doesn't necessarily mean he's going to do it again because it had generally been Dwight Powell went healthy it was Maxi kleeba all so maybe Lively gets back quickly but  we've seen Rochelle Holmes put up fantasy numbers in the past  I've never seen somebody go from like playing in their Prime to being almost completely useless and like a week but that's what happened to Holmes and Sacramento  but maybe there's some kind of life in him here as the backup and Dallas the backup to the backup basically  so watch list let's see what he does in the Mavs next ball game and go from there  and Jonathan Isaac who hit 19 and a half minutes and I said if he hit 20 and I rounded up on that one that I was going to pick him up and then he promptly saw his dip back down again some of that may have been because the magic I believe had a double header mixed in overall Isaac is number one 70 and only 14 minutes per ball game which is again that's the magic of Jonathan Isaac if you're looking at just the last couple weeks he's top 100 in 15 minutes per game this is why I keep saying like if he can approach 20 minutes he's a goal but he sort of did and then sort of didn't and maybe there's a possibility we need somebody to get hurt in front of him  like do they even think that his body can handle more than 20 minutes per ball game it sure seems like the answer is no but we should keep an eye on him because he has one of the best fantasy profiles in the entire NBA if he ever got enough minutes to do anything with it you know mid-20s and minutes is is basically like a top 50 guy for him and full starters minute you guys might recall  one was that two years ago he was a second rounder installers minutes  before I go to the next board here I want to once again remind everybody that you

do a five star review that's all so very helpful I want to get on social I'm at Dan Vespers I'm sure I'll see you guys over there  the next board is the injury Replacements board and this is a big one right now but not all of these guys are a start these are the guys that have seen  please pay attention to this  these are the guys that have seen their opportunity Spike because of an injury in front of them what I'm going to do here as I talk through it is give you guys the names that I think are worth playing in the specific scenarios that we're going to lay out  and there's a lot of names here so buckle up a little bit but we're not gonna go deep explanation on all of them so it shouldn't take too long  Miami Tyler hero his absence has really opened the door for three guys on the heat Duncan Robinson has been a very easy stream he's hurt right now he's questionable for the game got her in that last one so potentially you would be able to use them this evening when I forgot to put Thomas Bryant on this board who I should probably go back and fix you guys can actually see me do it here we'll do it live all right Thomas Bryant right in with the with the heat and then hero slash bam I believe bam is questionable for this one there we go fixed it right there live on air  Thomas Bryant is a potential stream if bam misses time he we know Brian can put up okay fantasy numbers if he gets you know 24 25 minutes or more and that seems like basically what he was looking at because defensively he's a sieve and there's just sort of only so long you can leave them out there but offensively he's very gifted very good mid-range shooter  finishes around the bucket extraordinarily well he just can't Garden anybody  but we don't really care about that for Fantasy purposes  Kyle Lowry and I met arques were the ones we talked about on Wednesdays show as guys that technically had been startable with Tyler hero down and I just kept wimping out on actually putting them into my lineup but then Kyle Lowry exploded in that last ball game and so that kind of makes that decision to heck of a lot easier all though it's worth noting that  that was the big one and probably the next ones to follow won't be quite so large  since Tyler hero went down Lowry is like a rounded top 90 Guyz is number 103 in those weak after two weeks that we've been staring down so far so again technically they're both startable in all formats it's just been hard for me to pulled the trigger on it  now how are you getting threesome assists some steals he hasn't completely ruined your percentages which again you're playing with fire a little bit there a Caz has been more points rebounds and percentages  I like they could fall off a little bit that's what I keep worrying about okay Kyle Lowry's not a 46% guy from the field these days  that's basically what he's been shooting since hero went down how long before the bottom falls out  that hasn't yet so I guess you can kind of keep going with it  I continue to be tuned is  Goga batsy has finally kind of locked in that starter's job I know that he got the start right when Wendell Carter she went down and Junior and he had a really good game against the Lakers and then the next couple he and mo Vogue were basically splitting the sentiments but over the last few ball games it's mostly been batted doing the damage thinking about just like the last week on this where is GoGo the last week  number 80 about 27 minutes per game and well that's three blocks at night I don't know that that number is really long-term sustainable we don't need long term we just need a week or two so Goga makes sense as the fill in there now and Wagner you can pretty much write off Bobby Portis we've talked about this one for Jay Crowder we don't need to go into a whole lot of new news on that one Craig Portis Jr in Cleveland has actually filled in kind of well for Donovan Mitchell he's one that I don't think I'm starting immediately but just be aware that you know for head-to-head purposes that's a guy you could drop into a lineup pretty easily for Roto I probably wouldn't  again there's this distinction and then people have been like Dan why are you making this distinction well here's how it makes sense  Roto you want every game cap you use every game against your cap to be someone that you feel is going to be top 100 or better in a 12 team League you don't want to blow a games cap game on somebody who might not be as good head to head you find a guy like say again Craig Port is Junior here where we don't know if he's gonna post a good game in the next one but over the span of say seven days if the Cavs had four games over seven days and you figured he was gonna be filming in for Donovan Mitchell for all four of them that's a good enough week  because it doesn't count against the games cap you just want to you just want to roll stats together  Obi topping put a couple of good games together for Indiana Aaron Nesmith has been is the reason why if Nesmith plays I don't think that I would throw top in in there if he doesn't and just get obn with a bunch of extra shot attempts many of them alongside Tyreese Halliburton but wait we'll get to that because he's on the injury board also  top into playable guy in starters minutes but he really does need like a full 30 minutes per game to get there so that's why you really need somebody out for this one to make sense  however  both Tyreese Halliburton and Andrew heart or questionable for the Pacers game this evening if they sit TJ McConnell is going to go crazy  he's done nothing so far this year McConnell but he's the third string point guard on that team and we saw him pick up some slack I think Halliburton missed one game earlier at Pacers were not surprisingly kind of bad in it nem hard played about half the game McConnell played about half the game TJ only needs about 24 minutes to be a fantasy guy but if both point guards are out in front of him in the pecking order and he start to see a 30 minute McConnell that's a top 50 kind of game  so be ready to potentially drop him in even though we might not get the news on this one until well when the heck did the Pacers play tonight Wednesday ball game a Indies at home so that one is a 4:00  I know we're gonna be doing our weekend preview in that one game's gonna have already happened  what do we got next on the docket here Reggie Jackson he's not one that I'm starting in Roto again one that makes more sense if you can sort of compiled stats on the head-to-head side Spencer Dinwiddie tips just a tiny bit farther into the maybe Roto his game is quite similar to Reggie Jackson lowfield goal percent free throw is off in a neutral for Dinwiddie points threes assists kind of the only stuff he does on the court but the last game he's done enough of it  so head to head in Woody obviously he's a go like that's not even a question if you get a decent schedule and he can give you three games and four or five nights  that's playable Roto it's an again where I just don't think I have the Stone's to play him his last ball game was very much a games cap worthy game but the you know he had like three or four before that what  so try to interpret this the best you can for your team in your league Santi aldama in Memphis had a quiet game last time out but Xavier Tillman is still been out Marcus Smart is out for a while Desmond Bane might actually miss time also  that leaves nobody Jaron Jackson Jr in South Elmer just gonna have to take every shot for a game or two and that's good for Fantasy so that's why he's on the injury replacement board  Paul Reed was awesome with Joel and beat out on Wednesday I'm expecting MB to play but on the chance he doesn't you  freaking better have Paul Reed ready to go  his fantasy numbers are huge when he gets playing time I don't care that Marcus Morris started means nothing to me  Harrison Barnes  I don't know that I'd play him in Roto but he can Murray being out loud Barnes to get a few more shots up and that allowed him to put up but decent fantasy line simple as that  he's extremely boring when that team is healthy he doesn't get anywhere near enough touches but as bodies drop and I still think the kings are going to have some kind of injury situation this year because they had none last season and it's very weird for a team to be super duper healthy two years in a row Fox Murray sabonis Barnes all those guys basically played every damn game last year  it's just not gonna happen again this season  Kings would be quite good if they all were healthy but I just I think we're going to see something tip the other way  we already saw Foss Fox Miss what three or four games now Keegan's probably gonna miss a few  if they get hurt at the same time  the West is just such a gauntlet like you need your body you need your horses in there  Dyson Daniels has been a really nice dream with CJ McCollum out but there's a big question mark there with Jose Alvarado starting to ramp back up again so he's kind of a maybe on this injury replacement board Kobe white is all so a bit of a maybe Zach LaVine as a game time decision for tonight last I saw He's listed as questionable but I think he's gonna try to give it a goal well wait and see on that one can you got to just watch the news on these and then Kelly Olynyk he's a fun one now finally getting a chance in the starting lineup with Walker Kessler out they tried other lineups with largely leaning on outside body but they benched him Olynyk got in there and then we know if Kelly puts up if it has starters minute it's he puts up gigantic fantasy numbers so he's actually one of my favorite streams on this board if he starts for the Jazz and the last page on our week in review the bylaws in the cell highs now that we have a buy and sell show on this thing I don't want to repeat myself too much but I will a little bit the buys right now are Chris Middleton who we've just seen finally kind of crack the the code on getting his minutes up a little bit higher you might be able to get him for someone near the like 90 range and that's probably a reasonable price to pay because he's not there yet  the person rostering him is probably not gonna be super willing to part with Middleton if they've been waiting it out to this point but this is your opportunity to try even if it fails  Jaren Jackson Jr is on my buy board he really couldn't be any worse than he's been so far this year he's number 83 percentages or field goal percentage is bad Steals and blocks or way down with him it's going to be about getting that defensive stat going again and I do think I have every reason to believe that at some point they will he's just being asked to do way too much on the offensive side and so it's kind of killing his chance to do anything defensively  but he's with every passing game he becomes a more affordable by low  and OG Anna nobe who was also on our board a couple days ago as a Buy Low there's every reason to believe that his steals numbers are going to go up that his free throw percent is gonna go up he just makes no sense where he is right now and I would also believe I would assume his rebounds and maybe even assists could Trend up a little bit as well and adobe's also a Buy Low and then the only sell high is Kyle kuzma who's putting up these giant assist numbers lately that I just simply can't believe we're gonna stick specially the 48% shooting feels like the one that's absolutely headed down  question is what can you get for probably a lot because he's scoring a bunch and he had these big assist games there's a lot of Buzz around him right now he's ranked 60th and nine cat if you can get somebody near 60 for kuzma I would 100% do it  so do it  all right that's your weekend review we're gonna take a look at all 30 teams next ball game is coming up over the weekend but before we do I want to get to a couple pieces of news that popped up over the NBA one of them and one of our viewers here I'll throw it on the board he says any update on Josh giddey and the answer is no and I don't know if all of you guys heard the news but Josh giddey appeared in some Instagram photos posted by a high school sophomore where she has basically claimed that they had  inappropriate relations we don't really know the legitimacy of any of this yet I'm assuming the Thunder and the NBA will probably have some kind of Investigation until we hear something we probably just need to assume that he's going to keep playing but news May pop up in the next hour two hours whatever it is I'm not a big Josh giddey fantasy guy anyway because he's not a particularly strong nine cat player and that's mostly what I talk about on this show is nine cat stuff I think giddy is like outside the top 200 on the year so to that end he wasn't really startable anyway  if he misses time the hot hand in the in OKC has been Isaiah Joe that's the guy you'd probably look at to get a little more fill in with Shae Gill just Alexander probably picking up most of the point guard type duties  and they'll just find other ways to kind of share the basketball so right now nothing  no update on giddy don't do anything about it yet we don't know how the NBA's gonna handle it we don't know if it's real we don't know if it's a joke whatever  it could be quite bad if it turns out to be real but for the moment let's just sit on it  here's what I'd like to do let's let's get through our weekend preview part of the proceedings see if I can get that up on the screen here make it nice and big there's Fridays games so here's the team played on Friday and you'll know we do this pretty fast because most of the angles were pursuing on these games or stuff that we talked about already on the sort of weekend review so we'll move through the 30 teams pretty fast 10 15 seconds on each team probably maximum here Boston Orlando that ball game again starts in about an hour and a half from the time we are doing this podcast  we already talked about Goga on the Orlando side Boston we know Drew holiday is doubtful so there is a little angle there to look at who fills in  when Derek white was hurt or out earlier this week Payton Pritchard had a big ball game my guess is that Sam Houser probably gets the start but you never know they might go big and let out Horford get in there  we gotta wait and see  Phoenix Memphis not much with the Suns until we hear about Bradley Beal getting closer so right now you can just sort of coastal along Kevin Durant by the way questionable with a sore foot in this game or the Suns may be looking for an opportunity to give their their main guys some rest and Memphis has been so terrible that I don't just feels like an opportunity to maybe do so Grizzlies we already talked about aldama JJ is a by low but if Desmond Bane misses time it's possible that someone else will have no choice but to put up some numbers would that be Jacob Gilyard I don't know I think we need to see and put one in the role of X before we start adding and subtracting stuff we talked about all the streamers on the heat there's possibly four of them depending on who's in and who's out the Knicks I'm tipping towards drop Josh Hart and maybe he should have been on the board earlier as someone that I am  putting more into the I'm worried or drop zone perhaps that's the name that got left off here  either way it doesn't look like he's getting 30 minutes when the next are healthy and that's what we need out of him to hit fantasy value and so we'll make it very simple these playing 30 it's a no and if he's not then or if he is then it's a yes  you guys in the chat room just said that Drew is out and not doubtful which is fine I mean I was assuming that he was probably not going to play someone's listed as doubtful in the morning you can generally assume they're not going news came out I think 11 minutes ago that he's actually been listed as out we also got word  Giannis is questionable that came up about 20 minutes ago on the Milwaukee side so that would be a really big thing for Bobby Portis  he and it's an illness you honest says upper respiratory infection it looks like non-covid illness if they don't say gastroenteritis I'm assuming that means that he's coughing a bunch which by the way if any of these guys have the thing that I've been battling for the last four weeks there's no way they're playing basketball anyway we'll get to the Bucks in a little bit  so that's the that's the next Bulls Zach LaVine is questionable I'm looking for more information on Kobe white pretty much every time he that Levine doesn't play but we said it a couple times earlier this week if there's a chance you could squat on white now  you might want to do it because we know Levine is on the trade block what I don't know is when he gets moved might be now might be a week might be two months  that would be the trade deadline basically I'd be two and a half months I guess  we don't know at some point though it seems like the Bulls are gonna have no choice but to blow it up and when they do  Kobe white stands to benefit probably more than anybody but Patrick Williams could also be a guy there on Andre Drummond could be a guy there there's a lot of stuff in Chicago the reason I brought up Kobe white first is that he's won we already know steps into more usage and he needs a lot of usage because it's Fantasy game is not perfect  Toronto  nothing really Pistons it sounds like we're gonna get Jalen Duren back that's fun so bye bye Marvin Bagley and Isaiah Stewart thoughts of any kind Jade and Ivy has played big minutes his last two or three ball games as Fantasy game is a bit iffy for nine cat but it'd be nice to see if there's been some growth there Indiana we just talked about all the guys that are questionable neesmith nem heart Halliburton chance to get some streams going but again you're just gonna have to watch the news watch the wire on that one see what we what comes out on who's in and who's out  sacko we talked about Keegan Murray that's the only real story there along with the Harrison Barnes Minnesota first game without Jaden McDaniels I should put in Tequila Alexander Walker on the watch list or in the show I always missed someone and then it comes up as I'm going through the games ahead  he got the start with Jade McDaniels out Jade's expected to miss two to three weeks with his sprained ankle I don't know that Alexander Walker's Gonna Get Enough usage to do anything but you never know maybe they maybe he ramps up how many shots he takes  kind of doubt it because Daniels wasn't exactly taking a ton of shots  maybe Kyle Anderson that was what we said before is it going to be slow-mo is it going to be nausea gonna be nobody probably nobody for Roto but Alexander Walker slow-mo those guys could be a little more useful to get on their head-to-head side  Wizards nothing really outside of just the tank Milwaukee we just talked about Giannis being listed as questionable so that would open the door for Bobby porridge to do a ton of stuff you probably get enough of Pat connaughton even there to make sense and then what have to have a big ball game again  Denver nothing really Houston nothing really  San Antonio also nothing really I know a lot of teams were we kind of know what up what's up at this point  Warrior's is Clay finally waking up  is weggins waking up inclined to say maybe on clay and I'm inclined to say maybe not on Wiggins but again you never know Chris Paul been very good with Draymond out he got ejected he got Scott fostered in their last ball game and that dropped him from top 50 do it like 64 but  easy peasy  New Orleans Dyson Daniels Jose Alvarado Jordan Hawkins all that stuff Jonas Valentin who's been blocking a crap ton of shots all that is kind of stuff to Monitor and then the Clippers I hope Norman Powell plays because I'd like to frankly see what he's gonna do with the team in this particular build but again I don't I don't really know and he might not play look at ahead to Saturday Philly that's gonna be whether or not Joel embiid is in the lineup or not obviously if he's not you go Paul Reed  okay see we'll see if anything about Josh Gideon emerges before that ball game and if it does then we'll have more things to pay attention to their Miami we've talked about Brooklyn Dinwiddie is kind of the only thing there Hawks  very straightforward  Wizards we talked about Lakers cam reddish being out has sort of opened the door for something else to happen but I don't think we're going to see it feels like it's just the core 4 for La these days Cleveland it's gonna come down to Donovan Mitchell's Health everything else is relatively locked in at this point if he's out again head to headers you might look at Craig Porter Jr lot of Porter Juniors floating around  Pelicans we talked about jazz if OLX still in the starting lineup I think it's probably the big question there Mavericks it's the health of Derek Lively and we are already talked about the Clippers and does anybody not go today or tomorrow  the Blazers there you go Blazers are off a couple days they'll play again on Sunday and you know Malcolm Brogden being back I think pretty much Shores that up and then whether or not DeAndre Aiden plays in that ball game because he missed the last one and reef at a decent ball game and Jabari Walker had a better ball game and like I'm probably not gonna take the plunge on those types of guys if Aiden misses another ballgame but it is something to sort of throw in the back of your brain  and does anybody else a little Charlotte on Sunday Gordon Hayward is what you're paying attention to their  I think that's the entire NBA  yeah that's all 30 teams that's what you're paying attention to  all right we're about 42 minutes deep let's do a few questions and then we'll wrap up the week here let's see Klay Thompson Bruce Brown scoot Henderson or tyus Jones nine cat I have to drop one by the end of the week  well the one of these four that's absolutely positively not producing nine cat value right now is school now certainly he's a guy you're going to want to have like on your team in February and March most likely  but if like if you need to win right away he's not really helping right now now if you're looking down the line and say okay I can't drop it I need to make sure I stash him and it's probably Bruce Brown because his ceiling is the lowest of the remaining players  a good Bruce Brown year is going to be like 90 range whereas you know Tyson suddenly starts getting minutes he could be a top 60 top 70 guy same story for Klay Thompson if he starts to get his shot to fall would you try to sell high on Paul George and Booker due to injury risk  problem is I think other teams are aware of whatever the injury risk might be Paul George's number eight in nine cat right now  where's Booker at he's number 11  I don't know that I would move on from either of those guys because Bradley Beals out a few more weeks so Devin Booker's gonna just keep having this gigantic run that he's on  as he is right now the point guard  Bill comes back there like likely to do more splitting of that depending on who the hell's healthy  you know if you could trade Booker and get a top 12 guy back I probably would but I don't think you can so you're you're probably just enjoy it and then with Paul George I think if you can get anybody inside the top like 15 to 18 back you probably do it but again I don't know that that's gonna work like I don't think anybody's gonna give you  what  Scotty Barnes for him probably not you're not getting stiff you're not getting these guys that were drafted at the very top end so I mean the short answer is yes if you could sell them you probably should but I don't know that you're going to be able to get much who would you target if you were selling Kyle kuzma  you know there are some names around him that I think are really interesting  Michael Porter Jr is really close by  DeMar DeRozan isn't that far off  vouch isn't that far off he Zach LaVine isn't that far off and Levine people are probably worried about right now  I don't know if I go any lower I feel like with the way he's scoring and assisting right now you could you could sort of aim big  could you get Freddie Van Lee I doubt it Jalen Brunson where's the try  I don't know that helps it all  rank Caruso quickly and Eason it's that order  should I drop Jonathan Isaac for Go-Go batsy yeah I think I would  do I trade Kyrie Irving for mikal bridges for the playoff schedule advantage or no it's a points League  boy I might  I might  depends on whether or not you think your team is still strong enough to get there with the per game drop off you take getting rid of Irving for Bridges I feel like you could probably get somebody better than bridges for Kyrie I remember 23 right now and he really hasn't even hit his stride in a number of different facets and like wait for Luca to miss a ball game too  so my answer this is maybe but I feel like you could aim even higher  Pascal siakam or Jalen Brown rest of season give me Jaylen Brown safer because the Hakeem could get moved if Toronto goes on a stinky stink run  is saddiq Bey a drop yes  I have scoot on ill I know you're not a fan but I feel like he has some trade value would you drop obvious sucks County Georgia Titus Jones or just  let off the hook  rest of those guys are gonna be much better than him for I would guess again the next two to two and a half three months  it's just a long time like I get it I get it guys scoot's gonna be good later this year probably  I get it I just I have so much trouble sitting on a guy for that long  too many things can go wrong other guys in your team can get hurt you can have weeks where you just have a games disadvantage and so if you have a guy on your team that's like  kind of a black hole for fantasy stats and and you know this probably gonna be it's not like he goes from being completely unplayable to very good over and just overnight there's gonna be a curve to this where he slowly gets better presumably  but if it feels to me like it's many weeks before he passes any of those other guys  if any of them is a drop it's probably Chianti George but I think I'd rather just not have to deal with waiting on scoot forever  someone dropped John Morant in a publicly how much would you use to pick him up 25% more  more  Memphis is what we're like halfway through his suspension so you know you're only holding for about three more weeks  and then he's going to play and I know nine cat his numbers are  weird because his free throw shooting is bad and his turnovers are super duper high at his field goal percent is not helpful but there aren't that many dudes out there that you could pick up that'll probably post mid to high 20s and points  you know five six boards seven eight nine assists and over a steel ball game  you know he's playable in any format and then in head-to-head if you happen to be punting turnovers free throw or field goal percent he's an absolute Juggernaut so um I would go more than 25% of your Fab budget this is you know guys like that don't pop up where they're just absolute guaranteed Mega producers  I don't know about all because you may want to have some at some point um but I would say between 50 and 80 is perfectly reasonable  any chance that impede misses a few games I picked up Paul Reed and about and I'm about to stream the slot  I don't know Troy sorry I haven't heard anything on MB since he missed out last ball game anything's possible with Joelle I'm assuming he's back because they had a few games off or a few days off here between basketball games  obviously you're gonna want Paul Reed if and beat is ruled out but all so like you can still stream and get more here  because they all read only as one more game  so I would probably stream it and just say I hope and becomes back because if you wait and then empty comes back then it's kind of too late really did stream this spot effectively  Derek Lively or Wendell Carter Junior I actually think Lively has the more interesting upside between the two because he gets defensive stats call me nuts I'm not a big window Carter Jr fantasy guy ah I think what he's using like 103 last year this season he's not even approaching any of that type of stuff he just can't get any higher than that because he doesn't block shots  just a tiny bit more here guys I don't know how many questions we got but just a few more and then I gotta wrap it up  um oh here's another situation where scoot got dropped do I drop any of the following guys to pick up scoot Henderson Bilal Dyson Daniels Craig Porter Jr GoGo beta yeah I'm dropping Craig Porter  because we know he's disappearing as soon as Donovan Mitchell comes back  you agree that Miles Bridges going back going to be a top 40 again he looks like a good start um I don't know about Top 40 when that teams fully healthy he's rumbling right now but then like the adrenaline's gonna wear off in a couple of ball games but yeah I mean he seems like he's gonna be a top 6702 I'm just continuing to try to win without him  I don't think I need him to win my league  his clay a cell hi yeah you're not gonna get anything for him after two decent ball games so no that's not he'd have to be good he'll have to be good for a few weeks before I think you could get anything substantial for clay  I have to drop one of the following players he can Meridian Anthony Melton vessel 10 team her uh 10 team or you're probably dropping Melton maybe even sell not Keegan Murray I feel like he's got just massive upside oh boy yeah I don't think we're gonna get through all these questions guys sorry about that do you think Markle faults is a by low Target for a punt 3's team normally I'd say yes but I just have no idea when that dude is coming back if ever  who's a good replacement for Miles Bridges I ended up picking him up I would rather not root for a guy like that yeah I understand  I think you could trade him for a top 75 range guy right now or if you're okay with  just closing your eyes for like one more week because if he puts up good numbers for another three or four ball games you probably be able to get someone more like top 50 top 60  and basically just a longer you hold on to him the more value you could get back in a trade you've come this far Jayden believe me I'm with you on this I don't really want them on my team either but now these there for you you might as well try to get proper value back so give him a little bit longer there will be some Ebbs and flows here and then you can probably get a little more  is Derek live injury serious I mean he didn't it look not great he bashed his back on the ground but it's contusion he landed awkwardly nothing's ripped or torn and he's a young dude so  weak maybe less maybe more I don't think it's months  look at a cell on Chris Paul with yeah that makes sense he's doing a lot more with Draymond out should I try to get Drew holiday Chris Middleton or OG and a nobby I would go for  oh gee of those three guys if I had my druthers  do I drop highest Jones or Brandon Miller  for Jaime is um you could probably stream the Branded Miller slot or you just hold just hold still  I'm worried about kauai's health I mean everybody's always worried about Hawaii's Health who would you flip him for  anybody inside the top 25  he's number 208 right now and his free throw percent isn't anywhere near where it's likely to finish this season  field goal percent probably all so ticks up  I don't know if this is the perfect time to sell on Kauai but you should be able to get a top 25  do you think this is the year Kawaii and Kyrie plays 70 games or more know but I said on many pods leading up to the season that I thought we were gonna get like low to mid-60s out of Kauai and 50s and I still feel that way spicy dad I like that handle would you trade OG for Aaron Gordon if you're punting threes no wait don't don't sell on OG right now he's a buy right now if you can get OG then let him get hot then flip them for somebody have at it but I'm also not an Aaron Gordon fantasy fan he's number 100 right now because it's free throw percent stinks I also think it's defensive stats continue to Trend downward as the year goes I don't I don't want any part of Aaron Gordon going forward  I'm gonna get through these questions damn it who would you aim if you were selling Kyrie Irving it's got to be top 20 or better  I wouldn't settle for anything less than a top 20 safe top 20 guy so like  cat  would be an interesting one that maybe you could get that be a little bit low  marketing maybe you could get  Donovan Mitchell while he's hurt maybe you could get  but the only reason you're selling on Kauai is if you just think it's the end is nigh for him I'd like game Mr gonna start popping up in the maps are looking pretty good I feel like he's just generally enjoying himself should I stream Duncan Robinson spot  uh try to hold these was rolling top 50 here with hero out  I start Thompson or OG rest of season um  I think I'm gonna say Anna Nobi  but it's close  it's closed  someone dropped tyus Jones I picked him up to stream should I hold for more than a week and see how he does yeah I do I actually believe that if the Wizards  actually let tyus Jones play um he could be a very good fantasy asset he's number one 29 with like limited opportunity so far but you saw when he gets started minutes if he's at 30 minutes or more he's well inside the top 100 and he's arrested of seasoned guy in those spots it's just the right now he's playing 27 minutes a game and Jordan pools taking 25 shots and missing almost all of them so in my heart of hearts I still believe that at some point it was going to be like tyus I need you to run this thing a little bit more and he gets a little bit better he's very close to being a playable guy even in these bad scenarios  so yes hold on to him I think it's good  is Gordon Hayward to drop I talked about this at the very beginning of the show scroll all the way back he's on the holds board for one more week is Jalen Johnson better than ogn and OB in fantasy well he has been so far this year although I do still think Jalen Johnson comes back to Earth a little bit and a nobby works up it's possibly both end up in like the 60s so maybe this carrot should be an equal sign you guys are sneaking in questions here at the end I said I was going to be done is Ingram a sell High  is he a so high I think he's ranked 88th  I don't know that that's high  oh points League now this is what he is in a points League  could cam Johnson get inside the top 90 in a points League I don't see why not  so drugs are tyus Jones rested the year probably sogs  because the Wizards are screwball at Orlando's winning and so this is being a is a big part of that so give me give me Suggs and that's it  I know a bunch of you actually just joined in to watch it like almost the one hour mark but hopefully you guys are way back behind and then you can
