welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right everybody sorry about the slightly delayed start today  kids parent-teacher conferences this morning at the preschool so everything got pushed back by a couple of hours we will still fear not have two shows today we'll go back to back why is my hat look all tipped sideways  think it might just be the way that the camera is facing me  Maybe my head is tip sideways  that's not good which side is higher this side is oh that doesn't feel right at all  but that looks straighter now  you guys are enjoying this very very bad beginning to a show Welcome to Fantasy NBA today I am Dan best burst this is If Sports ethos.com presentation please do take a moment to like rate and subscribe as we dive into the news of the day the news du jour here on Wednesday morning of course we will have our streaming show in the afternoon as per usual we'll get you guys situated on your playoff battles I got more bad news for you on the streaming front but this show is going to be about recapping the card recapping Player information injury news you guys can see Kawaii in the thumbnail for today's episode he left with back spasms we got Desmond Bane news so let's just Dive Right on in after of course all of you that are  watching listening whatever  come find me on Twitter at Danbury d a n b e s b r i s i can direct you to all the different directions from there  Discord or Sports ethos or baseball feed football feed basketball feed whatever that's all over on that side so from a player news standpoint we'll get to Kawaii because we'll hit that one on one of the one of the Recaps but the Memphis Grizzlies who did play yesterday I want to actually just start with their ball game if we could because the Grizzlies are screwy these days Jake laravia 24 minutes ended up with a pretty decent fantasy line of I don't expect them to go seven for seven at the free throw line every day but the 24 minutes is not high enough Luke Kennard played well but he won't play in the back-to-back almost definitely Jordan Goodwin came out of the woodwork here and anytime he starts we kind of want to get him into our fantasy lineups but I don't know what he is starting  Santi aldama when JJJ sits is generally playable although this one he was sort of Fringe playable because the bad field goal percent John conchar someone could tell us he's gonna play 30 plus minutes you'd use him but we don't know and then trade Jameson who I guess it played for the Wizards I forgot about that had a little bit of a call Semi Revenge game and then matter either way he just got going 301 minutes is nice 24 points is nice on good field goal percent two blocks is nice but literally I mean  if he doesn't shoot the crap out of the ball this is a very empty fantasy line so the end of the day we're staring down the barrel of the same crap with Memphis which is Jake Larry as damn close  Vince Williams if or when he comes back is playable but he's missed a couple now JJ when he plays is playable and maybe he goes on the second half of this back to back I don't know we'll find out in a few hours  overall though I don't know that like on the head to head side it's very hard to use any of these guys if they're not in a really prominent scheduling spot and yes the back-to-back is useful for some of these dudes but you kind of need almost need more than that like you can use a move for a Grizzly for two days and then punt I guess you could I just you guys know me I'm always looking farther down the line long streams things of that nature for head to head and then Roto you're looking for a guy you could just use against the games cap so the answer on the Roto side is who would you use against the games cap  probably good win when he starts definitely Jaron Jackson when he plays  almost definitely Vince Williams when he plays  and then you get into these other guys and laravia sort of a 50/50 call me coin flip guy on against the games cap uh Luke Kennard when he starts is kind of 50/50  it's mostly annoying though I'll Obama when JJ sits it's probably like a 640 kind of play  and then we got news The Desmond Bane has moved along to five on five meaning he could return within the week  in what capacity  is still a very large dangling question  my guess  and we don't know this for sure but my guess is based on the fact that Memphis after tonight they played Charlotte they go one game over four days then they got three next week they got three the week after that they don't have a back-to-back until April 5th and 6th so there isn't like a back-to-back scenario that Desmond veins can have to be avoiding does he get back in time for that okay see game maybe he doesn't does he come back in Sacramento and Golden State and San Antonio one of those games possibly  but you're gonna see you know  20 minutes 22 minutes there's no reason for him to play every ball game because Memphis is terrible you're gonna see a lot of what's going on with Jaren Jackson which is a play sometimes and he'll probably take a crap ton of shots in that game but then knowing when he's actually in the lineup is going to be very complicated so he's not a guy that I'm stashing and head to head unless I have an open IL slot but frankly at this point it would take you a roster move that you should be using on streaming if you're in the playoffs you've been needing to be like a bye week right now or buy week next week frankly and then I think I would consider it  but if you're in a battle right this second you can't pick up a guy who's getting zeros because you're gonna have to drop somebody alive to pick up beIN to put in an eel slide  and then pick a different guy back up again  so it's a two moves thing to kind of get right back to where you were almost  I don't know how you do it if you're in a head-to-head battle right now if you're fighting for the playoffs or you're in the playoffs if you have a buy or you'll buy next week or whatever it is that's a different Universe then you could because then you're looking all the way down at you know March 25th basically if you're season goes to the very end which hopefully it doesn't but some do uh then you're gonna get probably I don't know six games over the next two weeks and maybe he'll be in the mid-20s by then  that's useful that's a good fantasy play but you know immediately it's you're asking a lot  and we don't even know if he's gonna play in every one of those upcoming like if he gets back in the thunder on Saturday  do we know if he's gonna play the next four games that one and then the following three and actually get you a three game week  at what 66 68 minutes if you played in all three of those 70  it would be barely worth it it would be worth it if you played in all those games and he put up like pretty heavy usage numbers in 20 low 20s and minutes as he ramped up it would be worth it for him because he can put a button a bunch of numbers really quick he's good  but if he doesn't left sort of  holding the bag on a very risky move Roto obviously I mean there was no reason to drop him and wrote her to begin with because you know games cab and any games cap format there was sort of no reason to drop them I'm talking about spots where you're in a game's cap probably limited number of ill spots  if you have like three aisles okay fine but again you gotta use a move to get him I don't know how you justify  making a pickup on a guy who's not necessarily going to play it's a really hard call I get it  I really do  it's a really hard call  but if you're in a battle you can't do it right now  the other team in that ball game the Wizards who lost to the tank and Grizzlies you got a nice one out of Corey kissper he's always a stream when he's starting right now he's been hot knocking down threes he didn't do much else in this ball game but frankly you know five threes on good percentage is good enough be a lot cooler believe we talked about on our streaming show yesterday as Wizards had four games and six days starting last night the Hope was basically this kind of line but a bad field goal percent but he did enough other stuff to float it three threes five boards for assists two steals one block that's what you were looking for you were basically streaming for defensive stats and hopefully he keeps it up over his next three games this week because the plan if you picked up cool little league was not to use him against the rodeo games but to hold him through their back-to-back Saturday Sunday because then they go into a lighter week next week  Roto it wasn't even a thing  bench pool has cooled off a little bit last couple of ball games stick with them same with Aveda same with tyus Jones stick with those guys they'll be all right kiss bird is your son of all formats stream right now Philly put up 79 points in New York Knicks got ogn and Obi back and that certainly helped their cause but let's talk Philly first but he healed is coming off the bench now he is a very soft hold  I'm a little surprised that he's not starting  but I guess they felt like they needed to go a little bit bigger maybe a little bit more data I don't it's hard to say Kelly oubre is in the starting lineup he's a stream  Tyrese Maxey is obviously a play Tobias Harris is on one of the worst stretches of his life I'm hoping that he busts out of it he's kind of someone you just need to play I'll know if you really wanted to Roto you could sit him until he looks like he's getting a firm or grass on how to play basketball again  but the question marks I think our buddy hield Kyle Lowry and Paul Reed on this team read up 14 today with a couple of steals  he has been just barely good enough despite the rapidly fluctuating role and I keep kind of going back and forth on how I want to handle this he's very much a start because he's got 24 27 28 28 minutes over the last four ball games that's been enough even though he's been bouncing between the starting lineup and the bench and over those games you know he's he's been on a block stare as 10 blocks his four steals rebounds have been solid I'm I'm just nervous and I don't know why I'm so nervous about Reed I just am he's been good I had him I was very bullish on him when him beat went down we waited on him through that that weird illness and he hasn't really shown many signs of like truly slowing down he stops 75 over the last month in 26 minutes so again that's really all you need is 26 and he's been getting that starter or Reserve I just I don't know I feel worried about the possibility that those minutes could fluctuate more because his role is not set in stone I don't know why I have this weird worry in my gut I just keep going into games going should I use him against the game's cap  the answer like three out of every four nights is still yes  but there's just something about the way he's being used right now that's making me nervous I don't I can't even I can't even quite put my finger on it because it doesn't actually make sense and I was a big Paul Reed proponent  so for a lot of you guys you're like damn why the hell you flip flopping here I don't know  I've no I haven't felt this way about a player in a really long time where I look at the player and I remained super positive about it I just don't trust the way that  he's being used nightly even though despite getting yanked around a little bit he's still putting up numbers  so by all accounts I should just say start Paul Reed and don't worry about that day-to-day that would be the easiest call to take the Danny Green you know five years ago approach which is like okay yeah they're gonna there's gonna be a bad one mixed in there but like close your eyes don't worry about it don't worry if he's starting to worry he's coming up the bench as long as Joe well and beat his out  Paul Reed should be a start  that is the simple solution and frankly it has been the right one so far that's the first thing we said but for some reason last night I was looking at I was like I just  feel he's not scoring at all right now something bad is about to happen I just have this like sinking feeling that something bad's about to happen  anyway I guess the short answer right now is just keep playing him because he's been good enough but be careful like I guess  Kyle Lowry is an assist stream nothing more than that that's where I've settled with that one and then buddy hield  he's got to get back over 30 minutes and now getting blown out and having some very low scoring games has been not great Maxi being back is actually gonna help healed because that'll create a little bit of space even a small sliver of it compared to what was going on over the previous week and Max you'll be all right this he started hot and then he pulled off Nick's are very good defensive team that's why heeled as a hold for me um  even coming off the bench I want to give him like maybe two or three more ball games to see how this goes I don't want to be too rash with it because he was putting up some really big numbers and there's no guarantee that they come back but there's also no guarantee they don't  on the next side ogn we came back immediately played 29 minutes which is Tom Thibodeau minutes cap by all accounts Josh Hart got up to 39 minutes 20 points 19 boards 10 assists I think this pretty well answered the question of which guy between heart and a Chua was gonna take the hit when ogn and no B came back it was precious  Precious played 24 minutes 13 and with a couple of blocks actually ended up still being playable on the fantasy side so that was good but he's probably trending towards a drop as an obese minutes get up into the mid 30s that'll probably cost precious another two or three and you know 2021 is is definitely not gonna be enough so heart Brunson Devon shenzo OG obvious starts I hate to say it but I said it last week I'll say it again I think I say a heart and shine can be dropped there's just no indication that this minutes cap is about to come off for him Mitchell Robinson is almost waiting the wings now and they just have more opportunities to go smaller which sucks because when hartenstein was playing 30 minutes a game he was you know fourth rounder or better but there's just there's no indicator that he's getting back to that so  on We Roll Indiana hey Aaron any Smith's back everybody 15 and 4 with a steel in a couple of blocks no bennedict mathurin to try to take his minutes there's really no other option that they trust so Nesmith to the Moon  that's it that's my only thought on Indiana  TJ McConnell continues to be like bored or line  as a bench play you needed about three more minutes to get there in this ball game he didn't get them  I don't think I'm playing him I know they have back-to-back so that would sort of make sense but overall no and then over on the OKC side there was actually they are worth talking about very briefly Jalen Williams out he was questionable leading up to the Ball Game got ruled out about two three hours ahead of time so pretty close  and based on the fact that the Thunder have a very light schedule coming up here they play tomorrow  and they play Saturday but then they're off for three days after that you might see Jalen Williams I think he probably gets back in might even be as soon as tomorrow which would be music to everyone's ears we have a lot of Jalen Williams's at sports ethos in the meantime Gordon Hayward took his spot at 94 and 5 I Gordon hayward's  I just don't think he's good anymore um but we I've been talking about that for two years now  Lou Dort got a few extra shots that's probably the biggest takeaway from the Jalen Williams think Josh giddey did all so but I don't like Josh get his Fantasy game I don't like dude Arts Fantasy game either but at least with him taking a few more shots you might get a couple of threes  I'm not adding anybody it had to head because they're schedules not very good I'm definitely not anybody in Roto because these guys are not going to get anywhere near the top 100  but  we had to talk about it question mark  eh  Houston first game without Alpine Jacqueline Dale 26 minutes off the bench they went small to start the game and they were getting whipped early and they sort of pivoted it around and gave landale a few extra minutes moved to Barry Smith junior back to power forward  what are the takeaways from this game one land Dale's on my watch list I don't think I'm adding him after this one 26 minutes is not quite enough he had some light foul stuff and then he came off the bench now if he starts you sort of set the low watermark for minutes a little bit higher and kind of remedial handicapping it's like Fuzzy Math handicapping if a guy starts you set the window of minutes play just a bit higher and come off the bench you know this I thought was kind of a best case scenario for him coming off the bench 26 minutes  if you start you're like oh you can get into 26  I just don't see him getting to 30  and I do feel like laying down probably needs 28 30 ish minutes for me to feel good about it being a consistent performer but I don't know that for sure  we've seen him Phoenix last year he put up some numbers in he didn't need the full 30 but I think we can probably watch for one more game  before making an official call on what to do with landale they played tomorrow they got the Wizards real  juicy defense  which means they could go in any direction they want they don't have to go big they don't have to go small it'll give us a pretty good indicator the player I would rather have on Houston Overland at least for right this moment is I'm in Thompson who only played 20 two and a half minutes and a bunch of people on Twitter were like why do you want to pick up I'm in Thompson he was terrible yesterday um because we just know that when he plays and I'm assuming these minutes tick up a little bit  it's actually kind of surprised that they were only at 22 and a half I thought they'd be probably closer to 2425 if he gets to 2425 minutes he has a really interesting Fantasy game because he's a very big guard so you can get rebounds you can get assist you can get steals you can get some blocks you're not gonna get many threes so you know don't bark down that or bark up that tree  but now it's sort of comes down to which of those two guys Thompson or landale can be a guy who steps forward you know Freddie is going to have to do a ton with no shingun around jabbari Smith is going to do more Jalen green which might not be a good thing is gonna have to do more Dillon Brooks is gonna have to do more but like those two guys have terrible nine cat game the guys you're watching Orlando and Thompson I think I'm in the guy you pick up because if you dropped him someone else would pick him up land deals the guy you watch because I don't think he's gonna get at it everywhere after one pretty good but not really an eye-popping game so I think that buys you a little bit of time  as far as the Spurs go Victor webmin Yamaha got off to a pretty slow start in this game he closed well and it ended up putting an okay line together not one of his insane aligns but you know you started you'll take it Devin with cell came back play 36 minutes so both those guys seem to be fine he didn't play well but he played 36 minutes Jeremy Sohan is in a little bit of a groove right now  you guys know how I feel about playing guys and grooves if someone's long-term profile is outside the top 150 I tend to not play them when they go on their heaters because the bad ends up outweighing the good even if I catch him on a wave even if we played so on right now and you get two more good games in a row if you play Hymn for a bad one after that or two bad ones after that it ends up hurting more than it helped  Trey Jones is kind of the other side of a similar equation which is a weird way to frame it  so Han has big upside and absurdly low downside Jones has like neither there's almost no downside there's almost no upside he's very much a member of the doesn't matter Club  happened to get hot for this ball game he had hit I don't think I don't think he had a single three point or was that I already said that he hadn't hit a three pointer in the month of March and then he get three in the first quarter  there's a Rockets were daring him they're like all right come on can you hit one and he was like Well normally know but today yeah yeah he went he went five games without hitting a three-pointer and then he had four yesterday so  it's not gonna happen again he said he's a single digit score who gets you some assistance and some steals in a decent field goal percent and he sort of like a TJ McConnell  light but with slightly more minutes  doesn't matter Club  Malachi Brando is vanished drop in any format because the Spurs schedule get got bad after yesterday and then  champagne played 34 minutes didn't see that one coming not something I think we need to worry about either Spurs is the same thing as usual for me I talked in a circle to say Trey Jones is a doesn't matter guys so had as a guy I don't trust  Wendy and Visalia the guys you play that's the that's the short version  Boston you know they'd rest some guys in Portland and some guys in Utah as they did Sam Houser was the biggest beneficiary of that back to back Payton Pritchard was sort of second in line there Luke kornet got the start and a decent line and this one and even Xavier Tillman got into a Blog game but who cares they'll go back to playing their regulars now that they're off the altitude back to back discard whatever you took away from those ball games because those are over for Utah I'm gonna keep it simple for you guys although Jordan Clarkson just got added to an injury report with some groin soreness so whether or not he plays is now up in the air for Utah's next ball game they now  I think the Jazz are about to move into a very heavy stretch and the reason he's on the injury report is probably because they've got a back-to-back coming up and he might just skip one of them it's a five and seven stretch for the Jazz so head to headers take note for Friday today's not Friday so you don't have to worry about it yet but take note for Friday that jazz guys are about to become very interesting on the streaming side we'll talk more about that on our streaming second half of our two days right now for the moment  if healthy you play keyonte George you play Jordan Clarkson wildlife in his out that one is tied to the market in thing you play sex in all cases Collins and all cases and I think you play Walker Kessler I know he didn't do much in this ball game but he figures to see 20-ish or a little bit more than that it's most ball game off bench and he can put up top 100 numbers in 18 to 20 minutes he can go up pretty quickly he can go a lot higher than that so high floor with upside and Kessler Collins Sexton George those are everyday guys Clarkson wildlife and his out is the the play there Minnesota took care of the Clippers Rudy gobert left and returned he got hit in the ribs nickeil Alexander Walker had a crazy hot shooting night and you're not acting on that basically what happened there is Nas read was dealing with some minor illness or minor injury nikhil got hot and so nasri just did a little bit less but Nas is the guy you're holding between those two I'm still not picking up Kyle Anderson he was a little closer in this one but he just he doesn't seem like himself this year  if that changes and he starts to do more I reserve the right to change my opinion but right now he's not doing enough  Minnesota's got a terrible schedule this week but again that's something we'll talk about on the second half of our two shows today as far as the everyday guys it's go bare its Conley it's Anthony Edwards it's not read  I think Gilbert ends up playing I guess we'll see if he sits that's just more for nasri and probably then enough for slow mo by the way  for the Clippers Kawhi left early with back spasms we've seen the Clippers when they're without one of their three main stars and there isn't an obvious pickup Norman Powell sometimes gets warm sometimes not enough Terence man has been a schedule level play Lately that's it there's like I'd love to say there's an obvious pickup here but they're just isn't and so talking in circles isn't going to change that  Milwaukee got blown out I think you can pretty much throw out this box score everything stays the same as what we've said before which is that Malik Beasley is your three-point streamer while Chris Middleton is out Brooke Lopez is cold what you got to hang on  and that's it and then for Sacramento Darren fox said one of his Mega games almost like he was just getting ready for the Lakers  big game d Fox bonus was good again Harris and Barnes had a big one and don't care Trey Lyles being out probably forces Barnes into more minutes but I still don't want to do anything with him same story for Kevin herder don't care decent game don't care Malik Monk Is the guy you're playing a sort of like the third King in a starting lineup for your fantasy team and then key on Ellis filled in for Keegan Murray he had three steals that was good but I don't think the Fantasy games gonna translate unless he decides he wants to take nine or ten shots which I don't see coming  let's do a quick check of the chat room see if anybody through some stuff in there by the way apologies for starting this thing late I know they've official time was was off the Mark here cam Johnson likely to be back for the Nets so this Steve asking do we want cam Johnson or Kyle Lowry head-to-head rest of season well it's got to be cam I know they're gonna bring him along sort of slowly and Brooklyn schedule is not good they go today and then they're off for two days but his upside is just so far beyond whatever Kyle Lowry can do that this is a pretty clear add  you kind of have to add him in All formats because if you don't someone else will certainly for Roto you can add him because who cares about the two days off for head-to-head Brooklyn schedule gets better again starting on Saturday  so if you can hold on to that and they thought you know three games the rest of this week is pretty similar to what a lot of guys are getting  the question is you know how much does he see right Upon returning  I would say yes to cam Johnson in basically every format  and then I'll cut he asks what about between cam Johnson and Bruce Brown well in the very near term it's probably Bruce Brown cam Johnson likely surpasses him by his second or third game back and I don't know if camps going to play in back to backs  Toronto has all his three games left the rest of this week certainly if quickly and Gary Trent are still out for the Raptors tonight Bruce Brown's gonna get asked to do a lot of stuff and so then he'll be way better tonight than cam Johnson but I would think that by The Weeknd you'd probably rather have Cam uh let's see what we got here do do Derek Lively Brice Sensabaugh yeah I'm not a big sense about a guy I think I'd rather have Derek Lively if I was picking between those two guys  um who do I drop between Marvin Bagley Jaren Jackson and Kawhi Leonard  you're probably dropping Bagley there just because he's not simply as good  in a roto league with 120 games cap played how many games should I have played by now honesty goodness I don't know what the exact number is right now I would say try to be very close to the exact percentage of games the season has Eclipse which is about 80% so you know down about 160 from that  what you could also do and I what I often do in my role league is I'm not looking at the total number of games played I'm looking at because Yahoo if you go to the Yahoo team page on a PC it'll show you your projected games played at each roster slot if you scroll down and you basically just want all of those to be very close to Daddy even right now we're close enough to the end of the year where you should be making up whatever games played you fell behind so you want to be pretty close to break even in the Yahoo estimate which is pretty accurate right now one league for instance let's see am I pretty close to the to break even Mark yeah so right now  oh but this is a league that has an 850 all right I'll get you guys this number live on air stick with me here um  yeah most of the teams in the other Yahoo wrote All League that I'm staring at are  like right yeah about 660 right now 650 660 somewhere in that neck of the woods I think it's pretty good  I don't think I'd go above 670 right now but that's your window because you can make it up the rest of the way  hopefully that answer was helpful is Bruno Fernando worth a pickup Head to Head yes because of the schedule wrote Oh no  Derek Lively or jock landale  hmm  think I'll go landale on that one  yeah give me land all I think he plays more minutes than Lively  Desmond Bane listed as doubtful by the way yeah that news broke while we've been on air here broke about 15 minutes ago  oh I started Thomson just got ruled out boy he's a dog dang  Jerry Jackson doubtful Vince Williams doubtful for the Grizzlies game tonight so it sounds like JJJ is gonna miss another one Santi aldama is now questionable Lamar Stevens's questionable  well the Grizzlies  I don't have nobody left well it's a big Jake  you probably throw it in your Rodeo leak too  yikes Grizzlies yeah Trey Jamison that's another one he's gonna have to play 30 minutes I would think unless he fouls out in 25  is Vince Williams a drop head-to-head probably you can't take what one game week you're looking at here  he's not playing tonight Memphis is one game the rest of the way so you turn up potential one game week into a three game week you have to if you're in a head-to-head League  who are you choosing between Vince wiliams Jeremy Sohan and Scoot Henderson nine cat  well Head to Head it's probably  probably scoop because of the schedule and Vince is taking zeroes Vince Williams  different answers for different situations right now  good question today some nice strategy stuff Doug in there and we can wrap it up 30 minute show today  Breezy  easy breezy uh two hours or so two hours know maybe a little less I'll try to do it by about 1:00 Pacific time we will get our streaming show going  and I have you know it's a hard day to stream but I have some really intense thoughts on it so make sure to  get with us on that one and someone in the chat would just asked about the Jazz I just I talked about the Jazz right near the very end  um so scroll on back and and you know you're not adding anybody right this second but you know depending on who may be in and who may be out for the next ball game perhaps that changes but right now there's still playing kind of some of their usuals  all right I guess that's it okay thanks for watching Everybody appreciate the big viewership is over on social these days
