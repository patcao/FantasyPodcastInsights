mower  thanks for our buddies over at manscaped.com where the promo code ethos 20 ethos 20 gets 20% off and free shipping  it's not that in there did not intend to but felt fuzz in my beard  all right you guys know the plane by now if you guys don't know these shows work very quickly we're gonna go over the worst schedule starting today we're gonna go over the best schedule starting today and the guys that you should consider putting on your head to head streaming roster this show is for Head to Head legs  mostly playoff formats  or maybe I should say all playoff formats but mostly leaks that are in the playoffs right now the latest they could one would assume possibly start would be next week unless you were in a very shallow like an 18 or only 14's make it goes to the end of the year that's a crazy thing but it exists 12 teamers should already be in their playoffs even Yahoo leagues started already they cut off the last week of the regular season  but I gotta say  this week's Britain pretty horrible  a lot of players out a lot of players out this week oof  remember how last year I said we needed a lop off the final three weeks of the season and had to head I think that might need to be four  we may not have lopped enough  I need additional lopping  well we'll talk about that one we get there  I'm Dan Bass Pros I'm at Dan Bass Pro on Twitter please do find me over there if you're watching on social media all you got to do is click the follow button if you're watching or listening somewhere else please do take a moment to like subscribe so you can come back and join us again for the next one  oh righty let's begin here's your bored  I try to zoom in on basically like you know surrounding 15 16 17 days something like that this is what the board looks like starting today actually from a couple days ago but you can get a look at Thursday through the end of the week  and then on to the beginning of next week if you're trying to front load things a little bit remind her that of course next week has very busy Monday Wednesday and Friday Monday is what eleven two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven Monday is 11 games Wednesday is 12 Friday is also 12 and Sunday is 10 so you might be an overload mode potentially all of those days hopefully and as few of them as humanly possible  but that is going to color a bit how we plan towards next week on all of this stuff  worst schedules from today is a pretty easy one  you really have two teams  like baby shout out to a fourth  but the worst schedule starting today belong to the Charlotte Hornets and the Memphis Grizzlies each of those teams have but one game the rest of this week  so you know the whole one in four situation the Hornets play on Saturday and then they do go on Monday of next week so you know at least they get next week started properly the Grizzlies play tomorrow so if you really wanted to you could try to hang on to your Griz for one more day and then abandoned ship on Saturday neither of these teams has what you'd call sort of a traditionally horrendous schedule each of them I believe may look back up at Charlotte just to make sure yeah they each have three games over the next seven days so it's not that it gets great after the one game over four days to finish this week but it does go back to being pretty average meaning  if you extend any farther than four days they're schedule kind of moves back above the threshold typically the threshold that I like talk about on this show where you want to get off of a player  is someone who has fewer than 30% games per day over some length of time  so one game over three days not quite enough one game over four okay 25% that's below that 30% threshold two games over 7  Monica get out of the way two over six 33% that's borderline  it's bad and obviously the longer you go you move that number up like if three games over nine days is still 33% but it's quite bad because you'll find a lot of teams that maybe even have it as many as six games over nine days  but in the short ones when you talk about two three four games or days excuse me 30% or lower is kind of your threshold there  so one game over 4 One game over 5 those are the ones where you need to have your cutoffs two over seven as you get beyond that you need to raise the threshold a little bit probably above 30% more like 33 to 35% the longer you go  for a long stream this is so that's something to keep in the back of your mind so those are the teams where you're looking at possible drops  for Memphis it's a hard one because all of us in guys actually seem like they're getting minutes but we don't know if the starters are going to play in the game tomorrow so you almost you almost can't abandon your Grizzlies like GG Jackson putting up these big numbers lately and San Diego Thomas putting up these big numbers lately and you got JJ and Bain back lately  contracts been good canard's been out so he's probably already dropped Charlotte I think is probably the easier one here you should have dropped your home at home it's your Hornets a while ago because they've had a terrible schedule since  yesterday  sorry red bad schedule all week but like you could have made it through Tuesday one game over five days to finish the week is brutal  if you somehow managed to not do anything with your horny yesterday I don't know why you're doing it today you needed to make that movie yes today because you got a lot of players left that had three games in the week where you could have moved off your Hornet to do that so there really isn't all that much you should be doing today from a drop standpoint unless you're dealing with an injury someone like a Jalen Johnson who just got ruled out for a full week if you're in your playoffs you can't sit on 0's for a week and so if you can't stash him on an injured slot you got to move off Jordan Clarkson's been out for a while now he's someone that needs to get dropped tyus Jones needs to get dropped there's a lot of guys out there that are injured for a week or more that need to get dropped that aren't frankly top whatever high enough to sit on them like a Donovan Mitchell first rounder you can't drop a first round are you find a way to stash him and then anybody else that gets hurt that's the guy that gets thrown out to the waste basket  okay so now you know who to drop basically injured players pretty much injured players only because you should have already dropped your hornets and The Grizzlies  like you might as well just make it through tomorrow because the players are holding on to are probably pretty decent who do you pick up  there's one team  one and their way out ahead of everybody  and it's the New Orleans Pelicans  they have the best schedule not just for the remainder of this week but all so all the way through Saturday of next week and you're like Dan what the crap are you talking about they only have a three game week next week ah but they play on all of the low traffic days they call them quality days because those are the ones where you're not an overload mode  if you look at your schedule for next week right now there's a high probability that if you haven't done any streaming yet you have an reconfigured you probably have too many guys going on at least Wednesday and Friday possibly Monday also I'm going to doubtful Sunday but you know anything's possible there  what you're able to do then and you could look at your roster and be like oh like got all these games played  but you could take your worst player that's an overload on Monday or just Wednesday and Friday  and turn them into a pelican where you can use all three games  the Bucks by the way all so do this next week but they only have two games the rest of this week  so Pelicans would be the preferred one  I would argue the Pelicans probably also have more options to stream with the Bucks  I don't know that there's anybody on that team that's sitting on the wire that's streamable unless somebody dropped Malik Beasley because he's been kind of up and down and you know when it looked like the team was getting healthy it looked like he was going to turn into a turd and he will and he might be a turd actually all three of those games next week but  again  you're turning 0's into non-zeros but the Pelicans are your cash cow right now because you get three games in four nights to finish this week and you get three games next week that you can use all three of them  so if you have a injured player for instance but that's the that's the S one of all because then you're gaining six games played over the over the next 10 days if you have let's say you were dropping a hornet and you forgot to do it yesterday or something like that you're sitting on oh I don't know train man resilience it or something like that where you know one game over four days is just not gonna be enough  you moved to a pelican  if you're looking back at what Charlotte has next week for instance they go Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday they play on all four of the high traffic days  if this hornet  is your 10th or 11th or 12th best player  you slide up the guy behind them you know say they're your 10th bus player they had your last there were the last starter you were going to use on all four of those days are you slide your 11th best player into their slot  I don't know let's hypothetically say you're overloaded  Wednesday and Friday only  so you turn  what is a two-game week for that player in to a three game week okay so you're getting a game  I should also mention that next week if you're not in overload mode  it's almost impossible to stream  does that make sense if you're not an overload mode  whatever you do is going to pretty much tap out at a particular number you pick up a guy that's playing on the overload days you Max those out or you pick you guys picking up playing on the non overload days whatever  the teams that are going to be a huge advantage next week or the teams that have star players on those quality days because most teams next week are going to be overloaded on Wednesday and Friday and many are going to be overloaded on Monday  it depends a little bit on how many roster slots you have you know Yahoo leagues have 13 rosters slots so 11 games are going  you know odds are you're gonna be right on the borderline if you had 14 rosters slots so you have an extra player you probably are going to have enough guys playing because it's all about percentages 11 out of 15 we've done this math on the show before but I'll do it again just for the hell of it 11 out of 15 possible games at 73.3%  and you need 10 out of your 13 guys to be active that's 77%  so in a 10 game card  Yahoo 13 Rosser slots with 10 games going you're likely not going to be overloaded odds are you're on the underside of that in 11 game card so that's 11 out of 13 now uh sorry flipping that backwards in my head you need 10 guys out of 13 so you need  there the I said I spoke I spoke wrong on the math but the the idea was correct  it's not 11 out of 13 it's 11 out of 15 which is what I just said 11 out of 15 was 73%  and if you need 10 to fill your roster slot 10 out of 13 of your guys playing needs to be 77%  12 out of 15 is of course 80%  so in all likelihood you will have a maxed out Yahoo 13 Ross or slot  or on a 12 game card and an 11 game card more than 50% of the teams won't  but it does change depending on how many roster slots you have because if you only need 10 out of 14 guys to be playing at 71%  so on an 11 game card you probably will be maxed out if you have four bench slots instead of three and on and on and on and on and you guys can do the math on this all though again I butchered it the first time through hopefully it made sense the next time all of that to say  next week's a very difficult week to stream if you're in a Yahoo league with 13 starters or 10 starters three bench 13 total slots  you will likely be overloaded on Wednesday and Friday and you will likely be very close on Monday  meaning that if you pick up someone who plays Monday  you may or may not need them but if you pick up someone who plays Tuesday went Tuesday Thursday Saturday you get to use all three  also you can move off of that player on Sunday  so like with Charlotte again we're talking about this example  if you have a hornet  you gain two games the rest of this week in a 10 game stream from moving to a hornet to a pelican right now you gain two games the rest of this week and while it looks like you're actually losing a game next week four versus three Charlie you're overloaded for two of those days  so the Hornets really only have a two game week next week  that I mean maybe the guy dropping is better than like it like I said maybe it's your 10th best player so you lose a little bit there by sliding your 11th player into that tenth roster slot on Monday and on Sunday say that you lose instead of losing two games let's say you lose  like  to 1.8 or something like that by moving to a different streamer  you actually gain  a part of a game next week  because two games from your hornet  plus the difference of what you had to sacrifice in those overload days to slide your 11th guy up is about call it 2.2  versus 3 of the streamer  so over the next 10 days not only do you gain the two games this week but you probably gain a little less than one game next week all so  let's talk a little bit about which players make sense and we've done this with the Pelicans in the not that recent past actually when I think about it I think the Pelicans just had a good pickup day what like  two days ago or something like that was it that recent  I forget um whatever the case the the nice thing is we've already talked about these players  we should also talk about the Kings very briefly but for the palace it's Larry Nance Naji Marshall Jose Alvarado and then if if he was dropped you on his fell in Tunis would be edible although again all of those guys JV Nancy Marshall not so much Alvarado those three are like you know 150 to 175 range probably maybe Nancy a little bit of that because you can hunt percentages and Steeles and then Alvarado is more like a little bit deeper 150 to 200 200 plus possibly  but there are a few options on the pals these guys are probably on Waiver Wires because they're not very good fantasy wise  and then I do want to mention the king's very briefly that you know their schedule is not great  but there is it there is a certain advantage to them because they go Monday and Tuesday of next week so if you're in a Yahoo league and you might actually need one more player on a Monday because lightly more than half of you out there and you know who leaves will not be overloaded on Monday the king's go back to back to start next week  and also finish off this week with two games left there the only team left that has two games left this week and starts next week with a back-to-back Monday Tuesday so that's where it's like okay well I have a Charlotte Hornet I can go to a King to gain one game this week and icon I can also gain one game the first two days of next week so you turn two games into four in that situation  and again the hope is that you're not overloaded on Monday if you're already overloaded on Monday that's not really move that makes a ton of sense you gain one game over six days not a good enough ratio in my form of long streaming we want to try to game as as close to two games over a long stream as is humanly possible preferably never doing something for shorter than a four-game span  so that'd be like Charlotte to Sacramento  Dallas to Sacramento is a team I didn't really mention everybody on Twitter was eating me alive because I was like you didn't they didn't mention Dallas in your Tweet as a team with the bad schedule yeah they have a bad schedule but they played a night so it's absolutely no reason to move off of your Maverick now because it's not like you had who is even like you didn't pick up  Derek Jones junior did you  I hope not  we're talking about a guy like a Daniel Gafford right now he's been great but they have three days off after today  can you hold someone like that for three days maybe maybe their schedule is a little easier to deal with again because they play today and then you're like look I got no games the rest this week so if your season's over you obviously can drop any Maverick including Luka and Kyrie and if your season continues you can kind of wait it out a little bit  um you know how many options for a weekend back-to-back in fact I don't know that there are any weekend back-to-back so you know if you're gonna move off a Maverick you should probably do it after today try to squeeze two games out the rest of this week but also bear in mind Dallas does start next week with the back to back so you know your situation better than I do if you're in a tight battle and yeah you'd have to abandon ship but again you're not gonna do anything today so why would I talk about it today  sorry folks that wanted me to talk about the Mavericks their schedule doesn't get crappy until tomorrow  at least compared to these other ones  click check at the chat room who's got a streaming question before Dan goes to get a haircut that boo Dan three games of Naji Marshall or one game of Desmond Bane I think you gotta go martial because there's actually no guarantee that Bain even plays against the tanking San Antonio Spurs  can't take that 0 you could wait well let's see which game is Memphis tomorrow you could wait till tomorrow and then potentially swap him for somebody who has two games if Bane doesn't play  you may be lose out on a little bit that way but at least you have an opportunity to perhaps hang on to Desmond Bane if your season continues into next week because he's likely gonna play in all three games next week that's probably what I would do there hang on wait till you get the injury report tomorrow and then if he's out tomorrow then you got to go get somebody playing two games to make sure your season doesn't end  Kobe white or Payton Pritchard he's got to be prichard's been out  are you can concerned about shohei ohtani I am  I mean sort of  I think there's a chance he gets suspended for this but I don't think there's I don't think he's gonna get kicked out of baseball or anything like that  I also think baseball wants to keep showing at all costs so I think they were probably be as this investigation goes or probably some kind of punishment and then they'll make sure that he gets back into it my assessment based on what I've read so far is that he probably was trying to help out his buddy and didn't realize that helping out his buddy is all so illegal and that's gonna be the oh whoops kind of thing and then he's gonna get dinged for doing something stupid but not a like it's illegal and stupid but not purposefully it's like the if you commit a crime but you don't know you're committing a crime it's still a crime but folks tend to be a little bit more lenient with you  you know like oops I wasn't supposed to jaywalk there oops I wasn't supposed to help my friend cover a gambling debt with an illegal Orange County bookie  but I don't think he was personally betting  so they'll find a way to I think they'll find a way to punish him I just don't know exactly how much and honestly like  this is the year he can't pitch either so if this season goes up in flames  we'll see  do I drop keonte George after today for Payton Pritchard Delano Banton someone like that um  I mean it really kind of depends on how tight your battle is because George does have one more game the final three days this week Portland has two  and because my brain is on the fritz area forgot the name was Richard has two  yeah I mean if you're if you're if your battle is super close then yes you'd go to Prichard but  I'd love to figure out someone else to drop because keonte puts up some pretty good numbers right now  or Taylor Hendricks two games if we're comparing him to Naji Marshall with three if that's what you're going for I'd probably go with the guy with three games but again I think I think you try to wait on beIN coming back to that question is lamelo droppable if I need a spot to stream yeah I didn't drop over for weeks I don't think that dudes playing this year  dog tell me will Nance play all three games guarantee me that at once oh I don't know so he missed the last back-to-back but it was listed as an illness so I don't think it was a rest day  I think Nance plays the back-to-back  but I only am like 65% confident in that  Murphy question mark  ifremer he's available then hell yeah that's an amazing player to have for the next 10 days  beautiful player I'm very jealous of anybody that has Trey Murphy over the next 10 days  hey Dan considering dropping Bane and adding Pritchard oh so this question has come up a couple of times so I I still think that you hold on to Tomorrow there's no reason to do a Pritchard move today because they're not playing today hold on Wayne until tomorrow find out if Bane is playing or not and if he's out and you're getting a goose egg then yeah you switch to Pritchard you get the two gamer but if Bane is in tomorrow then you can hold through that ball game there's no rush on this one  hey Dan how long do you go for my playoffs starting next week yeah we're gonna try to do these two days basically until  the end of the season maybe not the last couple of days I mean that last last weekend all so I will not have a show like this on Saturday my older kid has a little league game at 8 in the freaking morning so we gotta get out of here like 7:15  God help me there's no time to get them all ready for little league and do a show and my little one turns four this weekend so his birthday party is like right after the Little League games I'm just gone all damn day so tomorrow we're gonna go Friday show that's a streamer level show it's gonna cover Saturday as well we'll do a little back-to-back there and then someday Sunday hopefully we can kind of loop back around and get back into the mix  nerdy nerd says I know where to find you Dan yeah probably  should I pick up Deuce McBride not until we know if he's starting or not and plus the Knicks have two games left this week and then they go all the overload days next week so  depends on the drop a little bit also a little worried that a Chua ends up playing big minutes in one of those games and McBride doesn't  should I drop Daniel Gafford for Prichard not today man Gafford plays tonight  after tonight  if you're in a dog fight then yes  thank you for the birthday wishes for my little dude  I will shortly have a 7 and a four year old and and why does Dan wear a hat because his kids are Expediting male pattern baldness dose McBride Larry Nance day Ron Sharpe question mark well Nancy has three games the rest this week so he has a leg up on the other dudes if klaxon gets ruled out and he was questionable with an illness last night checked and I don't think anything's happened in the last half hours so  so Nance for the three games  and then if klaxon is out I probably go Sharp  but again you know the McBride thing between between sharp and McBride it's really gonna come down to weather McBride is starting with a claxton's out so I can't really make a call on those guys yet but Nance has my sort of the preferred slot in the hopes that he plays all three ball games hopefully that was useful all right I gotta go get a haircut it's true set your lineups set it forget it there's nothing more you can do now you've made your moves we'll be back at you with a two for tomorrow I'm at to investor over on Twitter if you're watching there just hit follow anywhere else please do subscribe and frankly if you're watching on Twitter come over to YouTube subscribe there or iTunes or Spotify or something cast or whatever nonsense is a 1000 ways you can take in a pod those of you listening non-video believe it or not I've said this before I'm sort of pull back the curtain a little those advertisements pay more than YouTube and if you guys know it's CPM is but that's how we get paid in ad dollars  it has to do with amount of money that's generated per thousand downloads it's much higher for the non-video  area for whatever reason that's just the way it's built right now YouTube is low and traditional pod is like four to five times more so if you have an opportunity to download and listen to the show in the traditional format to actually much help more helpful to us here but I'm gonna keep doing these these live ones I think they're fun I think it's a nice way to continue to kind of grow our YouTube spread the word whatever and I'm grateful to all of you guys no matter how you take in the show hugs and kisses question from Dave on the way how do I hold Gafford or Claxton all the way into next week um  I'd rather have Gafford because he plays on Tuesday so you get one extra possible game on kind of what you'd call it overload day between the two guys if you're just like okay I don't have to worry about anything else then claxton's better  and he has an extra game  between now and the end of next week after does five Claxton as six  it's kind of a lot of things that go into this decision for the rest of this week the answer is obviously Nick klaxon for next week it's probably Gafford because of scheduling but there's no there's no perfect solution to that one  see you guys tomorrow  unlock going on tomorrow  a lot of  riding  this has been a hoop Bowl presentation
