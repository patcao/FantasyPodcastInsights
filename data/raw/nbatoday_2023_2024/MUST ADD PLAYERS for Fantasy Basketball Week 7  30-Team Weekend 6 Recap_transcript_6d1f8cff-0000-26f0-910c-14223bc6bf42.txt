welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I don't need to wait till the end of the song I can start talking whatever the hell I want  it's my damn show I'll do what I want  sort of the Eric Cartman school of thought there I am currently trying to figure out what software is auto adjusting my microphone volume because I have that turned off in streamyard  honest to goodness I could not tell you at this point it's happening something's doing it um  but I don't know why and I can keep trying to like bring it up bring it down but eventually the damn computer is going to decide how loud it wants me to be and we're just gonna I guess have to be okay with that so anyway what's up everybody Welcome to week a weird week week seven and the first ever in season tournament quarter and semifinal round that will have that part of a fantasy season it's created a pardon my slightly adjusted cursing here but a real cluster  not gonna say you know I'm not gonna say it three O'Connor called  warmer it's created a real cluster mess for Fantasy purposes streaming is going to be exceptionally odd  we will have a show later on today timing of it might be a little bit goofball my kid has a doctor's appointment because you know everything my life revolves around trying to figure out where the hell my two kids are at any given moment normally it's around 2:00 Pacific time I guess is that it'll run a little bit later today but Derek and I Derek ball we'll break down the goofball we get ahead this show is all about who you're adding for longer than today and tomorrow basically these are not ads we're gonna talk about for specifically the n Season tournament what kind of talk about each team and where they fit but it's a full weekend recap well hit the waiver wire we'll find all the good stuff and we'll do that here at a matter of seconds but before we do that I want to remind everybody you're watching or listening to Fantasy NBA Today sports presentation thank you everybody for watching and listening and thank you for liking and subscribing and dropping those five star reviews the continued growth of the podcast has been amazing borderline various the YouTube side the damage we've been able to do over there and just a matter of like two months really has been outstanding so thank you everybody that's hit a like button everybody that's hit a subscribe button you guys are powering this locomotive right now I am Dan Vespers over on social at Dan best verse I know there's not going to be a ton to do the next two days with just four games over these two but there's always something and planting this week is certainly a big part of it but let's go ahead and just Dive Right In I think that's enough show opening humor  as I once again stress about the fact that Windows update messed up some of my settings and I had to run the show about seven minutes later than I wanted to but luckily these two window updates window updates we Windows updates happened within like a week of each other so I remembered exactly the changes I needed to make so this one only took seriously like five or six minutes from me to fix but that's still dumb stop doing it to me windows  let's do Saturday and Saturday was a heavy load because there was nothing on Sunday everybody had the day off leading up to this quarter-final starter day here on Monday a couple of games tonight couple of games tomorrow so they wanted to get almost all of the teams in on Saturday not everybody I think it was a 12 oh count it right here on the screen what are the five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve game Saturday so she'll knock us through the vast majority 80% of the league and yeah let's just talk about it Warriors got a big on the Clippers Clippers came back and beat them in this one there aren't that many things to talk about on the Clipper side other than sort of the is it a Buy Low is it a sell High what what is the actual thing happening right here  interestingly Kawhi Leonard and Paul George are now in a dead heat 19 and 20 in nine cat after PG's very fast start and kawaiis sort of fine but not outstanding beginning they're about to be two ships kind of passing in the night and then James Harden who I think we can all agree is been kind of boring  in his time with the Clippers so far boring James Harden is still number 34 per game in nine cat and he's played in you know the last 14 in a row for the clubs which all ready he's ahead of a number of players and fantasy with just 14 games under his belt everybody's having these panic attacks over James Harden but he just gonna get better every week 21 points 9 assists in this ball game made his five free throws  he's on his way I believe to being a second rounder  he's a third rounder right now I don't think we're exactly like leaping way out on a limb to say he could get up another 10 ranks lots and he's a guy that was getting drafted I think I got him near 60 in one of my leeks and there's this whole thing and I know I go into it about drafting guys that are injured to start the year but I do feel like that was kind of a different scenario  like you know he was gonna have to get moved quickly because  the disaster it was creating in Philadelphia and then yeah you know he wasn't gonna be like a top 12 guy in clippertown because there's just too many guys there but you knew he was going to be at worst like where he is now 30 something  so hell yeah I took him in the 60s and a few spots and I don't regret it  how about the Warriors side well know Andrew Wiggins he was still dealing with the after effects of matching his finger in a car door she good Lord Chris Paul was out Gary Payton is out for a while cb3 might be back this week they said his little nerve compression thing was day-to-day  he is also very old so don't be too surprised if it takes longer than a day or two and maybe more like a week or two but hey maybe we get good news before their game on Wednesday either way  based on what we saw in this particular one ball game Moses Moody filled in for Wiggins  and kind of Peyton together and ended up playing 32 minutes he was excellent getting to the free throw line was certainly the biggest part of it going 9 of 10 at the foul line 20 215 and 2 with a couple of steals and a couple of Threes is a really nice fantasy line and if we can and Payton are both out again I think you probably have a reasonable argument for playing Moses moody in their next ball game also notable Brandon poem played 36 and a half minutes off the bench those are like all of the Chris Paul minutes plus a few of those Gary Payton minutes  because Corey Joseph is terrible he's been bad for a long time but now he's also old and the Warriors love pods he he's like the ultimate hustle guy  I'm I'd be a little bit nervous if any of those three guys come back because if we get comes back that pushes Moody to the bench and then Moody takes some of those  more of those I guess Payton bench it's supposed to just soaking up the Ender Wiggins ones but if all three guys are out again on Wednesday and it does seem like Payton's gonna be out a little bit longer Wiggins and Chris Paul of the guys that are day-to-day  then maybe you look at both  Minnesota with the win at Charlotte Minnesota did it without Anthony Edwards and without Jaden McDaniels  and nickeil Alexander Walker was a huge disappointment there's no way around that I thought he was gonna have another nice I mean he was a he had a huge fill in game the day before this was a  I don't know that I was necessarily expecting huge but I was certainly expecting decent and we didn't even get that he only took five shots in 30 minutes on the court because largely because Nas read is starting to get cooking and you do cat would take a bunch of shots because with Anthony Edwards how cats got to be kind of the focal point on offense but then nazreen has been heating up again and that's been the story of his year he got off to a really hot start his minutes were better than expected to start the season then they collapsed for a bit now they're better for a couple of days he's at 114 on the year we all love nasri Fantasy game he only needs 22 23 minutes to be a normal 12 team start guy  and it does kind of feel like with Edwards out he can get those 22 or 23 minutes he played 24 and a half and this one not that he's taking those minute specifically but they just sort of knee a little bit more scoring sock and that's what he can do  but again you kind of have to wait and see because Minnesota doesn't play until Wednesday and we're could be back doesn't seem like McDaniels is all that close yet  but if Anthony Edwards is back in there I think you kind of have to shy away from any of these streamers  all of that to say  play it by ear  if we hear anything about Edwards being doubtful or whatever in the next day day and a half then you pick up nasri kind of ahead of time but I don't know that I expect that to happen Charlotte's side uh still it'll be no lamelo ball for at least a few more weeks here Brandon Miller came back for this one and was decent not spectacular but he was fine miles Bridges continues to take a lot of shots as does Terry Rozier who is admittedly playing we have Terry roses there's some credit he was really bad at point guard last year he's been much better in his couple of fill in game so far this season  the question marks I think you're starting miles Bridges you're obviously starting Terry was here you're almost definitely starting  I mean you haven't really started Mark Williams and I wasn't as good in this one he fouled out and you're probably starting brain in Miller because his usage has gone up enough with lamelo ball out that he has been playable the guys that I think have been kind of coin flippy lately RPG Washington and Gordon Hayward  and PJ's been pretty good last couple of ball games all the sum of that I think it's worth pointing out has been because his defensive stats have been higher  and he's not bad defensively he's you know historically like kind of middling last year he was actually kind of pretty good 32 and a half minutes it's a game average about two defensive stats and that's something you could kind of see repeat if his minutes get back up into the 30s here with the with the Mellow ball being out but he's also been a low fuel goal percent guy that hurts free throw percent is not good that all so hurts a little bit still the fact that he can get you steals blocks boards  some scoring some threes you kind of Overlook the other stuff a little bit  so I'm gonna say yes on PJ and I think I'm also gonna say yes on Gordon Hayward who's bounced around a lot he got off to a really fast start this year and then went through a prolonged slump but 2217 is last two ballgames he's heating up again if you want to talk about like what he's been able to do shooting wise  my fear of course on the Gordon Hayward front is  is this all tied to better shooting if he goes cold again from the field like he did for previously the previous two weeks he was ice cold  is there going to be enough right now and I feel like with lamelo out there should be enough assists and rebounds to kind of float things but he's not a defensive stat guy he got off to a weirdly strong defensive stats start you know those numbers were gonna come down he doesn't hit that many three pointers so the floor and we saw last year the floor can come out pretty quick for Hayward um if the other stuff isn't working so I think he's probably a yes right now in most formats but I would also fully understand if you were just like ah  floor is coming out I don't really want to worry about it and then didn't do it  or Lando lost at Brooklyn the winning streak snapped for a magic team that was very hot coming into this ball game but no one was as hot as Mikhail bridges in this one he scored 42 points I think he had 30 something in the first half of them remembering right  but quickly let's talk about Orlando Cole Anthony bounced back Jalen Suggs had a rare off game he's been more than good enough to stay on your team he's number 75 on the year Cole Anthony had one very bad game but then seeing the bounce back I think was enough evidence for me to just say keep playing him even if he was part of units I mean everybody got trounced on that side gold bats a had some injury stuff early I think he I can't remember what it was he came back from it but the team was getting throttled so moving or saw a little bit of a spike in minutes there  I think you still if you're streaming a center and you're hoping for like top 15 to 95 range stuff goes still the guy between those two dudes and then really like the fact that even a couple of guys on Orlando survived this blowout was a small positive at least from a fantasy standpoint  for Brooklyn I'm watching Spencer Dinwiddie and he's still doing fine I am admittedly a little bit concerned about what cam Thomas's return is going to do to Dinwiddie long-term  now the fact that he's still got 15 shots up that's a good sign the previous game didn't really still had a bunch of assists all the I think Camp Thomas's minutes were were kind of still in check in that one  I just have this lingering fear within witty because he's a low field goal percent guy at times kind of close to a punt free throw or field goal guy he's you know career wise 41 in change free throw is fine but he's not really a positive there he sits almost right around Net neutral so it's mostly threes points and assists for him because Steals and blocks are not usually all that high within witty either  so it comes down to is there enough of that  to balance out the fact that he's you know sort of a three trick pony basically  points 3 is in assists and lately the answers been yes but I don't know that it's definitely yes all year  folks picture this nightmare scenario  you're hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app

not available in all locations and that's okay you still play him and someone was like Dan you're not high enough on Spencer's Dinwiddie I mean I think I'm exactly high enough on Dinwiddie because we've watched him for a decade now he's been in the NBA for a decade and we know what he is which is a minimal defensive stats dude who is going to hurt you probably a lot in field goal percent we did have that one like partial season in Dallas where he was extra hot from the field but that's not a thing that's stuck historically he's never really had a free throw season over 82 he's had plenty of them at 879 things like that which is all just sort of fine and then you know it comes down to how many times he's gonna touch the basketball  is 14 and some odd points in six assists at enough to start him in Rodeo all the time I think the answer is no on that one head-to-head the answer is probably yes because again he's an example of a guy who is very good in a few categories and then not as strong and others and had to head that makes more sense because you might have like a punt steals team he makes a lot of sense as a punt steals guard something like that Roto though you need typically more than two or three categories this if they're only good but not great  and that's where he's been historically but let's keep it right now I think you can start him in every format while we see how this whole thing develops and then you know Ben Simmons never comes back which I still think is a distinct possibility I know they said you know he had a cortisone injection they're gonna reevaluate in two weeks I'm not all that convinced that in two weeks something is going to magically be better with him but maybe it proves me wrong  I just don't think so and that maybe that ends up being enough for Dinwiddie to stay just above the cut line obviously gonna do a lot more when other usage guys are out but they're in right now  and Dennis Smith Jr by the way had a pretty good game you can mostly ignore that so it's the usual fare  let's keep going  Cleveland beat Detroit and the poor Pistons at least they got boy on bug out of each back his minutes up to 27 and change in this one I think actually this was his return he's just gonna slowly ramp up up up up they'll probably get him in the starting lineup I would guess over Jaden Ivy but it could be Overkill and Hayes so just keep an eye on that but zdanowicz is a must roster guy because they badly need him to score because Cade Cunningham is the only other guy in the team who can reliably do it  that's kind of the only story on Detroit you know Killian Hayes is a hold right now just to see how this thing shakes out I know Jade and Ivy started in this one which I guess is better for him than the alternative but  I don't think he needs to be on rosters and then with Cleveland it's you know nothing really Isaac Coral had a four Steel game but you're not gonna buy in on that Max Dr Spruce scored 22 again man like at this point you kind of just have to assume he's like a top 75 or guy or better and is it 58 right now  did not see that coming but I continued to ride the wave Pelicans lost at Chicago the Bulls who have basically pulled the plug on Zach LaVine are suddenly playing like they care about each other they're now six and six at a home which I guess is you know better than the alternative  they've won two games in a row ladies and gentlemen we'll talk about the Bulls in a second first things first on the pills side  no CJ for this one because he can't fly yet I do think that's going to change at some point and presumably the not too distant future but you know if they're on the road I think we have to assume he's out for now which meant that Dyson Daniels is semi streamable although it now seems much more clear that with Alvarado around and Jordan Hawkins both guys kind of  all three of those guys I guess kind of soaking up similar minutes that there's probably no obvious stream  that's where you're at with the pals herb Jones is bounced back nicely at a couple of LOL games and people were like should I move on now I'm like what are you talking about guys good fantasy players have good and bad stretches only the great ones really have like good stretches and then bad game  the best players have individual Bad Games everybody else in fantasy has bad stretches  I need folks to Not freak out when someone has two or three quiet games in a row  meanwhile over on the bull side Kobe wide continues to be the ultimate in fill-in maximize play he's top 50 over the last two weeks obviously buttressed a bit by this colossal ball game but he's getting everything he can handle with Zach Levine out Alex Caruso left this ball game part way through he's been nursing a sore toe the entire season to this point  if and we saw this before if both Levine and Caruso are out not only can you stay stream Kobe white who by the way is he's a hold because Zach Williams get moved at some point but you can also stream Iota sunu who is less of a stash I think he's the stash in case Demar and Levine get moved or Caruso and Levine and even if it's just Caruso I don't know that that's enough extra usage on the plate for the Sumo Patrick Williams was decent enough in this ball game again all so he's a guy that badly needed a little uptick in usage which is again the kind of stuff you get when Levine is out when to Mars is out the Bulls still kind of stash City over there if you have room I did stash Patrick Williams in one spot where I was like you know what I could use a little like three steals blocks couple of boards dudes probably not gonna punish my percentage is too much although  he did go one for four at the free throw line and this particular ball game  but you guys I think know at this point we're kind of on rinse repeat with Chicago and the only question is is Alex Caruso's starting in any individual game  because he's very much a questionable every night dude  a lot of teams seem to be more interested in Caruso than they are in Levine we've heard more about tomorrow than Levine then Demar said he wanted to go play New York and blah blah blah we'll see I'll be topping turned an ankle as you guys watching can see on your screen but they said two really nice ball games in a row some of that's because Jalen Smith is out some of it's because toppin has been extraordinarily hot  he makes sense by the way as a really interesting stream this week if you actually plays in their ballgame it also didn't hurt any of these guys that Tyreese Halliburton was out so there was just a lot of usage to go around Bruce Brown scored 30 damn points in this ball game TJ McConnell at a 20 and 11 double double and he's always a monster in fantasy when he gets 20 some odd minutes and now heart also at 11 assisted he doesn't have a particularly great Fantasy game  I think Tyreese Halliburton will be back for their play in game which I believe is actually tonight aren't they tonight and not tomorrow  you guys can catch me on this yeah Boston Indies tonight and then New Orleans Sacramento tonight those are the  two three matchups in each side I don't remember who the hell can remember these things  either way  they're playing tonight I think he'll be back I haven't seen anything about it in either direction so far yet today they're really hasn't been any news I think he's questionable still everybody's got this this flu thing going around and if it's anything like what I had the entire damn month of November I feel quite bad for these players because that thing sucked but I don't know I I still think halliburton's gonna play again I have no reason to assume that's true but if he's not and Topping does he's a go TJ McConnell would be playable streamable and I had to head side you can stream practically the whole damn roster Roto side top and I think McConnell this is again of halliburton's out  definitely the usual guys healed Brown Myles Turner I don't know about going any farther on the Roadhouse side but again Head to Head you could almost dream the whole damn team of Halliburton misses it if albertans in there you're not streaming guys like nem hard and McConnell unless you're really hard up for adding games to your week niece Smith kind of in that same boat if a little bit higher  Josh Richardson and he would Highsmith left the Heat's last ball game again YouTube where you can see on your screen as I highlight it Richardson heard his knee Heisman his lower back  they don't play until Wednesday so we won't probably have an update on them today but with all of those guys out that just again creates more opportunity because it's been kind of Jimmy Butler lately against the universe or later Robinson started for Bama oh he'd be interesting if fam missed their next game on Wednesday but again We're Not Gonna Know Duncan Robinson no relation is an easy stream for Tyler hero he basically has been the whole time heroes been out Kyle Lowry I met jacquez slowed down in this ball game but they be streamable if hero and if Richardson are both out that just makes it even a little bit of an easier call and that's probably about as far as you go with Miami but again we need more info before we can make a call on it  everybody was like the Bucks are done the Bucks are done well they're 14 and six guys it seems the Bucks are fine  the beat the Hawks which you know it's not like a big old feather in the Capitol is nine and ten Atlanta missing Jalen Johnson these days but at least four fantasy purposes that means Sadiq bake and just keeps and along no other notes on this game OK Google play 27 minutes here and click appellate played 30 so they went big and poor old Kong will we got stuck dealing with a lot of Giannis which meant not much fantasy stuff and he's not gonna do as much if he's tasked with playing power forward but he still hold Milwaukee no real adjustment Bobby Portis did double double but I mean his is like the ultimate two category guy 15 and 11 with basically nothing else Brook Lopez got his four blocks even if he missed a couple of shots and then Malik Beasley is just freaking pounding right now with no Crowder and Chris Middleton still on a time limit  crazy  and for those that are wondering where is Damian Lillard ranked right now the answer is 21 and presumably that field goal percent will continue to tick up from 43 we think I still have him climbing into the early teens well I guess see how that goes  oh this is a big Saturday in it Memphis at Phoenix JJJ 379 and 2 with a steal a little block obviously we still want more Steals and more blocks but he's worked his way back up remember we had that bottoming out game where he fell outside the top 100 he's back up to number 84 now which again not at all what you wanted but certainly a step in the right direction over his last couple  gonna be a Harder by low after scoring 37 points still think of you can you should I'm holding Santi aldama three steals a block he was in there for 31 minutes that's usually enough for him to have fantasy value not adding Vince Williams I didn't add David Roddy last week I foolishly picked up Derek Rose for one ball game but we do he wasn't going to play in the second half of the back to back and then Jalen Noel who played who started at point guard for Derek Rose who started a point guard for Marcus Smart who started a point guard for John Morant yeah we're way down the board is usually a guy that you can count on to get you some threes but he couldn't shoot the ball  and presumably rows will be the guy that starts there in the next one so that's where you're at with Memphis  Devin Booker was back for Phoenix and he and Kevin Durant are just gonna keep destroying teams and tell Bradley Beal comes back and then they'll continue to destroy just not at quite the same clip they're out right now meanwhile know Eric Gordon for this one that meant a little bit more to do  for  uh I was gonna say Joshua kogi but he only took two shots kind of Grace and Alan he only took four shots it was pretty much just the three guys and basically I'm not streaming anybody on this team unless two of the main stars are out and I'm not talking about nurkic there so leave the sun's alone  Thunder beat Dallas is one of the weirdest games in the history of basketball the Mavericks went on a 30 to nothing run and lost  how's that even possible  me while Luka doncic played 46 of the 48 of available minutes I think they figured out we got this game and then we're off Sunday Monday and Tuesday so  you know blow it out not much really to speak of on the Thunder side Jalen Williams continues to get his things gone we still haven't seen the big steals numbers from Williams and that'll be the thing that really gets him cooking  so if you can buy low you still should I just don't know that you can after a pretty big ball game like this one  Chad's been awesome Shay finally had kind of a quiet ball game still had five steals in it anyway but certainly the big story here is for one Dallas had a lot of guys out know Tim Hardaway Jr know Kyrie Irving for this ball game Grant Williams got hurt partway through this ball game  and so that meant and don't worry we'll talk about Derek Lively again but it also meant that Derek Jones kind of had no excuse and same with Seth Curry but to go out there and get a bunch of shots up however I know we talked about how there hasn't been a whole lot of news breaking today one hour ago Dallas did drop their injury report Kyrie Irving practiced so he's I would assume likely to play in their next game on Wednesday and that to me is enough to say I can't take the plunge on these replacement guys because you throw Kyrie back in the mix and the shots for Jones and Curry basically disappear not entirely but basically  and then Derek Lively someone we've been talking about needing to be rostered for a few weeks now basically as soon as we saw that in 24 minutes a game he's a top 100 play that's a guy that you're like oh this is the guy that they're like trying to make part of everything that they're doing going forward and so we want to make sure that we're there for it he's now a number 87 in 25 minutes per game and every minute he goes up he's gonna move somewhere between six and 10 ranks slots at least until he gets up into the part where it's sort of harder to jump spots on the board but he's a monster play in every format and someone was like Dan don't you think you're getting out in front of yourself after one big ball game no man we've been talking about this for two to three weeks  you can the writings on the wall with this dude and it's good riding is bad writing on the wall for everybody else the only thing that could throw even the tiniest pickup into the Derek Lively experience is if Maxi KLA shows up doesn't get hurt and Jason kids like  every once in a while I'm gonna go floor space her  because it could happen  but I just like there's absolutely no reason why he shouldn't be on teams right now hey before we talk Portland Utah now that a lot of you guys have

you guys that we add is just more people helping each other so go hang with us there I'm gonna leave that link up on the board  now we'll talk Portland Utah Jeremy Grant took a shot to the head in this ball game interestingly I was looking at the Yahoo blurbs which I think are provided by Rotoworld and they didn't have it  they didn't mention that they were just like oh Grant had a bad ball game bad ball game  okay admittedly he was having a bad ball game even before the head injury but that's the reason he didn't finish this thing  hopefully it's not a concussion we'll find out soon enough I don't think there's been an update since  if he's out  first of all my teeth I will picked up most of those minutes  and if someone could guarantee me that Bible was going to play 30 minutes a game he would be a mustad play in every format because in 30 minutes a game he can probably get you three or more defensive stats even if he almost does nothing else which is basically what he did here he played 3033 minutes I'm rounding and had six points 3 boards and two assists and you're like oh my God damn you're gonna put that dude on my team yeah well two threes a steal and two blocks if you average two threes a steal and two blocks and you do almost nothing else you're basically still near a top 100 guy and then if you just get anything just be on the board in points boards and assists again this 621 whatever  that's actually enough believe it or not  because it a two game week out of this dude  can getting getting you six defensive stats potentially  that's League winning stuff  or weak winning stuff  but I don't know that anybody can guarantee me he's gonna get 30 minutes of ball game because scoot could soak up some of those minutes you can see Barry Walker pick up some of those minutes it's not a promise  but I think if we see it in the first game with Grant out which I'm gonna assume grants missing a ball game they're not gonna push him here with the  I can concussions you just you know don't want to score around and Portland's not exactly making a playoff push  also of note in addition to tracking Bible  Shane sharp has huge efficiency issues but with both Simon's and now all so probably Grant out he almost has no choice but to take so many shots that he can overwhelm that number because like right now Shane sharp is number 150 taking 15 shots a game because field goal percent has been crap his turnovers have been really high  I kind of don't care about the field goal turnover thing if suddenly they're just like okay like shading you're gonna have to play he's playing 37 minutes a game right now and they're just like oh by the way you played 43 in this one oh you gotta play 40 and we need you to take at least 18 shots a game I kind of don't care about the inefficiency in that spot  then he's a Go in all formats  to Monte Cara had five defensive stats but I'm going to need to see more than that and the Malcolm Brogden is an obvious start as his DeAndre Aiden and that's your update on the Blazers Utah's a little screwball I mean we need to see Larry Martin and get his self back into this thing because Utah's generally kind of bad without him John Collins had a nice one that's good to see he's gonna bounce around probably near the edge of the top 100 probably the whole season based on whether he's had one or two good ball games or one or two bad ones recently but he should stay on rosters  you're ignoring Horton Tucker you're likely ignoring Omar you're too bad although it's harder to do after a 15 rebound game and frankly you know the team just played better in the lineup where he was on the court but at some point here in the next week or two Walker Kessler is going to overtake him so don't worry too much about that Colin Sexton is getting more run with Jordan Clarkson out he's a points only stream and then Simona fontecchio is your I need a couple of defensive stats and a three-pointer but I don't know that I can trust him to do anything else fill in for Lowry marketing  and I have the exact same take on keonte George today as I did all of last week I said it on almost every single show last week he's a roto drop  his percentages and turnovers are going to be too rough he's a head-to-head long term stash and you just kind of have to hope you catch him on a week whereas percentages or not garbage because you know 216 and six that's not nice that's something you want but no defensive stats bad feel goal bad for you throw bad turnover  that's more damage than good  and people have a hard time visualizing this because they're like whoa 216 and 6 that seems really good you're actually better off starting somebody who had like 143 and three plus a steel plus a block and didn't hurt your percentage is on any given day it's very hard to picture this because those numbers seem big but they're not even close to big enough to counterweight the damage he was doing in the other categories and that's why he's a long-term had to head play and for Rodeo honestly I don't have enough space in my teams to just sit on him indefinitely so I mean go back out of the wire  Sacramento Bee Denver 123 117 you know it's funny as I handicapped this ball game and I had the Kings minus 4 and I put that out on Twitter along with Pacers and Clippers who didn't cover and now looking back I don't remember why I ended up on the Kings because I sort of like dumped the info after I after I was done with it everything is compartmentalized in my brain once I'm done with something I just move on from it it ended up being a smart play but I don't remember how I got there  this is the whole like Dan what's going on with your head right now thing  anyway Reggie Jackson played for Jamal Murray who came back for one ball game but then turned in ankle I assuming he'll be back relatively soon it didn't seem like a huge deal right Jackson is a head-to-head streamable guy and verse not in the play in or the IST so you know doing anything right now  typically he's not good enough in nine cat Rodeo just to keep that in the back of your mind  Aaron Gordon is back also by the way hasn't been a 9 cat Road oh guy much more head-to-head you know punt free throw type but no huge changes on Denver and all though okay so Sacramento actually is experiencing a small change right now and that small change is a feller named Malik monk who at the beginning of this year I was like look I I want to have them on my roster can I I'm gonna repeat myself because sometimes you guys don't remember what I've said I said as long as Malik monk is stuck in the 22 minute range when Darren Fox is healthy he can't be on rosters but lately even with Fox around the last five ball games he's played 26 30 26 28 and 28 again  and my estimation does that make him a guaranteed rest of season play um  no not necessarily  but I think it's enough to make sure that he's on your team  okay that's that's all it really means to me because he's number one 21 overall right now in 24 and a half minutes for ball game which basically tells us that unless there's a star like a hard tapering of his per game production if he's playing 26 minutes or more he's a nine cat 12 Team all format startable guy and that's where he's at the last week and change  now yes he's also run hot he's shooting 54% from the field and these made something like you know 13 or 14 free throws in a row and these are things that are not going to stay long term so that's why over the last week and change he's in the top 60 but even if you account for the field goal percent coming way down and the free throw percent which is going to be good for him coming down a little bit that's still puts him inside the top 100  so Malik Monk Is your and kind of buried the lead a little bit here he's definitely the ad of the day or the ad of the weekend because now he's cleared that border  and I sat on him I'll even I sat on him in one or two head to head League's because I kind of liked what he was doing in points and assists and free throw percent in head-to-head and I was like you know what these are good enough and I like I don't need to be good in all nine things to win this head League I think he's really now crossed the line for Roto as well that's probably the big news there because he was heavily rostered it had formats and not that heavily roster and Rodeo and now that was accurate up until about a week ago but now it's all formats and then the Lakers beat the Rockets this game had some drama email doca and LeBron James got into a little bit of a thing where udoka was Colin LeBron a b word and LeBron was like come on man don't throw that word around because LeBron's a family man damn it and udoka has shown himself to not be a family man you know what I'm talking about anyway fantasy wise really nothing you know Jalen green is a nine cat disaster Dillon Brooks came back to Earth Alpine took 25 shots in this game holy moly that's a lot I don't know that having him as the exclusive shot taker into Anthony Davis was maybe the best offensive game plan here  Freddie Van fleet was probably your better game plan because the Lakers guards right now are not as good at Garden people but whatever Lakers got off to a pretty good lead this one got closer in the closing minutes if you're wondering why I don't know why Freddy 39 minutes in this game frankly but if you're wondering why you know D-Lo only had 26 and LeBron where was Braun at this one yeah he ended up at 35 so they got him until about the two three minute Mark at the end add played 37 like his knew they had a couple days off but they did they weren't like really pressing because the game was not super close in the last three minutes or you would have seen everybody with about two to three more from the regulars  speaking of the regulars the Angelo's been awesome but he's pretty much universally rostered at this point what's his rank these days  actually stop 25 over the last week good for Dlow 60 on the season that's pretty cool  obviously you're starting Dilo add Reeves Reeves had a great ball game too more so on the if you watch it as posted statistically speaking  I told you guys LeBron was going to cool that was one of the big sell highs from the last I think two sell High shows we had him on at least one of them because the thing was you knew the field goal percent wasn't going to stay at 58 with as many three pointers as he was making and now he's falling at number 29 and believe it or not I actually think there's more room to drop not that I don't love Braun he made some insane shots in this ball game and obviously the Lakers are always better when he's on the floor but he's just he's not trying to do as much this year  he's got guys like add and Reeves and d low to go shoulder a little bit of the load and so far they have  what do you do with the fringy Lakers well I don't think anything because they got Kim reddish Jarred Vanderbilt jaxson Hayes all back for this ballgame and then really hot tomorrow sounds like he could be back for the next one so you probably just leave those guys alone because frankly there's there's too many of them  let's go back to Friday which was a pretty light one and I already did some mid-show promo so we can just roll right into Friday Washington at Orlando we talked about the magic already the Wizards this ball game was closer everybody I'm a little pissed that Ty is Jones you'll still only got 26 minutes because they were good ones 13 6 and 2 steals with three three pointers that's good Bilal Cuda believe or Cooley as we've been calling him on the show shot six of seven that's why he had a good fantasy game but there's just not enough usage there to Warrant a roster spot  Gafford good kuzma good again pool not good again and then any of you who's been kind of bouncing back and forth between good and not as good he is currently at 107 which for nine cat that's a hold  people keep asking me what the hell they're supposed to do about Jordan Poole and I keep saying I told you guys not to draft him at 4:40  it was too dangerous  too much there was upside yes but there was so much downside I think we're seeing he's just he's just not a great basketball player  I do think he gets better than 200 which is where he ranked right now 39% from the field probably gets a little bit better  but he's looking like a guy who might just not be a role to play at any point this year I don't know how you can drop him because you probably drafted him in the fourth round but you can't trade him for anything  you know what I tell you this I would buy on Jordan Poole if I could get him for someone who's just like casually floating near 100  like Daddy but that's not gonna get it done like you're not gonna get him for those dudes  I don't know that I would give up anybody in that range who has some like Room to Grow maybe you could give up John Collins because he's probably never gonna be better than like number 85 this year you're not giving up much in the way of upside Bruce Brown it's kind of a low upside play in that range  Sadiq based not gonna get it done  oh who else is in there that has a shot Anthony Melton  like I do it for Melton  because Phillies gonna get crowded and they might trade for another star and so there's this possible downside built-in but I'm not I'm not giving up the upside guys now range Keegan Murray rather have Jaylen Brown obviously Drew holiday Walker Kesley these are all guys that I much prefer to have over Jordan Poole but if you can find someone in that range that's just sort of a plotter that's the guy you give up just to say hey maybe we catch lightning in a bottle with pool at some point but also maybe not  the New York knickerbockers  Josh Hart three games in a row with 30 minutes he's an ad  I don't know what to tell you guys um every time I'm ready to quit Josh Hart something happens and he gets 30 minutes of ball game he's number one 43 and 28 minutes a game some of that's because he's basically just refused to shoot the ball until three games back  but it seems like maybe he's starting to get over that hump a little bit took three shots against Detroit ten and 11 against Charlotte and Toronto that's probably the two that I'd rather look at but he's also been hot in those games so maybe that's had something to do with it  I'm fully aware that Josh Hart could play 24 minutes in the next ball game and then he'd be a drop again but I also promised you guys that if he played 30 minutes in a row for a couple of ball games I would pick him up and so now I kind of have to keep my word  even if it's gonna be boring Toronto is a zero  fantasy interest team right now everybody is doing exactly what we expected based on the first few weeks of the Year Scotty Barnes had a nice little bounce back here after he had kind of cool detach he pushed himself back up towards the end of the first round I still think he's probably more of a like 25 to 35 range dude when the whole season comes to an end but so far he's been better than that and look I was too low on him on draft day people on Twitter like dinner you just mad because you were low on him yeah I was low on on Barnes he's taking a big leap forward and I didn't have him as one of the guys  that's fine we got plenty of wins elsewhere  if you guys are wondering  like all of my roto redraft teams are dominating right now and I've done it without Scotty Barnes but yeah I wish I had him  meanwhile I feel like so much less of an idiot since Dennis Schroder cooled off he's down to number 98 on the season I like the 16th and the Seven assists that's nice I like the free throws but it really does have a little bit of that didn't witty dress Vibe of the low field goal percent not many defensive stats and shooter doesn't even really shoot the three ball very much  had to he's very much a play Rodeo Schroeder is in Jeopardy of falling out of the playable Zone he's number one 36 over the last three weeks because there's just been you know three positive categories and like four or five negative ones  I didn't make up how math works that's just how it works but also my handicapping on truder seems to be much more accurate than it looked like the first two weeks of the season when I was like oh my god did I badly Miss on this no we got it it's just a matter of understanding like how a guy got to a specific spot  let's see we talked Memphis we talked Dallas we haven't talked Philly or Boston and that should be fun because for Philly Joel embiid and Tyrese Maxey missed this ball game and you can see on your screen button was out Kelly oubre was out ubre  they're hoping to get back on Wednesday I don't know how much he's going to play in that one coming back from what we believe to be relatively serious ribbon core injuries but he'll get back in there Maxi and indeed both practice that news broke about 10 minutes ago while we've been talking as did Nic Batum so you can kind of throw this game out because and be in back and Maxi being back and Uber being back in between being back means that Paul Reed's not gonna play that much Pat Beverly's not gonna play that much robbing is not gonna play that much Marcus Morris is not gonna play that much and the only guys that played in this ball game that are going to get to play in the next one are Tobias Harris Indiana  so  dump the Box ladies and germs  ah the Celtics does anything make Dan best for his happier than Al Horford smashing on the fantasy side and you know what's really funny Horford's been so good since Chris stops for singing this went down that he's now inside the top 100 on the season that's crazy  he's top 50  over the last three weeks and porzingis wasn't even out for the first of those he's top 30 over the last two weeks which again that also includes a game I think where poor thing this wasn't down and he's a first rounder over the last week and a half  how freaking Horford everybody  one of the best fantasy plays on the board since porting this went down so rock and roll  Jayson Tatum got ejected in this ball game so Sam Houser picked up a few extra minutes he's a three-pointer stream and that's the general story with the Celtics who do play early this week so if you can wedge some streamers in their Howser Pritchard  obviously Horford if you've got him he's a juicy one and then Portia was like oh yeah I'm gonna be back soon but obviously a calf for a 7 foot 3 inch the original unicorn OG Edition is  not a small deal  speaking of OG I forgot to talk about him in that Toronto game and Obey at 9 points 5 boards three assists a steal and two blocks I mean it  there's still like infinite room for him to improve um  he's outside the top 200 over the last week because he's shooting 25% at the free-throw line and 36% from the field so there's just like you can still go get him  uh Spurs I think the only other team that played yeah we don't we don't have to go farther back than Friday  San Antonio is annoying this was a Wembley list ball game that's the only reason that I'm gonna spend some time on it no women Yama and that meant that everybody kind of shifted up a spot and then champagne got the started small forward and I don't care and Malachi Branham started at shooting guard and I don't care because they wanted to bring them into a Sell Off the Bench and I don't care what I do care about is Zach Collins playing only 24 minutes in this game in a game that basically turned into a blowout and Charles Bassey getting 19 if Bassy was going to be guaranteed 20 minutes he'd be a fan of he play but it sounds like when he's probably gonna be back for their next one because they were off for four or five days or whatever it is between contests  and then like I find a lot of these players kind of annoying to roster Jeremy Sohan is extraordinarily in to roster so I don't have him I don't have any of the cell do I still think you see the field goal percent come back down Wendy's fun I'll give you that  and then we talked about Zach Collins late last week as a guy who's values being sort of artificially deflated by the high turnovers but even he's not been he's been imperfect so far this year the Spurs are just annoying  let's flip the old covers over and see what's going on and I just two ballgames Boston at Indiana and New Orleans at Sacramento so we can zoom in real tight for those watching live you get the giant font on your screen right now  what are we looking for well you know Boston is still without forcing us so Horford and then in Indiana we're waiting to find out what's going on with Halliburton he's questionable that illness man I don't know if you guys have added the illness going around right now this this chest coughing one there's just like no way you could play a good basketball game while coughing up a lung out there so maybe Albert and doesn't go and if we can get that information early enough I would hope that you can  McConnell would be an amazing pickup  Special by the way if you can figure out which of these teams is going to win today Boston's favorite by five and a half so I think there's an assumption that Halliburton is not going based on that number on the road King's favorite by three and a half which I think that's telling you they expect both teams to be relatively healthy in The nightcap you could probably get out in front of it grab McConnell now but you're also saying how do we think Indiana can beat Boston with that lineup I guess would be no so if you want to really win the stream game this week see if you can figure out which teams today and tomorrow are gonna win because then those teams will play on Thursday and then you could get two  quiet day streamers with one move  so like do you think Boston's gonna be Indy then maybe Houser is the guy because you get him today you get him Thursday do you think Sacramento is going to be New Orleans maybe is Harrison Barnes on your wire maybe he's the guy you look at or even a Trey Lyles if you want to go farther down the board as a post to you know this like New Orleans if McCombs not traveling maybe the better one game play would be a Dyson Daniels or but if you're going to have to punt on him because then he doesn't play again until Friday on an overload day maybe you try to get the guy that you think plays twice before that because remember whoever loses he's Monday Tuesday games doesn't play again until Friday on a day where you probably have a full roster anyway  so you really are trying to guess who's gonna win  and if you want to get out in front of it we can even look at tomorrow a tiny bit and we'll do this again tomorrow but tomorrow's games are the Knicks at the Bucks and the Suns at the Lakers um  I actually kind of think Phoenix beats La I think the Lakers would beat the sun twice already this year it's really hard to beat the same team three times in a row and I think this will be the first time that the Suns will have two stars in or did they have Booker and or no I think they only had Duran in the two previous ones  so Phoenix I know I don't like this dreamers all that much but tomorrow if you wanted to go you know Grayson Allen or Joshua kogi maybe get two games out of those guys and then the Bucks do we think the Bucks beat the Nicks possibly  Portis is out there you go that route I wish we got a good report on someone like a pack haunted he'd be another interesting kind of fill in type dude as opposed to looking at Lakers like cam reddish or Taurean prince who are probably easier guys to pick up or on the Nicks if Josh Hart is out there if you think those teams lose at least that's Tuesday to Friday so it's not the like Monday all the way to Friday but it's still paying the but if you could get a guy that goes on to quiet or days  we're up near an hour already so I think we're probably gonna go light on questions today plus I think I mentioned it right at the beginning of the show my day is going to get screwed up a little by a kid's doctor's appointment so I'm gonna do just one or two quick ones here this is a good question from Adam lemberger what is Terry rozier's trade value and the honest answer to that is I don't really know I think some folks are going to be grading him on a curve because lamelo ball is out and he's been very big in those couple of ball games but he's also a guy that we've seen put up top 60 numbers when lamelo is around because he's able to play off ball and get better looks  I think it's trade value is probably not as good as his actual rank he's number 63 and 9 cat right now you're probably not going to get a 60 range guy back for Rozier so the best move with him is probably to just enjoy this run see what happens as a trading down for like an 80 range guy when Terry probably does have the ability to roll better than that for some time here over the next couple of weeks  um let's see if I can find one more question that applies to everybody  what do we got lots of really good questions in here but there are a lot of them are hyper-specific um okay who would you rather pick up between Malik Monk and Josh Hart  that's a good follow-up question because I talked about both of those guys my answer is monk because I have no idea what's going on like RJ Barrett's minutes have been down the last couple of ball games for New York that's been basically direct correlation yes Malik monk has been hot so that plays a part in why he's seen more minutes but it also does kind of feel like there's a good chemistry thing happening there  so I'd rather go Monk and just kind of see what happens he's also more fun to have and head to head because he scores more but I'll go I'll go Malik monk there and then last question any news on Anthony Simon's know he's pretty deep into the expected timeline  I would assume another week or two just to sort of like don't get your hopes too high but I got to think we see him before Christmas that'd be a really like the longest possible recovery from what he was dealing with so assume he'll be back in the next two weeks three would be the absolute longest if you made it this far just just stick it out thanks again everybody wonderful time with all of you
