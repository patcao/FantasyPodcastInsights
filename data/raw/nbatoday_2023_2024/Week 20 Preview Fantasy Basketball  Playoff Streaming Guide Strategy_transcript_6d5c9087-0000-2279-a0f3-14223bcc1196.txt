welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right guys if this combo platter show it's our fantasy NBA Today weekly preview but also our daily playoff streaming calendar I'm Dan Vespers we're diving straight in because I want these shows to be no more than 15 minutes and in a perfect world we keep them around 10 first of all find me over on Twitter at Dan best d a n b e s b r i s check out our baseball draft available now in the MLB fantasy passion for you NBA subscribers you can upgrade  to the all-sport for just one additional dollar per month  it's a start of a new week we 20 technically I know some sites that combine All-Star week that was one but I'm actually counting it all the way through so don't don't get on my case for that it is the beginning of the playoffs for a number of League's you're fighting for playoffs and a lot of League this is a head-to-head only episode whatever we're talking about right now has absolutely positively nothing to do with rotor or games cap this is all about maximizing games played and winning your head to head weekly matchups what you see on your screen right now  and I'll go ahead and make it a little bit bigger for you guys is the streaming chart which is available through the NBA fantasy pass you can see the whole thing I'm color coding it as I go here that part is up to you that's just I think for ease of reading here on YouTube or Twitter or however you're taking in the podcast but what I want to start with is a quick scroll through on the streaming calendar and let you guys know what's going on this week  obviously the big one is Brooklyn they've got five games in seven days you very rarely have a five game week there's only a couple the entire NBA season so whatever you can do on that Brooklyn front this is the date to do it if you have any players on your team that only have three games that are say basically any worse than like top 90 you probably should replace them with someone on Brooklyn that has five possibilities on that team that might not be fully rostered guys like Dorian Finney Smith would be the best one of the group Dennis Smith Jr would kind of be the next tier down and then you work your way all the way down to Someone Like A Day Ron Sharpe who's also again five games you might get yourself a 35 30 to 40 rebounds out of sharp five blocks a couple of steals good field goal percent it's a stretch but if you're hunting field goal percent and you're hunting rebounds five games of rebounds out of sharp would be better than they probably not going top 90 to drop for that guy but someone on your team that's in that 100 to 125 range go get out you know one 65 range guy 185 range guy playing five games and you get a whole lot of good stuff  Nets are also the only team on a back-to-back today tomorrow so if you're looking for a much shorter stream that's the same thing  same players where things get a little more interesting is where you get into the four and six or the three and four the four and six starting today meaning teams that play four games in six nights that'll get you through Saturday on a long stream would still be Brooklyn but you're also adding Chicago and the Portland Trailblazers Chicago the only streamer really is Andre Drummond because they're pretty narrow rotation these days it's kind of the starting five and then Drummond so he'd be the guy there the Blazers there's a lot of Health stuff hanging in the balance right now  we're waiting on I think three Blazers are questionable going into tonight's Blog games DeAndre 8 in his definitely questionable to Monica Mara got added late due to illness he's questionable  perhaps that did maybe everybody else is just actually just out already so guys like shade and sharper out Malcolm brogden's out scoot Henderson's out I believe Jeremy Grant Jeremy Grant is doubtful he's not out but he almost definitely will be on a tanking team so  you know if Tomy Camaro plays he ends up being a really good stream for six days Jabari Walker is a pretty good stream for six days the Blazers are messy now eight and sits out you could go wreath but you're also playing with fire because eating is questionable meaning he could be back at any moment during this  like pretty good scheduling stretch for Portland and then wreath turns back into basically nothing  Matisse double by the way is also questionable for tonight I don't know how I missed that one he would also be a really interesting stream for defensive stats so there's a whole bunch of names on the Portland side that could be interesting but we may not know about them until a little bit later on tonight so unfortunately it's not like I can come back on air and do one more minute on that the good news is that they're in Minnesota so the Blazers are one of the earlier games on the car today just half an hour after that Memphis Brooklyn start so we should get information on them by probably around 4:00 Pacific time and then you can make a call on a Blazer if you definitely want to  three and four is actually a little bit different because if you if we take a look at the Blazers schedule they actually go Monday Wednesday on every others and then Friday Saturday is their back-to-back so they're back loaded on that four games in six days so if you're just looking for a four-day stream Portland is not part of that mix but Sacramento is so it kind of flips around and you remove one but you add another Kings don't have that many if Darren Fox sits out you know maybe you get a little bit what I dare go Davey on Mitchell probably not because Fox is a chewed around meaning even if he doesn't play tonight he'll be back by that Lakers game ain't no way he's pissing that Lakers game coming up on Wednesday  Kevin herder is probably your only Fringe level guy you could stream and frankly  I don't know why you go that route if you weren't going to hold through Thursday and that makes me frankly a tiny bit nervous but guys potentially coming back and and then screwing things up for you  so  all that to say  and now I can close out this window you guys have now kind of seen this a little bit I want to change what's what what's being viewed on the screen to  I guess it's one of the Chrome tabs I have open here  what do we got  there we go that's this  okay here let's let's get this Chrome tab up this is the one I wanted  pretty sure that's the one I wanted yeah but it's too small don't worry I got you I got you everybody  okay so here we go um you guys briefly saw my my notifications here so we already talked about some of these players now you guys can get a look at them while we're talking about the other stuff going on on the card either tonight or this week  the other thing I wanted to talk about because there's the names  with with Portland kind of screwed up in the in the graphic on the screen but that's the names if you're going today  the things you should consider if you're streaming today are do I have any Fringe level players that are only going three games this week because if so I got to get onto Brooklyn  but if none of the Brooklyn guys are available and you have some three games got three game dudes playing this week then you have to look to see  when is it start for them  like let's say you have a fringe level player on Detroit you just happened to be I think they had a pretty good schedule last week right or yeah they had four games last week let's say you had been streaming Simona for something like that  it's a three game week yes  if you can't get to Brooklyn like we talked about there's a Chicago but let's say you couldn't get under a drum and they're just aren't that many options today outside of the Portland Trail Blazers  so that to me is the key like if you've got a three gamer and you can't get Brooklyn Portland's got to be the other one and then you definitely are not making another move on that club until Sunday  but even then I would argue you don't have to  here's the beauty of the long stream  the way the schedule is built right now actually affords a very interesting opportunity  to stream Xtra roster spots  allow me to explain myself  there are and everybody's talking about Brooklyn right now  multiple teams  coming up that play five games in seven days it just so happens that they don't run Monday to Sunday so nobody's talking about it  yes Brooke Lynn is your key today  but if you didn't want to make a move today to Brooklyn the Cavaliers start a five game in seven days stretch tomorrow  yeah there's another one just knocking right on your doorstep  and they got Isaac core who's been kicking but they've got Sam Merrill has been kicking butt Donovan Mitchell just got ruled out for at least the next three ball games so worst case scenario he comes back for a couple of them and your stream isn't as good on Sunday Monday at the end of the week but guess what the Cavs aren't the only one the Blazers who we just talked about they start this week by going four games in six days but if you get to that Friday Houston game for Portland that's actually the start of a five-game in seven days stretch for the Blazers  so if you're picking up a Portland player this the smart money says hold on for 11 days they go seven times in 11 days starting today and it just gets a higher and higher percentage the deeper you wait into the week but because Portland has one of the better schedules to start this week actually playing today on a kind of a low traffic day you could pick up a blazer  like a Jabari Walker or a jumaane kumaro whoever it might be and hold on to them through Thursday of next week  it's glorious  honestly you could even go deeper than that if you wanted to because Portland is one of the best playoff schedules on Earth they go four four four four and their final week they don't play on Sunday so you could actually make a move at that point  Blazers have that right after the five and seven then they go two games over five days so they get to catch their breath a little bit but they come almost up on another back-to-back again up so they're actually a lot of ways to maximize games this week and it doesn't all have to be Brooklyn  the other nice thing is and I want to bring up a different graphic to look at here so let me stop sharing that one and we'll get another one here and see if I can figure out where I put it up boo  yeah I know I should what you're just in their thinking and you should probably get a producer uh yeah I probably should but it ain't happening so  bear with me all right here's a little schedule strategy and this is what we what part of this we already talked about today  if you can get some Nets do it if they've all been scooped up the Blazers likely have some options to hold through Saturday or again for 11 days or Andre Drummond if you use two moves today save the rest for Thursday or later  one thing to keep in mind is you're in the playoffs too before we get into the follow-up tweet on this one  is  you want to make sure you have a move saved through Thursday at least one if somebody gets hurt on your team because if someone gets hurt and they're not ill eligible suddenly you're now staring down the barrel of two maybe even worst case three zeroes that's a big way to replace missing games played is to wipe out a 0 but the other thing I wanted to mention before we wrap up our Superfast show for today is  tomorrow remember I was talking about how Cleveland starts a terrific stretch tomorrow here on the screen you can see Cleveland starts at 4 and 6 they're actually a five and seven starting tomorrow but Atlanta Houston Miami Orlando and Philadelphia all start 4 and 6 tomorrow  so there's a lot of options to bulk up your games played starting as soon as tomorrow  what I will note though is as you're looking at the calendar looking at the teams that play today I believe every single team that plays today with the exception of Utah  is a four game week  so you're not gonna be able to add more than one game to your Ledger  for most of these teams if you like say you had a wizard they go today they still have three more games so if you moved off of a wizard the best you could do at one game the rest of the week Utah plays today if you abandon ship on Utah starting tomorrow you can turn two games over six days in to four games over six days so if you're really in a tight battle getting off of the Jazz after tomorrow is a real or after tonight is it really good deal because they actually play only three games until Friday of next week  that's three games over 10 days  bad schedule for Utah  but again with all those options I just mentioned what did I just say Atlanta Cleveland it would be the best one Cleveland because you can hold for seven days instead of six Atlantic Houston Miami Orlando Philadelphia  you got a bunch of options there  Beyond Hunter might be on the wire and some of your League's if you're going the Atlanta route Isaac Coral as we just talked about even a Dean Wade and Cleveland Houston I'm in Thompson may or may not be on roster's probably not Miami always has someone you could pull off the bench Caleb Martin  he's an easy one Jaime akez or Lando's entire team is a stream team Jalen Suggs is probably floating around out there in some spots Cole Anthony mob Wagner Gary Harris  Philly and I'm a ton of them but there might be a couple of Hell Kyle Lowry might be your grab tomorrow  so  that's where you sit over the next couple of days I don't even think it's like there's sort of no reason to look at every single day over the entire week right now you can try to game plan it out a little bit but in all likelihood you're gonna have someone get hurt on your team and then you're gonna have to replace that roster spot and it's gonna blow up your plan what I will say is today the things that you absolutely positively must do is if you have a fringe 3 gamer try to switch them to Brooklyn and if you can't get to Brooklyn try to switch them to Portland because that buys you Brooklyn buys you seven days Portland buys you at least six possibly as many as 11  other than that you could hang on  and if you have a Utah Jazz player you let him play today and then you move off of them tomorrow  otherwise you can let it wiggle a little bit I don't think that you have to you know detonate your team you don't have to go from a bunch of three gamers to a bunch of four Gamers today because you could still do that tomorrow if you really wanted to there are more choices tomorrow I believe then there are today and  if you want to wait till later in the week you sort of could no it's not it's not the world's easiest thing but you know Charlotte has a Friday Saturday back-to-back that starts to stretch for them where they have six games over nine days so that's it Charlotte's an interesting team to start on Friday Chicago who we already talked about is a good one this week that they continue through Thursday of next week to have a pretty good schedule talk about Cleveland tomorrow that's a pretty easy one gold in the state goes Wednesday Thursday Saturday in the middle of this week so there's an opportunity to use a move to get three games over four days right smack in the middle so there are a lot of options  but make sure you're streaming  don't sit on like a fringe Pelican or a fringe New York Knick player because they only go one time the first four days of this week they are a teams that go three times in those days and then you just pivot back off of it  so you don't gain you know you gain two games over that four game stretch but you have to sort of account for the ones that you might lose on the back end but like the Pelicans have a terrible schedule until next Friday  so look to see who only on your team if there are some really bad schedule guys Utah is a bad one New Orleans as I just mentioned his bad one the Knicks are kind of a bad schedule this week Indiana's a bad schedule this week all the least starting on Sunday they transitioned into a slightly better calendar Charlotte's a weird schedule because it's awful to start the week and then it's good very good for nine days  so that gave you a few names will continue to do names over on social tomorrow will give you some names on again we'll repeat the names for the possible pickups tomorrow that we already talked about today and then we'll also give you a little bit of Wednesday so we'll try to do like two days at a time here while also looking down the line and seeing how many moves we might have left so I would say you probably average using one move today maybe as many as two definitely don't go over to move today save at least two moves for Thursday and Beyond to be able to short particular categories at the end of the week if you only use one move today you could then use another one tomorrow if you wanted to gain a game or you could save them and try to back load your week a little bit  and that's the way I stream play off week number one thanks for watching everybody that's our quick hitter it did go a couple minutes over because it's all kind of like a weekly preview episode good luck in your playoff week hope you guys are enjoying these weird little blip shows we're doing we're trying to do one every day
