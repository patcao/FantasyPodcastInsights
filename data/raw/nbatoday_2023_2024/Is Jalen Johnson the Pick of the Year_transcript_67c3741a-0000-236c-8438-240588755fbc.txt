of stuff on social media  that's the that's the note that's it let's talk basketball  let's talk last night  it was a busy Wednesday  I admit friends I've completely lost track of what day of the week it is  my damn kids were sick for so long I have totally lost track but let's start at the top it doesn't actually matter what day it is today is Thursday so happy Thursday it's a quick day oh quick note here for those that are hanging out with us either live or watching a early or listening live early in the day  today is a euro NBA day there's a game in Paris that starts in like two hours so make sure to check your lineups first thing this morning calves and Nets are tipping at I think it's 11 a.m. Pacific time yeah 11 a.m. Pacific Time start  that's why those two teams only have one game this week just in case you guys were curious  anyway back to the board Sacramento blew out Charlotte because Charlotte isn't even really an NBA team right now they were barely an NBA team when they had their players and they don't even have any players left so what do we take away from this one  nothing  seriously what are you gonna do with the game where a team gets blown out and it's not even close certainly on the king side the only note on this one is that remember when we had Keegan Murray as a buy low and he was ranked like 105 and I was like this is the easiest bible I've ever seen in my life you guys know where he's at now and 9 cat  54  and this is actually I think where he can probably hang out feel goal percent is up to 46 and a half remember he was at like 39  here we go baby the king Murray surge has happened  Malik monk still trucking along and everything else is sort of irrelevant on Sacramento so I really want to try to focus on the big picture stuff don't let's not get caught in the minutiae  we're gonna talk about everybody named Jalen was there anybody named Jalen in this game I want to keep my promise even if they didn't play well I said I would talk about jaylin's no Jalen's in this game Terry Rozier  I haven't responded to the comment from a couple days ago on YouTube but someone was like Daniel you're getting caught up in recency bias  when it comes to Terry Rozier and so I kind of want to talk through how I got to where I got because I take all of your comments very seriously and I think most of them are written with love because it's people that you guys watch the show a lot some of you might not know how to sort of construct tone in a comment on Twitter or YouTube whatever but I'm never gonna be the guy that holds that against you  I'm never gonna be the analysts that gets super defensive about stuff and less I like haven't stopped in four days and then you know I would just beg your forgiveness on that one  but to the point of reasons he buys on Terry Rozier here's what I was thinking  last year I like to Terry Rozier I thought he was gonna have another good season and there you know all the signs pointed to him basically being able to repeat what he did the previous year  and then he didn't  the simple as that you just didn't his shooting was basically all the way back down after he had had two or three years in a row 4245 percent shooting he dropped back down to 41 and a half his usage was way up because lamelo ball basically missed the entire season but the inefficiency actually counter weighted the increase in usage he also had a poor free throw shooting year for reasons we don't entirely know and so everything kind of got held back this year and admittedly we were too high on him last season  don't really fully understand it but that's what happened  the reason I wasn't as high on Rozier this year as I was last year was not actually because he had a bad season last year it was because it felt like and obviously the entire team has gotten hurt so none of this actually came to fruition but with lamelo ball likely coming back  which didn't hurt Rozier he got better shots that one was a bit of a wash but they added Brandon Miller and Miles Bridges  those were the two big pieces that was the handicap for me Brandon Miller miles Bridges were gonna come back those guys were gonna get some number of shots I figured at least 20 between the two of them and it's actually been higher than that but again some of that clouded by who's been in and who's been out and so my thought was okay well Rosie's probably gonna drop back down maybe more like 15 shots a year instead of 16 to 19 where he had been the last three seasons  possibly even lower  so it wasn't that I don't think I ever said during draft season 2 specifically avoid Terry Rozier I think I just said this isn't really a guy that I'm targeting this season because I think you're going to see his role slightly diminished and I thought there was a chance that if things went South he was one of their potential trade ships which that one is actually still on the table but again I'm not I can't use that in as an excuse because as a rodo guy that's not something that I really game-planned for anyway  but what's happened now is that Rozier missed the beginning of this season remember he's basically started the year heard by the time he got back everybody else in the team was out lamelo's been out heyward's been out PJ Washington's been out bodies just dropping left and right miles Bridges is basically the last man standing for that team Mark Williams has been out forgot about Mark Williams being hurt Brandon Miller even lately has had a flu  and so Rosie's taking 19 shots a game again but is if efficiency is back up where it was two seasons go so it's actually better than ever  so it wasn't about recency bias for this year it was about the addition of two more guys that I figured The Horde it's gonna be carving out shots for now what does that mean going forward it's not take lock for me to say he's a sell High  because if the Hornets get any of these guys back again they're missing like 60% of their rotation players right now Rosie's not going to get 19 when all of those guys are healthy could his efficiency stay higher yeah it could but with the assist day at 7 no well the scoring stay at 24 know  the threes they could maybe stick a little bit 4.7 free throws a game no  all these things are coming down but then the opposite part of that is people are like well nobody wants my terrorism because they all know he's gonna drop off so now it's about understanding how far you think he's gonna fall  my guess is he's at 25 right now if the usage takes the hit that I expect which is like 15 to 20% actually it's like a pretty good knock on what he's doing right now  that's a couple of rounds that's 15 to 25 slots so if you can get someone back in the 40 to 50 range I think you sort of locking value and you get the added bonus of sort of buttressing against the possibility of a trade  so I hope that makes sense and I hope that addresses what was a very reasonable question about rows here  in one of the previous shows see I did find something to talk about on Charlotte  Brandon Miller I mentioned earlier this year I didn't think was going to nine cat guy it doesn't look like he's a nine cat guy yet he probably will be at some point in the future maybe even within the next two months not right now I'm still okay with streaming Nick Richards I don't think I go too far down any of these other Pathways at least not at this point you just have to hope that guys come back  no real notes on Washington they kept this game competitive so most of the key guys had better basketball games better in quotation marks Gafford was amazing God how good is Daniel Gafford been this year  he's number 41 in nine cat in 26 minutes a game 41 friends  even the atrocious Jordan Poole had a better ball game keep an eye on any of the idea if you start to cool off then you start to bench him he's a stream while warm guy Kyle kuzma was I mean how many times did we scream about sell High he's number one forty-one and nine cat no defensive stats at all percentages turnovers are all atrocious these days somebody's probably gonna trade for him and maybe that helps I don't know and then tyus Jones was not quite as good in this game but you know who cares  Indiana side is the more interesting side in this ball game so let's pause there for a minute I want to try to zip through the game's where we can and pause where on the ones where we need to go a little deeper  this is game one for the Pacers without Tyreese Halliburton  I make that sound more drastic than it is oh they're hoping to have him back in a couple of weeks  but a couple of weeks is an opportunity to try to cash in  on something  first of all if you're looking for scoring Benedict mathura and is probably going to do a fair amount of that nine cat no  Obi topping he got more run here because Jalen Smith was out so don't read too much into that one either  the names that I think people and hold on to Erin E Smith there's no reason to drop him he's been very good lately the names that everybody was wondering what would happen with them I think there were four of those Andrew nem heart who I've said many times on this show I don't believe is a nine category guy and you saw it in full force here buddy hield who the question was hey what would he maybe get a bunch more shots with Albert now and the answer on day one was no so leave him alone  Bruce Brown who my question was hey is this guy gonna have to do more facilitating and he kind of did here in the first game without Halliburton  I don't know that this level of production can continue but I do think it's worth kind of a speculative add on Bruce Brown  and then McConnell who only played 22 minutes TJ only got 22 minutes but he did a lot in them and I'm inclined to believe that in most scenario's he's the guy who's gonna get the minutes from McConnell if he gets up to 24 25 minutes he's crushing and replace full starters minutes he could be like a top 40 fantasy guy so McConnell's the obvious One Brown is the one that you're like okay maybe head-to-head I think you could go for it on Bruce Roto maybe we just watch one more and see if he can replicate and that's as far as I go on Indiana in the games here without Halliburton  Minnesota Boston was a weird one because both teams were resting guys and the game went to overtime Boston was without Christopher sinkus so Al Horford got his fill in game Minnesota was without Mike Conley and Rudy gobert so Nas Reed got a fill in game and slow-mo Got a Feeling game and then to kill Alexander Walker played a ton of minutes  but there hasn't been a perfect correlation between minutes and production for him and even in this one it was like yeah I mean he did some stuff but it took a really efficient ball game to get there  slow-mo is the guy you look at if both of these dudes are out  nazri is a guy you look at any time any of the big men are out for Minnesota and you play Nas when he is hot just sort of in general  but again let's not spend too much time with this ball game because both teams were scrolling with their lineups there's nothing long-term to take away we moved to San Antonio Detroit  the toilet bowl  I mean there's bad and then there's Detroit Bad  Spurs whipped them this game was over early I I wouldn't do a whole bunch of pickup and drop stuff on the Spurs based on this because nobody played more than 28 minutes hold Trey Jones as long as he's starting you're holding that's the only note I have on San Antonio today  Jaden ivy needs a breakdown I think on the Detroit side I'm not picking up Killian Hayes I know he had 12 assists but we've seen too much ugly to go down that rabbit hole Jalen Duren good boy McDonalds good  Ivy this is a game this game perfectly illustrated my fears on Jayden Ivy he had a bunch of good stuff  19 points to 18 shots five assists two steals two blocks and two three pointers lots of really good stuff there but  high volume terrible field goal percent missed some free throws he actually didn't turn the ball over that much so it didn't have all three of the The Telltale Mischief marks  but this is why Jaden Ivey is a full freight train go in points League's and why I'm flipping a coin and Rodeo and saying like is this actually good for my roto team the line that he just put up here honest to goodness if I'm if I played this game in Roto I think I'd be upset  because I like the two blocks a lot and I like the two steals those are nice but like do I really need the 19 points and five assists all that bad  I'd rather play a guy who gets 11 points and three assists and does not obliterate my percentages on a given night  that's just me now head to head if you're hunting one of those percentages that makes it a little bit of an easier play or if you're punting a turnover to percent I get it more Appeal on that side I understand I don't want to try to  tailor this podcast all my discussions to whatever League's you're in but like we can't talk for two straight hours here  but that's to me the sort of double-edged Sword of Jade and ivy with Cade Cunningham out for a couple of weeks  Oklahoma City beat the zombie Miami Heat and then Eric Spoelstra or was this right before the Ballgame Eric Bolster was giving I believe the largest contract in head coaching history which is funny because I think on yesterday's show wasn't that the show where I said oh and we just got terrible news on Marcus Smart right in the middle of the program so I'll break in on that in just a second  damnable okay so I think on yesterday's show I was like someone should go give are exposed to like 200 million dollars just to get him well he were like ah  no nay Dan We're not gonna let you have this idea and they gave him 120 million dollars and he certainly earned it the new news unfortunately of the morning is that Marcus Smart's finger injury which we were hoping was not a big deal is a big deal and he will be out for six weeks  again  is there an obvious pickup while the Grizzlies just gave Vince Williams a whole bunch of money so  maybe  I don't think you have to like Sprint out and pick up Vince Williams I don't think that he's gonna be a League winner over the next six weeks  but I would say that he deserves your attention at the very least because they're back down jaw and Marcus Smart again and The Grizzlies now are looking right down the barrel of  throwing in the towel on this season I mean they'll keep fighting they'll do their best  but  I mean  really how far are you gonna go without Marcus Smart and  uh yeah anyway and and jaw was the other one sorry I was looking at Vince Williams stats while I was talking about that  how many teams do I have Marcus Smart on is the question only one all right I guess it's not a total disaster for me personally but man that's a pain in the butt  tough break man tough break  yeesh  when it rains it pours their  man  Chrisley's can't catch a break  I I be really worried if I had Grizzly's well at least we know Desmond Bain is gonna get 20 shots for the rest of Eternity all right what the hell are we talking about before I got sidetracked by crummy news okay see no news no news they are a there is zero Delta fantasy team which is fine it's boring for a podcast because all we get to talk about is guys doing cool stuff but mostly I like to focus this show on actionable things and there's nothing actionable with this team  best thing I can say about okay see right now is that hey remember when he we told you guys to buy low on Jalen Williams that was another really really easy call  he's up to number 56 now  Miami was weird in this one you know bam out of Iowa and Tyler hero and Jaime as duh well Jimmy Butler is out those are all the easy ones but we had our sort of like once a week Nicolas yovich sighting  no you're not adding there hey what Highsmith played 35 minutes in this ball game because Kevin Love was basically getting having young dudes run circles around him he couldn't guard anybody on defense that's why I love didn't play as much in this ball game  Kevin Love is actually still been streamable lately and frankly even in a bad ball game here he still did enough to not hurt you funny thing is I think I'd rather have this Kevin Love Game than the Jaden Ivy game and I know that makes me sound like a crazy person but you know he positive percentages still got you some points and rebounds and just like the difference was not know Steel's blocks really  and it's just the way my brain works against sort of the standard fantasy competitor  you know most games Highsmith in love are kind of splitting minutes and when Caleb Martin comes back it might further complicate matters but you're not picking up Highsmith after this one big ball game and we can continue  still no Joel embiid for Philadelphia and to no one's surprise they're not as good with out him  and this is really the stretch where you've seen the Sixers Miss James Harden  because they need somebody to run the team and as good as Tyrese Maxey has become he's not at that level yet  the assistant are solid nine of them I mean he had a really nice fantasy ball game but like I just I don't think you want your guy taking 29 shots I think you want him  you want a little bit more involvement because Maxi took 29 shots to buy Sarah's took 24 Kelly ubreak took a 11 that was the next highest number  not a good distribution still you love playing the Hawks and you love overtime for Fantasy the Anthony Melanie is gonna work his way back into game shapes coming off this back thing so they didn't want to overextend him he'll be fine he's a hold as he ramps up Uber a probably ramps down hopefully we get Joe L&B back in the not too distant future  the big disappointment in this game was that you know I figured Paul Reed in an overtime game would get at least 20 something minutes  the nice news is that he still put up a good fantasy line and only 19 minutes I'm still comfortable using Paul Reed when he is out even if it's not going to be these big eye-popping numbers because Marcus Morris comes in and screws things up on that front  but he doesn't know same with you know and like Mo Bamba's in their kind of messing things up for him but still 20 to 25 minutes of Paul Reed is still startable and fantasy  let's just hope that him beat his back pretty soon and now the player of the day and I forgot to talk about any Jalen's that had already played I'm sure I missed one or two well I didn't mention Jalen Williams though Jalen  freaking  Johnson  25 points 16 rebounds seven assists a steal two blocks three three pointers 62% from the field six of six at the free-throw line one turnover  he was a positive fantasy contributor in all nine categories yesterday  that is remarkable and on the year  Jalen Johnson is up to number 32 in nine cat  that is just I mean  holy crap what a year he's having  and the question I would post all of you guys is  is Jalen Johnson The Pick of the year right now  because for a while I thought it was Scotty Barnes and it still could be he has a good case for it Barnes is number 13  for a while like I thought there was a chance it could be Tyrese Maxey he is falling in a number 18 which is still very impressive but he's dramatically cool Chet Holmgren he's at 14 that he's in the mix Kawhi Leonard is number six who was being drafted in the 30s  but there's just something I think about a guy drafted like 135  or not drafted at all that's a third rounder that just feels like it has to be the pick of the year because he was off the radar in a lot of League's the B150 had him at like 55 or 60 or something like that I can't remember the exact number I think it I think ethos tweeted it out last night so it's my fault for not looking it up before coming on the show  so if you were if you had a b-150 drafter in your league they probably took Jalen Johnson in the you know 10th 11th 12th round something like that but a lot of League's he got picked up  two or three weeks that I was in  I picked him up  you know Yahoo publicly said only go 13 Rounds  picked him up  some folks are calling him to pick up of the year and I'm like I don't I mean again like dry I think draft pick of the year  really remarkable I love that discussion I love talking about the positive side of fantasy  it feels my heart  people are gonna  hear me talk about Jalen Johnson as a pic of the year and they're in their mind they're gonna go he's  sliding  Scotty no no he's an awesome pick all so  there's no right answer to this question I think it's just fun to talk about these big winners Jalen Johnson has to be near the top of the board he has to be  Houston also an overtime game they could really use some depth right now no tari Eason  no official timetable on him Dillon Brooks still out  Grumble grumble  cam Whitmore finally got any more extended look in this ball game 33 minutes 16 five and one with a couple Steals and a couple of Threes I think cam Whitmore is worth a speculative add the nice thing too about having a few kind of fill in or Speck ads coming up on yesterday's card is that we all so had in this very same ball game  some obvious drops to carry us forward  and that's from the Chicago side because now with Zach LaVine going back to Full Tilt and vooch coming back to Full Tilt you can drop Patrick Williams you can drop on Andre Drummond you can drop iot assume if he was on one of your teams  you know don't have to worry about him the Bulls that need to be rostered Levine white vooch Caruso DeRozan  those five  they are so the five starters for Chicago so that makes it easy to remember  it's really nice to see Levine get going he was one that I had mentioned a few times as a bylaw because I think people were pretty frustrated with him  also nice to see Kobe white stay warm here with Zach LaVine back it seems more and more like white season is not gonna be as tied to Zach LaVine and just more to his sort of natural hot and cold streaks  where he settles is still kind of unclear my guess is gonna be like in the 60 to 80 range because he doesn't get defensive stats and that's always going to keep him held back a little bit  and the field goal percent is probably not going to be great in the long term  and then do the Bulls trade guys that's still on the board but they are not in the number nine seeds so suddenly they're like well I guess we could kind of run it back in the 13-9 and Holmes so they're not a complete disaster there anymore  and offensively they've gotten a lot more fun lately  New Orleans may have actually ended a dynasty with this ball game seriously because Warriors Twitter Wars media the warrior Team all three full implosion  Trail by as many as 40 points on their home court they should move back to Oakland this has to be the this has to be the the curse of San Francisco I wouldn't read too much into the fantasy stuff going on in this game  from a micro standpoint  I guess I did get a question of Trey Murphy needs to be roster the answer is yes  does herb Jones need to be roster the answer is when the team is healthy probably not but he had a better ball game in this one  the questions in this game seem like they need to revolve around the Warriors  because  the poop has hit the oscillating air movement device  nerd alert  Klay Thompson he was asked about getting booted home said something like what do I need to worry about that  yeah defensive  someone asked Steph Curry if things need to change and he said something like well what's the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results  getting a little warm  in the Yay Area  but what does it mean well it means one of two things I want to three things there's three possible outcomes here on this Warrior situation I'll come number one which in my opinion is the one that we almost definitely do see  but it doesn't preclude us from seeing the other two outcomes outcome number one  is Draymond Green comes back in the next two games  and the Warriors see if they're  heart because as Steph Curry is their best player  no one with a brain of any shape or size would argue against Steph Curry being the team's best player  Seth Curry and Draymond Green I would argue however are equally important to what the Warrior's do on a night tonight basis  they don't have offensive fluidity without Draymond and they don't have any defense without Draymond  they also lost Chris Paul and everybody can talk about how he's old and washed and whatever but he's actually still a good point guard and so he was a guy that could get people open  the Warriors basically lost their two point guards with Dream On and CP3 both being out  Steph can play point  but that's not his best position it's Steph Curry is a Transcendent all around basketball player  but if everybody can just key on him and he has to do all the ball-handling which is kind of what's happening right now  that's a recipe for doom doom  so thing number one Draymond comes back The Warrior see what they look like  do they look a little bit better I would bet almost my entire life they look at least a little bit better  provided Draymond doesn't choke hold anybody or grab someone by the you know what's and yank on it  Daniel just be done then he'll have to actually retire instead of just threatening to retire  but then things can go in two different ways  because once they see what they are with Draymond and they decide look are we still close to being competitive  or are we still a train wreck  and this was like a  two train Collision two trains going head on it's the worst possible outcoming what we saw last night but with Draymond they have to decide look are we just like  are we still a train wreck but just not as embarrassing a train wreck or are we competent because once they get the answer to that question then the Warrior start to figure out are we a buyer or a seller  either way changes on the horizon  if they're a buyer which I think is actually great for a lot of guys they send out pieces teams want Wiggins is contract teams want Jonathan kaminga  human because young interesting teams are going to want  Brandon pajam ski glue guy who was totally running out of energy by the way  teams might be interested in trayce Jackson Davis Warriors will package together some stuff a young guy a bunch of picks whatever  go get another player  okay well reassess it that point  or  is it time to break it up it's time to take the Chisel  banging through the middle of this thing and just split it  in which case  clay  probably gets moved Wiggins almost definitely gets moved  that's hard to know exactly where they end up and what their fantasy value would be in that scenario all of this to say we bring it all together into our lovely little package you can't really do anything with the Warriors until we know what direction they're heading  I'm not starting trayce Jackson Davis unless he's starting and we had a better ball game here but when he comes off the bench the minutes are too too much influx  clay you start Stef you start  that's it for me right now  even paigey I'm not starting because he's hit a rookie wall which  rookies almost always hit a wall and then you can always tell how fast it's gonna happen by how many times they're getting knocked to the ground in the Ballgame and he was playing so hard  and like his whole story to this point this year it was a good one by the way was oh he's like grinding out defending getting rebounds getting assists  there are 10 year NBA vets playing that have that profile that can't stay healthy for a full season so new kid coming in wasn't going to be able to and he's upright to his credit he's still healthy but he's got nothing in the tank  let's see what happens when Draymond comes back and then we can reassess again but something's gonna pop for the war warriors what will it be  so I guess Utah's good now I'm nothing changes on the Denver side but for the Jazz it's like it's a different assortment of players every ball game other than Larry marketing  so marketing is a start that's an easy one I haven't looked at his rank in a while whereas Lowry at did he fall back a little know he still number 10  damn that's an impressive year  Chris Dunn had another good ball game he played 26 minutes here  I love Chris Dunn I don't know why I'm so hesitant to make a move on him I mean I know why I'm hesitant to make a move on him it's because  you know half the time he's playing like 16 minutes  Chris Donas minutes since the team has gotten healthy our 1919 1820 1626 33 24 26 they've tried it up a little bit but assists steals  typically kind of feel goal percent I don't really  shoot it all  he kinda needs to be rostered  it seems nuts because he's number two Seventeen on the year but over the last week he's number 52 as like a weird point guard version of Matisse Bible nobody really all that obvious is out for the Jazz right now  and Kris Dunn is splitting the point guard but it's almost right down the middle with jonte George  24 minutes a game is enough for Chris done because he's gonna get you assist he's gonna get you a ton of steals the Jazz are playing their butts off right now  so add him to the mix I like Larry marketing and I like calling sex and I like Walker Kessler I know Kessler's minutes are all so all over the map but over the last month two months he's been like number 65 so I wouldn't worry about the game to game too much  John Collins not doing enough on a game to game basis for me to quiet of a fantasy line these days Kelly Olynyk I think we can probably push to the side for now Jordan Clarkson is on one of his heaters at the moment and obviously he plays better when he has point guards with him Chris Dunn being one that helps a lot  but for Clarkson I mean we've seen this a thousand times yes three big ball games in a row and then crashes into the Earth and anybody that doesn't remember the last one can't remember four weeks ago  sell high on Clarkson when he's running like this so Clarkson if you want to start when he's hot I'm okay with that Kessler sex and marketing are the ones that I'm going with every day and then right now I think I'm going with Kris Dunn but it is a little bit of a specialist look  I mean damn 24 minutes he's getting like two steals the ball game he's got a Delon Wright thing going on  and then Toronto they were able to hang in there for a while but just kind of ran out of steam late against the Clippers  I don't think there's a whole lot to take away from this ball game the usual  RJ Barrett is on a heater of his own just like the beginning of the year in New York he shooting like 52% from downtown right now you know that's not gonna last long term  so if you really want to play Barrett right now you can just know it's good to run out and when it does  it's gonna be ugly  ugly ugly boogly  it's gonna be bad  I'm sure I forgot to talk about a Jalen somewhere in there we had Jalen Duren we had Jalen Willie Williams we had Jalen Johnson  those are the ones that are crushing it  I'm excited by the fact that I look over into this they do a chat box on stream yard and I can see folks posting in Twitter I can see folks posting on YouTube I got stuff firing in on social what a cool day  what a cool time other than the Marcus Smart news  one question that got asked that I didn't address was what to do  with Luke Kennard and  you guys know I like Luke Kennard and I talked about him at the beginning of the year as somebody that I was sort of like side eyeing can this guy get enough minutes to actually put up consistent fantasy value  the answer is I I don't think they're gonna play him enough I think the Grizzlies believe his body can't quite handle a full workload  and if you look at his minutes per game this year it basically tells that story which is  first of all he hasn't been healthy this season he didn't start the yo healthy and he hasn't really ever been healthy he's cleared 30 minutes one time  I was on November 5th  if someone could tell me that Luke and I was gonna get to play like 27 minutes a game I would pick him up  but I'm not going to do it before I see it happen because I just don't know that his body can handle it and I don't think the Grizzlies even believe his body can handle it Vince Williams Junior is going to get the first crack at those minutes you're gonna see the Grizzlies try out all sorts of random crap now with the team going down and they're gonna be a silly season Club  so get ready to see Jacob Gilyard play down the stretch and Santi aldama played down the stretch and maybe Luke Kennard and maybe John conchar and maybe David Roddy and maybe Xavier Tillman and maybe sire Williams  I don't know today  today  well  I guess I don't know to this anybody really Grizzlies even playing tonight I guess I probably should have looked that up before I started talking about them I don't think they have a game today do they  no they they played again tomorrow  they host the Clippers tomorrow  what are the Grizzlies going to do tomorrow  if JJJ is back it's gonna be probably Billy waived Biz Mark be almost so there's going to be more Tillman who's eh if he for Fantasy value JJJ Desmond Bane and then it's like well we'll see if anybody else actually gets to do enough consistently Vince Williams likely starts so that's the reason that I mentioned him as this sort of speculative ad for 12 teams definitely an ad in slightly deeper formats and then you wait and see because they're not just going to pull the plug on the season on January 11th it sucks they're gonna see if they can win a handful of games without Marcus Smart but I mean ultimately they won't  and then eventually they'll pull the plug  I don't think they're going to be big sellers at the deadline because they still feel like they've got enough there they've just been brutalized by injuries and suspensions this year I don't think they're gonna be a buyer at the deadline because they know this season is a lost cause  they're a team that's probably gonna get to February and March and just start giving their guys days off  and that's when you really want to dig in not January 11th  February March that's digging time on the Grizzlies and that  is where I will  put a pin in it for today
