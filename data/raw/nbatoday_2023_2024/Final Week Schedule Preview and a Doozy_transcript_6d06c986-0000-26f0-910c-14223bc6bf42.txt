welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast so our very last weekly preview show of the Season weak 25 the very last very weird extremely spooky know it's not Halloween it's an eclipse we had a solar lunar solar  solar eclipse  that those of us in Southern California got to see a very small fraction of the rest of you are saw something a little bit more cool  and those of us who didn't have any protective eyewear saw nothing at all but it does lead us into one of if not the strangest weeks  of this 20 24 portion of the 2324 NBA season the  innseason tournament week was arguably the weirdest schedule on the 2023 side and then with the all-star weekend gets combined into two uh  but this is a strange one  first of all hi it's me again stand vespers  your friendly host happy to have you guys here this is fantasy NBA today it's the weekly preview weekly lineup whatever you want to call it Edition  and it's our last schedule breakdown show of 202324 because after today there's no reason we will just be repeating ourselves from this show  why well  I'm gonna share the last week of the the NBA schedule on the screen for those that are watching on a video feed and it's gonna be extremely in because there's only seven days left on the board but the first thing you'll notice is that there aren't any games too  of the seven days this week  I did a little color coding along the top bar for eight that's today April 8th April 13th that's Saturday  no games  none not one now today you've got college basketball I mean college basketball is pretty much the reason for all this stuff no games okay that would be a screwy enough week  but we also have two 15 game days Blended in just for funsies that's Friday the 12th every single team in the NBA plays  and Sunday the 14th  the last day of the regular season everybody also plays  okay so now you've got four days where there really isn't anything that you can do other than you know if you have six injured guys on Friday or Sunday you could try to swap one out for somebody who's actually playing what's that that's not enough  you want even more absurdity  what do I have a gift for you Tuesday tomorrow is a 14 gamer  There is almost no way  that you all listening don't have a full card on three days this week Tuesday Friday Sunday and an empty card on two days this week today and Saturday leaving yeah you can do the math 7 days total two empty three full you got two days this week where anything anything at all is worth exploring that is Wednesday and that is Thursday oh that's it  outside of those days this week is a wash  Wednesdays and eight gamer Thursday is 5  if you are still streaming which is basically the point of these weekly preview shows  if you're still locked into a weekly lineup that would be the other reason to do it  you pretty much can't do anything at all  until Wednesday  all right so there's two ways you can look at this week we wait number one is if you're in a weekly lineup format  something just fell down in the other room but I assume it's fine  what's what could possibly go wrong if you're in a weekly format  you should be looking at all the guys that are questionable and figuring out what you're supposed to do with them so she'll just Alexander  he's missed four games in a row  and we have no idea if he's playing in any of their final four  I don't know how you bench him though  Anthony Davis with his eye he probably have to play him Kawaii Leonard they're hoping to have him back by midweek I mean feels like you kind of have to play them  Tatum Steph Donovan Mitchell probably trying to play these guys  Jalen Williams and OKC  he's out for four games as well  it's hard to say you know  some of the toughest decisions you can make you kind of have to try to read the tea leaves a little bit Minnesota's trying to get cat back you know Tobias Harris has been out with his sword knee he was ruled out just a couple hours before their last ball game so the hope is that he'll get into some of these games this week  very very difficult decisions  but if you can get two out of a lot of the Superstar level guys we just talked about and you kind of have to do it  what about daily formats because that's where things get  I don't want to say easier but yeah a little bit easier  you're basically taking four weekly moves let's say that your league is still going for some Unholy reason if you're league is still ahead format and you're still actually going this final week first of all you got to get out of that League because that's a absolutely terrible rule that your season's going to the end you guys should be lopping off at least three weeks I think after watching this season I would almost vote to Lop off four weeks of the end of the year  I hate it  I hate it because I like playing the as many games as humanly possible but I think you kind of have to chop off for weeks next year but if you are in a daily League somehow going to the end of the regular season again haven't helped you but you basically want to move two guys on Wednesday and two guys on Thursday  you want to squeeze extra games out of this week somehow someway and that's kind of the only way to do it  because I mean just look at your look at your team look at what your team has going on Wednesday  I don't know many players you're going to have five six something like that  I don't have any head leak still going I'm just looking at a rodeo league right now that has five bench sloths slots my team has seven out of 15 guys playing on Wednesday which is pretty close to where you'd be again just over half the league is playing so you know you have a 15 roof you probably have about eight guys going if you have a 13 you probably have about six guys going something in that neck of the woods what you should probably be doing there is first of all looking to see is there anyone on my team  that doesn't play on these two days okay well  first of all it's very hard to do with this screen zoomed in like this I think we need to  think we need to zoom back out even if it looks a little silly  and it does you guys can see parts of the previous weeks too as we scan the board there are teams that are not going Wednesday Thursday one of those teams is Indiana the Lakers are another one the Philadelphia 76ers are a third in the Washington Wizards are fourth  one thing that those teams all have in common is that in the LA  Philly Washington  they are the rare three game weeks  they play on only the ultra-high traffic days so they have very bad schedules I'll repeat those teams if you need me to the Indiana Pacers have a terrible schedule but you're not going to do anything about it until Wednesday the LA Lakers have a terrible schedule the Philadelphia 76ers and the Washington Wizards these teams have bad bad schedules because if you don't have somebody on those teams that's a Bonafide Superstar you can move off of them and you're not going to lose any games basically all week because they're all in overflow days are there any teams that go back to back on Wednesday Thursday nope  nope  so there isn't a single move you can make that turns say a wizard like let's say you're streaming Corey kispert which is fine he's been pretty good with kuzma missing time or oh I don't know like there's someone like a really hot tomorrow who's been pretty good lately Philly not so many outstanding streaming options Indiana's had a couple of kind of above Fringe level guys even like a TJ McConnell has been pretty good lately  but these guys you can ride him out through tomorrow  and then I went today you're going to move them for somebody who plays on Wednesday  this so this is the easy decision look at your team if you have anyone from those four clubs and arts are you probably have one  again this is for daily leaks going to the end of the season which is idiotic and its own right but it's it does happen you move two of those guys hopefully if you have two that's what you do if you have one you move one for a guy on Wednesday and then you turn that guy into a dude who plays Thursday and again we talked about this on Fridays streaming show every single player that plays on Thursday plays Thursday Friday Sunday so you don't have to worry about moving that guy again  preferably you can get somebody good on that Thursday card I know it's only a five gamer but at this Junction or the season there's so many weirdos playing that yeah I mean Boston has a back-to-back in there so you're probably can go like a Payton Pritchard Chicago you know Andre Drummond has been useful these days Detroit has plenty of streamers they play on Thursday Warriors Rockets Pelicans Knicks Blazers Kings Jazz there's plenty of streamers you can pick up on Thursday that will take you through to the end of the week and then Wednesday with a games you'll also have plenty of options as well the nice thing is you don't have to look for a specific like scheduling component you're just picking up the best guy on Wednesday and then switching them out for the best guy on Thursday that's all you have to do with that  pair of moves  if you have two guys on teams with really bad schedules you just do that twice  easy solution to your week  but if you only have one guy  who plays on Who had who has no games on Wednesday and Thursday now you're stuck basically using two roster moves to get one bonus game  and I still think it's probably worth it or  you have a couple Avenues you can go here so stick with me for a minute  I'm not in favor of saving roster moves for Friday Sunday I think in all likelihood you will have at least 10 of your guys healthy and starting if you have 14 or 15 roster slots if you only have 13 which  I don't know man Yahoo leaks are over so this shouldn't be a problem anymore but let's say you only have 13 rosters slots okay fine you know you might have four or five guys that are listed out  but  kind of just have to play the odds that you're going to have 10 guys going  so here's what you can do  so again the best option is take one of those teams that has no games on Wednesday and Thursday using move on Wednesday use another move on Thursday outstanding outstanding you get one extra game for each move you make I know normally when we're streaming we talk about getting more than one move one more than one extra game excuse me for each move we make with the optimum being two extra games over some number of days that's longer than two like you're not switching a nothing to a back-to-back  uses up too many roster moves this week is so different because it's condensed into a two-game week you don't have to worry about long streaming for four or six or seven or nine game or days you only have to worry about two  and there are no back-to-backs so there's literally no way to turn  one roster move into two bonus games the best you're gonna get is one move for one additional game  the best way to do it is to take one of those teams that has no games in there and you switch them for somebody who plays on Wednesday and somebody who plays on Thursday  the second best way to do it is to take somebody who plays on Wednesday but not on Thursday and after their game on Wednesday swap them out for another dude on Thursday  so that is another way to get one bonus game per roster move  the unfortunate thing about that is that the guy you're dropping after their Wednesday game  probably better than the guy you're picking up on Thursday  but hopefully they're so far down on your board so they're like the 12th 13th you know 10th 11 12 13th best player on your team that the guy you dropped them for even if you don't use that guy on Friday Sunday you can like slot in your 11th best player for you if you dropped your ten best player and there isn't that much of a drop off less certainly than what you get out of streaming on Thursday  and then the Third Way is you gain less than one gameplay you take someone on your team that does play Thursday you switch them for someone who plays on Wednesday and then back to someone who plays on Thursday that's kind of the worst method but it's still gets you one extra gameplay for two roster moves  so again there's two ways to get one bonus game played per roster move its take the teams that have nothing Wednesday Thursday or take a team that has a guy that plays basically Tuesday Wednesday or just Wednesday which is anybody go Wednesday that doesn't play on Tuesday  Brooklyn Cleveland  which by the way if you're like dancing I drop my net or my Cavalier my answer is probably not because you probably don't need any more games played on Tuesday you're probably pretty full unless you have a bunch of those guys if you have like three calves and a net you might have room for someone on Tuesday but in all likely you don't  have that you probably don't have more than three guys but between those two teams  so you can just hold those guys through their game on Wednesday and drop on Thursday so drop your player that played on Wednesday on Thursday pick somebody up who plays Thursday Friday Sunday or drop the guys that don't play Wednesday Thursday on Wednesday for someone who plays on Wednesday and then drop that guy again on Thursday and that's basically the way you run your weekly schedule because again you only have to worry about two days it's a two-day no long stream exclusively mini stream  that's it  weekly choices are really really really hard right now because  we just don't know you generally want to err on the side of caution but also if you're talking about someone you know like a  freaking J Guild just Alexander how can you really  could you really win your week without him  almost like you need to games out of shape maybe you even get three  Sub in your 11th 12th best guy for Shea just Alexander in a weekly format that guy could play all four and it wouldn't be as good as she and one or one and a half  so that's why it's tough you kind of have to lean towards yes among most of the really really big name guys and just hope that you get two plus games out of them and then once you get about you know past the top 40 then you could err more on the side of caution if we're talking about a weekly format and as far as you daily folks go the other advice that you got and you know this is a short one but it's important is pay very close attention to the in and out the who's playing who's healthy Tuesday Friday Sunday so I can make sure you get all 10 live bodies going  and there's a little bit of a format to this  the format is  anybody that you know is healthy put them in the hardest spots to fill on your roster so like if you have a healthy point guard don't put them in a utility spot put them in the point guard spot  put someone in the power forward spot put someone in the center spot try to knock out those kind of backwards and then the guys that have all the you know shooting guards small forward that type of stuff forward guard that tends to be a little bit easier to fill and then utility is obviously the easiest one and if you have a bunch of guys that are rotating that you don't know if they're healthy or not make sure you get the  as many and sometimes you just have to play in early or game like if you have a guy who's a game time decision who plays on the west coast at night you might end up just not being able to play that guy because you don't know if they're in so try to get guys into your lineup as early as often as possible on those overload days because the worst thing that could happen to you is accidentally starting somebody who doesn't play you take a zero anything is better than that you'll really be kicking yourself if you take a 0 even more than you'd be kicking yourself if you started kind of the wrong healthy guy  with the exception of course being this Superstar level West Coast guys like Anthony Davis basically or Kevin Durant or Devin Booker or something like that these guys that are playing at 6 7/2 and right now add is that kind of one guy  the West Coast Mega Stars  I guess Kawaii would be the other one I think he's already out for this next ball game so no problem there okay that's it guys that's our last schedule breakdown show of this regular season we will of course continue to have all of our recap shows all week long Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday we'll do our very last week in review show and then the season ends after that and we'll start first thing Bingo Monday morning we'll start
