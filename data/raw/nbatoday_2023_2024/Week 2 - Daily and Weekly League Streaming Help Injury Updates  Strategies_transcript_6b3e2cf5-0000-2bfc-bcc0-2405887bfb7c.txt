welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I gotta say of all the days for me to be fighting a laryngitis this is not a great one two show Monday but damn it we're gonna get through these bad boys  this is the weekly preview show also known as the weekly lineup show also known as the week ahead podcast iteration  also known as just fantasy NBA today I'm your host Dan bass and I am joined as always on our weekly preview shows by d-ball b-ball I will call him all so Derek but I like that I like that damn handle d-ball what's cracking my man  and I'm just living the dream today you know it's been it's not so nice where I am we got our first snow of the year up in Ottawa so I am happy to be cooped up nice and warm and doors talking basketball with you and everyone else at their I'm going to just check my phone real quick I don't go outside very often because you know I'm I'm a vampire but it is 78 degrees in Los Angeles today and it's going to be 81 each of the next two days before dropping down Bridget's 73 a week from today so you know we're we're in a tight spot over here my voice is cooked if people can't tell I'm fighting my way through it it's it's this damn cold that the kids have brought I know you're actually fighting something as well but between the two of us  two of us at 50% strength we can make one competent weekly preview  Derek by the way you can all find on Twitter at the name that I actually called them when he came on the show which is d-ball b-ball I am at Dan Vesper over on social media we're gonna be looking ahead at the week two  schedule what teams have two games three games for games any streaming opportunities things of that nature because last week Derek we talked a bit about how streaming and week one can be a bit of a double-edged sword you might win one extra category and a given week and that's good but you might also accidentally drop someone who was a season-long value and that's probably more bad than the one weekly category win was good are we is weak to starting to be an inflection point because I feel like you know two three games it's not much of a sample size but at least we know about guys like Paul Reed is a good example it was just like they said all the right things but he's the backup center right now so is this a time to start thinking about streaming are you still waiting longer how does strategy change for you between week one and week two  yeah absolutely so I mean the first week it's more about you know asking the question is this guy a good fit on my team second weeks probably gonna reveal the answer to that question it's kind of tough for us especially as analysts because we are getting this question a lot you know should I drop this guy do I you know do I cut bait and run or you know do I trust myself and I still tend to believe you should trust yourself I mean there are you know Paul reads great example person that I was very high on myself I drafted him and a lot of spots and I am feeling like I got burned right now based on what I'm seeing in the rotation and and enough consistency so far yeah you know what there are some cases where you can just cut bait and run you know you got those really inefficient rookies again if you know if you feel like that's probably gonna burn you more than it's gonna help you I'm Thompson for example then you know what you're going to see him go to the wire a little bit more off and but it's it's not time to cut bait on everybody you know just one or two bad games does not mean that you should be sending guys to the wire I'm starting to see names like Josh Hart and Gary Trent Jr pop up on the wire and I just know that another week or two they're gonna be a great back up on rosters again and No One's Gonna remember that they had  that one bad week to start don't let that be you I'm I don't want to get into the specific names all too much I just Gary Trent is one of those guys that I just can't  fully figure out what he's gonna be with the Raptors this year I know he got some more action this last ball game because OG and Adobe was out and was this bouncing back and forth and it seems like they don't really feel like he's a part of their future but then he does still get a fair amount of playing time and anyway that's not even really the point of all of this stuff we got weekly things to discuss  so what you're saying is  a little is the short version yeah you're starting to stream a little now  well yeah I mean everything is good and smaller doses I don't think it's time to go full board and just flip over every single player that's bad right now I mean everyone has bad week and just because it's the first week doesn't mean it's gonna play out like that there is no trend for us to analyze yet and we as analysts do look at Trends so I mean three days it's very small sample size if you want to make you know if you want to infer too much out of that and of course that's on you sometimes you'll be right sometimes you'll be wrong but if you're trying to make moves a certain you just can't say that you have that certainty so it's time to err on the side of caution still maybe in another week or so is time to start really getting aggressive with those dreams I think Derek piece this week by the way has been pulled in front of the paywall over at sports though so it is a free preview week of the week ahead that's the name of the piece it is excellent and I'm going to pull straight from it while we talked today Derek who are the two game weeks this week what team should we be avoiding well I first off yeah I mean two game weeks are never ideal there is a little bit of nuance to this two game week that at least one of these two game weeks that I'm looking at right now so there's four teams playing a two-game week we got the Rockets the Clippers the Sixers and the Kings now among that group yes you're absolutely going to want to avoid the rockets and you're going to want to avoid the king's most of all I gave those to you know they were basically an equal running for the work schedule of the week the other two there is some redeeming qualities to them because really when you're looking for a stream you're looking for a minimum two games in a three-day window of time and you can actually get that from the other two two game teams so I do see a little bit of value in the Clippers and I do see a little bit of value in the Sixers because on that Thursday to Saturday stretch you do get two to three games or two out of three games from the Sixers and on the let me just see the schedule here we get a Tuesday Wednesday back to back for the Clippers so it's not that they're you know a terrible most of all costs it's just that  you're really taking them for just a three day period if you do take those players are you looking at which teams have three games in four nights and back to backs all throughout the week already absolutely yeah no way for me I like to make one move and stretch it as long as I can those are typically the most advantageous moves if you can turn one move into three or four bonus games on your on your roster and that's something I think you got to do every time situations might demand something different I'll be there's that player on a hot streak sometimes you just want to get them when you can but for me I tend to like to stretch my streams out as long as possible  are there any teams that fit that mold for you this week where the schedule is excellent say you know even four and six days today through Saturday stuff like that where you can make one move and you can get four games and then leave yourself a window to make a move on the back end or is there a team that's sort of towards the back end of the week that's stronger is that something you've already got laid out in front of you yeah not quite in those terms but I mean the best way to put it would be if you're looking at if you're looking at good ways to start the week I don't think there's a better team to start with the Orlando Magic you get a back-to-back Monday Tuesday you rested a on Wednesday which is also the busiest day of the schedule anyway so really you're not losing much on that rest day and then you come back again for a Thursday game where there's only four other team or three other games happening so I mean really there is a lot to be gained with an Orlando Magic stream this week I didn't actually give them my schedule of the week though because you can really close your week well with the Phoenix Sun and they don't play on Monday they start their first game on Tuesday which again is already because Tuesday has let me just see here three games their next game back you've got Thursday four games so another competitive Advantage by going with the Suns here and then they go into the weekend Saturday Sunday back to back on the road against Philadelphia and Detroit so I really think that you're going to get some really good value out of the top Suns players and if you can get a good  stream that makes sense for your league I think that's probably gonna be the most rewarding team to take this you said the kings were terrible schedule what makes there's so much worse than the other two gamers well it's it's not so much just that they're just that they're worse it's just that you're only getting one day a value remember I was saying before you want to get two and three days there is no such opportunity with the Kings right you've got well they're on the road and I don't think they're going to be back in Sacramento until next Wednesday I don't always like to go teams on the road for one because you know you're just kind of playing with you know more interpersonal variables and things like that I never trust the guys are gonna have as consistent performance as well they're on the road and then you've got the fact that you know the Kings don't start until Wednesday so you're going two days without production and you picking up if you are picking up a king's player you're getting them on the busy as day of the week you're resting two days if you keep that player and then you're picking them up again on Saturday um where you're not really going to see a lot of value there now I get I did say before there is the Rockets who are also on a two-game week they're actually going to be playing the Kings on Saturday but I kind of prefer their schedule and if we're looking at roster and the type of players that might be available to us as managers shopping on the waiver wire I think you're going to be looking at a better pool players from the Rockets So I did actually give the Kings the work schedule of the week not as much because of the teams are playing but because of what's going to be available to us and what value we can squeeze out of that again going a little bit further in there not touching too much on the players we're looking at but really I'm not too impressed with what's going on with the king's bench right now I'm not putting a lot of faith in them to even perform in those two games so it's just really just not a great time to be going with the non-star Kings Players let's just say yeah you've also got the issue now of deer and fox like being out for the week in a two game week so I think folks might be inclined to want to do some sort of replacing is that something you'd then wanted  talk them out of absolutely yeah no I'm not gonna try to talk you into taking the next guy up for for deer and fox it's not always a linear replacement now there's some players on that team I like I am personally a big fan of Malik Monk and Kevin huerter but they're not point guards they're certainly not going to get you the assist there's certainly not going to get you the steals I mean if they get you that kind of points I mean I wouldn't be surprised but it's not something I think you can count on so it's not like it's not like another sort of situation where you can do just go one for one if you are trying to replace your inbox there's gonna be better opportunities elsewhere  I'm looking at your actual now so there's a there's a The Weeknd piece which is live at sports ethos.com you'll have sort of like a  tandem piece that you've done on Twitter which is basically like your week two streaming strategy I think people listening probably want the specifics and you actually lined them out there who are some of the players you're looking at safe for tonight tomorrow or tonight tomorrow just to get the week started you have some names on your list yeah you got a ton of options to start the week I mean it's if you are looking to stream right off the bat I mean at 11 game day gives you countless options now I tend to believe that if you have 11 games you might not actually have space on your roster but if you do that gives you so many things to choose from the guys that I listed you're gonna see it on your screen right now I'm looking at Alec Burks Cole Anthony Gary Trent Jr or Jones Isaiah Stewart Jalen Suggs Kelly Olynyk keyonte George those are kind of my top streams there are some other guys that I might have included if Elon didn't limit the amount of characters I could use but you know what if you're looking at a top group of guys I think that's a good place to start there might be some other names available that might be a little bit harder predict depending on you know league but I think that's a good sample size for the teams you're looking for I tend to focus more on the teams and the players themselves and then within that team structure I tend to focus on the players that are available it's not always just about picking the best player for me I really do focus on that schedule and and those are just the teams that have the best options we already talked a little bit about the magic but um if you do have space on your roster and you want to get two games in three days you can start out the week with Detroit New Orleans Toronto and Utah as a good way to do that and then just kind of prepare to make your next move Thursday morning once you're done doing that two and three and as folks that are watching on YouTube can see and we'll go through some of his names here at Derek this special helpful because I'm fighting this laryngitis I get to keep throwing it back your direction you actually have in and eight I think it's an eight tweet guy here that gets you through first you got Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday  sort of a Friday Saturday chunk and I'm scrolling down through it as we're doing it kind of double up on Friday yeah you see that extra day coming in there okay so let's go through some of these things here because I think people want to play in a head all so who are some of the names that that folks can see on Tuesday on Wednesday on Thursday if they want to plan a few days in advance now so Tuesday this one's kind of an iffy proposition right now just because I think we're kind of questioning the value of some of the players on the Spurs but for me I'm still focused on Jeremy Sohan is a great value add if he is available in your league I know he kind of didn't really do much in his last game but the Spurs again they hit that two and three Mark that I'm always looking for with the stream you've got to get multiple games out of a player and I think Jeremy Sohan is most likely to be the standard League guy or the highest available standard League guy from from the Spurs now if you are lucky enough to go to the wire and you're able to see a guy like a Max screws or Isaac akoro that I'm just go for it go for it don't don't wait don't question drop who you need to drop in order to get them busy on the way they're playing and the fact that they're about to go on to a back to back to Tuesday Wednesday some other names are going to see their bones Hyland Josh Hart I've already touched on him a little bit I am a Perpetual Norman Powell advocate so I always love streaming him whenever I need some points that's  a bit of a hot and cold player but I tend to be a Raptors fan trust that he's gonna have those hot games and Quentin so those are some of the other names that I'm looking at for a really solid value stream on that day excuse me coughing into the microphone right right at the perfect opportunity let me actually pivot you away from not necessarily just week ahead because that is what we're covering on this show but thinking thinking more slightly longer term what are some of the things you've seen over this first week as kind of like call it a weekend review almost things that you're excited about as we move forward things you're excited about even just for week two players that you're excited about surprises things like that what's been the stuff that's and I guess it could be good or bad on that front well I mean I have to start by saying that I am absolutely in love with what Jalen Duren is doing oh my God don't think I'm in the minority here we've all taken our time to go over what he's doing I do have him in a couple of weeks and he has been a godsend for me  on the flip side you know what I've been actually really disappointed in what I'm seeing from Memphis overall this year now I'm seeing some some good individual performances I'm not disappointed in the numbers that I'm seeing from Bain and Jared Jackson in particular but if we think about what we were saying before the draft happened before our fantasy drafts happened before the league started you know all things considered we've got Steven Adams though we've got John Moran down everyone saying you know this is time for them to really exceed their value this is time for them to do more than what they were doing last year and in German Jackson's case I would say he's doing equal or less and Desmond Bane's case I think he's doing a bit the same but I am not with his efficiency going down that bench I'm not really seeing a lot of a lot of value outside of maybe an Xavier Tillman who is performing well statistically but again the team started out owing three and their first week and they're trying to get into the playoffs they're not off to a good start and I tend to be concerned about teams with with questionable questionable Vibes let's say I'm super super super super impressed with what we're getting out of the rookie class especially defensively I'm a guy that always tends to prioritize efficiency and stocks and I think there's just so many defensive studs that we've already seen come out of this class I mean I'm going to count chat as a member of this class even though technically he's not him and Victor Ram minyama are some of the most elite shot blockers I've ever seen certainly of their generation and I think that a guy like Derek Lively with the maps has a lot of potential to be there too he certainly hitting a little bit earlier than I expected to and he's someone that I've got really highly ranked as a potential value added streamer or rest of season at starting this week on Dallas is four game week another guy who I think is just flying under the radar I don't how you can do that as a second overall pick but Brandon Miller just doesn't seem to be getting any attention at all and to me he's actually outperforming what I protected from him as you know as a rookie I expected a lot more and efficiency a little bit less consistency with the schooling and it looks like he's doing really  well and settling in really well so far so I'm going to be really paying attention to what's going on there um  just really haven't gotten over my heartbreak with the Paul Reed thing yet I mean that's that's all that's playing in the back of my head well I'm talking is just don't don't say anything bad about Paul Reed don't jinx it but yeah yeah you know what I'm just I bought all the stock and it's just it's a penny stock now unfortunately yeah I mean this is one of those situations where a coach said all the things that we all wanted to hear and then through three games he's not played a single minute alongside Joel embiid and that pretty much ruins whatever opportunity they have you know what I'm a Raptors fan so seeing nurses kind of wonky rotations and not using the bench is not an unfamiliar thing and for me it's really easy to say that he's not going to change his Pace I'm not expecting the bench to do anything and less there's an injury so frankly I'm just oh now I'm beat eventually will miss some ball games so it's true in those you'll talk about streamers so I think that'll be a good time for me to come in that's right that's Burger boy City baby that's a three birds I have had a burger boy yet because I didn't want to do it on week one but  maybe we'll get a maybe we'll throw some some of them sandwiches up for week two let me do a couple of questions here from the chat room related to the weekend my blouses says are you starting yakka portal or Kevon Looney they both have four games this week so we're thinking weekly line up here  so for me it's normally in any other week or if I hadn't been watching so much Raptors basketball I would almost always say turtle something is going wrong right now he is not getting minutes he is not performing well in those minutes and I think actually if precious actual hadn't become doubtful for today he was actually going to be the Raptors player that I recommended as a streamer because I'm expecting him at this point to get equal or more playing time to portal Looney on the other hand I think you're you're basically getting the same sort of average production you're losing a little bit of the blocks that hurt a lot offers but you're probably going to get a little bit back on free throws and you're probably going to keep your turnovers a little bit lower as a result I just prefer Looney's consistent see if I'm being honest so in in this week I'm going to say Looney but going forward I wouldn't count that as something as foregone conclusion will say let's do one more from Frank because it's another weekly lineup decision Keegan Murray with two games or Chris Middleton with three and I don't I'm you probably have it right in front of you do the Bucks have to the back to back this week because that would be a middle-aged you know they're doing three and five and there's only really one valuable game for the bucks this week they're playing Monday and Wednesday which are both double digit game weeks so I mean Chris Middleton's disorder player that you can start him with confidence in those games but it's it's got to be hard to know what to say with Middleton right now I mean the Bucks are not great at communicating but his status we know that he's dealing with injuries to his right everything his left everything and so you can never really be sure what is going to happen now you and I think are going to agree that when he played he's just he got out there he's he's a potential top 50  producer so that's kind of value that you just don't leave on your bench so until we hear that he's injured I have to assume that he's the better player between between him and Marie that's my choice  no disrespect to worry though I love him yeah he's off to a really nice Darkness share um let's see head all right we're picking two for tonight in an overflow lineup  the choices are Walker Kessler Xavier Tillman brute wait we're picking two out of  five Kessler or Tillman oh so one Center and the Bruce Brown and then gtj or Reeves I think yes so one Center one other I would guess so Walker Kessler Xavier Tillman is the center Choice Bruce Brown Gary Trent Austin Reeves is the as the non-central for Walker Kessler I still might go his Direction despite it  because yeah we got to look at who played too I mean like they're playing the Nuggets tonight the day being the Jazz so I mean who's on the Nuggets that they're gonna need a center for nobody yeah right so I think Kessler is getting they're gonna need every bit of tester tonight I mean yo catches and he's everything so you're going to need someone out there who's defensively oriented and who's gonna be able to take on that challenge Kessler has to be the guy you take on this now again big advocate for Tillman in any other circumstance I tell you to start them but if it's one or the other it's got to be careful you're just you can't avoid those blocks and you know the minutes are going to be there for a player that's guarding a former and BP yeah and possible MVP again with the way this season's often run and um and now of the other three this is a toughie because Austin Reeves looks totally gassed possibly from Team USA stuff he's just not himself yet eventually the legs are gonna get underneath them but what day that happens we don't know what's the latest on OG I actually it was gonna dig into that in a minute here but if he's out then you're sorted down to Gary Trend or Bruce Brown I'm probably personally going Bruce Brown I just like the across the board stuff but maybe you take a shot on Gary Trent and hope that oh geez out and he hits four or five three-pointers that I don't know between those two I probably lean Bruce  yeah so for me I think we're agreed that we're crossing Reeves off the list right now we just need to see a little bit more for him  and then Bruce Brown versus Gary Trent Jr that's a bit of a tricky one for me because Gary Trent Jr is about to go play Portland yeah his former team and also probably one of the worst teams in the league so I mean that's that's a recipe for Revenge game and there's probably not a lot of people there to stop him I think he's gonna want to have a really good game tonight and I think this is a good recipe for for a breakout performance for him having said that we haven't seen it yet and I just I know Bruce Brown's playing well so why why go against him right now and is going to be playing against who they have night Chicago that's a very winnable game they're gonna need a multi-tool player like Bruce Brown out there and I think I think he just take the safe pick right now if you're not sure go with safe I'm trying to figure out if I can find one more here we go one more weekly lineup decision question Nas read or onyeka okongwu weekly lineup decision here  hmm okay Minnesota's three Minnesota's three games Atlanta is also three games they're playing on the same days as well actually they they play each other on the first the first game of the week so that's a fun little twist for you there it's got to be okay move for me I mean I just love his potential to produce defensive stats rebounds and just keep his efficiency really high he's not shooting a lot from the field or from the free throw lines he's not really gonna hurt you at all there but I know that he's gonna give you plus value as a rebounder he's probably going to be one of yours better steals producers as a center and you know that he's one of the best blocks guys in you know in the league now as read you know what as soon as there's an injury in the Wolves sign up I'm gonna be all over him and it's hard for me to resist adding him to my to my team even with Karl Anthony towns and Ruby gobert there but the reality is that they're there and I just see more competition for playing time for Reed versus Socom Luke and reading more offensive oriented player I think that he's more a  there's more variability to how he can impact your team whereas I know Uncle was going to come out with that defensive Focus that's basically what he's there to do and so you should count on him to do that and as read he might get hot he might get cold  he is deep ball b ball on social media he is Derek ball in real life last question for you Derek before I send you off into the abyss um towards the end of this week since you and I are not going to talk between now and next Monday what would you recommend Focus do for the weekend is there a good plan of attack for Saturday Sunday even into Monday of next week like sort of a rollover streaming idea yeah absolutely so for me I always try to if I don't have my last move used up by Friday I've got a plan to use most of my moves by Friday because again I'm looking at that two and three window we had said a little bitter that that tweet thread that I had made before I kind of doubled up on my Friday advice because that's the real last day that you can squeeze value out of week two and I'll touch on what we can do to prepare for week three read after I finish this one up but basically from Saturday onwards you've only got two teams that can give you two games that's a Charlotte and Phoenix so unless you know that you're going to go out there and you're going to get a really good Hornets or a really good son streamer you kind of have to burn through all of your moves on Friday in order to make sure you get in real value added place and with that in mind you've got Brooklyn Chicago Denver Indiana on a Friday Saturday backpack if you are able to make a second move after that Saturday back to back you can still make a play for Sunday which will actually give you a three and three every single day with one dreaming spot will be filled if you don't have that last move to make and you're kind of making your final move on Friday then you're looking at teams that have a two and three schedule to close out the week so you're looking at Cleveland you're looking at Dallas you're looking at the Warriors you're looking at the Grizzlies and you're looking at the Blazers so after you do have a lot of options to close out the week you just have to make sure that you're not leaving any of your if you do have weekly moves you're not leaving any on the table because by the time it comes to Saturday you really don't have any options to have value added moves and what are we doing here unless we're trying to get a competitive Advantage now say you're on Sunday or you're just trying to make your final move and you're already looking towards week three there are let me see here  one two three four teams that can that can get you a final value added play on Sunday if you are looking to make a move into next week because we've got Dallas Detroit Golden State Golden State in San Antonio on a Monday or on a Sunday Monday back to back now that's not going to help you when you're weak in week two but it is going to help you get an expert Advantage for week three again we're looking for value added we're looking for ways to maximize our moves and make them stretches as far as we can't so if you're going on to Sunday you have one move left and you do want to start preparing for your next matchup you should be looking at guys like Burks Derek Lively Isaiah Stewart Jeremy Sohan Kevin Lewis's Moody and a bunch of other players from those teams that I just made I love it  thank you sir it's been a pleasure pleasure  love being here with you love talking basketball he's the man he's the man with an actual plan you know you can say that expression but this is where we're actually talking about a weekly plan he is at d-ball b-ball on social media go find him immediately Derek until next Monday  and it's been a pleasure  that dude knows his damn weekly crap  he's so far ahead of the rest of us that's why I like to have him on because I haven't really looked past Wednesday on most of my stuff and he has and all so  a really couldn't do enough another solo show my voice is gonna completely fall out the bottom of my throat I do want to cover just a couple things very quickly here we're not done with today's show yet there's some more questions in the chat room that were not about weekly lineup stuff that I'll hit on a few of those IRS also some really funny comments in the chat room that I want to make sure you guys see and I read out loud I also want to go through a couple of the injured players for that are making weekly lineup decisions will do that as the very last thing before we sign off so let's start working our way through that also quick reminder here mid-show please check out our buddies at manscaped.com use

I'll do it again on this one this is the handyman's box you can see how small it is because I'm a small dude and there's there's your scale size of my shoulder basically and then the actual device inside is like I don't know maybe about yay big so pretty sweet travel electric razor and my new lawn mower 5.0 should be coming in the mail any day now and then I'll be showing off that glistening new device right here on some of the shows as well a couple of the questions that were not related to a weekly lineup show um Charleston says hey Dan what do you think about any of the arrest of season top 90 can you rank Danny Melton Delon Wright Naz Reid in a vacuum no I don't think he's top 90 I'm a little bit lower I think on avdija than most or then some because he doesn't hit that many threes he turns the ball over a lot his percentages kind of hurt last year combination of rebounds assistance steals is fine but look he's playing 24 minutes a game right now through their first two and he's number one and 154 full starters minutes he could get to 90 but that would mean full starters minute Spacey every night and so that's why I'm a little bit down on that  Sheldon asks are you picking up keonte George or waiting I think I'm picking up  now because I think something magical is about to happen in the next couple of days in fact I think this type of stuff the keonte situation feels like the kind of one where a lot of fantasy analysts are going to be like poking and prodding and asking why are they not moving him into the starting lineup and it's going to end up taking longer for it to actually happen in real life but I I actually think you can pick them up because I think we found some drops over the last few days guys that just have shown that they're not gonna have a role or the role that we were potentially hoping they might have over the first week someone like a tail and Horton Tucker who you know had a massive preseason but we got to the regular season and it's all the same old crap over and over again so guys that I think are droppable  and if you have sort of that dead weight which is effectively what these guys are that are outside the top 200 you might as well pick up someone with a little bit of upside like George and see what happens and if nothing happens then you move on to the next one this is a very funny comment from show s who agrees with me Dan looks like Marc Gasol  and I don't agree  I haven't gotten too many look-alike lately when I was younger I loved a lot like MTV Jon Stewart like pre Daily Show Jon Stewart  that's probably the closest one I've gotten I'm gonna like look I'm gonna put a picture of Marcus sole up on the YouTube screen here so you guys can see it and I I don't think that I don't think you're going to agree that this is anything but there you go  I'm not seeing it  here wait  there's the face yeah I'm not seeing it  next comment says Marcus sole looks more like Josh Lloyd than Dan in my opinion and then everybody's laughing because damn it that actually is a really funny back and forth and then Charleston's wondering why they show his five minutes late dance checking to see if you looks like Marc Gasol and shaving his hairy chest because that was a comment that was from earlier in the chat room you guys are amazing um let's see what else we got here Adam asks Chris Paul or Derek Wright white rest of season I think if you're just going straight  nine cat ranking it's probably gonna be Derek white but Chris Paul is going to get you that those those precious assists that everybody's always hunting from the mid rounds and so that might be a reason to go the Chris Paul Direction  More name recognition than Derek white people may just not fully appreciate how good he is all though I know Derek white just had a gigantic ball game so  perhaps now is the moment when people are appreciating how good he is but this is one of those ones that to me is a little bit more team dependent straight nine cat though Derek white is probably the answer to that question  Jay Wizz says I won my cat leg and I lost my sleeper League not bad for a basketball Noob yeah man way to go I hope that we've been able to help a little bit along the way  nil says my worst players are Xavier Tillman Jalen Johnson Jeremy Grant her I drop one of them for a streaming slot  no probably not Tillman in my eyes would be the one that might get an axe in weeks in Memphis is not playing a giant front Court  you go says 10-man points League do I drop Moses Moody for Max strus yes do I drop Walker Kessler for Rob Williams know Rob Williams is already sitting out a game for rest that's gonna be a fatty fat headache the rest of the way  Marco says his jailing a keeper for a points League  yeah I think for points I'm good with it  because all of Jalen Green's issues are the categories that points League sort of disfavor the percentage is turnovers things like that category leases a hard no  who has a bigger weeks Xavier Tillman or Jalen Johnson  Memphis has four games so probably Tillman you go with the extra ball game if it's just per game it's Johnson but because you get the extra game out of Tillman I think you go that way  John says someone dropped Zach Collins in my league and I'm debating on whether to drop the lawn right Kyle Lowry or Derek Lively you're dropping Kyle Lowry John that's a pretty easy call  Khan says dan you said Jalen Duren is a high who might be able to Garner a third round to think the Aaron Fox is a possible Target I don't think you'll be able to get Darren Fox because he scores too much and his name is is too busy although the fact that he just got hurt maybe gives you an opportunity so try it I doubt it works but you never know maybe that team is thinking I can't deal with an injury right now and blah blah blah  also what are your thoughts on Jonathan kaminga um my don't have that many thoughts on coming guys I think he's generally a little bit fantasy overrated mostly because he can do some stuff like he can do a few across the board things but he has issues with percentages with turnovers with the trust of Steve Kerr and he heard his knee in their last ball game so that sort of caps out any chance for him to do a whole bunch of stuff  eighteen says Turtles on the way over and my points League should I drop Daniel Gafford Xavier Tillman to pick him up thank you I think I probably would drop Tillman for him  but if nobody's scooping him up I guess you could let it go  yeah I think I'd probably rather have Turtle over Tillman Alex Russo and Nas Reed worth a pickup um I picked up nasreen a couple of spots interested to see how that goes because if he actually gets 2425 minutes a game he would be a fantasy value but maybe we just got a little bit lucky the first two  hey Dan this is too bad today says I just traded Xavier Tillman for our neck of hongwu what do you think about it I love it  great job  yeah great trade  Aaron says should I start scoot Conley Orion day tonight only one guard slot open I'll go safe and all go Mike Conley  Neil says you recently gained three viewers from our league from Germany your content is Now official proof for player of evaluation thanks man you know how hard it you know the problem  among the many problems among being a fantasy analyst but one of the big ones is if people find you and they like your advice they're not going to tell anybody about you  it's really hard so anytime you guys are kind enough to let somebody know that's a competitor that you like me and then they find me two and you lose your competitive advantage that's like the ultimate sacrifice you're making I really appreciate that show s says more like Steve from American Dad I'm pretty sure that's the kid yeah I'm a little bit of a dweeb I'm okay with that  he says he's kidding that's fine we're just having some fun our cakes son says what kind of expectations should we have for Trey Murphy any news on him coming back soonish now I think we're still probably about a month out  and I don't actually know that he's gonna have a spectacular role on that team because they're playing well  and they have all three of their big usage guys  kuzma ranking 4 Points league question mark pretty good I mean issues are field goal and free throw percent so  yeah I mean he should have been someone that went relatively early you know I  I don't have much to add there he's  yeah he's a good points League value  there's been a quest that I put a picture of Steve from American Dad up on the screen so let's do that now YouTubers getting a delightful little bonus here  he is does that mean  his eyebrows are kind of high should I raise mine up should I do one at a time  like Dwayne The Rock Johnson used to do we'll leave Steve from American Dad up there for a minute I hope I don't get a copyright issue for this let's take that down  so says her is my worst player in an 11-man Roto League I need threes do I keep him or stream his spot  if you have a games cap you definitely keep him because you need threes if there's no games cap you probably stream it  freaky says is there anyone you're projecting could earn a bigger role you know I haven't really gone that far down the rabbit hole yet  if you really like this is the type of stuff we should be doing in January so let's just say no right now  let's just say no  easy answer no  will Royce O'Neill Jake asks be a top one 20 player and Nine Cats once that team is healthy know  Kevo says what's up with Kessler yeah you know what I don't entirely know he also had a Team USA experience like Austin Reeves and for some reason some of these guys have kind of come back come back and been a little goofy  ah I think maybe Utah's just making him earn it a little bit but he's the center of the future so I think we'll get around on it pretty soon  Cano says rank them nazre Wendell Carter Junior Derek Lively Robert Williams uh let's go  hmm Robert Williams is getting all these days off so he can't possibly be at the top of the board for Head to Head Roto if you don't care about the days off that that puts him first  Head to Head its probably Wendell at the top  and then  Time Lord the nas then Lively Rodeo it's probably Time Lord that Nas  then when Wendell then Lively  freaky says that's facts about not wanting to tell the league numbers about fantasy analysts yeah it's tough man we can't win by Word of Mouth we have to try to spread through every other way  folks picture this nightmare scenario you're hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're

1995  to no no actually I think was really that 19 and yeah 1995 to 1998 but I got the accent down  I still remember a handful a little itty bit though I still remember a little bit of Spanish and I can read it and really sound like I know what I'm doing but I won't have the first bleeping clue what I'm saying  I do remember swear words though so at least I got that going for me  quote Bill Murray from Caddyshack so I got that Goin for me  Pratt asks should I trade Turtle for Terry Rozier yeah I'm fine with that  depends what your team needs at that one  not Zod says 11 category Head to Head Dynasty legal we're getting into the Weeds on this one I have the chance to trade Tyrese Maxey and Nicola vouch of itch  oh wooch Maxi and vouch for demonic bonuses is a good trade I have yokich and Shane and like the idea of owning playmaking Biggs yeah it's probably an okay deal I don't know what the intent and 11th categories are so that does complicated a little bit  if this was nine cat  I might say stay puts I think Tyreese Max he's gonna have an absolutely monstrous year I don't know what the 10th and 11th categories are you know what stay put  Maxi might beat sabonis this year  different kind of game yeah but whatever  show says this is my first year playing fantasy basketball your show has been a great help that's awesome thanks man appreciate you watching and hilarious commentary actually I might even appreciate the commentary more  Daniel bendy says I'm almost bummed that I already got Jaylen Johnson last pick in the draft because he was the most obvious pickup last week fiending for some early season steals gotta love the B150 for the wreck though yeah I mean I guess that's a little bit of a letdown but you just have to find your joy in a different thing the joy isn't in making the quickest pickup the joy is in laughing at your opponents that you drafted the guy that you know they all went to go try to pick up when Johnson had that first big ball game on Wednesday of last week everybody in your league was like oh should I pick him up and then they were like ah are Benny drafted him  so  enjoy that  Rodeo ball says is it worth trying to trade Paul George for Jayson Tatum or another first round guy yeah worth it worth a try it's probably not gonna work but you could try  Samuel says can't decide who's my worst player I need to drop one choices are Gordon Hayward Derek Lively Xavier Tillman Benedict matheran and Azure Thompson it's not as her hold on to him  I would hold on to Tillman  it's between Gordon Hayward Derek Lively and Benedict mathura and it's probably Derek Lively because do I Powell was healthy for their last game and Lively only got what 12 13 minutes something like that I think Jason kids gonna be mixing and matching at the center spot basically all year long and that's going to be a huge pain in the Tucker  you go says what's up with giddy  he hadn't all right first game then two relatively Dead games do I look at moving him at a points League ah no you don't try to move a guy after two quite games you move guy after big ones and frankly I think he'll be fine in points League's but you guys I mean you guys watched all my preseason shows I am not high on giddy  I think he's fine but his job wasn't getting any bigger Ryan says OG is expected to play by the way oh yeah I forgot to mention that I saw that flash passed on Twitter while I was talking to Derek a few minutes ago OG and Obi is expected to play so I'm expecting kind of a Wimpy little game out of Derek White  not what am I saying Derek white Gary Trent all over the map here when you're reading one thing and saying another  how much Fab would you drop on Walker Kessler on Echo Kang Woo is a hundred dollar Fab budget so this is like a Yahoo public prize league for references Xavier Tillman went for five bucks Derek Lively went for four Walker Kessler I'd probably drop a solid a solid 15 bucks on right now because people are freaking out I might even go higher and okanga white probably go 10 or 11 maybe go 11 to try to beat out somebody who puts a round number in there but you're gonna want to use a decent size chunk you're not going to go too much bigger than that I don't think I'd go bigger than 21 on Kessler but when he gets this thing turned around that's a guy that has a chance to be a top 50 dude and those guys are big deal so don't don't go too low on this one so maybe you go 21 and 11  you can Ace yourself out of pick ups later but probably worth it  are you still high on Dylan right yeah I think you can be a top 75 guy in 2425 minutes just like he did last year Jason says best fantasy basketball show on YouTube I hope my league-mates don't watch thanks Jason this is again how the hell am I gonna spread the word about sports ethos and Dan Bass Pros as a human if y'all won't tell each other you're killing me Smalls  is I'm in Thompson a pickup not yet  you think LeBron might be out today last report was that he was probable  and I really do think the Lakers want to open the season two and two they don't want to get into one of those holes like they did last year and they have a hard hard schedule to start the year  and the magic are a good ball Club but you know they're not the nuggets and they're not the Superstar son's and they're not the Kings they're not quite to that level so the Lakers see this game as one that they want to win here early  and if anything you may have seen the Lakers take yesterday off but they played that one so I think the play in this one too  do Padre's back any concern over cam Johnson do you think injuries are going to be a recurring thing yeah a little bit a little bit he's been banged up throughout his NBA career and so that is kind of annoying but at this point you just gotta wait it out  Marco Delon writer Jalen green in a points League Jalen green Daniel Benny way too early most improved player of the year prediction boom  this usually ends up going to somebody who just got a bigger role as opposed to somebody who  actually got a whole heck of a lot better but it's obvious I mean Jalen Duren right now  is went from like nothing to Superstar  which is not true because again  I don't think anybody told you to pick him up earlier than I did last year which is pretty rare for me in a rookie  that's usually the way this thing goes  Tyrese Maxey has a massive year he'd be in the running  um  I don't think it's gonna be on a Spurs unless they really get their act together  and it doesn't feel like that's happening anytime soon  Kade has a shot if you want to stay in Detroit  Jordan Poole if Washington isn't a complete disaster  hmm  those are probably the best ones  yeah how about those Jeremy Grant versus Brook Lopez to start tonight in Roto give me brolo I think he's ready for the broke out game somebody dropped Bradley Beal what  how much Fab would you drop on him possibly all of it  that's absurd that's a guaranteed top 60 player  why on Earth would somebody drop Bradley Beal you're going to put yourself in a real fab behold but you should be spending more than half of your annual budget to get a fifth round pick off the waiver wire seven days into the season at least 51 dollars maybe more  Jason says good point I will yell from the mountain tops to watch your show thanks Jason you know longer hurt my heart now you fill my heart with happiness like the kids book that talks about everybody's different emotions this is one my heart feels  glad  could you see Kelly oubre being Sixth Man of the Year ah depends a heavily on the hardened stuff because if Harden gets traded they're going to get a bunch of dudes back that are all going to take his stuff  the only way this works is of hardened just sits out for four months and that would be horrible for all of us so probably not all right folks good luck this week's at your lineups  thanks to Derek at d-ball b-ball I am at Dan best Bruce like great subscribe on the way out back tomorrow will break down the big Monday card and I think we're going to be talking to Raphael Johnson of NBC Sports slash Rotoworld Manana if I can get that scheduling worked out that would be sweet by the way also good news Jaden McDaniels just got cleared to play for  later tonight so he'll make his season debut don't expect him to play a full 35 minutes though so just sit on that one a little bit longer oh I don't know forgot to do no more questions sorry guys to those that are here at the end and everybody started to sign off and then I remember there was something I wanted to do and that was talked about the guys that are game time decisions Kyrie Irving is a game time decision  he's apparently dealing with a a foot issue this kind of came out of nowhere  but the Mavs believe have a four game week so he's a start  Devin Booker is probably a Sit since considering he's doubtful for their game tomorrow it is a four game week so maybe you still get two out of him if you really want to roll the dice makes me pretty nervous he's 50/50 I wouldn't kill you if you started him but if you want to play it safe you can do that Donovan Mitchell is questionable for the Cavaliers for their next game it's a four-game week I'm gonna try them out there because I think we get two maybe three out of him  let's keep going down the board here James Harden's and no LeBron is a yes bam is a yes he's been playing through stuff although he just did get downgraded to questionable so that would take him down to just a two-game week  by bam also plays through stuff so I think you're almost definitely getting two games out of him  Darius Garland is it is a tough one he's got ruled out a Tuesday's game a day in advance Cavaliers as we just talked about have a four game week but it seems like you're getting cut down to probably two at most out of him so I think I would bench Garland your benching Nick's in your benching dear and fox your benching cam Johnson your benching Bradley Beal your benching Jared Allen Tyrese Maxey is questionable with a hand injury he's a start he's been amazing so far and I'm thinking he's gonna try to go if he can  Klay Thompson has a game time decision tag right knee soreness that's probably them trying to figure out if they want him to play in a back-to-back he's a start because this is not a real thing Time Lord is already out for one half of the back-to-back three games of him versus four of somebody else you could probably find somebody playing for that's how far do we need to go on this thing Daniel Gafford has been downgraded to out for Monday's game that's a huge pain in the butt just two games in in a second one was a pretty good one which means that he is now down to a two-game week so Daniel Gafford is a bench in a two-game week bench in a two-game week obviously boy and Madonna's Trey Murphy the third those guys are still benched tari Eason benched beats a zubats dealing with a quad injury and the Clippers I believed and we just talked about them having a two game week so zubats is a bench as well and that is as far as we will go  we got one more question right at the very end Tommy went Nguyen says start CP3 Crown keyonte George in a points League I'll go Chris Paul on that one  okay this one longer than I expected I got to go get my kid a preschool we'll be back tomorrow to break down the big Monday card and we'll talk to you then so long for now everybody see you guys over on social activists
