welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right I decided there was enough time to wedge in a second show but we gotta knock this one out in nine minutes or less that's my goal welcome to streamer Edition second episode today of fantasy NBA today I'm Dan Vasquez my Twitter handle is at Dan best price  I'm on a mission here let's talk about streaming  first of all we're making this board big on the screen so you guys that are watching with us live you get that little visual aid of course this is a sports ethos presentation what you're looking at right now is a Dan best Bruce version color coded edition of the sports ethos streaming chart for this season one of many very good reasons to get an NBA fantasy pass either for the rest of this year or for next season actually the all sports we should get right now so you get the baseball stuff too  best schedule starting today Friday March the 8th I'm just gonna do a quick scroll through on the boards you guys can see what we're looking at right now there's March the 8th the best way to look at this just visually is to see the teams where some sort of color coding begins on March the 8th and the teams where that happens are Charlotte  Cleveland gets a semi and the Portland Trail Blazers  the best schedule over the next seven days belongs to the Portland Trail Blazers they play five games in seven days that is the best long streaming option on the board there are two back-to-backs wedged in there it's it's unmatched now of course the issue will get to in a moment is Who the hell's actually playing for the Trailblazers the second best schedule if you're going to go long streaming is the Charlotte Hornets they go six games over nine days it's almost as good as the five and seven but there is another one day on one day off in the middle of Charlotte's they've got bookended back-to-backs there otherwise if they were closer it would be a five and seven so it goes to and then off on off on off and then another two for Charlotte the third best schedule and they're pretty far behind in this one is the Cleveland Cavaliers because they play today they're off tomorrow but then they go back to back Saturday or Sunday Monday so they give you a nice little boost rolling into your next week it's not the best schedule to start next week that belongs to the Spurs we'll talk about them as far as tomorrow streaming goes  I think the Spurs are the only team Boston has a back-to-back but they don't have anybody to stream to start next week so they'd also be a pretty good schedule starting tomorrow but you know the hell with that so then you say all right Dan well who do I abandon ship on well it's the same as yesterday believe it or not you taught not only had the worst schedule yesterday two games in eight days  they're still the worst schedule two games in seven days starting today it didn't really get any better sorry Jazz your schedule still suck so it didn't it does get much better at the end of that  Indiana and Sacramento a distant second place in worst schedules right now Sacramento goes one time over the next four days that game is on Sunday but then they have a back-to-back immediately following that Indiana same thing they go one time over the next four days that game again just like Sacramento is on Sunday they go back to back Tuesday Wednesday of next week so just kind of a bad two-day or four day if you want to call it that span for Indian Sacramento before it gets better Lakers schedule is about to get really bad but they do go two times in the next three days Minnesota is I believe basically the same as the Lakers they go two times in the next three days and then just like La two game week coming up next week so that's problematic for those clubs but you don't have to worry about that until after the weekend if you don't want to okay Dan who the hell am I actually playing on these garbage teams you're talking about  well here's the thing it can get a little bit goofy so we got to start with Portland because they have the best schedule of those teams I'm going to actually help with a visual aid for those that are curious on this front let's do this one make sure you guys aren't seeing anything on my Twitter feed you shouldn't be there we go potential volume stream player so the Blazers do up wreath is a nice one because DeAndre 8 and sounds like he's out for a little bit longer dylano Banton is interesting he's not gonna put up giant numbers but again five games and seven nights you pretty much take anything Chris Murray Keegan's brother not great but again five games in seven Knights even if he only averages like nine points four rebounds and a steal  one assist you're still talking about you know 45  20 rebounds five assists five steals like that's that's something you're probably not gonna get out of somebody playing three games over those next seven days a Jabari Walker and timani Kamara are some of the more interesting players in this group but they're both questionable for Portland's game tonight so you can't really make that call until later on this evening they play at 7 they wanted the late games tonight so you have to wait a while most likely to get the injury report although those are two of the guys that I would lean towards one of the name that I didn't tweet out that I want to throw in there would be screwed Henderson he may come back at some point if we find out that he's coming back tonight they'll be gentle with him I'm sure but five games of bad percentages but possible volume could be worse while up next day my next team I mentioned was the Charlotte Hornets oops I forgot to put that on the screen there they are so there's the names you just saw for Portland now I'm actually using the visual aid I was claiming to use before Charlotte Grant Williams sees on some rosters he's not on others Visalia I miss it would be one of my favorite here if he hasn't been picked up yet because Cody Martin's out for two weeks Trey man is likely already rostered so that would be a tough one but would certainly be a favorite as well and then Davis Burton's kind of reach in this group but he's playing between 20 and 25 minutes and we know when he's out there he wants to Chuck so you might get two and a half three pointers out of Burton's six games and nine nights again it's the number here for Charlotte you can get any of those first three guys Grant Williams mitsch man or even like if somebody dropped Nick Richards that's great because you don't have to do anything for 10 days six games in nine nights even if they're bad it'll still be good enough same kind of story for Burton's the only problem there is there is a chance he just stops playing halfway through  so that was a tougher one for me to actually give my seal of approval on and then Cleveland who I mentioned was the sort of distant third place they go three games in four nights so you'd have to move off of these guys starting early next week not the first day but pretty early next week Georges niang Sam Merrill Dean Wade safer than the other two but his Fantasy game is also wimpy or Merrill or niang whichever one is starting for Max Strauss is probably the direction you lean in in that duo because you hope that you can now get those three games like the streus missed those three even if you Misses two maybe you get sort of a backup level game out of those guys for the other one that would still be worth it we're talking about the Yang and Merrill and then Carousel and Isaac okoro or probably rostered already because Cleveland remembers started a five and seven span three days ago so they should have been picked up on Tuesday but should any of these guys still be floating around you could use them for this kind of short span today through Monday and then get the hell out of the way after that because they go two games over six days after Monday the Cavaliers their schedule goes from extremely loaded to very light as it tends to be when teams are coming off of those five in seven runs that's it ladies and gentlemen wanted to do it in nine minutes or less thank you to those that showed in here on Twitter
