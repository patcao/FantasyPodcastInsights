welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right folks it's the second half of our  two first  two for Tuesday  it's two for Tuesday  two for every day right now streaming time here on fantasy NBA today  a sports ethos.com presentation I am Dan Vespers today is a big day a pivotal day for streaming because  today is the beginning of the quality days this week I always think of Martin Lawrence and bad boys says he wants to get some quality time  we need some quality days  today four games  tomorrow a dozen  Thursday two games Friday a dozen  or is Friday  Friday 13 know it's a dozen Saturday three games Sunday  a scant 10 games  if you planned way ahead which we tried to help out with Thursday Friday shows last week our streaming episodes  you may have been able to game it out  so that and Yahoo public leagues you only have a three-player bench so it's a little bit easier  to make it so that you're at exactly 10 guys  on Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday  and a lot of its gonna be really hard to not be on overflow if you have 14 slots or 15 slots like you're going to be over on Wednesday and Friday there's almost no way around it but for instance  personally you know as I was telling you guys what to do I was eyeballing one of my League's  I mean one Yahoo public prize League that's head-to-head  and I hate it it's so terrible format to have the way the Fab is set up for daily head to head leaks at city audit and the league goes to the second to last week of the Season everything about is just idiotic but I'm in one and so last week as I was talking about it I was able to look at my own League where I had a Buy in the first round of the playoffs last week so then I'm looking towards this week and I'm saying okay well Monday I have nine guys I had nine out of my 13 dudes playing so last week I made one roster move and I picked up I think it was Santi aldama to round out my Monday it was nice he was on the waiver wire that was a cool one to get  and then I looked ahead I was like all right who do I have on the quiet days okay quiet days I had basically Anthony Davis that was it for today I think  so then I started to dig a little bit deeper trying to figure out how I wanted to do the rest of the week or maybe I had might have had 11 I may have been one over on Monday but it was like a  repeated  roster slot in any event I was able to  move somebody's around this is this is the important part don't matter the exact sequence of events and I picked up Malik Beasley  bucks cuz they go Tuesday Thursday Saturday  and prior to the week even starting I also picked up Brandon ski who  he's only one quiet day but at least he's four games starting today for the rest of the weeks I figured at that point like I might as well load it up cuz  it's nice to have somebody going today and tomorrow in case someone on my team gets scratched on Wednesday yesterday because you have to put in all your moves overnight which again is just beyond insane for head to head leaks you should be able to make moves at the very last second if you need to  I made two more moves and I picked up Jose Alvarado for today Thursday Saturday and I picked key on Ellis up so I would have picked up earlier but he was on waivers until today I picked him up for today with the option to hold through the rest of the week of things are going really well  because I've also kind of graded out what categories I'm liable to win I'm not gonna win points not gonna win points against this team so this sort of no point like I don't I don't need guys are gonna score a whole bunch I need to in threes it'd be nice to in both percentages  rebounds assist Steals and blocks are and turnovers are all up for grabs in some capacity so points is basically I basically built a punt points  thought a blocks I'm probably gonna lose as well dudes got JJ Brook Lopez and Daniel Gafford I have that he Davis so I'm not dead in the water but liable to lose that one so I basically build like a punt points strategy with a semi punt blocks  and then of course I'll download block four shots but again that wasn't the point point was I set myself up I used two of my four moves today to load up my Tuesday  and now looking ahead I actually have exactly 10 guys playing tomorrow on Wednesday I'm not an overload mode anymore  but one of the problems with the guys I picked up is that Alvarado and Beasley are the only guys on my team that play Thursday  and Saturday plus Santi aldama who's back in on Saturday so I graded out the first part of my week pretty well but I still need to make some shuffling to get through the rest of it because Friday I'm actually only nine out of 10 I could go bigger on on Friday and Sunday I think I'm at 9 out of 10 as well so I have two moves to use the rest of this week I've already done my moves for today and I gotta figure out where I'm gonna go with it in all likely that someone like a Gary Trent who's a good three-point shooter I like the steals there but I don't really need the points and he only has one game after tomorrow that's a guy that could get moved for anybody with two games after tomorrow where maybe I attack a different category Alma all so I know he plays on Saturday but I now because I hyper loaded my quality days because I picked up so many guys to that played today I actually have room if I wanted to move off of a quality guy day to just a regular player from all the other teams that goes Wednesday Friday Sunday  well not Wednesday Friday Sunday I guess I can just hold through tomorrow but Friday Sunday  so after tomorrow after Wednesday I can do more moves I can pick up somebody goes Thursday Saturday I can pick up somebody that goes Thursday Sunday Friday Sunday whatever it is I have room after tomorrow to pretty much do whatever moves I want  I would suggest you do the same thing that I did and that's the segue and actually talking about the set of my own team but the schedule  look at every day the rest of the week on your team what do you at right now are you overloaded on Wednesday and Friday because in all likelihood if you didn't make a bunch of moves to unload them you probably are  I made a bunch of moves to unload them and that's what we've been talking about  but I think we need to probably come into today assuming that most of you guys are still full even if full is just 10 on Wednesday and Friday so guys playing on Wednesday and Friday are of almost no use to you right now  even though they are to me who have the worst who have who have the worst schedule learn how to talk Dan who has the worst schedule from now until the end of the week let's start there that's pretty reasonable and easy place to begin worst schedules from today through whenever belong to Memphis in Toronto we just talked about they have two games over the six days  but only one of their two games is on an overflow day so you'll likely get one of those two  and the absolute worst schedule at least my mind Detroit Indiana Phoenix and Portland those four teams have two games the rest of this week and they're both on overflow days all four of those teams play Wednesday Friday only  which means if you have anyone on those teams who's not a superstar so  Tyreese Halliburton  you could probably let Myles Turner into it maybe Pascal siakam because he scores a lot but his other stuff is not amazing Booker and KD be as hurt right now so I don't even know and then nobody on Portland qualifies  a lot of those guys should be getting dumped because you're only getting zero potentially games out of those guys obviously the superstars they're going to be in your lineup on those overflow days but anybody that's not at Star level meaning like top 50 or better in fantasy purposes  you could move them and you probably wouldn't lose a game played  because you probably have someone you can just slot in around them  now again if you've already done what I've done and you've unloaded Wednesday Friday to the exact point that you have exactly 10 guys to start  then this doesn't apply to you and you don't need to make any Western moves today or tomorrow frankly because you've already done it  if you've already done it you've already done it this show is not for people that have already made those moves this show is for people that are now trying to figure out what the hell to do after they were able to get going in their week yesterday hopefully you had a full schedule yes today and now it's like all right what's next  first of all we just got word right while we were on air that Bradley Beal did not practice so you know I mean there's another indicator that he's a guy that perhaps you can dump  it's crazy to think but  you know what if he doesn't play the rest of the week what if you're talking about sitting on a zero when you could make a move today to get three quality game days from a New Orleans player or a Milwaukee player or  Lakers and Thunder go six times in four days so yeah they're on overload days or Atlanta they've got three games left this week two of them on quality days Boston has two games this week on quality days I mean you probably gonna lean towards the teams playing three times on days where you can utilize them but  the list is  not short for guys that don't need to be rostered on those teams that only play on the overload days  so those are your bad schedule and then again Memphis Toronto you know you might be able to squeeze out one of the games from those teams but also pretty much anybody if again if you're if you're  still overloaded on a Wednesday Friday or full maybe I should say on Wednesday Friday any of these teams  won or no games is what you're getting out of them  who are the good teams there well we already talked about Milwaukee in New Orleans we have for a week been talking about how that's those are the two teams you want to be ready for this week  the Lakers in the Thunder as we just talked about those teams actually start six games in nine days as part of their schedule now heavy schedule for those teams Lakers and Thunder have the same schedule this week which is today tomorrow Friday Sunday and then they got it back-to-back Tuesday Wednesday next week so those are teams that are in the mix  golden state has a back-to-back their schedule doesn't extend quite as far as the Lakers and the Thunder but it's the same this week where it's again today tomorrow Friday and Sunday  next week is is still a four gamer for the Warriors but they're back to back isn't until Thursday Friday next week so they actually have seven games over 11 days since I've six and nine which still isn't bad  you know by all accounts it's pretty darn good like still in the mid load amid 60s and percentage of days with games which again not quite 67% which is the six in nine but still pretty good  but again all those teams I just mentioned  there are other three games besides today are indeed on overload days  and then Atlanta as on the list because Atlanta makes more sense if you're overloaded they go tomorrow which is an overload day and then Thursday Saturday which are not  so you potentially could trade out someone  for a hawk  and still get at least two actual games out of them plus you get some coverage on Wednesday if somebody were to bail out but if you think about coverage on a possible bailout then you might as well look at some of these other teams also like the Lakers like the Warriors like the Thunder we just talked about they cover you on bailouts on then all three days but you know what if your team somehow stays healthy those three then maybe you don't get to use them at all  so like this week is pretty hard  that's the bottom line you have no idea what your team is gonna look like  tomorrow Friday Sunday in terms of last second scratches  you kind of need to assume someone is gonna get scratched on your team late but you don't know who you don't know if the guy you have is a backup is going to be able to replace that guy the timing of the game's might not work out where the guy who gets scratched might be in a lake game and you're back up might have had to play early or so you weren't even able to get them in your lineup  this is one of those weeks where you just need to watch starting at like 3:45 Pacific time until the end of the night and anytime someone gets ruled in you throw them in to a non-utility slot in your lineup  so that at the end of the night hopefully you have like two or three guys that are rotating between the utility slots and that's how you can rotate bodies in quickly if someone gets ruled out but this I mean it's an impossible task it's an impossible task not everybody can sit in front of their computer for three and a half straight hours every day for an entire week and then the following week and basically as long as your playoffs go you need to be there for all of those start times  it's not gonna work  so instead you just have to do your best and instinctively the move is  see if you're full on Wednesday Friday  if you are full on Wednesday Friday and specifically if you have extra guys playing on Wednesday and Friday you utilize a drop utilize a move to get off of the extra player there's no reason for you to have 11 guys playing on Wednesday and Friday  because two that 11th guy doesn't get to do anything  instead turn that 11th player who was just gonna be a 0 for you on Wednesday and Friday it is someone who's playing today or today in Thursday or today Thursday and Saturday or like the Hawks tomorrow Thursday and Saturday  now technically for Atlanta you don't want to do it yet because they're not playing today but if you're looking at a team  now if you want to get the quality days you go Milwaukee and New Orleans and then the other side of the coin is if you're not full on Wednesday and Friday first of all consider yourself extremely fortunate especially if you didn't game it out meaning you just have a bunch of pelicans and bucks you're probably going to win the week  because your opponent's gonna be sitting on overflow and you're going to be just cruising along with freaking Dame and Zion or whatever you know bucks and Pelicans guys you have that you didn't have to pick up at the last second here but let's say you really wanted to pour it on and make sure that you had like four or five guys going on all the quality days  who are the names on those teams specifically that makes sense as moves today  the same ones we've been talking about for Milwaukee it's Malik Beasley  and if you want to dig deep Patrick Beverley got ruled out by the way so maybe that means a little bit more opportunity for something like a pat connaughton  I don't think Bob Bobby Portis is on the wire but he would he would obviously be one to use as well so it's basically just Malik Beasley from Milwaukee for the Pelicans Larry Nance is probably your best waiver level guy who's been floating around Naji Marshall and Jose Alvarado are the next dudes down the pecking order my three of those guys could make sense if you're turning a 0 into 3 game's over the next five days  that'd be pretty awesome like if you have an overload guy who's going to get you nothing until Sunday and you turn a 0 into three games over those five days the only thing you didn't need to do is probably make a move on Sunday  with whoever you picked up on the pills or the Bucks  because they don't play that last day of the week or you just hold them if your season continues because they go Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday next week Pelicans do bucks go Tuesday Wednesday Friday Sunday of next week so they each have four games although the guys are picking up again those names we just talked about Nance and Beasley are probably the only ones that I would say yeah I mean you could hold for another week and just say look I'm gonna get four games and that's fine like you're not gonna wanna hold off Verrado and Najee Marshall longer than you have to or comet in whoever else you might have  scraped through on on that Milwaukee side  if you are not full on Wednesday and Friday then you should be looking at a team like the Thunder the Lakers or the Warriors because they go today and then all three of those heavy days and so then you take someone  who has a poor schedule but we just talked about Portland  Phoenix two games over six days Detroit Toronto Memphis teams that basically have two games over the next six days in tournament 4 because if you're not overloaded  then turning two into four is legitimately turning 2 into 4 if you are full on Wednesday Friday turning two into four might actually just be turning two into two  not super helpful  but if you're not full then those moves make a lot of sense so again  the dichotomy here is if you are full aim for the quality days teams Boston and Atlanta are all so in the discussion there we don't have to do anything with them today because Atlanta doesn't go until tomorrow Wednesday Thursday Saturday Boston doesn't go into Thursday Saturday  so you might as well just sit don't pick up a guy who's not playing tonight there's no point you might as well just wait a day find out what your team is doing fine figure out what categories you need to hustle for the longer you can wait before making a roster move the more information you have before making that roster move  and if you aren't full you tackle the teams the three choices that have four games left this week which again Warrior's Lakers and Thunder  the players on those teams that are potentially worth streaming Warriors have a couple Brandon pajam ski would be one of them if trayce Jackson Davis is floating around he would be another he's probably been added Jackson Davis has because he's been putting up some nice big man stats lately but you know it's bad for free throw percent is maybe kept him on the wire and a couple of League's guarantee or anything like that but it's a possibility uh Gary Payton would be a deeper for the Warriors I don't think that I would venture much beyond that and most of their other guys are probably on rosters unless you could maybe find Andrew Wiggins floating around that would be the other one for Golden State for the Lakers it's really hot tomorrow because LeBron is out for one half of their back-to-back so that's gonna give him one good game and then three kind of medium games Spencer Dinwiddie all so as a possibility at doing some stuff he's been playing better lately so steals some blocks couple of three-pointers  expect Dilo to be in and I expect LeBron to be in but didn't we've been picking up more playing time because of his defense again more of a deeper League kind of guy when the Lakers are healthy know I'm probably not going the camera reddish route and no I'm not probably going the Tory and Prince bout those would be the extremely deep options and then the Thunder there their whole stinking roster is basically just a deeply set of choices if Lou Dort is playing  he would potentially be one of them  Thunder lost where they last play Sunday they lost in Milwaukee on Sunday the Thunder  kenrich Williams has been okay lately but again you know almost everybody on the Thunder that's a stream level is a 19 minute guy and those are very dangerous the only one who actually gets more than that would be Dorn  honestly God I don't know who you pick up on that team case in Wallace Aaron Wiggins kenrich Williams all these guys are super unreliable so not much there  so those are your four teams and we already talked about your three tumors and that's basically where you're at at this point  those are your choices  tomorrow we'll discuss it all over again if you're full on Wednesday if you're not full on Wednesday that's basically the way the rest of this week is gonna go Are You full Wednesday Friday  or are you not there's two very different but but parallel paths for the different rosters this week right now I have a roster that is not full on Wednesday Friday so tomorrow I might make a move to fill them up  there's no reason not to the options of to stream on Wednesday Friday Sunday are better than the options to stream on Thursday Saturday other than like if Payton Pritchard or Sam Houser is floating around that's a really good Thursday Saturday option but then you drop way off to like a Bruno Fernando or a Vietnamese or something like that whereas if you want to go Wednesday Friday Sunday with your pickup if you're not full you've got you know 75 80% of the league to pick from  crap ton of options waiting to the last minute and find out somebody's a late scratch and pick up their replacement that's gonna go 35/40 minutes  you have way more options if you're not full  of course you could also make yourself not full by using an extra roster move today use two moves today or something like that the only problem is you don't leave yourself much wiggle room if you use two today and then want to get tomorrow that leaves you one move  for the last four days of the week what if somebody gets hurt  that's pretty much have to save it at that point in case somebody goes down  or you just roll the dice say screw it somebody goes down somebody goes down I gotta load up my team as much as I can  how the hell did this go 20 some odd minutes that was not my intention coming into it  all right well let's see here what do we got a couple of quick questions from the chat room on streaming  Keith says I'm dropping key on Ellis after his game tonight I'm talking Sasser oof bad schedule though Najee Marshall Larry Nancy the other choice is yeah so those are the better choices because you can get the games out of it Keith make sure you're not overloaded because Detroit's schedule is crap crap crap if no Wendy goes Sohan or to pick up Nas Reed I would prefer Nazarene  I got screwed yesterday I added Camp Thomas then he was out right before the game's locked  yeah I mean this is  why unfortunately like if you're in a head-to-head Lee you really need to be making your roster moves at the last second and I know Camp Thomas was a super late scratch so you didn't do anything wrong here but damn  Ryan says underrated content thanks man appreciate it  one day I hope to be overrated  Naji Marshall is the most added is he preferred over Larry Nance know I think I prefer Nance Marshall might get you an extra three pointer and like two or three extra points but  what's that really do for you over the next three games do you want an extra two three-pointers in an extra nine points or do you want like an extra six rebounds for assists couple steals in a block or something I I prefer all the stuff that nonce is good at and he typically does it on good percentages as well  would you prefer Bruno or Jonathan Isaac for their three and four starting tomorrow I don't think Jonathan Isaac plays in the back-to-back so assume you're getting two out of Isaac or three out of Fernando and all so you know with the issue of course being the magic are on overload days I make sure you even get to use the games you're getting out of Jonathan Isaac  I would lean to Fernando for the three games where two of them are on quality days but you know if you're again if you're not full then you can go Jonathan Isaac and maybe even move on if he plays in the front hand of the back-to-back but not the second  Dan would you drop key on Ellis after tonight's game to pick up Naz Reid wait until tomorrow and then drop a Linux after his game for a player that plays Thursday Saturday  honestly nausea so freaking good I think I would say go try to get nausea read  get three games out of him he's very he's good enough to be on a full day  if Aiden gets shut down and do a brief can become a playoff here can we stop calling him Dr Death I don't think you up as going to be a playoff here I honestly just don't think fantasy wise is all that good  sorry I couldn't join earlier you're forgiven is Crowder an option he's an option but he's not a good one  20 minutes of ball game  four to five points so just half a steal and a three-pointer Maybe  it's gross  how deep are trusting Pritchard how deep in my trusting Pritchard I'm trusted him man I don't I only Drew holidays back this week I don't know about Derek white but I think you're gonna get at least one good game at Pritchard maybe both so I'm I'm digging it points like I'm only up 50 I have three moves left I have Coos Camp Thomas and Kay do I cut the cord of any of them Miss again tomorrow how much trouble am I in right now  I think Camp Thomas is the most likely to come back because he has the most to prove among these guys Detroit it seems like Kate is out for a bit I think if all three guys are out you consider dropping  kuzma  and Cade I don't I don't know that they come back  which is a shame because they're the two more valuable of the three but  hmm  will says you're killing it I've been doing work in my head last few weeks I hope so man I'm trying to I'm trying to bust our butts on these things do I drop nurkic today with the questionable tag for tomorrow no wait until tomorrow if he gets ruled out you can drop him then but  no sense using I mean nothing would make you want to break your brain faster than dropping Newark today and then finding out he's going  you're welcome for all the whole hard work Michael  hey Dan Alvarado or Hauser for the remaining two games on the low volume days Alvarado's got three my good man Alvarado's got three Hauser's only got two so I mean if you're going Houser he doesn't play till Thursday  I will say though I think two games out of Hauser might actually be better than three games out of Alvarado this week  but you can go over Otto now and you can change later if you want to although again like trying to hold on to a couple of moves till later is generally a good idea will the manual quickly come back this week well apparently it's back at practice but he got ruled out for tomorrow's game meaning Sunday is the target I mean you know are you gonna get a hold five days to get it quickly game  not a move I'm making when he doesn't play for five days  Dan I have Anthony Simons and I'm up big in the first two weeks the playoffs second round starts next uh should I drop Simon's for Emmanuel quickly  no don't don't don't do quickly that's the new that's the noise right now he's not playing until Sunday at the earliest and then for Portland I don't know so maybe some is done for the year possibly but like he has two games between now and then the next time we could see quickly I think Simon's yeah he just got ruled out five minutes ago so at least whole Simon's through Thursday because what if he goes on Friday  Camp Thomas by the way is questionable  we got the tag on him and Aiden is questionable also  um  you know it's Simon's getting ruled out early odds are he's not playing this week but again we know that quickly is not playing until Sunday at the absolute earliest so moving off to a guy who's not playing for five days is a streaming disaster if you're gonna dump every time it's jumping for somebody that's got two three four games still and then if you still want to go quickly and like two three days have at it but there's no reason to do it yet you just can't sit on a guy doing nothing for that long  do I think Camp Thomas is going to play tomorrow I have a clue  having a clue fully questionable I think if he can he's gonna go so I would say 5545 but it's basically a coin flip right now that's basically what questionable means  you are all very much welcome everyone thank you to the very large social media audience that's catching this one there's like 600 people watching on Twitter right now so that's pretty cool do I think RJ and Emmanuel are going to be out in and out of the lineup for the Raptors um I think once they're back they'll play I think the Raptors are bad enough that they can play these guys so if you you know if you can get him before that Sunday deal he probably get him on everything maybe other than back-to-backs  it'll be a little annoying though I mean it's generally it's better to try to go get a guy that you think is gonna play every day but those guys all RJ Barrett is is percentages are gonna kill you but like a manual quickly  he'd be pretty fun to have if he was actually playing every day I just I question whether or not that's gonna happen  son's last game is Friday this week is Grayson Allen still a whole or should I drop into add more games if you're gonna drop you drop after his Friday game provided you're not overflowing but Grace has been so good everybody wants to drop Greece now and he's top 55 this year for friends  hold until his game  first we get the playoffs full on Wednesday and Friday I don't know if this is a  oh nothing's just stupid question would you say I can drop DeAndre 8 in I'm against the Dark Horse of our league is at 18 her  give him till tomorrow to find out because he's questionable so I know you're full but if he's in he's gonna be far better than your worst guys so give it one more day on 8th and if he sits out tomorrow you can move on  who should I stream between Visalia meets Vasily a midsection I don't know I keep switching the a in the eye in my brain but still I mean Stitch Trey man or Brandon Miller probably Miller it's key and Ellsworth streaming after the last game yeah I think so  everybody says very much a you know what have you done for me lately again and he had a quiet game but it came after a giant one it's the average we want the average Manila says manscaped out incoming yeah you should go to manscaped.com use promo code ethos 20 I think I might have forgotten to do that promo on the Early Show  there's a chance to add quickly now to the ill and then swap them for a pelican after Saturday I mean if you have enough moves to pull that off have at it but I I don't  I don't have enough moves all right great questions guys a lot of them come in storming in here when I'm trying to wrap it up this is our longest dreaming show  not my plan  much love tomorrow I think we're going to have Dr Ray on the show because he and I are battling each other in this 30s right now but if it's not tomorrow it'll be soon either way Dr a coming soon here on the podcast that should be a lot of fun thank you to Ryan Ward for that hit earlier on today that was all so a
