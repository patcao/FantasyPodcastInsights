welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  what's cracking everybody  it's the end of week seven weekdays I always got the weekend coming up but there ain't any games  so this is the end of week seven today  it's crazy I know we got a game tomorrow in Vegas that doesn't count for Fantasy purposes so tonight your week wraps up with 26 of the 30 teams playing  we will preview that at the tail end of today's show but this is of course your big Friday episode of fantasy NBA today we can review will have the ads well have the drops will have the whole have the watchlist players will have buys a sells an injury Replacements and get you guys all set  reconfigured  for then sitting on your thumbs for a couple of days which  frankly I'm okay with their not being a whole lot going on over the weekend because I'm typically chasing children around all weekend long so I mean this is a blessing for me well wrap up the Week Tonight with a big old tweet storm on the Twitter's I'll try to do my night in 90 second recap doubt that's gonna happen on a 26 team card and then we can just put our hands in our pockets and  Float On Through To Monday probably want to start thinking about how you're going to stream next week if you got any roster moves left but let's get going with The Weeknd review first and foremost everybody I'm Dan batters this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos preseason you can find me on social at Dan best price I know so very complicated d a n b e s b r i s or just Google search Dan from Sports eat those Twitter and it'll pop right up there we've also got our Discord kicking along I want to make sure everybody finds us so over there it is in this show description no matter where you're taking in this episode live after the fact YouTube pod channels click that link to free invite come hang out a lot of people answering each other's questions a lot of fun and this is one of our most well traffic shows every week so figured this is a good time to sort of shove you all casually and that direction  let's throw some names up on the board what do we got yes it is the weekend review thread I like to give everybody this little preview page that says we will cover the stories of the past seven days although really you know past four or five usually takes care of it with a stronger eye on season long decision this is not a show to help you out with your streaming moves for tonight this is to get your team's going rest of year let's start with the ads  some repeat names on the ads board we'll start with those actually and then we'll work our way back through some of the new ones the repeat ads are Killian Hayes who I guess you could just call a hold a repeat add is I guess just to hold but I also felt like maybe some people didn't do it last time so that's why I threw it in there Haze is the is very much the maybe in this pile because we don't know how this is gonna go but you want to add to find out how it's gonna go because he's looked pretty good in the starting lineup his role is fluctuating everything with the Pistons is fluctuating because they've lost 900 games in a row did you guys know the Pistons have lost 44 of their last 48 basketball games dating back to last season  that's tough road to oh  and the Pistons are holding roads right now  but anyway while he started while he's logging decent minutes you kind of want to have him on your team I'm probably not starting him in a rodeo format right now because you just don't really know what the individual day is going to look like for Hays right now what is the actual effort gonna be what are the numbers gonna look like head to head he makes a lot of sense and Jalen Duren is out not that that changes much for haze but  it just like anybody that's out on a team creates a tiny bit more opportunity for everyone else even if it's microscopic for the guard on a team missing a center and by the way we don't know who's filling in for Duran yet Detroit hasn't even announced  like they gonna go Isaiah Stewart sliding up to the five is it going to be wise men or Bagley Bagley hasn't even played in a week  anyway keep killing A's going see what happens here his teammate boy on bug zdanowicz has been on our board for three weeks in a row now he was a stash two weeks ago he was a stash last week he is active now and he is crushing it so far he's been slotted in and they were just like please boy on do anything at all and in his two games he's a first round you have a lot of this stuff is not gonna hold long term but  who cares if you thought he had a lot of usage in previous years you have seen him while the Pistons are terrible  actually you did they were terrible last season but they were kind of intake mode and he was sort of cruising now they're asking him try to save them  it's a lot of it responsibility boy on  anyway he'll be a top 100 guy that's kind of the safe floor for a good percentage is scorer I don't know that this needs ton more explaining he very obviously belongs on fantasy rosters but maybe you guys ignored me last time so here we go again Trey Murphy I am already getting questions about whether or not folks should drop Trey Murphy which is like  what are we even doing here not everybody can come out of the Chute and play as well as boy on does in his first two ball games but Trey Murphy has come out and played almost as well in his first couple of ball games  17 points three and a half three-pointers I'm not sure what everybody's so upset about on the Trey Murphy front he's also just sort of bumbling his way into blocks  and I know yesterday's game was not super fun because the pals lost to the Lakers by 45 points  but Murphy actually still had 14 points 23 boards in an assist and 13 shots  he's getting time he's getting usage that's really all you can ask for because his fantasy profile we know  the question with him wasn't whether or not his Fantasy game translates the question was whether or not he's going to have enough of a role  on this Pelicans team when McCollum Zion Ingram JV all these guys are upright and doing stuff and so far the answer has been yes so he very much belongs on rosters and anybody that's coming at me on Twitter with like ah I'm getting tired of this already  what are we really doing here friends it's been a couple of days  and then for the third week in a row I also have Malik Monk on this list who you know we've seen his minutes trending up pretty hard like I know on the season he's still ranked outside the top one 10 but lately it's been much better his minutes have trended up that was the big issue for Monk  when we talked about it basically every game he played he was on our watch list for the whole first part of the Season he was an ad when Darren fox went down because his minutes went up to close to 30  and lately they've been inching up again more like 27 28 which is a lot better than they 20 to 24 that he was getting at the beginning of the year and that's a difference between you know one 40 range and inside the top one hundred  he's running hot right now so don't get too obsessed with the Malik monk experience he's top 60 over the last two weeks but he's also shooting 50% from the field and he's made every free throw he's taken the last two weeks that's not gonna hold we know that but that's okay because 29 minutes a game is more than enough for him the only question I have on Monk Is will the minutes hold at 29 if the field goal percent tapers which it will  is he still gonna get enough playing time to  like is are they tied together the field goal percent creating the playing time or is the playing time gonna be there independently  your two new ads for this week are Kelly oubre Jr actually he was on last week all so he was a repeat but  people are not buying on this one and then it'll be topping let's start with the Uber who came back and he was like kind of it is first game since returning he played only 19 and a half minutes  it's gonna ramp up dude was involved in a serious incident we still don't really know the details of it but he's gonna ramp up and when he does we should be there to see how it looks  he was getting a reasonable number of minutes after the hardened trade remember there were a few games in there before this what again whatever this injury situation was  before before that he was still playing in the mid to high 20s and when he gets out there he's not bashful it's not like the  the guys that the Sixers brought in are chukars you know Nick Batum Rob Covington these guys are not gonna go out there and fire shots up at will  they're gonna be ball movers Defenders  so I don't see that Uber is rolls gonna change that much maybe you see a slight downtick in minutes from pre-trade ubre  uh but in my opinion there aren't that many guys floating around right now where you can be like hey if this thing clicks  this guy's a six seventh rounder  and Uber is one of those guys so you might as well just see how it goes because now he's on his feet again and we'll get to see the ramp up  and then he'll be toppings a weird one because you know we talked about him a bunch over the last two weeks on the podcast  he's number 64 over those last two weeks 16 points 3 boards to assist one and a half blocks at 1.3 rounded up shooting over ridiculous 64% from the field but again Tyreese Halliburton gets him a whole lot of dunks and then if the three-pointers are dropping then you get this sort of double whammy thing  the minutes is the big question mark with topping if no idea how many minutes he's gonna get on a night tonight basis the good thing is  his field goal percent right now and the sort of blocks threes combination that he's put up recently has been able to balance against the fluctuating minutes  I don't think this dude shoots 70% for the year but there was a reason that a lot of us analysts were taking him with our last round pick in drafts and it was  he's gonna start  he was gonna be the starting power forward for this Indiana team well we didn't know was whether or not he was going to have an actual role with it at the beginning of the year it didn't really look like it  he was getting yanked around his minutes were in the low 20s so even if he was shooting well it wasn't translating then he started to shoot better than the minutes were trending up Jalen Smith got hurt that's helped him as well  is he just an injury replacement right now that's actually also a possibility  but I feel like he's being undersold at the moment and he does belong on rosters  for now  that could very well change  reminder in between Pages like subscribe  follow on Twitter let's do the holds next Gordon Hayward as a whole I don't think we need to go into too much detail on that he's been better since lamelo went down which is sort of a big womp womp for Charlotte but for Hayward his season has been A Tale of Three Adventures he got off to a very hot start then turned intensely cold and now he's shooting the ball better again much like Malik mug much like Obi top and we don't really know if his playing time if his usage  is tied into a hot run it might be  but that's okay  because by the time we wait and find out you'll have missed the heater  and if it turns out that he's just gonna do more stuff even when he's not running hot then you missed the chance to Adam for that same story for top and same story for Monk  so there's sort of no point in waiting too long in situations like this one  so with a word who he's been a hold for a while now just to be kind of wanted to see what his role was going to be when my miles Bridges showed up we wanted to see what his role was gonna be as Rozier came back it didn't look good by the way in the short term but then lamelo went down and now it looks like his role is bigger again pretty obvious hold right now  Spencer Dinwiddie as a hold this one I continued to admit that I am worried on he's not a guy that I was targeting really at any point this year but he did have a very hot run when uh both cam Thomas and Ben Simmons were out  camp Thomas is back dinwiddie's continue to take a crap ton of shots though which that's a reason for me to not be as worried like the fact that he still hyper involved in everything  I just don't like his Fantasy game he much more of a points League guy lowfield goal percent medium turnovers you know like math free throw number doesn't get steals or blocks mostly gets points in assists and still  you know if you're at two category two trick pony effectively  that makes you a much more valuable player in a head-to-head format where you could punch a couple things or points League where the system sort of punched three things for you  does did we get back inside the top one hundred  I mean she I'm leaning towards no  but I think we should hold in case I'm wrong because again there aren't many more interesting guys out there to add instead of him folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game-winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you

that's dri z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations I put buddy hield on here and I don't really know why people keep asking me what to do every time he has a slightly quieter ball game he's a hold as a starter on this team he's a hold his field goal percent is gonna go up and down so weak to week you're gonna see these pretty wild fluctuations but his minutes are pretty safely in the mid to high 20s now and that's a that's inside the top 100 when you stretch it all the way to the end and if you somehow manages to push his way into the 30s in minutes we saw last year that got him inside the top 60 when he was running at that type of pace I don't think he's gonna be a top 60 guy rest of season but I do think he's gonna be top 100 as long as he's a starting member of the Indiana Pacers  on Yucca oh and this is a tougher one I know lately he has not been good and  that has pushed his season mark down to one 30  and a lot of that's because he's not really getting any defensive stats he's playing 23 minutes of ball game which should generally be enough for him he's just like not as involved on defense this year and I couldn't possibly tell you why  Hawks are doing slightly different stuff I do think that at some point this deal balances out and at some point capella is going to get hurt and then okong was gonna go nuts so you kind of want to hang on there  and I get it it's tougher  you're probably not starting him in Roto formats right now against your games cap especially while he's been kind of running cold but they're just like again this is this whole is there anybody out there that could step into massive massive value  and is already sort of Fringe value anyway  most of the guys that step into the giant value like take Orlando Robinson for instance he was Zero  until bam out of Bio went down and he would Highsmith went down and now he's a monster  that's not a guy you keep on your bench because you need multiple things to happen  and he wasn't doing anything before that Al Horford is actually interested in interesting example of this he's a guy who was not that dissimilar actually from this so Kong woo situation a little bit farther down the board when poor Singh is healthy who apparently by the way he's back  but then went down and for jumped into this Giant Center role and went from you know 15160 range to top 30  is that a reason to hang on to a mall at the time probably not because most of the time he wasn't good enough to justify holding onto anyway I think okongo is good enough to justify holding you know I had to head legs he's doing sort of just enough to be somewhat useful and then Roto you just keep them on your bench treating them like an injury replacement if you want and then when he gets hot again you drop them back in  even if capella is up there  Alex Caruso is a whole also again I don't know that this one requires a ton of explaining he's number 78 on the year basically anytime he's been a healthy this season he's been playable so  go for it  the Wizards I had them on the holds board last time it's a much easier sell right now because you know they're coming off of better ball games like they were competitive against the 76ers their last time out and so all these guys it's like oh yeah they're fine  Cole Anthony is an obvious hole we had no explanation needed he's been running very hot and jaylen's out for sounds like less time than it looked like  he was listening his questionable for tonight and then he just got ruled out about a half an hour ago which makes me think he'll probably miss a couple of ball games but I thought he was gonna miss a few weeks and maybe it's not quite that bad  we can open prey  Derek Lively is an obvious hole I'm not even gonna explain this one because if you're thinking about dropping him out of your damn mind and then Malik Beasley basically the same thing he had one bad ball game and someone was like hey is this gonna chill until he really falls apart which I still think could happen at some point because he's shooting 48% from the field that's way the hell out over his skis on that one but he's been really involved in what the Bucks have done over the last two to three weeks in particular is sort of non-shooting role has increased  so I'm gonna need like one to two weeks of really bad play for me to move off of this thing it seems like he's fine for now so keep him as a hold  once again as we flip pages please like rate and subscribe here are the scared nervous or drop level players Carousel I left on there he's hurt now so he's an obvious drop Jaden Ivy is one that I think is in the nervous slash drop he's like kind of in between the two he had a pretty good ball game last time around  we're trying to make sense of what Monty Williams is saying he's talking about shortening up his rotations Ivy had big minutes for like a week and then he went back to the bench and his minutes have been zero and then some  it's really hard to know what the hell he's gonna do on a game to game basis and so I don't think he needs to be rostered right now because in Roto there's zero chance you're playing him and even if somebody was like oh Jade and IVs gonna play starters minute it's we saw what that was last year when all of the other usage guys were gone and it's still wasn't good enough if that makes any sense that is to say like he was playing starters minutes and he was outside the top 200 because he has these gaping holes in his Fantasy game  sure he gets steals that's fun and some assists and that's okay but it's free throw percent is not good field goal percent is better this year but do we know that that sticks no there's no guarantee it's turnovers are high he's got all the young player issues and no guarantee of actual minutes and so that's why I don't think you really need to hang on to him thank you could make a move if it looks like something's shifting their but I don't know that you need to get out in front of it because the upside isn't all that high anyway at least not in nine cat  Bobby Portis he is a drop and now he's yelling at his team and his coach and her I don't know what the hell that story was yesterday from Chris Haynes about him  emphatic or imploring his team to do more play harder or whatever is going on  Bobby Porter seems like crazy person and he has for some number of years now and all so his fantasy value is tied up in points and rebounds and their days where he doesn't get those he's just know  kante George I left in this page he I had him here last week and it's the same basically I like that outlines of his Fantasy game that's fine but the it hasn't been colored in yet if that makes any sense probably doesn't I'm trying to use like a you know play-by-play color commentator type analogy here  where you can see the assists from keonte  you can see sometimes he's willing to go take some shots  but he's outside the top 200 because he can't shoot free throws aren't good it's turnovers are very high and they're just isn't enough stuff besides assist you can't do even if it's like I get it a sister hard to find and so we're all in this constant like ooh what's that one  thing but that's not enough  again you like you need to be punting every thing you can't punt everything  head-to-head I understand why there might be a desire to try to sort of active stash him Roto I also kinda get why you almost could treat him like an injury type player but there's again there's no guarantee that he's putting up numbers this season and your best guess  is February March some of the efficiency stuff starts to  decrease in intensity but even that that's that's not a guarantee either  I don't know I'm you guys know me you listen to the show for a long time if you've been with us for a while if you're relatively new introducing you to the Dan best press method of fantasy I don't really like squatting on players for very long I need those roster spots to do other active things with  so that's why I feel like we can probably just like keyonte George go and if somebody's playing him right now he's ruining their fantasy weeks he's doing way more damage than good  keep her legs I get it I'm not talking about keeper I'm not talking about Dynasty I'm talking about redraft right now  Grizzly's non-stars I think are all basically safe drops at this point jazz is getting close I think he's four or five games away now if I'm remembering how many games the Grizzlies of played Marcus Smart will probably be back in the next one and a half weeks or so so there is about to get healthier and then whatever fringy players they have cooking these days until dama had a good game a couple times and John Khan had a decent one sometimes Beyond those okay and  sometimes Xavier Tillman is okay now these guys are gonna matter in like a week so why are we fighting it just let it go Let It Go  the cold never bothered them anyway Andrew Wiggins who came back from smushing his finger in a car door and stunk again  I he's a tough one because at any sign of  you know shaking off this Valium fog or whatever the hell he's under these days  then he becomes an ad but we're talking too good games out of about 20 so far this year that's simply not a good enough ratio  the problem of course is every time he has a good game you're like ooh is the next one going to also be good is this the start of a turnaround and so far neither of them has been  so  this is another guy who was ruining fantasy teams Roto I think I would  think more about squatting on him  because you know what's in there someplace something's wrong I don't know what's wrong but something's wrong and then head to head you just like you can't have him right now he's crushing teams  he's been so bad and almost every single category it's wild  the watch list these are kind of fun names actually scoot Henderson is a watch list guy Blazers are dealing with Myriad injuries these days Malcolm Brogden out as soon as Simon came back Jeremy Grant has a concussion DeAndre agency dealing with a sword knee we'll see if he comes back at some point here in the next two months scoots probably gonna be kind of interesting so constant watch list  I know there's a Constant Gardener I'm scoots of constant watch list Patrick Williams is on my watch list I don't think you need to stash him yet because it feels like he's still one player away from being useful and tomorrow and Caruso are both in right now  Caleb Martin is a watch list for me he looked pretty good in that last ball game but again a lot of guys are out for the Heat and so even if he does put it together for a couple of days here I don't know that I'm gonna trust it anyway  you probably could  you probably could if you want to stream Caleb Martin I don't think it'd be the worst idea in the world but I watch listing him  oh Mary you're seven is on my watch list I don't think this is gonna pan out but you just there it's like filler  Derek Jones Junior who may qualify as an injury replacement guy which is weird because he's starting most games but he hasn't been able to do enough unless people have been missing and right now Grant Williams we missed their last ball game I don't know if we have an injury update on the Mavs yet this morning it might have happened while I have been on air here but Grant Williams is out Josh greens but now it's better for Derek Jones Junior when either Kyrie or Lucas missing because then you know 15 to 25 shots get dropped back into the player pool  but he's close-ish when other wings are out  the missing stars is what kind of puts him up and over  Norman Powell man and Josh Hart these guys I'll put him in the same bucket I just can't quit these dudes every time I think that they're they've completely  they're droppable then they come back and they have a better ball game and Norm had a better last one Joshua had a few good ones in a row on top of a very good tweet if you missed it go follow Josh Hardy  and I don't know what to do with them  I know I'm the fantasy analyst I'm supposed to tell you what to do but I don't know what to do with these guys so the answer there is watch list when in doubt just watch him  the Blazers I highlighted Matisse thigh bulb on the the graphic but it's like all of them because again well all these guys are out someone may step into something we know shade and Sharp's play about 45 minutes a game while everybody's hurt and he's in a prime sell High spot and you'll see that when we get to the cell High page but if I will somehow picks up 30 minutes he'd be interesting Jabari Walker if he picks up 30 to money Kamara there's a bunch of guys on that club that could be sort of interesting if someone was like damn I can promise you they're playing 30 minutes tonight  but I don't think there's any guarantee of that and so that's why we're gonna tread cautiously  and I threw Moses Moody on the watch list because Steve Kerr came out after the last ball game was like look these lineups aren't working  does that mean Andrew Wiggins is getting benched he probably should  they're ramming a square peg into a circle hole right now  round hole I guess is the appropriate expression  maybe it's time for Moody to get some more plank time he's been out playing both Klay Thompson and Wiggins so far this year but at least in Space the floor  that's good for Stevens is literally doing nothing  injury replacement board this is always a fun one hey go subscribe and drop a five star review while I cue up the injury replacement board  I know I'm doing it a lot today sorry everybody I'm being a pain in your butts these are all the names that are maybes don't necessarily just start them because I'm saying their name here in on Friday morning  make sure to pay attention to ethos fantasy BK that Twitter feed for NBA news you'll find out if any of these guys are coming back because that could be a thing  the safest names on this injury replacement board are Duncan Robinson as long as Tyler hero is out  or land o' Robinson as long as bam and Highsmith are out  Kobe white with Levine out for a month now saddiq Bey with Jalen Johnson out for a while he's been very safe Eric Gordon's gonna be pretty safe because KD and Beale are probably out for this ball game though it sounds like Bradley Beal's trying to come back early next week  Grace and Allen is also I think out for the Suns if Mark Williams misses another game Nick Richards was a wonderful feeling in their last one  and then the slightly less safe ones would be Kyle Lowry for the heat also the Tyler hero situation Brandon Miller for Charlotte with mellow out and then the least safe one is Simona fontecchio who's been decidedly Matt with Larry Martin and out but probably makes sense as more of a head-to-head style stream but there are some really interesting names in that list like both Robinsons on the heat and put up really nice numbers lately Kobe White's been rolling Bay had a couple really good ball games Nick Richards and easy sort of one-to-one replacement uh so you got a lot of really good injury Replacements going right now and frankly this may be the most interesting page on today's show  and for some reason I left this one highlighted I don't know what I've done but  you're just gonna have to deal with it those that are watching Buy Low and sell high and there we go I fixed it  DeMar DeRozan is Buy Low I still feel pretty confident that his free throw percent is going to slowly trickle upward  it already has begun to do so he was in the late 60s he had one good free throw shooting game and now he's at 61 every good free throw shooting game he has he's gonna move up like five six seven slots  until he gets to 85 86 and then he'll be inside probably the top 45  that's it that's the Buy Low and with Levine out for a while the Mars shots are gonna be plentiful the assists will be fine you'll probably see the scoring tick up as the possibly both percentages improve for him  to make Sim a very quiet but useful Bi-Lo candidate  people like oh I think he's washed now and not really basically looks the same the free throw percent doesn't just disappear as you get old that makes no sense he can Murray Bi-Lo on Keegan Murray you can't get his back right but at some point he will and it is gonna shoot better than 39% and You're Gonna Wanna be there when it happens  Walker Kessler we've all forgotten how good he is when he plays 28 minutes or more and he's gonna be better as the Jazz get healthy because the games will be more competitive he can do his soul job as a post to being asked to do anything else and you can probably get him on the cheap now because he's come back and they've brought him off the bench for a week and a half and everybody's like oh this is annoying I don't want to wait on this  and I don't know how cam Johnson is still by Lobo but people really don't appreciate cam Johnson's Fantasy game which is silly he's number 81 on the season right now after the slow start remember they were kind of working him back from injury and blah blah blah  over the last I think three weeks now he's been more like what 60 range something like that  and that's what that steals  game Johnson's just gonna float his way into the 50 to 70 range and you can probably get him for someone near 80 right now your cell highs continues to be Kyle kuzma because nobody wants to listen to me on that one but he's just gonna slowly work his way down the board as the percentages end up where we always know they'll be shooting 89% at the free throw line over the last three weeks that's not sustainable  just not believe me don't believe me from early this week we had Donovan Mitchell on the cell High board not because I think he's gonna fall off too hard I just think he's gonna fall off a little bit the steals at 2 per game probably not a sustainable number the free-throw percent was up around 9 for a while he's at 80 right now as those things come back to earth he'll fall from rank or he's six or early this week he's eight now after one slightly less amazing ball game and even that's like hair splitting he probably falls into like the 1217 range but it does feel like right now you could flip him for someone that you think is headed up into the top 10 like maybe a Steph Curry  possibly who else I don't even sure who else fits that marker  might just be staff that might be the target otherwise I don't know that there's anything to do here CJ McCollum you already saw the the first sign of it still got two steals yesterday but there's just no way he was gonna keep up the pace he was on McCallum was a second rounder like he still he was early second now he's late second after one bad game again he's only played ten games because of the Numa thorax 2.6 defensive stats is just no way that holds  he might be his ADP though I think he's getting drafted in like the 80s he might be that but 20s now I think you could probably get someone in the 40s or 50s back for him and that's probably still worth it  Bogdan bogdanovich I had on my cell High border earlier this week because I think he probably ends up hurting his knee at some point but I trade young is ill he might miss this ball game so then Bogdan actually just be a good time to hold on to him for one more day and shaedon Sharpe who's going to be a great sell High because he has all these efficiency issues on the season 42 percent high volume from the field three turnovers 37 minutes a game against what with Grant out and probably Brogden out and we may be maybe maybe eaten out sharp played 42 minutes in their last ball game and he's just gonna take a crap ton of shots and he's gonna get points and boards and assists and Steals and threes and his free throw numbers fine and with usage and opportunity like that it doesn't really matter if the field goal percentage turnovers are crummy his usage will be high enough to counterweight that  so enjoy it for a game or two and then someone's gonna be like damn this dude scoring like 26 points a game with eight boards and five assists and two steals sell at that point so let him do it like tonight he'll probably have a giant ball game who the hell of the Blazers playing tonight doesn't matter we'll figure it out in a minute  Dallas I don't know maybe I'll have a big ball game how to play you play 402 minutes and not have a giant ball game he's gonna do something  wait for him to do a something big tonight and then try to sell them off before guys come back and his Houston plummets but certainly takes a hit  and that I believe is the end of our board  yep that was it you guys can watch me close Microsoft Word live on are amazing podcasting with Danbury today uh let's take a look at what's going on tonight very large very large Friday card we'll try to move through this at some kind of reasonable clip I want to try to do another show later on this afternoon so we're not going to do questions we very rarely do questions on these Friday shows but I do appreciate you guys hanging out in the chat room and chopping It Up live it's pretty cool to have a lot of folks that want to watch the show in real time it's been a fun because we really haven't focused on YouTube but for like a year so it's kind of cool to see how things have picked up a bit there let's get the area it is there's the Friday slate on your screen I think I can even make this larger  I know  this is immediately remedial YouTube being with Dan Bosch Burris  all right what do we watching for tonight Toronto and here's the thing like we talked about everything that happened over the course the week and so now we go through all these teams and it's like all right how do we put some of those topics into  into this sort of process  and you'll know immediately as we get to each team and that's why we can kind of lightning round this a little bit because I do feel like it's a tad repetitive but  you know there are a couple of teams that aren't playing the rest of this weekend so I guess there's that element to it the Lakers their game tomorrow doesn't count against the the Pacers and then the pals and Bucks who played yesterday in Lost they a they're done for the week so nothing to do with those teams and then the other 26 they all play tonight Toronto nothing Charlotte we talked about you know your Mark Williams health status and then guys like Gordon Hayward Brandon Miller and even PJ Washington are kind of probably BJ probably should have been on the watch list  Detroit what did Monty Williams mean when he said he was gonna shorten things up and then who's filling in for Jalen Duren who's expected to miss at least two weeks with his latest ankle issue  Orlando I'm you know we probably see Gary Harris start because I doubt they want to upset the you know Cole Anthony zooming Off the Bench routine is Gary Harris worth a replacement play I doubt it in Roto had to head I mean maybe if you need to like two threes in a steal almost definitely get you that  that's not much  especially here on an overload day and then Orlando's off for a while remember there's you know no actual game's Sunday either  we don't have action we don't have actual fantasy basketball get into next week after tonight so maybe Jaylen suggest his back I honestly I thought he was much I thought they injury was worse it may turn out that he's just out for a little while and they were sort of being Coy about it  in any event  let's see what we got here Atlanta's next on the board Trey young is the the question mark for today a lot of guys get to do more stuff DeAndre Hunter moves across the cut line when young is out because he gets more shots and then a bunch of guys that were already doing a bunch of things get to do more bunch of things  Philly we're watching Kelly oubre impact on anything else as well Washington just you know can they be competitive here against Brooklyn Camp Thomas had a really bad ball game and people freaked out and you know they can because he's also a guy who doesn't have a massive fantasy profile outside of scoring a crap ton of points so if it gets ugly it turns out ugly quick and then didn't witty as well  they've got some head-to-head style streamers on that team Dorian Finney Smith Royston Neil have been Head to Head level sometimes wrote Oh but in my opinion I I need a better guarantee  the next Josh Hart sort of the only question their boss and it sounds like for Singas is back so I know for so sad don't worry well you'll get another shot person gets never stays healthy for a whole year Minnesota heater I guess oh he should have been somewhere on my board Nazarene probably should have been a heater add can I go back retroactively and put nasri in as a heater add will you guys allow that  my bad I know I was gonna miss somebody  it's hard man you go through all 30 teams you're gonna miss someone  Grizzlies  man calves Evan Mobley is questionable he's out you'll probably see maybe Dean Wade move in but it'll just be more for Jared Allen and more probably more rebounds for Max Drew's that's been fun Miami we got all the streamers Golden State I do want it that's an interesting one so we'll have a better idea when Golden State announces their starting lineup if it's the same craft ink one they've been running out there then you know womp womp we won't get any information but it would be kind of cool to see Steve Kerr go you know what Wiggins yes suck  and Moody you're going  Moody might be an ad if he gets thrown into the starting five as a maybe  Thunder nothing Bulls that's all just about  stashing time these days so not much there Spurs  not unless they somehow decide to trade Jones finally gets started minutes that would be the thing that would move a needle there  Houston nothing Denver nothing King's Keegan Murray by we know that Malik monks minutes what if he has a cold shooting night I was minutes disappear that's what I really wanted to know their with Monk Phoenix is down probably three starters so Eric Gordon's gonna do a bunch of stuff you might even see Kate's job do a little bit too but I wouldn't start him in Roto  Clippers Norman Powell are you or aren't you worth my damn time  the Jazz man's um  Jordan Clarkson might be back which probably helps a bunch of other guys even if he's not really a nine cat guy himself  but with Mark and still out if Clarkson does come back this may be the game where we see him take 18 19 shots which that's funny if you got him in points League I get  Dallas see what Derek Jones Junior does if two of those other winges are out and then poorland I'm very interested in to see if any of these Fringe dudes can get a reliable 30 minutes on the floor I'm sort of doubting it  but hey at least we got Simon's back  a little bit of a game-changer in a lot of formats every time it's good very very well be in the top three three-pointers guys this year  just trying to think of like who's hitting a lot of Threes right now Steph is at 5.1 Lucas at 3.9 halliburton's at 3.9 these guys have actually played some ball games Simon Says hit four a game but he's only played two bogdon's at 3 and a half or sorry bully on bug zdanowicz lamelo is at three and a half Tim Hardaway was a 3.4  Steph is out in his own Stratosphere but Simon's could be one of those like four a game kind of dudes  not be good for his field goal percent but that is intriguing I am intrigued by this could he be  top two or three and three pointers made this year I think that's a possibility  okay I wanted to try to keep this one to about 45 minutes I think we're right around that marker so let's go ahead and pull the plug on it because I want to save my voice at I had to do I just say had to do I was fortunate enough that certain schools in and around Los Angeles Cal Poly Pomona be one of them you USC LMU these places give me the awesome opportunity to do play by play for them throughout the year so I had two ball games yesterday in addition to the podcast  so I did about five hours of broadcasting yesterday and my voice is tired and I want to debut a brand new show type here later on today my hope is that if my voice is okay and timing works out because the nanny sick today will be able to do the first ever Dynasty edition of fantasy NBA today where I don't say a word I'll be there and I'll say things like hmm interesting that's very cool but Mark Camaro who's our Dynasty lead at sports ethos is going to be on with me he's gonna be giving you guys the dynasty adds the dynasty Fades basically the key moves to make here after watching about six and a half weeks of this 2023 campaign and you got a nice little layoffs over the weekend if you want to try to do something about it cuz I know you Dynasty nuts you guys are making moves literally every second of every day and this is a great time to do it when you don't have to worry about setting lineups after tonight so that would be pretty cool if we can get that going later today stay tuned to make sure to subscribe no matter how you're taking in the show that will be a way to make sure that you get to hear that  show when it drops  I say when because I'm I'm feeling optimistic in the meantime I am at Danvers over on social I just dropped like two or three threads this morning alone and I got to do another one maybe I'll wait on the next one my fingers my voice they all need a break man needs a break  and go check out Sports ethos  but more than anything just come hang in our Discord seriously we've dropped links to basically all the stuff we got going on
