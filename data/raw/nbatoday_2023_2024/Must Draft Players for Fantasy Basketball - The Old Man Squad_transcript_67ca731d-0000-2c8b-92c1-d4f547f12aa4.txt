welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  that's that  it's time to go man  it's time to roll  it's old man squad time on fantasy NBA Today Big Show Friday October the 20th four days from the start of the opening start of the opening the opening of the start the beginning of the NBA season I wanted to address to the nine today so you guys got the Saved by the Bell throwback t-shirt  Cal Bears hat  same stupid draft board behind me  and an exciting day indeed  quick Preface on today's show  the old man squad is not a list of sleepers  it's not that common of a misconception it is a very uncommon misconception but it is one of the less  these are not sleepers these are the players  ranked basically like zero through 120 or so  that I simply think are going too late in drafts for some variety of reasons combination of them or just one very obvious one up they are separated into  chunks so to speak  the borings  the guys that kind of originally made up the Dan Bass Pros old man squad the boring players who are falling because they are somehow boring  they are the totals monsters  six players that I deem not monsters on the per game side but like to elevate your team by plowing through a solid season of basketball the games cap Darlings these are the players that you play in games cap formats typically that is a roto but as heard from Josh a couple days ago on this show he is running a head-to-head league with weekly games cap and then there is one one player that I've decided is my single not so boring swing of the year I am Dan Vespers this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation you can find me on social media at Danbury and I really would strongly strongly strongly encourage you to do so the season now four days away we have so many things that we can only do with a speed of social media I can't get out and do a show every time a little piece of news breaks but I can break it down on Twitter so find me over there if you haven't already specially those of you that are finding me for the first time via the podcast or YouTube I encourage you to sort of Loop in the social side make it one big bucket altogether all so Bruce you want 50 remains on sale

was amazing go check that out it's Sports ethos.com  so now you understand what the old man squad is it's not sleepers its players that I think are falling I have given my per game and totals ranks on them those of you that are watching with us on YouTube live or after the fact you like actually get to see the name don't worry pod listeners I love you guys you guys are my rider dies I will be reading all of the names and all of the numbers as well let's get going it the old man squad 2023 2024 this is the list of the incredibly boring per game winners there is by the way just a quick sneak preview three more names on the second page I couldn't fit them all on one page of Microsoft Word because we have like 35 names to get through today so we got to dive in quick  to that end I'm not going to be doing three four five minutes on every one of these players that would be a three-hour podcast nobody wants that so we're gonna try to do about one minute per player on the old man squad and that'll get us through this thing in about a 40 to 45 minute show  first name on the list is organized by Yahoo pre-rank right now not ADP Kyrie Irving he's preaching 14 I have his per game Mark at 9 and his totals Mark at 11 the players at the top of the board do tend to be a bit more injury-prone as you saw last year the average number of games played for the players ranked in the first round on a per game side was in the mid to low 60s so someone like Kyrie who I expect to get into the middle of 60s will not lose that much on the total side against this per game number he's getting drafted now in the early to mid second round he's the first rounder on a per game side and is a turn value by totals he is the first name on the board and the thing that's hard about the top and again I don't want to spend too much time on this but if you look at the first you know three maybe four names on this list  there isn't a whole lot of room for them to beat their ranking simply because they're just aren't that many numbers in front of 14 that you can get to  I don't expect Kyrie Irving to be number five and frankly the guys in the first round I generally expect to be pretty damn good  you guys have heard me on this show talk a lot about how I think that  someone like a Tyreese Halliburton who was going at 5 or 6 or whatever it is right now I think he's gonna be a great first rounder but I can't put him on the old man squad because what's the game there you get him at five he finishes at 5 technically that's a win because if you're first rounders don't lose to their drafts slot it's a win but that's why I didn't put any first rounders on this board it's not because I don't like the first rounders it's because the ones that I do like mainly obviously Nicole yokich Tyreese Halliburton Shae Gill just Alexander I think Kevin Durant at the end of the first round is all a nice one I like game I like Jayson Tatum like I like all these guys but there's no where for them to go really so I didn't put them on the list should have said that the outset old man squad will not have any first rounders  second name on the board is Jaron Jackson Jr who I realizes not an easy player to build a team around but going late in the second round where he is now the pre-rank of 20 and typically going later than that is a pretty damn easy number hit for him to get to  he was number 19 by totals last year despite missing the first five weeks of the season with an injury he finished at number 12 on a per game basis in only 28 and a half minutes per night on 19 points 7 boards and four combined defensive stats know John Moran for 25 games JJ's can have no choice but to do more this year than he did last year at least for the first 25 and maybe maybe longer which means even if the block number comes down off of three he'll cover some of that with other stuff I expect him to be a top 12 player per game again and I expect to see the durability that we saw most of last year  after he came back from his season opening injury he gets to do that to start the season this time I've got him as a late first rounder by totals the number I have on the board is eight I will say again numbers are a little bit hair splitty here in terms of like what's the difference between calling JJ the number eight player by totals and number nine not all that much what you should take away from this is that I think he's a first rounder on both per game and totals which makes him a guy I like drafting late in the second round  Jimmy Butler is the next name on the list he's preached at 23 his per game Mark I have him back at basically 11 which is pretty much where he was last year he was 10 I have a moving down ever so slightly not necessarily because I see Butler getting worse but because I see one or two guys getting in front of him without his stats changing all that much someone like a Kawhi Leonard who will likely be better than Jimmy Butler per game over the entire season I think there's a pretty decent shot that Jayson Tatum can also get in front of him JJ even has a chance to get in front of him I don't know that anybody that was in front of Thunder Butler last year falls behind him this season so it's not that I see him necessarily getting worse on a per game basis I just see other guys getting a little bit better so that puts him basically at the same spot I think he plays in about the same number of games this year that he did last year which was 64 maybe 6566 the heater going to need him mostly upright so by totals I have Butler in the first round as well he to me no matter the format I think is a layup at the end of the second round  I say that and then I have to always sort of put the qualifier  no catastrophic injuries  okay no catastrophic injuries  if that happens to one of these guys  what are you gonna do  many of you are probably looking at the old man squad list and wondering where the hell Kawhi Leonard is don't worry there's another section of the board for players like that  Myles Turner is the next name on this boring side he is going at number 34 on Yahoo boards right now I have his per game ranked at 22 which is a little bit behind where he was last year he was in that 18 to 20 range most of the season I think Indie got better around him so I don't know that he has to do quite as much but I love Myles Turner he has the JJJ stat set which is some points some rebounds some threes a ton of defensive stats doing it without hurting your percentages from that big man spot the Unicorn build is just such an easy one to get fantasy stats out of Turner's always a little bit beat up and as you get into the second third round you get into guys that play in more games per year so if he plays in low 60s of games played 63 64 something like that that probably does shade his totals a little bit lower so I have those at 26 but that still puts him as a win in both numbers against his ADP and what I tried to do with pretty much all of the guys on this boring list the the sort of traditional part of the old man squad is guys that I think beat their ADP both per game and totals  Nick Clarkson at 50 is the next one you'll notice I have a run of Center's on my old man squad list I think they're generally undervalued here because everybody's making a run at assists and scoring in the first few rounds but there are other ways to win your fantasy league and Clarkston going at 50 is patently absurd  he was number 24 last year Brooklyn might run a little bit smaller at times but if they don't have him on the floor they don't have any defense so ultimately they're going to need to get him out there he did it last season playing just 30 minutes at night so we don't really need a minute Spike and even if they drop by one one and a half I don't see that as a really big issue for him but I did shade that into it I think it's per Market drops by about half around I've got him at 26 per game he was very durable last year I have no reason to believe he won't be again I didn't go too aggressive on the durability with Claxton because remember last year Nick played in 76 ball games so even though he was number 24 on the per game side last season by totals he was actually one of the top ranked guys in the league at number 16 I didn't go that high this year I bumped his totals up by a little bit to number 25 but it could actually be better than that you could probably get him inside the top 20 if you get a little bit of a Repeat Performance  Walker Kessler at number 53 is one of my favorite Center values on the board I have his per game market number 31 which I think I could have gotten even more aggressive with that then I did you know second half of last year Kessler was number 19 on a per game basis he has that big body build that I love out of a big man in that he's not gonna get knocked around you don't have to worry about that type of stuff he's not leaping high in the air so you don't have to worry about that type of stuff he's just Stout man he's a stout player who does good things you could even see a potential bump if his free-throw percent gets any better than 48 I know historically he's not a good foul shooter so I don't think that I would put my eggs in the basket of oh his free throw percentage is definitely gonna get better but it could because 48 was god-awful and if I remember right and I can probably dig into this I think in college he was at like 58 59 so even just getting back to that Mark moves him up the board substantially and would cover any losses in blocks per game  Kessler was amazing he was very consistent over those last three months if you shade it down to the last two months he was still number 22 if you shaded down to the last month  I actually don't remember where he was I think he was like 30 something  yeah because he shot 41% at the line no worries about that I think that number comes up a little bit Walker Kessler is a very good value at 53 and I want to keep moving this list along so I'll stop yammering about it now Jared Allen right behind him at 54 is a value Alan opened up earlier remember on Yahoo boards and then kept falling he was not necessarily going to be on the old man squad list because last year he finished at number 33 per game I have every reason to believe that he's going to be doing about the same stuff this year I don't think the calves run too small I think they liked having that sort of two lines of Defense between Mobly and Allen  but again I wanted to cover the idea that maybe there's a little baby size drop off so I put his per game mark this year at 36 and said of 33 I put his totals at 36 as well because we know he's dealing with some stuff to start the year and last season he got to about League averaging games played I still like Jared Ali he's not my favorite of these Center run guys as you can see from the various rankings on the board before you but I do still think that he's a small size win their how many names have we done here seven or eight every seven or eight names I just want to take a quick moment to remind you guys of what we got going on please take a second here hit that Thumbs Up Button I'm gonna I'm gonna nail you guys with that on this show I'm gonna remind you over and over and over again because this is the one that I really want to explode I know we only got four days before the season starts but I really want this show to do extraordinarily well you guys know I put a lot of work into this one a lot of energy a lot of research and I'm going to talk a lot and I'm gonna talk fast so please take a second to hit the Thumbs Up Button there like 40 us a lot of you that have already joined in here I know that number usually grows as we go those of you in the chat room I can see you chatting hit the button subscribe to the YouTube page as all so important but just hit that thumbs up man let's make this video really blow this one out of the building and do find me on Twitter over at Dan best press d a n b e s b r i  let's get back into it  next name on the board is Tyrese Maxey who  I mean he doesn't fit the traditional old man squad board because I don't think that you'd call him boring but the nice thing about Maxi is that he derives a lot of his value out of strong percentages or certainly strong for a guard 48 plus from the field 85 at the free throw line and low turnovers I get that he scores a lot so maybe that takes him out of the boring Zone but I think James Harden's going to be gone soon Maxie towards the tail end of last year was inside the top 40 per game I think there's a very real chance he gets back to that Mark this year so I actually put him at 40 on my board because I wanted to try to go easy on my rankings I didn't want to get too aggressive here I have his totals at 34 I think he stays more upright this season no one big injury to knock him out like last year I just think it's going to be a good season for Tyreese very different stats at some of the guys that we talked about before him because we had I think five four five centers on the board already we get back into the guards here with Maxie he's going at 58 I think he's got a really nice shot to beat That by around round and a half maybe more if you got a little bit more aggressive Jalen Williams at 63 is my next player on the board he much like Walker Kessler was just an absolute Behemoth the second half of last year and maybe more so if you really just went down the stretch when he got aggressive in the Oklahoma City offense and started to take close to 13 shots a game 18 points 5 boards for assists two defensive stats combined he made over a three-pointer he shot 55% from the field and 89 at the free throw line I don't know that that 55% sticks for Williams so I'm not gonna say that he's gonna be inside the top 20 like he was for the last 25 games last year but I put him at 39 which is still a two-round jump over his draft slot at 63 I put his totals pretty aggressive here at 21 I like his frame I like the Jalen Williams body type to mostly play once he was out there he mostly played  he missed like one game the last two months something like that so if he keeps that pace up over the course of a year you're looking for a really nice total season I think there's a good shot Jalen Williams get up gets up to about 7374 games this year and that'll give him a pretty good size bump over his per game if you push him over onto the total side I like cam Johnson at 65 he's not one of my super jumpers but I think he's boring as heck which kind of fits the build here for the Dan Vespers old man squad cam was in the 50s last year 55 I think he's got upside beyond that because he's again like Maxi he gets you three-pointers without damaging your percentages  where he has an advantage over Maxi is that he gets better steals where Maxi has the advantages he's gonna do more on offense but for cam Johnson full complement of minutes he could get you 1.4 steals this year full complement of shots he could get you 16 17 18 points 33 pointer is within reach for him in a full season in Brooklyn I don't know what we need to get so hyper aggressive with him to get him to the marks where I put him here but he's going at 65 I got his per game Mark just inside the top 50 at 408 I'll go ahead and put his totals at 48 as well because he has been dinged up a tad so let's get into about 66 ish games and that'll give them about a round round and a half here as well  a long time member and perhaps the biggest value we had on The Dan best Bristol man squad from last year Brooke Lopez he's going at 72 72 people I've got his per game Market 37 which is still way off the pace from last year I don't care that Dames in town I don't care that Middleton missed a ton of time last year because with Lopez I don't care if he loses a shot or a shot and a half in this offense his value was out of block shots I still think he's gonna get a bunch of those with Lillard replacing Drew holiday if anything the Bucks are gonna have to funnel more to the interior defense because holiday could keep people in front of him in a way that lizard can't so I'm not worried about Brooke I know that you could say sort of contract to your stuff but it's not like he signed a long-term deal anyway he is just a perfect fit for the type of things they do in Milwaukee even if they change the schemes around I still think his block stay somewhere between 1.8 and 2.6 this year peeling off from 22 even if you dropped him back into the 40s he's still a two and a half to three round jump per game all so aside from one season with a back issue he's been very very  healthy after all the foot stuff in Brooklyn so I'm not worried about that either let's keep moving along oh we got a lot to cover on today's show tyus Jones at 77 I could have probably put him in in the games cap darling category but I'm just not that worried about the end of the year I think there's a chance that even if the Wizards shut things down partway through Jones is a guy that might just play on and off despite that but because I didn't want to get too aggressive I went ahead and I put his per game and totals marks at 54 each of them I just matched him up like I did with Jared Allen because I think his games played number is relatively close to League average this season I don't think he gets inside the top 50 per game I think Jordan Poole and Kyle kuzma are gonna do too much but tyus Jones with 14 some odd points I think is very well within reach maybe even a little beyond that seven assists is Within Reach This Year good steals numbers good free throw percent he'll keep his turnovers low so nice assist to turn over is a good way to get assist without damaging yourself in another spot  low 50s on both again that's a two round jump so I like it a lot Klay Thompson got bumped up from the 90s to the 80s on the latest Yahoo pre-rank board but I have his per game Market 50 this year that was where he was the whole second half of last season and I see almost no reason why that should change for this year his total is 62 I see him taking some games off but not that many he's Improvement mode so to that end like I don't know why he was going anywhere near as late as he was for as long as he was there's still value with clay at 50 makes a little more sense for Roto because of possible games missed I think there's actually a chance that he really clicks it up and gets into the 40s  per game this year but I didn't want to plant my flag in that  frankly because I don't think we had to he is a value even if you don't go that high so Klay Thompson  doesn't need a whole lot of explanation  to buy a Sara is former logo of the Dan Bass Pro man squad and one of the faces on today's thumbnail on YouTube  I'm not as excited a pause briefly on this one I'm not as excited about to buy as I had been in the past I just think that his role on that team is shrinking even with out Harden but we saw last year there were long stretches where he was a top 30 top 40 guy when Harden was out when Maxie was out  he'll find his way to doing stuff and an ink nurse offense there's just going to be more he's durable he's gonna be that kind of guy that nurse can play for 36/37 minutes a night if he really wants to and he might and this is a chance for him to kind of show up and blow it out so I went 60s I think I actually put the wrong number there I put 60 on the per game side I think I wanted to go mid 60s on that one copying this over into Microsoft Word by totals I went pretty high though totals at 43 he generally beats his per game on the total side because he is as durable as he as he's been for all these seasons and I don't see that changing this season either so by Sarah it's very boring very safe play in the late 80s and I'm on board with that one  Mitchell Robinson at 97 is one that doesn't really make a whole lot of sense in my eyes I know that people are constantly afraid of his stuff at least on the injury side  but even with it I think we still have wiggle room there Robinson was number 53 on a per game side last year I bumped him down to 61 just in case Isaiah hartenstein does something more on that team I put his totals at 71 because he has been banged up throughout his career but even then you're talking about three rounds of value on the per game side over his rank slot which is 97 totals in the 70s you're still talking to to two and a half rounds of value there  he's just a guy and centers have a way of rising up the board like this because they don't score a lot so they get undervalued but this is a point in a draft where you can take a guy who doesn't score that much Robinson at 9 and a half rebounds and almost two blocks a game like last year you also had a steal out of your Center slot and the word on this street and I don't know that I believe it but the word on the street is that he's working on his free throw stroke which was awful last year I 48% again like that is a big negative with him if you just removed that turned it into a smaller negative like you know he was like two standard deviations below what you need to get if he just turns himself into freaking like 55%  that moves him up half to a full round on the board so there's a way that actually he could even beat this Mark  John Collins is a little bit of a swing here at 100 I'm putting him in the borings zone I am  the low to medium confidence I almost left him off the old man squad board because I do think there's a better chance than some of these guys that this one fails but I also like the opportunity so Colin's  you know for a lot of these guys on the old man squad the story here is that I feel really good about consistency and just odds that they beat their number like most of these guys are looking like yeah the odds of this guy beating their number is really really high for John Collins it's a little bit more of a wide spread where he could come out and he could roll top 40 like he could legitimately get there he could also be an afterthought  so he's a little bit more of a swing but you average all that out and it puts your per game at 77 which is where I put in with a total rank of 72 I think the chip on the shoulder impact with Collins is going to be enough to get him there I think he's got a better shot than not of having a good fantasy season and so that's why I left him on the boring part of this board instead of shuffling him over into one of the other subheadings which you guys will hear about in just a few moments Daniel Gafford is next on the board at 102 good news on Gafford this morning by the way I don't want to necessarily date this show but he did get Center eligibility on Yahoo we knew that was gonna happen I thought it might take a game or two into the season for Yahoo to be like oh yeah by the way this guy's they're starting center but they did it today great news for Gafford that we don't have to wait on that I've got his per game Market 73 he's always been a top 75 guy when he got started his minutes I think that's what you're looking at this year there's upside beyond that there's also this notion that he's always hurt which is not true he has little nagging things but he plays through them and he played in high 70s in games last season now admittedly the minutes load will be bigger so that doesn't increase the chance of some kind of injury creeping up on Gafford and make and being part of the mix but I got his totals at 55 I think he's one of the really nice leapers at this part of the draft a guy you should Target if you don't get  some of those centers I listed in the third fourth and fifth rounds then you want to make a move on someone like a gaffer because I think he's one of the shur or bets at this part Zach Collins and other Center behind Gafford he's ranked at 104 on Yahoo's board right now I've got his pregame Market 80 his totals at 82 I still don't fully trust the Spurs to unleash anyone this year Collins there's going to be as the season goes  I think you'll see his role shift little bits because they'll have one but Yama playing a little bit of Center here and there  you'll see the Spurs you know Popovich he'll yank guys he'll move lineups around its gonna get weird at times but he's a ball move her out of the big man spot so they need him they want him to push some people around because he is kind of a giant human being so I think he's got a really nice shot at least for the first chunk of the year to have a pretty solidified role the fear there for me is that he sees like 26 27 minutes and they cap him out there and let one banana roll against Reserve big men you know smaller lineups he gets the other sentiments so that would sort of top out on Collins but remember down the stretch last year he was a top 40 guy  he was getting used to then that I don't know that he's going to get this season I think he's worth a swing he likes both Colin's actually here John and Zach Collins are worth a swing at this part of the draft Zach I probably like more in terms of what are the chances he hits John I probably like more in terms of what is the chance that if it hits it sticks but I like both of those guys here as that maybe they're not even I mean that Collins I guess isn't all that boring it's not fair for me to put them on the boring list but I like him so I had to put him on some part of this damn bored and he went here  last name on page one by the way we're making progress here on Yoko Kang woo who's number 106 on Yahoo I have him taking just a half round move forward on the per game side and here's why I said I didn't want to spend more than a minute on anyone but okang might be the guy we spend a minute on last year okongo was number 75 on a per game basis  a lot of that was low turnovers but a lot of it was all the fact that he's a big man that didn't hurt your free throw percent  he's not the Unicorn stock because they ain't in three pointers he's more of the rebounding shop blocking field goal percent kind of big but he did it without hurting your free throw numbers that's a big deal for him  he played 80 games so by totals he was an absolute monster last year but it's also worth pointing out that Clint capela who's not on this board by the way he almost made the Dan best result man squad he's sort of like an honorable mention was number 41 per game in 27 minutes a night and missed 17 games those 17 games okongwu was a top 40 guy he was amazing  but we have to remember that that's built in to the 75 final rank from last year when capella was healthy okongo was more like a top 100 guy  so you kind of have to come into this season assuming that okongwu is going to be a top 100 range center when Clint capela is healthy  and has a shot to be top 50 top 40 even top 30 sometimes when cappella misses ball games  we don't know how many of those are that are gonna be Clint has his story missed between 10 and 20 games per year he did have that again one or two seasons in there where you only missed about 10 games but mostly he's been in the mid to high 60s throughout his career Houston Atlanta whatever  so yeah you bake that all in on the O'Connor per game number which I have at 70 I've also baked in that maybe the minute split is more like 2622 this year and set of 2721 but it's little stuff  now the reason to really love a Kong in this part of a draft is if anything bigger happens to Capella Beyond just the usual Clint's got a sore knee Clint's got a sore back he's got to sit out a week in December he's got to sit out a week in February blah blah blah if anything larger besets capella that's how Hong Kong who can really rocket boost himself up the board again I love the durability I think he's a big winner in this zone so I kind of like him either way but just remember if you're drafting a Kong don't expect a lava hot start to the year  he makes his Mark when things happen to Capella and on days where and blowouts actually are good for him but just keep that in the back of your mind

page two you guys get to see all the other names if you're watching live if you're listening you still get the element of surprise  De'Anthony Melton there's three names left on the boring board you guys knew this one I've talked about him a thousand times running up to the season that doesn't make him my favorite play but it does in my eyes make him one of the easier choices Mountain last year just 10 points for boards two and a half assists 1.6 steals he does his damage with steals he does his damage with some threes he does his damaged by being actually a pretty good rebounding point guard size player getting you four of those a ball game in 28 minutes at night there's a chance with hardened move that he actually does get to take a little bit of a step forward I was a game at 83 I wanted to be pretty chill about it I have his totals at 61 I like what's going to happen for him in Philadelphia if or when hardened is gone again upside beyond that that's the beauty of it there is upside Beyond it if everything works out for Melton and we can't assume that's going to be the case but we can hope and that's why you get a guy like that where the floor is really nice and the upside has a chance to kick in  I put my Conley on this list but he's barely on this list because in my eyes his per game is right around the edge of the top 100 which in a lot of formats doesn't play but in a lot of formats it does because I really like his boat captaining role in Minnesota he's exactly what that team needed I in my eyes he's the reason that team made a really good run down the stretch not because of Any improved play from Anthony Edwards or getting cat back or whatever  it was Conley  that was one of those weird trades or everybody got better and then everyone else in the league got pissed about it because the Wolves moved Russell who's more of a Score first guard he can pass don't get me wrong be looking past but he's more of a scoring point guard for Conley who's more of a passing point guard on a team that has cat and Anthony Edwards and a rolling Rudy gobert was not an offensive Force but needs a guy that's gonna get him the ball in the right spot  Connolly fits that better he makes a team better Lakers needed someone to take the pressure off of LeBron and AD and Dilo can go get his own shot you taught needed to tank they needed to get rid of Mike Conley they got more picks everybody wins  anyway Conley I've got him at 97 on a per game basis I think he's just gonna quietly float along with about 13 14 points and about six and a half seven assists a night  not going to do a whole lot else steals haven't been there as much in his older years in the NBA so maybe you know one one point one something like that good free throw percent not good field goal for him turnovers he'll keep relatively low so it'll be good for that getting assist without blowing up your turnover stuff  but I just think that like we talked so much about how you got to make a run on a cysts at the beginning of your draft and I don't know that that's necessarily true because not only is my calmly floating out there but you could even take a shot that Kyle Lowry stays up right for two months he's not on the old man squad board because I think he ends up playing like 45 games to get this year and I simply can't put him out there but for a guy who's getting drafted like 160 or whatever Lowry's a great per game fill in because he'll probably be like Conley around the edge of the top 100 until his body falls apart and it will  by the way Conley is pretty ranked at 15  at 19 the final name on the boring old man squad board is Josh Hart who I went back and forth on about 50 times this run-up to the season will Donte divincenzo ruined Josh Hart this year  and I think the answer is no  because  I believe that heart who they signed to a nice extension they paid him  Josh Hartz a wine connoisseur did you guys know that I thought that was an interesting little footnote on him I just think he's super happy there  he's good friends with his teammates dating all the way back to their days as teenagers basically  and so and thinking about how the team performed late last season they were just better when he was logging bigger minutes and when he played 30 minutes with the Knicks live season he had put up top 60 numbers 10 points seven boards from a shooting guard three and a half assists 1.4 steals half a block he hit a three-pointer he's got his confidence back shot 59% from the field which probably doesn't stick long-term but 79 at the free throw line is fine turnovers were relatively low I just love the out of position rebounding from heart it makes my heart all a flutter so I put them in there with a per game Market 79 I think he manages to stay inside the top 100 he's a guy like Patrick Beverley that rebounds so hard from the guard spot that he plays himself into injury so I got his totals down at 91 but again at 120 basically which is where Melton was Yahoo moved him up 11 spots in their last board at 120 for heart I think it's a pretty safe play here and a guy that in my eyes is just going a little bit too low  a reminder again here before we get to the totals Monsters the game's cap Darlings and my single not so boring swinging this is not the Deep sleepers list if you're looking for me to like get into the Weeds on someone like a Paul Reed or an Astor Thompson this is not the show for that those are not old man squad guys those are guys that you're  those are sort of deep sleepers I think we had a sleeper show these are guys that we've talked about with the other analysts don't our mock draft review over the last couple of weeks this is not that  the old man squad and I feel like I need to repeat this  because we're 40 minutes in and a lot of people have joined up since the first few minutes of the show  the old man squad this particular part of it which was like 20 some odd names deep I think these are guys where I have a lot of confidence that they will beat their per game 80P Mark or pre-rank Mark and totals guys like the like the Thompson Twins or Thompson brothers now that the brother sorry uh  these guys  probably have issues with percentages start slow finish strong stuff like that this is not that list  this is not the big swing like Obi toppin list this is not the Derek Lively's this is this list is not the guys that have the 10 15% chance of hitting but really maybe it locks in  those are the guys you're taking at you know 125 or deeper  these are the guys before that typically 120 or earlier on the old man squad what I think they are just going too low  so that list that we just completed where the guys that I felt beat their ADP or pre-rank both per game and totals  the next part of this list are a little more caveat ish  well do the totals monsters first these are the guys that might be there pre-rank on a per game side but I feel almost definitely will beat it by totals and by enough where it's worth spending on that draft pick two of them are actually in the second round one of them is Mikhail Bridges who I think actually loses to his pre-rank on the pre-game side he's preached 19 I don't think it's pretty his per game number beats that  I know everybody's like Abbey scores a ton in Brooklyn now yeah but his efficiency suffered  Bridges is number 31 over the entirety of last season  it didn't really change when he was in Brooklyn he was number 25 per game while taking 19 shots a night you averaged 26 points for and a half boards almost three assists two and a half three pointers  but his deals and blocks came down a little bit his field goal percent came down a little bit love the free throw number getting the line is great but if fishing sea crept in and that changed his Target number  still he is and I know that we talked about like yeah obviously Anything Can Happen guys can get hurt his workload is going to be bigger  he is the most durable player in the NBA right now and yes you know guys are like that until they're not Karl Anthony towns played in every game for like three seasons in a row and then he's been hurt for like three of the last four years that could happen to bridge as well his body type isn't the same as towns he hasn't been run into the ground by Tom Thibodeau I think the minutes for Bridges were still only at about 34 even once he got to Brooklyn last year so I've got his totals rank in the first round at nine I think he just I you know 7879 80 games when you're putting up late second round per game gets you into the first by totals and a good example of that is Bridges from last year who was number 31 per game but was number six by totals  vouch was actually another one he's coming up in a minute on this list he's the fourth name on the totals Monster's part of this board  second totals monster is Desmond Bane and I know what you're thinking Dan  Bane was hurt a bunch last year yeah but it was one big one  it was one key injury that knocked him out for sadly a whole bunch of time or I think he would have had a monster season he played 58 games he missed something like what 18 19 20 of those all in one chunk the guys that I'm worried about on injury stuff or the guys that constantly miss one game every week every two weeks that type of stuff that adds up  the Danilo Gallinari who are always dealing with hamstring I know he's been out for a year with a catastrophic deal but that type  honestly Jared Allen's a little bit that type he's always missing a game here and there with something Jimmy Butler is that type  that is in my eyes the one where you're like okay I can handicap these missed ball games  with Bane it was one big thing  last year he was number 25 before he got hurt  and this year he's got a third of a season where he's the number one guy on the team  he's going to post absurd numbers  I've got his pregame Mark for the season at 24 I think once Jack comes back he's more like a late 20s or early 30s guy but you average that out and it put some in the early 20s per game I think he stays healthy most of this year I've got his totals Mark at 12:00  so again per game Mark slightly behind where he's getting drafted to 21 totals I think he smashes it DeMar DeRozan is the next player on the list I think he's at number 44 by the way I do think Demar takes a little bit of a step backwards this year the Bulls want more Kobe white so Demar taking 18 shots and seven free throws his feels a little bit of a stretch but I don't even care if he takes a small step back he was number 20 you could even bump him down by a full round if you wanted to and he still beats that 44 Mark I bumped him down only by a little bit because I still think he's Demar at the end of the day per game at 30 great health I've got him at 20 by totals last year he was 28 per game and last year he was 18 by total so I basically just bumped him down two slots yes I think there's a little bit of an erosion you could even argue that there's more erosion and I still think he bashes that number 44 number because he's a guy who plays historically he plays and he'll play again this year  one of the other faces on the YouTube thumbnail you know he was coming is voucher Nico stay in in Chicago two guys in a row here  vouch does likely see his role shrink as well much the way that we just talked about with Damar because you've got Levine you've got to Rosen you've got more Kobe white but vouchers a pillar of consistency he's a pillar of efficiency I don't need him getting 14 shots a game he can do just fine with 12 12 and a half and I think that's probably what he gets because he's gonna rebound 10 11 rebounds a game he's a good passing big man he got you three plus assists last year blocks and steals could actually tick back up a little last season they were a bit lower than usual turnovers are low he plays and he plays any plays  per game Mark I've got him dropping by around from last year vouchers at 26 last season I've got him at 38 this year I've also got his totals Mark dropping by around by totals he was number five last season  five  I've got him in the teens this year  that's still destroys 57  57 is his pre rank on Yahoo right now  even I'll throw I was throw him out there because Josh and I are you about who on one of one of his shows and even he pointed out on Twitter when I last night I was like what in the world vouchers at 57 Josh is like even I think that's too low so this is like  if you just not the Gimme the tapping of the fantasy season at 57 I really don't know who is really big crowd here coming in and watching this one live I'm very grateful by the way and I will do the quickie at Dan best person on Twitter please hit the Thumbs Up Button Let's Make a Difference here let's make this show our biggest ever and you can do that biggest non-trade deadline show ever and you can do that by subscribing on traditional podcast channels subscribing on YouTube and hitting that Thumbs Up Button let's keep cooking we're almost at the end of the board I knew was gonna be an hour but I had weird fleeting hopes of doing it in 45 minutes Austin Reeves is a totals monster in my eye because I actually don't think that his per game value beats his Rank by all that much he's ranked at 98 on Yahoo  I think it's per game Mark is in the 80s which is fine it's not that different from 98 you know that's two or three good games versus two or three bad games it really doesn't change much over the entire year but I also like his makeup he's just tough man he plays I think he's gonna play through stuff this year I think the Lakers know they need him out there so I've got his totals ranked at 67 which is a three round jump and that's more than enough to get him there I didn't put him on the boring side because I don't know that his per game Mark really beats it like he could finish at 100 which would technically be losing to his pre-rank I just don't see that many universes in the Multiverse here of fantasy basketball I don't see many of them where he doesn't get inside the top 70 on the total side so that's why I put him on this side and the last name on the totals board is actually the lowest ranked player of anybody on The Dan best results man squad on Yahoo and that's Bruce Brown at number one 26  because he is the definition of boring Bruce Brown last year finished at 121 on a per game basis for the Denver Nuggets  which I realized is not really a value for you in fantasy but he was doing it Off the Bench in 28 and change minutes per ball game in a very much non featuring role  he signed a contract in Indiana to go get a little more role so I think his shots go from 9 up into double digits I think it's minutes go from 28 and change into the low 30s and I think you push that stuff together  and he goes from 11 and a half points to say 13 the threes go from one point one to one point three the rebounds go from 4.1 to 4.85 the assist get up near Four the Steals and blocks maybe each of them goes up by a 10th of a point and suddenly that's a guy who's inside the top 100 because it's so fast to move from 120 to 100 you don't have to change very much so I've got Bruce Brown in the 90s I put him at 91 here which maybe is a little bit aggressive but whatever and I think he's gonna play a bunch of games so I got his totals ranked at 77 which honestly is probably not aggressive enough looking at last year he was number 74 by totals with a per game Mark in the 120 range so I probably should have put his totals in the 60s honestly is he boring hell yeah is he gonna get you some nice totals absolutely easy to kind of guy you take in the 11th round when you've taken some shots early and you want to make sure that your team has a 11th player that you can plug in and not worry about it if everybody else is falling on their faces he's absolutely that guy  many of you are thinking there are some names that I Know Dan is going to say today why the hell have I heard them yet and the answer is because they make up the game's cap darling's portion of the Dan best old man squad  the game's cap darling's for those that are uninitiated are the players who are likely going to be hurt at some point this year take games off rest days injured days old as dirt you name it they're not great for head to head  their head to head aches headaches to headaches I think I may have coined a term their head to headaches  but they make so much sense in games cap formats because they're per game Mark is going to be so far out in front of where they're getting drafted that it doesn't even matter that they're going to miss a ton of ball games  and the first one is the most obvious name and I could have put his face in the thumbnail too and that's Kawhi Leonard who's getting drafted at 22  we know that healthy upright Kauai is a first rounder per game we know that Kawaii if they don't add James Harden is a mid first rounder per game  because like we don't even need a reminder  over the final three months last year basically the second half of the Season well I Learned was number four and all of fantasy basketball and he didn't miss that many ball games by the way not that that's the thing we're thinking about here he was actually number two by totals over the last three months last season number four by averages  27 points 7 boards for assists 1.6 deals 7 blocks two and a half threes on 53 and 94th he's an early first rounder  when he's putting up those numbers  is he going to get hurt of course he's going to get hurt doesn't matter if you're in a games cap format of course not Kawhi Leonard is a  a wonderful late second rounder in Roto formats he is a roto monster he has at many times in his career been the only player in the NBA to be a positive impact fantasy player in all nine categories do you know how hard that is  and not just barely either in fact the numbers that I just read to you guys make him over the last three months last year he was a positive contributor in all nine  including turnovers how do you do that when you're one of the feature guys Kawaii does it  he's the actual unicorn of the NBA  unicorns are bad in assists and  sometimes steals their low and sometimes points their low the real unicorn is Kawaii  that son of a gun when he's healthy  he's a positive contributor in everything  that's crazy anyway I've got his per game Market seven I've got his totals at 19 so I actually think he does beat his his ranks lot I mean on the total side but even if it doesn't game scap Roto you don't care Kristoff porzingis at 42 is the next name on The Game's cap darling I've got his per game taking a hit by about not quite a round he was on the turn last year I've got him dropping to about 20 I wrote it down at 19 here on the board totals rank of 37 I don't think he plays in I don't think he gets to 65 games this year with Boston but I don't think he needs to that's the difference they'll give him days off because the Celtics are going to put up a big big number in the winds call him this season they've got Drew holidays well there's no reason to push for singers they'll want him up right for the playoffs so he probably plays in about 62 games that drops him in my eyes into the 30s by totals but again I don't care because his per game Mark is going to be such a jump over his ranks lot specially this early on that you kind of have to on the Roadhouse  side the third oldest man in the NBA gets the next slide here and that's Chris Paul who's being drafted at 69 on Yahoo I've got his per game Market 47 and I can actually see it going higher depending on how the Warriors deploy him that's a two-round jump by totals I probably finish this pretty darn close to where he's getting picked I put his totals Market 65 I think the Warriors could do a good job of keeping him healthy by not running him into the ground you know 32 33 minutes a night is probably a thing of the past but 2930 or he's running the second unit he's getting the ball to two of the best Shooters of all time that's a good spot to be if you're one of the best passers of all time he'll get the steals I hope that his field goal percent does come back a little bit I don't need to know that we have to get it there but if it does that's the upside for him on the per game side that's how he gets back inside the top 40 and then you're talking about a possible three round jump which is pretty sweet yes he's going to miss game's but he's a game's cap darling and  Jeremy Grant is the last one I know everybody's worried about the Wizards I think the Blazers are your bigger fear for shut Downs because Grant is older the guys on the Wizards maybe not kuzma but like Jordan Poole he's still trying to prove himself he's not gonna want to go full shutdown tyus Jones this is his sort of chance to prove himself Jeremy Grant has been doing this for three years in a row I'm gonna go play for a bad team and whenever they tell me to take a rest cheers I'll take a rest  but as long as I'm up there I'm gonna beat my rank slot by a bunch  Jeremy Grant last year when Damian Lillard was out was a top 40 play I've got him at 53 because I do think that Scoot and Brogden and whatever those guys will take a little bit from him but he's got such a well-rounded game scores threes doesn't rebound all that much she'll get a few Steals and blocks and percentage is just a lot to like about there but he's probably gonna take the last month off so by totals I've got him behind his ranks lot at 83 per game I've got him beating it by about 20 and finally  I've got to pick one every year I pick one Buzzy guy for the old man squad that I don't think is Buzzy enough which is crazy because this dude is so damn buzzy and it's Chet Holmgren and it's mostly because by the way a lot of people pronounce his name wrong which I think is so funny because you've got these guys like  collabo who I can barely pronounce homegroup the m is in the middle  the N is at the end  screw up the hard ones people  anyway because I'm gonna screw up the hard ones until I hear their names on a broadcast I'm watching on NBA league pass  I think Holmgren who's getting drafted at 51 because he is the Unicorn style player  his floor is insanely high it's just very hard  for a player of that fantasy makeup to not post fantasy value the other guys like homegrown and will spend you know an extra one minute on him because we're basically at the hour mark here the other guys like homegrown  who have this same fantasy build our JJJ  Chris stops poor singers who's going to score more honestly but like so is JJ but let's be reasonable here we're just talking about the makeup Myles Turner  Brook Lopez these are the guys who score some maybe not a ton  rebound some maybe not a ton  I think homegrown might be a better rebounder than some of those guys  don't need to pass they don't it's not in their makeup  but they'll get you somewhere near a steal maybe a little bit less  2 plus blocks  and good percentages both field goal and free throw  they're just aren't guys like that who are ranked outside of the top 60  all of the centers that have that type of statistical makeup the two blocks per game potential  and good percentages  the lowest ranked one basically was Brooke Lopez last year I think  and he was what 22  like  it's damn near impossible for these guys to screw up fantasy rank value when you're good in both percentages and blocks and could even step out and hit a three but I don't even care maybe check doesn't hit a three maybe his field goal percent stays better  they just don't exist guys like that who don't have the obvious big anchor weight category  outside of that top 50 right so I've got Chad actually at 35 per game 40 by totals because I think his body's gonna take a little bit of a hit a hurt this year but it was kind of nice that he had a full season to fill out a little and you saw I'm actually absorbing some contact even during preseason games so that's my single not so boring swing I don't know how many home grins I'm gonna get on my fantasy team because I think other people are going to be reaching for him but if you really goes near 51 where he's ranked on Yahoo  I would do it and for early five  and that ladies and gentlemen is your Dan best Brazilian squad thank you so much for hanging out with us today or a reminder on the way out there are a lot of you watching and not that
