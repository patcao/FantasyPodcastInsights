welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  good morning everybody doing shows out of order today but you know what nobody cares and if you do why do you care  it's fantasy NBA today it's so High episode here to start off your Wednesday we'll do the recap show almost immediately after this one so make sure to hit that subscribe button on whatever  however you're taking in this show YouTube iTunes Spotify some other feed so that way you can be alerted when we do the next one  I am Dan Vespers at Dan best person on social media d a n b e s b r i s I will most definitely hang out with you guys over there so make sure to come join us on the social side this is a sports ethos presentation Sports ethos.com the website ethos fantasy became over on social media  we did buy lows yesterday in the afternoon I want to do sell highs today because I kind of prepped him together and I figured I might as well not those two shows out back to back so lets just jump right in and give you the cell highs for weeks six with the preface that this week is a little more mid Roundy there aren't quite as many of those guys at the very top like we've talked about in the past actually in a few of them here I'll just throw up on your screen as guys we talked about last week and the week before  I called it the previous calls page but as you might remember we talked about LeBron Darren Fox herb Jones Lou Dort those are some of the names that came up and a lot of them have kind of done what we expected LeBron is tapered off by about around Darren Fox is falling off by about a round and a half whereas Fox at yeah he's now down to 24 LeBron is in the middle second round these guys were at the top of the second round or even in the first Fox was the first round or a week ago  and you know they're just things that you knew wouldn't hold  and for Fox not that I think he'll fall farther but I do actually think he'll far farther because he was hit and you know four three-pointers a game or three points six or something like that that's a number we just knew was gonna come down  and he's taking 22 shots a night and ate  free throws a night  you just can't like there aren't that many guys in the NBA that can do that type of usage every single ball game and then maintain their body function Luca is a good example of somebody who has usage like that and then basically grinds down as the year goes  there isn't anybody else that's all that close frankly Joel embiid would be the next one because a lot of his stuff comes at the free-throw line but like  she is at 21  these guys that have that type of responsibility they do just tend to taper off a little bit so herb Jones we've seen him slow a tiny bit that one wasn't a big surprise Lou Dort has completely fallen off a cliff Kyle kuzma is actually been the guy to hang on so we had him on our cell board a couple of times he's still holding largely because he's become point forward for the Wizards that was sort of a development that I admit I didn't see coming I still think of you can sell on kuzma this is a great time to try to cash in because the Wizards are Beyond a mess but of all the calls on the cell High board the fact that most of them have already started to shift I think is a sign that we were mostly on the right end of those but let's talk about a few today and again these aren't going to be as I popping as some in the past I wanted to start with the name that I thought was probably the buzziest and that's us our Thompson who's currently ranked 70th and so you're thinking to yourself okay Dan a why now because he's already fallen off from his top 40 start and you'd be right that would have been the time to sell him  and so this isn't even really a sell High  and you may have noticed actually on the first those that are watching the show instead of listening the very first slide I put up on the board said sell high and then in parentheses it said or sell even  and a few of the guys on today's show are sell even guys and that's what us are Thompson is because I do think he continues to fall a little bit mostly that the 2.7 combined defensive stats probably don't hold all year the nine and a half rebounds still feel like something that could  begin to erode just a tad it doesn't have to be massive amount but let's remember that Jayden's kind of in and out of the lineup so far this year and the Pistons are struggling and at some point the grinds the rigors of an NBA season are already started to take a little bit of a toll on top and  do I think he's gonna fall all that far no I mean when he was Top 40 that was when it was like okay he's probably gonna get a tumble a little bit this is where you should really lock it in and  you know his arm mistake for not getting him on the board and sooner probably does still taper off a little bit because the percentages are not good you see that with rookies pretty often he's floating his value with defensive stats and rebounds that's great I love those categories but for a young guy who's gonna be beaten up as the year goes on those are things that can suffer  so I think he falls around two rounds sure something like that 70s to 90s to 100 and whatever  so if you can find someone who's nearby or maybe even a tiny bit better because I still think there's a lot of Buzz around Oscars start to the year you probably try to do it  can you take his 70 range and turn it into 60 or 65 somebody that's a little more boring like a Clint capela would actually be a really interesting kind of comparable player who you know is not going to get worn down by the season all so it's minutes or low so like there isn't really a whole lot of strain on capella right now voucher is a guy that everybody's freaking out about because the Bulls are terrible DeMar DeRozan who I had in the Bible Department yesterday if you can somehow collect like cam Johnson Yakima hurdle Jared Allen all of these guys are very close to us our tops and almost all those guys are dudes that I think probably move up or at least stay level for the rest of the year where the likelihood for Thompson is that he does continue to sort of trickle a little and the nice thing about it is  when osr was Top 40 you probably couldn't trade for another top 40 guy you might have been able to get like someone between 50 and 65 I still think even with this drop off for Thompson you can aim for somebody not all that far back of that so you haven't lost that much in terms of the trade value but I think this may be your last couple of chances to do it now that said he's probably gonna have a game mixed in here where he goes nuts and that'll be the one where you'd want to try to make the move at some point there's going to be that sort of Mega game that hasn't really happened since the first part of the Year remember the first few games it was five blocks it was you know eight defensive stats he had how many games early in the year he had three games in a row with double digit rebounds and they had a five out of six stretch in double-digit rebounds and right now he's in a little bit of a dip so the best advice is not to sell him today but to wait until he has the pop-off game the you know 12 points 14 rebounds two steals three blocks  and understanding that in that moment it's going to be hard to sell them because you're going to be like ooh this is him coming back around but you also have to remember average has happened they just happen over time his minutes are trending down probably because he's getting a little bit worn out  and he'll come looping back around after the All-Star break or maybe a little bit before that but the dog days of the Season really Crush rookies and so that's why he's on the board right now  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly

plus not available in all locations  next name on the list and because I didn't want you guys to think that I was just picking on young guys is the Old Man On Campus Chris Paul not the oldest player in the league that's LeBron but CP is quite old  and here's the thing  you're not going to be able to get equal value for Chris Paul because I think anybody in your league that's paying some modicum of attention is aware that Chris Paul is going to weaken with Draymond Green back his big game's largely coming when Draymond was out to start the year and then during Draymond suspension  he's been fine with Draymond around but he hasn't been you know like the top 50 type of point guard that he's put up these recent numbers with dream on out  I still think overall Chris Paul is going to be fine his field goal percent is very low he heard his knee and yesterday's ballgame or his leg or whatever it is just old man type of stuff and so probably miss a couple of ball games which is going to make this cell a little bit harder than when I prepared this last night before he left the ball game early  but he's hanging around in the early 60s even after the four minute game yesterday and despite the fact that he's old I still think you can probably get somebody in that 70 range back for him  which I realized is taking a little bit of a haircut over what he'd been doing Chris Paul had worked his way actually inside the top 6 0  you just kind of have to accept that and I didn't do this show three days ago if I had I probably would have said to aim a tiny bit higher but right now aim for somebody in the 70 range whether that's you know like a  I don't know if I would go Mike Conley that's my maybe two boring you're probably not gonna get Jerry  who else is somebody you could maybe look at we just talked about cam Johnson a second ago probably not as easy after a good ball game but someone to consider y'all can turtle we just mentioned you're probably not going to be able to get but maybe capella would be a Target very different kind of player I get it but again you just try to lock in these boring plotting types where you dodge what's going to be some kind of small drop off here for CP3 he will likely buffer some of that drop off with an improvement in field goal percent as the year goes because he's still at 39 and change actually technically these almost right at 40% now that'll probably work its way up to somewhere between 42 and 48 we don't know exactly where but trending upward the steals the assists are always going to be there but it's just gonna be a little bit less with Draymond doing a lot more of the offense running for the Warriors and I think probably they'd like to keep Chris Paul healthy or as the season goes so probably not going to kind of grind him into dust as the season rolls as well  so yes this is not like you're gonna make a massive profit this is not a supercell High moment for Chris Paul but it's a cell even ish or maybe take the tiniest haircut to avoid any kind of little erosion and so that's why he's on the board today  other in this same kind of trying not to you know lock in this is the Locking sell High episode I guess maybe the better way to frame it is Alex Caruso  who I adore from a fantasy standpoint he's in the 60s again this year and only 23 and a half minutes per ballgame we always body can't really take much more than that and the Bulls have said you know in as many words that he's on a minute's cap they haven't been super clear about what it is but if you just look at the ball games he's played basically anytime he goes over about 27 or 28 minutes he sits out a ball game or two like look back in November 8th he played 31 minutes he was an absolute Goliath in their lost to Phoenix three steals two blocks 19 points for three pointers on seven out of nine shooting and then he sat out two ballgames  and then he started to ramp up again he played 29 27 and 27 in there he put up these big fantasy lines then he clipped back down to 18 and then I had to take a day off  yesterday he was only at 19 it was a blowout lost he would have played another four five minutes late but just understanding  with Caruso it's a little bit of a moving Target on the minutes cap I think they'd like to keep him around 24 25 but in close ballgames he gets to go a little bit heavier 27 28 when that happens they give his toe a break  it's as simple as that  bulls have a layoff let the whole lead basically as a layoff coming up here with the in season tournament next weekend where I think basically there's one game for like three days straight in the NBA so we'll all get a little bit of a respite there maybe that's an opportunity to arrest him at the fear with Caruso is not that the minutes do anything because he's putting up top 65 value in 24 minutes of ball game right now that's great that's a sustainable number for him because the defensive stats are excellent the issue is does he get traded in a bull's blow up  and if he does does his role shift in any way  because anybody that acquires him is going to realize that he's also in that kind of has to be in that 25 minutes or less range  and I just don't know if he has the same Freedom or  yeah I mean it's just a question mark right you could just say yeah probably has about the same job wherever he goes but we don't know  we don't know changes terrifying if for the most part in fantasy what it's an unknown nebulous change the way a possible trade would be here so  I think if you can lock in anybody basically inside the top 90 you kind of do it not that like you want Malik Beasley who's number 90 because right now we know he's running extraordinarily hot but if you can get somebody who's a safe top 90 or better guy which uh so far this year someone like a Devin vassell feels like a pretty safe top 90 D'Angelo Russell this kind of a safe top 90 Mitchell Robinson and Drew holiday you're not gonna get Drew he was drafted too high but Mitchell Robinson on yakka oh Kang woo these guys are kind of safe just yeah like petering along top 90 type of guys I don't think you're gonna be able to aim much higher if you could get somebody like we talked about for Chris Paul like a Mike Conley or Keegan Murray or even a Dennis Schroder who I still think Falls a little bit but you know you lock in some assists  you try I just don't think it's gonna happen so you have to kind of be aware of what the the universe value is Caruso at is a low scoring type you're probably gonna have to take somebody back that's all so not a super high scoring type which you know maybe makes Devon to sell harder to acquire but some of these names in there that I just mentioned Jalen Suggs is not that dissimilar actually from Alex Russo in an overall fantasy type like we just talked about Conley he's only at 10 points a game who else did I mention D-Lo might be harder because he scores and gets assist but Mitchell Robinson only six points a game perhaps if you target these low-scoring guys maybe you could kind of flip them and get somebody back  it's a question mark I admit it but you want to try to do it before anything could come and put a dent into it Here's the final name on the board for today and this one's a harder one to pull off and so I do think it needs a little explanation and that's Devin Booker and a lot of you guys might be telling me that I'm getting kind of too locked in on this one and look I'll be the first to admit I did not think he was gonna start the year this hot but it's also be noted I didn't think he was gonna start the year as the only guy playing you know he's only played in nine games he missed a bunch of ball games earlier and Bradley Beal actually played a few of those not that  we may ever see Bradley Beal again as long as we live but he was actually healthy for a week how many games and Beale play three  yeah he's at three so far this year  then Booker came back and played a couple games with Kevin Durant most of his games have been with Katie but now he's played a couple with out him and basically what we've seen so far for both Kevin Durant and Devin Booker is they are effectively getting the best case fantasy scenario on all sides  because the one thing we talked about coming into this year was like Devin Booker's used to just gonna have to go down a little bit because he's playing with Kevin Durant and with Bradley Beal and I know that the rest of the team is a bunch of role players but if you're thinking back to what the sons did last season prior to the Kevin Durant play trade the only other guy that really ever had the ball in his hands was Chris Paul it's a Booker was taking 2021 shots a game these years when it was Devin Booker doing a ton and Chris Paul doing a pretty good chunk of stuff and the Assumption which I still think is probably an accurate one is that his overall amount of stuff to do probably does decrease with the massive caveat  that Bradley Beal has to eventually play a basketball game this year  we all graded out Booker and KD and Beal on this idea that they were going to be on the same team at the same time  we're however many games into the season now for Phoenix 17 18 19 games I don't matter what they're at right now but the guys haven't played together yet  and I didn't even really been all that close there was one day that they were all supposed to play together and then like during warm-ups they're like oh by the way Bradley Beal still hurt and now he's just out indefinitely  there's 17 games into the season and they haven't all played together  so we still haven't seen it  now the last two games we've seen Booker without Kevin Durant he's been unbelievable 40 points in one of them 28 and 11 in the other and yeah he's had some really massive games even with Kevin Durant 31 Point 13 assists game a 24-point 15 assist game up in Utah I think that was the only overtime one maybe either way  what we've seen and this goes for Kevin Durant too by the way I just I think Booker probably has more trade appeal as the guy getting more assists Who is younger and for whatever reason there's less fear about his health there's probably about the same amount of fear  but then the other side of this discussion is what could you even get  so that's why I almost didn't do this one but I wanted to put Booker on the board just because I felt like you needed to be talked about as somebody who's going absolutely insane he's at 29 Points 9 assists so far this year you know the percentages were gonna be good  that was a reason to like Booker out of the chute  but again  if you think so this is the big if you think Bradley Beal ever gets his butt back into a uniform and can stand upright for more than three days in a row  you have to believe that both Booker and Durant are a little bit of cell highs right now  I would say Booker more than KD because with Durant most of what he's doing is fairly repeatable like you probably see the field goal number come down a little bit but it's not like he's the big assist guy on this team that's something where you take the ball out of his hands that's a thing that goes down with KD he's sort of done what Booker's done just without the passing but Kevin Durant can repeat his Blocks he's gonna get more rebounds so that type of stuff is the reason that maybe you say okay well KD can probably hold on to a spot a little bit tighter but we Booker if you if you take the ball out of his hands the assists the scoring all that stuff comes down together with the rant I mean yeah so you take the ball out of his hands and stuff goes down because both of these guys are positive percentages dudes but more things  come down for Booker by basically one full category then they do for KD who's turnovers by the way are also extraordinarily high and that's a number that probably comes down for Durant so there's this sort of buffer against it I think both guys eventually take a little hit but I do think that Booker takes the bigger one  in the event that Bradley Beal is playing so I have to keep adding that one caveat if you think Bradley Beals gonna miss all bunch more time and right now there's kind of no reason to think he's not you know they're just like oh yeah we're gonna reevaluate him in a week or two or whatever it turns out to be but he hasn't played since November 12th he's already been out for two and a half weeks and we started having heard anything about him in the last like five or six days  it could be another month we don't know  and if it is then there's sort of no reason to think that Booker and KD can't continue to ride along inside the top 12 I just believe that at some point this year the suns are going to get healthy and at that some point you're going to want to make sure that Booker had netted you a top 12 guy and there's really no better time to do it than right now  the beauty of it is you don't Booker's number seven I think at the moment yeah he's both on on basketball monster and on Yahoo's number seven you could probably go get someone else who's just a traditional First rounder  like you could probably get Kyrie you could probably I don't know if you could get staph  I don't even know if you want to get Jayson Tatum whose for some reason way down the free throw number right and I didn't even notice that Jayson Tatum was down at number 20 so far this year because it's free throws down at around 80 instead of mid to high 80s you could probably get him if you wanted to I don't know that you necessarily would Dame is working his way up the board as we all kind of expected he would how much higher can he go well feels still at 41 and change these are guys you might want to consider moving Booker for in the next  not to be today because I don't think we've heard anything about Brad Bradley Beal at least I have it maybe you did that I didn't see it but I try to see everything as best I can stop something every once in a while and then the news the news feed uh but you probably have a window here and that's kind of the nice part and why another reason why I wanted to get Booker and or Kevin Durant on the board is because you've got a window to do it  so take your time if you need to if you want to ride book or out for another week or two while we still aren't hearing anything about Bradley Beal have at it  but I think there's gonna be a drop off to probably somewhere in the mid second round which is still higher than I thought he was gonna be but  this you know top eight thing is just  it won't it won't stick if the team gets healthy that's something I think most of us can agree on some of you out there still gonna be like oh yeah sister you know he's still gonna be like 99% of what he is now as just not how it works if you inserted another guy who needs 1819 shots into the mix and is also supposedly going to be running some point things are going to shift the Dynamics in a shift a little bit there will be a drop off the question is of course how much you think it's gonna be but I still think if you can lock in somebody who's a first rounder you do it  like a safe first rounder by the way Jayson Tatum not necessarily a safe first rounder although you gotta believe this deals in the free throw percent come back see if you can get one of those guys  if you can't no big deal you ride out Booker you'll probably be inside the top 20 because again Beale might miss two more months for all we know meaning he could roll here as a first rounder for the next however long so again there is no massive time impetus to get this thing going  if you think Bill comes back anytime soon that would be the reason to lock it in and that is  basically the story on that one and that's your board for this week we can go ahead and stop sharing that thing so you guys don't see a blank screen this is your cell High episode for week six mostly
