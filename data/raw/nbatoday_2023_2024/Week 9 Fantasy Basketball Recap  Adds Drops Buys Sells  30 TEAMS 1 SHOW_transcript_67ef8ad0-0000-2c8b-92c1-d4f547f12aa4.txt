welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  this one's always a crowd-pleaser I think  the hell do I know  it's our Friday show so our week in review podcast all the best ads  drops holds I'm nervous watch list guys  injury replacement board which is  longer than the freaking Dead Sea squirrels  a couple of baillos couple of cell Highs but not too many of those because we do have individual shows for that we run early in the week  and the stream wild warm bored that's new for this week on the pod  welcome  one and all I always want to say welcome foolish Mortals it's the first three words in Disneyland's Haunted Mansion ride welcome foolish Mortals to the Haunted Mansion but you will hear the sound of screaming children in the background on today's show there is zero question about that both of them are home there's no camps there's no nothing going on and they're playing I think hide and go seek with my mother right now so  you know life also representing today gotta take a moment to represent my shirt this is the Bakersfield Blaze 2012 California League first half Champions t-shirt  right baby  first half Champs  didn't get any better than that  we had some damn good players on that team though  it's a damn good players on that team trying to think back  Billy Hamilton was on that team when he was set in the minor league baseball record  who else made the big soft that Ross roster Tony Singh granny was in the big for a while  I had to go back and dig it up our team was a juggernaut the first half  who were those dudes  my memory is not that great anymore it's 11 years ago you guys got me some slack but look we got a lot to talk about on today's show we will yeah I last week I wiped out the the weekend look ahead because honestly it's a little bit redundant and so what I probably do instead is all scan I'll do my quick scan of the YouTube live chat see if anybody had any questions that I didn't cover during all of my week review stuff and if that's in there we'll do one or two of those and if it's not great we'll wrap things up quick reminder everybody of course you can find me on social media at Danbury d a n b e s b r i s  single most important thing you can do while watching or listening to Today's Show is to subscribe to the podcast  a lot of people at actually in the last like two days have been like  damn damn I wish I would have found you sooner I dropped tyus Jones at the beginning of the year  how many times did we say on the Pod Do not drop tyus Jones  he was like number one ten and remember when we did that breakdown they were 19 games I think into the season when we did the breakdown and we realized that nine of their 19 games had been to blow outs  so as minutes ties was playing like 24 minutes a game 24 and a half minutes a game over that strike because most of the time the games were just done after three quarters now all of a sudden he's getting an extra six seven minutes a game close game late fourth quarter  and he's number 57 now and there's these things and so anyway subscriptions are great not just for yourself for me yes obviously selfishly I want that but it also helps move the podcast up the board  total listens actually doesn't really typically do it unless it's like you know the shows that are doing millions of hits or whatever so please do it those buttons find me on social hang out in our Discord that link is in the show description let's  begin  I always struggle to figure out what size I want to make the the deal on YouTube I'll even at this size for an ah you know let's go big let's make sure everybody can see what's going on here so this is the weekend review thread is all so ported over onto Twitter if you want to see the names the show I think is really the place you want to be because we break it all down here and you actually get some legitimate  thoughts about the players I just throw it into a Word document kids are so loud right now I just throw it into a Word document I know it's sort of low-tech but whatever I give you guys a nice clear way to see it on your screen let's start with the ads I left our Easton on there for the third day week in a row because I'm still getting questions of what to do he he's an ad um I know we missed the last ball game with a sore knee I don't care last two weeks these number 70 in 26 minutes per ball game steals rate is through the roof and you know maybe that in the rebounding perhaps those come down a little bit but everything in Houston is pointing to East and getting minutes he's closing some ball games there was frustration in their last game with alpine so there's gonna be more willingness to go small if eason's healthy I don't know that that's a thing that's gonna happen nightly but even if it happens like once every four or five games that's still notable because it's just more minutes available for a guy that you may go really likes I don't think this one needs a ton of explanation because we're again this is the third time he's been on this board but  please Lord stopped asking about it just make sure he's on a roster and then the other super obvious one this week Isaiah hartenstein who on the last two shows or last two Friday shows was listed as an injury replacement player only  and technically he is still that  because if Mitchell Robinson was around hartenstein wouldn't be doing enough but there's this weird a disagreement right now  in the next front office  where  the Knicks applied for the disabled player exception or exemption meaning that they could get some sort of funds back  for a Mitchell Robinson's injury to use that wooden them against the salary cap and then they could go sign another Center besides Taj Gibson if they wanted to  but then in an interview  like 25 minutes ago Tom Thibodeau was saying that they still expect heart and Stein back in eighth or not they expect Robinson back and eight to 10 weeks  which puts us pretty damn late in the season you're talking about after the All-Star break you're talking about early to mid March  but  that's not the same as the entire season for our purposes the heart and Stein stuff it's almost the same thing  he's got two to two and a half months minimal of starting center value but then the question right now is just does he belong on my Straight ads board or does he belong on a long-term injury replacement board ultimately a doesn't matter he needs to be on a roster that's the only thing you need to take away from that this specific discussion so don't get caught up in the semantics of it people always like Dan this dude belongs on this board it's like no like listen to the explanation please don't overeat into the Twitter thread hardsteen it's gonna be good  Jericho Sims is questionable he's dinged up so that's like even more opportunity for him  Marcus Smart is hoping to be back tomorrow Saturday we'll see if it happens I would think that early next week would be the absolute latest that Marcus Smart would work his way back in here for Memphis I don't know actually if he's gonna be a nine cat 12 team guy technically he kind of wasn't before he got hurt you guys might recall that he was outside the top 100 12 and a half points five assists two steals a game the big turnovers was unsightly and if you wiped those out he jumps up about 30 or 40 slots so then he does get inside the top 100 and basically what I'm hoping for here  is that smart still gets some more in the like 9:10 ish shots per game so the usage doesn't alter that much  he'll get some assists because he'll be playing alongside jaw and Desmond Bane and Jerry and Jackson Jr and the turnovers will hopefully come down  screaming in the Next Room was absolutely hilarious right now I'm sorry guys this is just the magic of winter break you're gonna have to bear with me on this one so stash Mark is he's very close to coming back he was on this board last Friday as well and there's no reason to shift him off of that now that he's super close to coming back but I honestly couldn't figure out what board to put trayce Jackson Davis on he probably ultimately belongs in an injury replacement board because  because I don't know what's gonna happen with him when Brian comes back if dragon ever resurfaces at some point  he probably doesn't stick all the way through the season but for now I think you can call them an ad  if I'm in a roto League  I'm not playing him in the next game because I just have no idea what's gonna happen he could get 16 minutes he could get 209 there's this massive Gap there's no guarantee of what he's gonna get trayce Jackson Davis that is  head-to-head you see what happens  Warriors now have a really good schedule over the next little bit they played today tomorrow and Monday cuz they go on Christmas they're in Denver for that game so I had you got a really nice spot here three games in the next four days that should give you plenty of opportunity to kind of evaluate him and then look if he plays well because the Warriors have a beleaguered and also kind of bad Wizards team coming to town that just one in Portland last night this would be a great opportunity because there may be blowout chances the next two not that the Warriors are good enough to expect to blow anyone out but if this game gets opened up early or Midway through that's a time where you think where you figure he'd probably get to play a little bit more as well  so again I think it probably  you know  makes more sense to call him an injury replacement but  just for the sake of us talking about it on the podcast let's just put him here that'll simplify Our Lives  a couple of guys that I kind of jumped out at me lately are Aaron Nesmith who we kind of knew that Rick Carlisle loves he's now actually inside the top 100 on the season on the shoulders of a steel 0.8 blocks two threes and 54% shooting from the field and then obviously just never turns the basketball over but if you go recently it's actually been even better than that nice Smith over the last two weeks is number 53 in 9 categories yes someone unsustainable 2.4 combined defensive stats three three-pointers and 54% shooting yeah that's not gonna stick but he is dramatically under rostered in fantasy league right now and for good reason  for good reason because Rick Carlisle screws with all of these guys all the time  he's only 21% roster it is big ball game yesterday jumped him up a ton he was one of the big overnight ads but in a lot of leaks he's sitting out on the way for wire and he's actually been good enough to use basically for the year now if you just played him for every ball game he'd actually be a nine category 12 team dude  I don't know if that's something that sticks all the way through the year because as we've seen with the Pacers things numbers bounce around guys get healthy guys get hurt all that good stuff  but right now he's one of the guys they Trust  he's kind of been out playing Bruce Brown who makes it appearance later on the list so stick with us here  I think for Smith you pick him up right now with the hope that he actually could be arrested season guy  and it kind of a similar vein Prince also kind of falls into that could be a rest of season guy last two weeks he's number 80  his three-point percent has come around after a very slow start to the year in that department  where niece Smith has the edge over Prince is that he can more reliably do other stuff and Tori's never going to be a guy who sort of forces his way into extra shots so rest of season probably not I mean his bigger ball games have come while Gabe Vincent was out LeBron James was out things of that nature but their shoehorning him into minutes even when the team is healthy right now they just seem to like the way he fits and one of these one of the very few Lakers that can actually hit a damn three-pointer seems like nobody else on the team can do it  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the

today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  if you look at the stuff going on with Prince lately the thing that jumps out is even when the team has been mostly healthy he's still playing 32 33/35 38 minutes in these games  yeah they're losses but 4234 and 4 is the three-pointers over that stretch you also had a couple of five three-pointer games he's just knocking down outside shots he sort of on the court long enough to average up about a steal per ball game over that stretch and the same thing he just on the court long enough to get for rebounds and three assists because he's going to pass the ball Anthony Davis or Lebron everyone's in a while and some things gonna happen after he does that  I don't know that this is a thing that sticks all year  and it has a little bit of a like  kind of the kcp gets hot for a while and then we'll see people roles hot he rolls top 50 for a couple weeks and he gets cold and he's more like 150 for Prince hot is going to be like 75 and cold is going to be like one eighty so ultimately it probably doesn't stay above the cut line but for the moment and maybe he belongs in that new like stream wild warm category that I'll be revealing unveiling to you all here a little bit later on in the program for prints a lot a lot of it's going to fluctuate based on if he's making his threes and getting a steal that's you know one of the reasons that two weeks ago he had like a top 50 week this last week he's more like number 100 because the steals haven't been there  I'm gonna call him an ad right now  because mostly because he's running at least warm ish at the three-point line not like lava hot but pretty good and actually kind of sustainably decent in the low 40% range it wouldn't be nuts to see him shoot around that Mark for a season it could happen  I don't like him as much as some of the other calls here but I think he belongs here more than somewhere else and so those are your ads  let's move on to the holds board and some of these are easier than others obviously Alex Caruso's a whole these play he's been healthy as last two ballgames which I know we two ballgames who gives a crap but basically anytime he's upright and can make it through a ball game he belongs as a goal on rosters problem is that about one out of every three or four games he leaves after four minutes and doesn't come back so if you look at any real stretch of time for kerusso you're going to see the minutes I want to say artificially deflated but it's real because it happens so often it's not artificial so you're always rolling the dice a little bit when you put him out there you might get stuck with the world's worst Fantasy game which against the games cap really hurts when a guy plays six minutes gets one rebound and then gets hurt for the game that kills you you're using a games cap to get nothing you're effectively just sacrificing one it's like a bunt  it's like the bunt of sat of Roto games cap  but every time Caruso makes it through a ball game he's so damn good that we have to keep trying it  Malcolm Brogden is a hold right now I don't know that it's gonna be that way when shaedon Sharpe comes back I just don't feel I don't feel like I have enough info  to say that Brogden is an injury replacement player only but it sure feels that way  so maybe maybe Malcolm Brogden belongs in the injury replacement board with Jayden Sharpe out  it looked like when sharp Simon's Grant and Aiden were all healthy that there wasn't going to be enough for Malcolm Brogden to do  because remember he doesn't get many steals or Blocks he's all scoring  and some assists  and maybe some threes but it's field goal percent he's no longer a 50/490 thread now that he's not playing alongside the honors  so can Brogdon get high enough I think the answer is no when the Blazers are healthy so he probably belongs as an injury replacement name but whatever he's a hold for now while we wait until we can confirm this for real and while sharp is out at least there's a chance that he might have a decent ball game  Kelly ubre is the next name on my holds board  this one also requires an explanation because we just don't really know what race job is going to be  is he gonna be a 22-minute guy who takes eight shots a game as you can be a 26 minute guy takes  were out for the Sixers last ball game it sounds like at least one maybe both of those guys might be back for their next one does that mean they do break again goes back to kind of having not that big of a role  does his role get larger if the Anthony Melton sits out does his role get larger if Joel embiid ever comes off of this World level heater that he's on  hard to know  so the question now is why we find out the answer to all of those questions do we find out that answer well Uber is on the wired or do we find out that answer well Uber is on a roster and I think you gotta lean towards ubre being on a roster because if it hits it could be really really good  it's one of those things where like  if his upside was top 100 I'd say let's leave them on the wire while we wait and find out because if it happens and someone else gets him it doesn't really matter that much but we saw early this year and yeah were some guys out and they hadn't made the hardened trade yet but we saw earlier this year the Uber was like a top 60 guy for a little stretch those dudes don't grow on trees  he met officially have now fallen off of that tree but again if there's any chance that he remains on this metaphorical tree we got to make sure that he's on our roster well we figured out  Malik Beasley he was one of the easiest like you knew he was gonna cool off at some point this year  but my take on Beasley was even once he cooled off it seemed like his minutes were so high  that there were other things that could float his value he's currently number 86 and 9 cap for the season in about 30 minutes per game shooting 48% from the field can't seem to make a free throw but he didn't get there so that kind of doesn't matter  I think there's a very real possibility that Beasley's super hot run is over and maybe isn't coming back but I still think it's at least a 50/50 shot that he'll be fine  and again now we've seen him do it this is a guy that rolled top 64 a few weeks 100 range 120 for a few weeks it kind of doesn't matter what format you're in all of that plays well enough to very obviously yes  and so when the floor is like barely serviceable but not  not a not dead weight and the ceiling is really good that's a guy that needs to be on a roster and I saw him dropped in a lot of places after just a few quieter ball games  I would strongly suggest you take a gander at your wire he got dropped by 8% more I mean he's down to 47% roster in Yahoo leaks right now you got dropped in one League that I'm in and I got outbid for him so you know womp womp I guess for me but the same thing's probably happening for you or maybe even at a higher degree I don't know  and then D'Angelo Russell who you know without LeBron James yesterday had a better ball game he is basically come out and said I'm sucking lately that's basically what he said to the media I'm sucking lately I cannot shoot he is in a serious shooting fuck it was nice they had two Steals and three blocks in yesterday's ballgame to sort of counterweight the bad stuff that's been happening and he really has been very bad medium volume 35% from the field the turnovers are back up after a really really good run to start the season but to me watching him play he just looks a little bit tired  a lot of the Lakers actually do the only liqueur that doesn't look that tired to me is Anthony Davis in kind of a weird twist everybody else looks gassed on that club okay not Gabe Vincent either because he's played won like third of one ball game in the last two months but everybody else looks cooked  and to me like  I personally don't think it's a coincidence that the Lakers and Pacers have been two of the worst teams in the NBA since the n Season tournament ended  since these teams had what are they went to Vegas on like that Wednesday and they came home on Sunday  that's a lot of days to spend in Vegas and on top of that these clubs had these extremely high impact games you could see that the intensity level was really high for them they all wanted to win the 500 Grand a piece or whatever it was for a you know they themselves for their teammates like think of the guys on the Lakers and Pacers that are making 500 grand for the year and some of these guys had a chance to increase their salary by like 30 40 50% in one game  that's colossal  so then these teams spend five days in Vegas they blow out all their energy on sort of like a fake playoffs and they come back and they got nothing in the tank  I haven't watched all of the Pacers games but  I've watched most of the Lakers games I try to watch those basically from start to finish as both the Laker fan and someone who has these like secret pipe dreams of doing a little bit more Lakers coverage in my basketball life  they're not running  the Lakers are jogging  they're a jogging team right now you can see the difference too  you watch some of these other ball games some guys are running and some guys are jogging and the Lakers are jogging right now and I haven't watched the Pacers every day and obviously they got a win in their last ball game against whoever the hell are they lost to Memphis but they beat Charlotte by like 30  but Charlotte's like a g League team these days and Steve Clifford's a little bit of a joke  but like if these teams aren't playing crapper clubs they're just getting run out of the gym by teams who are playing faster that may be something to think about for next year you haven't heard either of the club's complain that much of the Lakers were talking about how tired they were because they're travel has been really rough around the IST but like  what are the Lakers and Pacers since December 9th I think was the tournament finals  think they're combined like three and 12  they're pretty good teams going three and 12  anyway  let's keep moving here that's the holds board here's the I'm scared or nervous board as I once again remind all of you guys those of you watching you can see it before I talk about it but I want to tell you guys

is I think very is Twitter handles that you need to follow  let's dive back into the I'm scared or nervous group  and her Wiggins drop his sorry butt  stinks  Kelly and Hayes drop  cam reddish  drop  I said those three because I fell like those three didn't really need much of it explanation because look camera she had his hot run he's still playing big minutes but he's got Butterfingers he can't really shoot missed a bunch of three-pointers in last couple of Laker games he hit a few but he's taking a ton and here's the thing like they like what he does because he's long on defense they're putting him on guards to try to slow some guards down  but he's getting a foul trouble these days that happened and I think the Knicks game was that the foul Trouble game or was the Bulls game I don't remember  but his novelty is wearing off a little bit  and then offensively he's been a pretty good liability so you know this isn't meant to pick on camera reddish I just I think the Lakers have better options  and honestly I think it's Gabe Vincent gets healthy everybody's like always gonna take all of DLow minutes I don't know that that's gonna be I think he's gonna take cam reddits but I I think the Lakers will run small at times  because Gabe Benson is probably a better point of attack Defender he's not as long as cam you might not see those the passing Lane jumping but someone on this Laker team has got to keep a person in front of them  by the way it's why they were a plus three when Anthony Davis was on the floor last night and a minus 10 when he was off for nine minutes they can't guard anybody when AED is not on the floor because everyone on the perimeter is just letting dudes Buy  the Lakers can outscore people  when 80s out there because he'll protect the rim and he'll create tougher shots and teams just won't shoot as well but he leaves the floor and it's just like a layup and three pointer party someone's always open because there's no Rim protection meaning everybody comes charging back and then everybody's open  all of this is say I don't know that camera is just minutes or even safe and it started doesn't matter because his stats haven't been very good either  herb Jones is on this list but he is he nervous no  qualifier not a drop yet I'm giving her a very goodly he got off to such a good start this season I refuse to do anything rash with herb Jones  I know he's dead another slow ball game yesterday  I think this deals and blocks will start to come back around a little bit I don't know that the scoring ever will  so certainly not when Trey Murphy he's going for 28 points on 16 shots  Trey Murphy is very good and and that in there in lies the rub like if the Pelicans decide that they don't need the defensive stopper to be their main guy and they played a Cavaliers team that had no one really they needed to worry about on offense and then they're gonna go offense they're going to space the floor makes everybody else's life easier  Pelicans are one of the teams that almost never made any three pointers now Trey Murphy's come back and suddenly they all can shoot threes it's because there's room  anyway  so herb you're on the hot seat but I'm holding on because I want to see you bounce back and if you do I want to make sure that it's for me  Bruce Brown I think is a drop I mean anyway these guys that I'm that fall into the drop category whatever like you can use them when their team schedule is good like almost anybody in the NBA you could make an argument oh they got three games in four nights sure they're fine  but if Bruce Brown has three games in four nights and he's on your team that's not even worth talking about that's a totally different discussion that is a streaming show that's not a full season fantasy show this is full season is Bruce Brown full season guy I thought he might get into the 90s doesn't look like it's gonna happen  and then Gordon Hayward  so like  what's the right way to even frame this  last year I said he was washed he started this year looking like maybe he wasnt washed but now he looks washed again Steals and blocks of dried up there's not enough offense for him and this is even with lamelo ball out over the last two weeks he's number one 34 in basically what you can call almost the best case scenario and ain't gonna get any better for him I think you can probably drop Gordon Hayward and I really wouldn't worry too much about it either  because I just don't think he's good  all right what the hell is next on this board the watch list that's always a fun one watch list I don't know that there needs to be a ton of explanation on all of these guys but here's the watch list Jaden Ivy who had a good ball game for the Pistons I don't think that this is the thing that he can do consistently you might get like a week here and there where he puts up pretty good numbers but that's probably about as good as it's going to get you look at almost any month for him and it'll probably be outside the top one 20 like almost any cross-sectional month  iot assume he's a watch list because he jumps into the injury replacement board when Alex Caruso's out  Malachi Branham is on the watch list because he's starting for this Spurs but his Fantasy game isn't very good it's our Thompson is on the watch list because we saw how good he could be at the beginning of the year but he's run out of gas and the Pistons are awful Marvin Bagley also Pistons awful but did he get this darting job back does it matter  did all the good stuff mostly happen just because they were playing the Utah Jazz yeah  Zach Collins watch list Wendy was back but Collins actually still had a pretty good ball game in their last one I don't know that that's a thing that continues I think we end up dropping Collins but  he was injury replacement when when was out with his turned ankle  and then managed to somehow play well again even with Victor back in their last ball game I again I just don't think that's a thing that that sticks  here's a weird one to find on the watch list I threw Isaiah Joe in there  mostly because we saw Josh giddey go down  and it didn't seem like it was that serious but  I don't know maybe Joe works his way into an injury replacement spot even if you played him you're basically just hoping for somebody to give you like three three pointers and you're not worrying about a whole lot else so again not a rest of season discussion and then Donte divincenzo and Josh Hart they had a good game for the Knicks but they are not more than watchlist right now because neither one of them seems to play well more than about two times every week and a half once a week maybe twice a week in a great universe but that doesn't seem to hold all that much  so I think I'd probably rather just deal with most of these guys on the watch list in the schedule Zone  could anybody get above it I guess so again like  if Cade Cunningham went down that's how Ivy would move up for too soon we already saw it when Caruso went down for Thompson probably need even more guys to get hurt or just to for him to sort of get out of the dog house  is that Collin's Isaiah Joe Hart even Chen so these are guys that could all make a difference in the injury replacement board but I don't see any of them making their way to just like the full ads list  here's my brand new stream wild warm nameless so far we're just building it out don't worry this is just the start just the foundation the three names on the stream while warm list our Bobby Portis Nas Reed and Obi toppin the way that you get into this board as a watch list or even an ads list if you wanted to go that high is that I don't think anything any of these three guys our guys that you can just set it and forget it for the rest of the season the ads board tend to be in general guys that I'm like oh yeah these guys could just be dudes you play from now until the end of the NBA season  but we've seen it enough times already this year to know that Bobby Boris is gonna run hot and then cold it doesn't have almost anything to do with the Personnel on the floor around him nobody got hurt that magically made him better like if you was out then Port is an obvious injury play but he's been decent not their last ball game but he was pretty good for like the three before that  and then we see him get bad for three or four ball games and there isn't really any like extra thing that's making it happen it's all just oh Bobby got hot  seems like generally the same idea with nasri though it helped when Anthony Edwards was out and if either of the centers like we saw a cat leave the Minnesota game with just a minute or two left soreness Etc here no  Nas Reed is in that same boat  Obi toppin the third name on this list  Obi toppin Andrew's editing after the show today I'll be topping is another one that's been running hot and cold he had a pretty good stretch where we threw him on our rosters for a little and  then he cooled off  and there wasn't anything super obvious about it that caused it he was still starting  but what he's warm he gets more minutes and when you get more minutes  then you get to do more stuff  and we'll probably add more names this list but the way that this list separates itself from the others is again there isn't like an obvious player that has to go down for them to do it it's just when the time is right the timing's right  oh Lord here's the injury replacement board and it's a big one buckle up  we're gonna go through this one pretty quick because the explanation is basically just the guy that's out and I'll throw a couple of thoughts very brief quick snippet thoughts on the guys that I think may or may not actually be startable but here we go he moves into the starting five when they have their scorers he tends to be off the bench because then they go defense at the center spot  careless Levert good with Darius Garland out that's okay that's enough that's in all systems go one  Craig Porter Jr Isaac Coro and Dean wait all on the Cavaliers that one it seems like you need all three of Garland Mobley and Donovan Mitchell out to consider any of them I don't even know what that I would use them on the Roto side but certainly on a head-to-head they make sense  Kris Dunn for you John needed everybody out no tht no kante George know Jordan Clarkson no Lowery marking and unfortunately that specific situation is probably not gonna happen very much  which sucks cuz I love Chris Dunn's Fantasy game but we're almost never gonna get to see it unleash the way we did for one ball game  early or this week  Kobe white just continue to roll with him with Zach Levine out Patrick Williams his kind of got himself Above The Fray also with Zach LaVine missing Brandon Miller with lamelo out said he'd be with Jalen Johnson a lot of these are repeats now Nick Richards with Mark Williams out Dante exam and Derek Jones Junior I think with both Kyrie Irving and Josh Green out they're right on the borderline of playable probably like 60/40 I don't know that I use them on the Roto side although now Luka might be out also we're hearing so I guess my question is can these guys actually get their own shots with Luca out I might go the other way they might just stink if they're not going to be open during the Ballgame so those guys are 50/50 Tim Hardaway Jr is a goal and certainly with Luca and Kyrie out you know he'll take 25 shots whether he makes four of them or 11 that's gonna be the difference between whether this is a great game or one that breaks your team  Colin Sexton is a go  I don't know why I didn't have him up there with the other Jazz guys but whatever Brandon ski when he gets back he's been good here since Wiggins got dropped out of the lineup and Draymond Green's been missing  Norman Powell anytime that either Paul George or Kawaii is out he's been good and then use of Norwich is out for the Suns for personal reasons so we got to throw Drew you banks on at the very end of this very long injury replacement board one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 names on it good Lord wow that's a lot all right a couple of buy lows that one of them we've talked about before that's Walker Kessler anytime he comes off the bench anybody that's not watching the way the Jazz run their rotations right now might have a panic attack but we won't  yakka Pirtle he's had two games where he played like 19 minutes in each of them he'll be fine we've seen it before he has these games were the matchups kill him and then he comes roaring back with a 27 29 minute game that got him back in that like 775 range if you can get him for a hundred ish you probably do it sell highs Anthony Simons had an enormous game last night that thrust him back up the board to I don't know where number 37 he's scoring like a madman right now but here's the thing like what he does is points in threes and sort of assists and there isn't much else I guess free throws are pretty good as well it's really hard for him to maintain this pace but after that giant ball game you could probably get a top 40 ish guy back for him 45 or 50 would also be fine in my eyes and I think you should do it and then Camp Thomas we've talked about a few times as a flippable guy sell them when he's hot by when he's cold rinse and repeat  quick scan of the chat room here let me see if anybody is  ah Jalen Suggs any worry about Jalen Suggs that's not a player that we talked about um no I mean here's the thing he's heard a lot  he's got that wrist thing going on that frankly he came back faster from than I expected and I don't know if it was a regen or if this is now the other wrist I might have gotten Twisted on it  when he's out there and he's healthy he was a 70 range guy this year so I say stick with Suggs he's number 78 24 ball games  that's a that's a very playable dude so no not super worried other than the fact that he's hurt all the time which is a little bit worried some but thou I mean that was a worry before this season even got started so nothing that I've seen in the last  two months has changed my opinion of what he's gonna be on the court  although that's not fair because I came into this season not thinking that he was going to do all that much and then he came out and he's one of the best defenders in the NBA  try to hold on if all the injury stuff is killing you I get it but like again guys inside the top 80 these are very useful fantasy players so try not  the other questions are all like would you prefer this guy or this guy or this guy or this guy when do you think certain dudes are coming back I appreciate all these questions but I'm gonna ask you guys that are watching and used to the chat room to take those and just drop them into the comments section once I should post the show I do sweep through the comments about once a day and so I'll be able to get to your stuff at some point there I don't know when it's going to be today because as you can hear my kids are losing their freakin Minds in the other room but that is the magic of winter break oh here's one last question before we go asking about Austin Reeves know I  you know so for Austin Reeves if you're looking at yesterday's ball game  and 27 and 5 with two steals  but he only played 27 minutes  it's because he was getting cooked on defense and certain teams have the better Personnel to do that  teams that have a really good ball-handling guard  we'll try to get switches on him and then try to beat him up a little bit  but I would say this Lakers didn't you lose yesterday's game because Reeves and frankly you know even when the Bulls were targeting him he was a plus minus guy he was a plus guy in that game against Chicago he was a minus in this game against the Bulls again not for anything that he wasn't doing on the offensive side but just like if you look at the Personnel around him he's one of the dudes that needs to be on the floor with Anthony Davis I don't know if the Lakers have fully figured that out yet but while Reeves is getting beat up there needs to be another line of defense behind him in a way that like  whoever who do you want to sub in for him at that spot that's stronger like a really hot tomorrow who's much bigger different kind of player  Prince is stronger  he was getting beat by faster guys reasons getting overpowered so no the answer to your question is no I'm not worried about Reeves minutes because he still doing a lot of stuff when he's on the court and that's the most important thing he still putting up really good numbers God after that slow start this year he's number 100 and 9 cat and he's been more like you know top 80 for the last month which is probably about where he belongs because he doesn't get many steals  he doesn't get any Blocks he's a good percentage is guy he'll just three maybe two turnovers are going to be on a high side because he's one of the dudes that's handling the basketball and he's still figuring out a lot of that side of it which I think by the way we'll get better like he's learning pocket passes that are getting picked off little things like that when to make the pass when to just hesitate take the shot he's learning we saw this explosion from Reeves late last year and everybody's like oh my God he's figured out the NBA but he hasn't because teams are adjusting how they play and now he has to take that next step and he's working on  so no I'm not worried about it good question this is a team I watch a lot so I feel like I do have some some insight on that and those are some nice questions about players that I didn't address and that's kind of the way that I like to use the chat room on these Friday shows  all right put a pin in this one for now again anybody that's listening watching however you're taking in this show if you want to try to get in touch
