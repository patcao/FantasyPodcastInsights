welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast happening everybody afternoon Edition here of fantasy NBA today this is the one where we go through the schedule and we make it quick  no fuss  no muss  no coconuts that's not right  that's not right  there's your schedule grid everybody again those of you that are watching you guys are seeing the streaming chart of available on Sports ethos.com that's to NBA fantasy pass subscribers  I am Dan Bass Pros this is again your special tour today of fantasy NBA today we will not have time to do one of these tomorrow I'll be out of the house in the afternoon so I will have to just take care of it over on so social media where I can be found at Dan best press  good to do one of these in as many days as humanly possible they will be hit or miss on the weekends this weekend's going to be pretty tough I have played by play stuff going on so again we'll try to do it on social media with those but again during the week as many days as I can for five days a week is the goal right now if we can get higher than that even better if you've been watching you should have a pretty good idea of where we stand right now it's Thursday and you've probably used I would guess about two of your four weekly moves in Yahoo leagues and that's a pretty good spot to be in if you've used only zero or one great and if you've used three or four you're gonna be a little bit of a bind  but that's okay we're gonna go through this uh no matter what we got no you know  shouldn't be a problem  here's what we're starting with we're gonna start with the worst schedules coming up because I think we can kind of work backwards from that  the worst schedules coming up belong to and it's like  I'm trying to decide if I want to do the the worst first or like work up to it let's work up to it the third worst schedule's  which uh  in this particular case  belong to teams that have three games over eight days are the Atlanta Hawks  the New Orleans Pelicans and the Orlando Magic  it is worth noting that all three of those teams have two games the rest of this week and see Hawks go tomorrow and Sunday the Pelicans go tomorrow and Sunday the Orlando Magic go tomorrow and Sunday but all three of those teams brutal brutal start to next week one game over the first four days next week and I think for all of them  is it Wednesday yeah it's Wednesday for all three  so bad schedules there but again worse  looking ahead  because two games of this week everybody  in the entire NBA with the exception of one team plays two games or three games the rest of this week  so you could hold on to those teams I just mentioned  the only problem of course is then you'd be using a move on Monday  where then you're using up a move for next week  and in Stead if you wanted to you could get off of one of those players this week and kind of conserve one  the question of course is what is the downgrade in the player your streaming so like  the Hawks for instance let's say you were streaming Bruno Fernando get out of our minds and you were streaming Bruno Fernando could you drop him for someone who has a good schedule the rest of this week that all rolls into good schedule next week yeah because the drop off wouldn't be all that severe but let's say you were streaming like Atlanta Hawks let's say you saddiq Bey was the worst Atlanta Hawk on your roster you probably want to get the two games out of bay before you pivot to somebody who's you know a top one 50 one 60 kind of guy who has a better schedule to start next week and we'll get to those guys in a minute second we're scheduled the rest of this week belong or the rest of coming up I should say the rest of coming up which makes all the sense in the world belongs to the Los Angeles Lakers who have three games over nine days that is as you guys can calculate one day worse than the above three games over eight days is 37.5% of days with games three games over nine is 33.3% of days with games Lakers like the other teams have games Friday and Sunday the rest of this week kind of tough ones mine you  and then they play in Sacramento on Wednesday of next week they're off for two days on either side of that Lakers have a really bad schedule it's a two-game week next week and they roll into a three game gamer but it's back loaded  so yes the Lakers schedule is really terrible right now and it gets worse before it gets better the Lakers after their game against Minnesota on Sunday have three games over 11 days  yikes  and four games over 13 which is actually a tiny bit better but still pretty awful  there are not that many fringy Lakers really hot tomorrow would probably be the only one that's on teams right now nobody else is really playing enough to Warrant any kind of look so what you could do again is if you wanted to punt on rui now you could use to move this week if you have a couple extra saved up for instance and then you wouldn't have to get off of the Laker starting next week and finally the worst schedule coming up here and it's really not all that close at this moment and again the Lakers gets worse then this team but right now the Utah Jazz two games over the next eight days 25% of days with games are off today and tomorrow they play on Saturday they play on Tuesday of next week and then they don't play again until Friday of next week but the caveat with Utah is their schedule goes from the worst in the league to the best overnight starting on Friday of next week Utah has a five game in seven day stretch coming up  so that's a team where you want to try to abandon ship today but make sure that you can get back in on them a week from tomorrow so it's an eight-day  marriage break take a break  you're sending your your spouse to go stay in a in a motel for eight days and then they're coming back home that's the Utah Jazz right now but what do you do okay let's look at the flip side here because Utah there's a lot of streamer area guys on that team and some of them got hurt recently but other ones are still upright what do you do  and how good does a jazz player have to be to avoid being dropped a lot of times you get to a two-game week and people are like who am I dropping but no one ever looks at it from this perspective this is a two-game week but worse by a day this is a two game over eight day stretch it's one of the worst scheduling quirks you'll find in the NBA for any team ever  and we're in it today for Utah  there's basically no one in the NBA outside of like the top 25 who's good enough to hold when they're playing one game out of every four days and you're in your playoffs  now I get it you want to try to hold on to call in Sex and you want to try to hold on to John Collins you'd love to hold on to Lowry and should he come back now he is a top 25 guy  but someone like a Jordan Clarkson someone like a keyonte George any fringy player on this team pretty much has to get dropped  sad truth  unless you wrap up this week because then you're looking at next week you're like well it's a three game week it's just sort of kind of crummy and they pivot into a better one that's the only way if you're in any kind of battle this week you have to get off of the Utah Jazz  now the good schedules this week the ones that you should then pivot to  if you're trying to abandon chip on these guys the best schedule and forget working our way up the board the best schedule over the remainder of this week belongs to the Miami Heat and the Minnesota Timberwolves those teams both are they play three games over four days  including a back-to-back today and tomorrow so not only do you get three games in four days but you get the opportunity to crash out of it after two days if you wanted to  so you get the three and four and you get flexibility  guys on those teams that potentially could make sense we will get to those in just a moment second best schedule the rest of this week is the Brooklyn Nets remember there on the back end of a five and seven  but they're back to back is over the weekend so if you pick them up today well you should have picked him up a few days ago because it's Brooklyn in there and they're in the middle of a very good scheduling run but let's say somebody didn't pick up a Brooklyn Net and like what if Lonnie Walker's out then maybe you get a Dennis Smith junior little mini surge here so there's weird little you know needle threading that you can have to do to get there you have to hold through Sunday you don't have the opportunity to abandon ship because they play on that last day and the back-to-back is the last two days so you're basically stuck through the rest of the week which again not a huge difference but notable and then I wanted to shout out the two teams that have kind of a third best schedule they only play two times the rest of this week but they start next week with a back-to-back that's San Antonio and Boston those two teams have two games the rest of this week and then they play Monday Tuesday of next week so that's again  like if you have Utah you could add one game for this week but over that same span you want to think about how long you're holding a player when you make that switch you go from two games over eight days to four games over 8 days with San Antonio and for Boston is that all so for or is that five they actually have five games over eight days the Boston Celtics do so you know that's the team you were moving to off of Utah  you're still getting a three-game bomb over an eight-day span that's pretty significant by the way and you start next week with a flourish so that's the movie would look at if you're weak if your battle this week if you feel more confident about it like you don't think it's maybe coming down right to the wire Boston doesn't have that many grid streamers but they would have the best schedule when you combine the end of this week and the beginning of next week  not each side individually but sort of all together that's the way that it makes sense  okay so now you guys have seen and I didn't scan the schedule all that much but here let me do just like a stroll a skull a good Lord Vespers slow scroll through the Scout this calendar so you guys can see what's coming up that's what you're looking at Portland we've talked about them they've got a really good schedule coming up tomorrow they start a five game in seven days stretch then there's a the Clippers actually are on Saturday that's a great team to move into if you're going to use a move on Saturday of this week that's kind of the end of The Majestic teams for this week Charlotte's not bad either if you can't get Portland tomorrow they've got six games over nine days starting tomorrow these are things that we would have talked about on tomorrow's schedule show if there was one but again we'll talk about those over on social media and then as we mentioned Utah they go into a great schedule towards the end of next week a lot of teams have kind of Middle East schedules throughout next week streaming is a little bit tougher than this one but Boston their schedule is great starting  like kind of now but basically Monday of next week they go into a stretch where they play nine games over 13 days so that's a sorry eight games over 13 days that's a pretty good run for them if you wanted to hold a Celtic a Celtic a Celtic for two weeks um next thing is I want to quickly show you guys the players that you can stream for this week if you so choose these are the players that have a lot of volume right now  two things I wanted to look at yeah there's two things I wanted to look at here real fast first is the volume players and the other one is the injury replacement players so let's do  one and then the other here's the here's the volume players as we throw them up on the screen but I'll read them to you so if you're looking at Miami the volume guys you might want to look at there would be Caleb Martin and Jaime heck is Junior if you're looking at Minnesota we already talked on our morning show about how important Nas Reed is right now with Karl Anthony towns out but you could also had Kyle Anderson and even Nicole Alexander Walker to that mix Brooklyn line Walker if you plays if he doesn't you go Dennis Smith Jr frankly he would Dennis Smith might be playable even if Walker is in you know you get 23 24 25 minutes three games you're hoping you can get seven between 70 and 80 minutes out of Dennis Smith over the rest of this week and then obviously Dorian Finney Smith who's on rosters right now because Brooklyn's schedule has been so good up to this point there's just no way that he still floating around around on Waiver Wires and the other thing I wanted to touch on quickly here before we wrap up our super duper Ultra fast episode in the afternoon the injury replacement board which is again you know this could change as we continue to get more information in fact let's see even over the last couple of minutes last hour Tyrese Maxey got ruled out for tomorrow Benedict Mathews been ruled out for a week Trey man on Charlotte is questionable so that would make things super interesting we've talked about but still a mitsch but that's for tomorrow so nothing else today but you know over the next hour and a half  we might get some more information and then this board would change but the injury replacement board nasri great injury replacement long-term Dennis Schroder great injury replacement Kelly Olynyk and Gary Trent great injury replacement frankly Dorian Finney Smith we just talked about and then Duncan Robinson who belongs on the last board we talked about the volume board for Miami but I'm also assuming that Robinson uh and Nas read basically I'm assuming those guys are now based are picked up by the time this show is airing so you get into over on the volume side you throw in guys like like slow-mo for instance and jacquez and Caleb Martin that in my eyes maybe are not the best you know games cap kind of plays which is basically what this injury replacement board is meant to signify and that is just under the wire I'm trying to do these in 15 minutes or less good luck everybody keep streaming let's keep winning and we'll again do most of this discussion over on social media tomorrow so make sure you're following at Danvers this is fantasy NBA today a sports presentation we have our big weekend review show coming tomorrow morning those are always a blast a rue very fast check to see if anybody's got any streaming questions in the chat room  Trey Jones or Jeremy so on to start next week in a points League  so hard if you're looking at the Spurs side oh and and you know I didn't mention the possible volume guys if you were looking towards next week that's what I forgot to do so um Boston knows really doesn't have anybody which is a shame San Antonio does though Malachi Branham has been doing more lately Wendy's out so is that Collins could potentially be a thing so there are a couple of kind of sneaky options on the Spurs if you're trying to front load next week  all right I'm cooked my voice needs a break we'll see you guys tomorrow for the week in review like rate subscribe  hugs and kisses  this has been a hoop ball presentation
