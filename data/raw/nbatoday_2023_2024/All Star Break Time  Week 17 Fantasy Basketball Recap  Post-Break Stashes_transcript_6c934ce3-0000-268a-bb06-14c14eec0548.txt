welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast get my adrenaline  cooking a little bit  need a little little juice this afternoon I find that these pods are a lot easier for me to do like right when I get back from kid drop off in the morning I still got the adrenaline of the am coursing through my veins I get these kids up I got to school flowing of fire and  the afternoon I got some food in my belly  burping on a podcast and I'm just  tired this sluggishness I got the Slugs creeping in on me here  but fear not once we get going  get the juices flowing a little bit welcome to Fantasy NBA today I'm Dan best for this is a sports ethos presentation  I'm realizing that I forgot to change the name on the document that you all be seeing here on this show so we're going to take that down for just a second while I get that all squared away  so uh  how's everybody feeling it's the All-Star break  we we have a little breather on our hands here opportunity to just kind of  relax a little  so if you want to do that that's fine hang out relax a little  talk about life  oh what do you guys want to talk about today you want to talk about fantasy basketball still  all right fine we'll talk fantasy basketball find me over on social at Dan best Bruce specifically on Twitter  at d a n b e s b r i s Sports ethos.com is that website ethos fantasy BK is the news feed  this is our week in review show we're still going to do it this week because I don't think we get to do a next week games come back on Thursday of next week if I'm not mistaken so there's really legitimately one day of basketball that will go over so I'll Friday show next week is gonna just be basketball well have some fun ideas of shows to do over the break will do on that Recaps All Star weekend we're gonna do one where we look towards the second half of the Season well that's him by Lowe's I had one other idea that I can't think of right now it doesn't matter you guys will see Slash hear them next week  no matter what no matter what I say right now  so today now that you've all obviously taken a moment to like And subscribe  like And subscribe I know at least a handful of you are watching this for the first time so definitely go do that  now that you've all done that let's talk a little bit about the week in review we cover stories from basically the fast roughly the past five days I know that on the screen it says past five to seven but we really don't go back into the weekend because we've generally covered those and they're a little bit sort of added date we have some stuff I want to talk about on the related to the trade deadline now that we're a week out on that teams have had their new guys there for three games give or take  and even have a couple of teams starting to lean into this hard tank mode already February 16th silly Seasons coming two months before the end of the season for a couple of basketball teams it's not all the way there  but it's quite close  let's start with everybody's favorite  ads  ads you know you love ads  these are in no particular order the order they're in is how I looked at the box scores of the games that these teams most recently played to make sure that I went through every single named appropriately  we have a Grizzly on the adboard and then we you know we've had some other ones in the past I don't want to repeat myself knew this week is Gigi Jackson who got himself a contract more of a points League add though wanted to make sure that we Illustrated that key note on Jackson news coming off of a very nice ball game is last time out the grizzly Samuel managed to beat the Milwaukee Bucks sort of an unacceptably ridiculous result  but for Jackson  you're gonna have some stuff that Creeps in a little bit he's a 67% free throw shooter so far this year he's 45 and a half percent from the field yes he definitely shoot the three ball but a lot of his shots lately seemingly are the three ball now the nice thing about Gigi is that he's scoring a bunch like a bunch of bunch missed a game due to a violation of Team rules but otherwise he's putting up a ton of shots he said double digit shot attempts in each of the last six games he's played in Eight of the last nine including there was a 24 in there he's had an 18 a 17 so he's going to score because he's just taking a ton of shots you'll get you a handful of rebounds he has some he had a couple of Nines in there but he also has a couple of ones  he doesn't pass  Heaven help him he does not pass is high in a sis over the last two and a half weeks I think is two turnovers are gonna be there not in the extraordinarily High number but they'll be there enough because he's got the ball in his hands a bunch and he's probably not passing it and then Steals and blocks are kind of still a little bit we don't know his blocks are okay so far he's a 0.7 in about 20 minutes of ball game which you know if you extrapolated that you'd figure there'd be about a block in a starter's level number of minutes but I don't know that we know that that's necessarily the case and then steals is actually been profiling a little bit lower than that so you're talking about a guy who's gonna get you some points he's gonna get you some three-pointers he will likely get you it seems like he's gonna get you some for action of a block and a couple of rebounds  but as is the case with his teammate Santi aldama who's going to be on a later board we talk about today  are the percentages going to be good enough to counterweight or  to not counterweight I suppose the counting stuff because right now you know he shot 50 50 53 and 59% is last five ball games so Gigi's been pretty good over those last five but game right before that he shot eight out of 24  game before that over three before that three out of 14 before that 4 out of 14 so these these things do have a way of leveling out at some point  and I'd say then that's why it makes him such a safe points League add because you don't have to worry as much about the field goal and free throw percentage and you just get a guy who's Chuck and shots like tomorrow doesn't exist  great  Brandon pajama ski is on the ads board he has been for about two and a half weeks so this shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone but I've seen the big news from this most recent week  is that he wasn't feeling in because a lot of his starts over the last two and a half weeks where he's put up these better numbers have been with either Andrew Wiggins out or Klay Thompson out  he had a couple of good games even with those guys in also worth pointing out which is why he became not just an injury replacement but more of a straight add to see what would happen  and they took place and starting job clay still got plenty of minutes in that ball game but look minutes are just not as safe when you're coming off the bench Clay is not this bring chicken that he was before two catastrophic leg injuries and so now you've got in there with the starting five doing sort of the cross the board stuff uh and so he's a he's just a straight at now  no caveats  keyonte George is an ad also a bit of a cell hi yes two things can be the case at the same time he's coming off a monster of a ballgame his last time out that was big depending I guess on when you're listening to or watching this podcast on Thursday evening he had 33 points and nine three-pointers against Golden State he's shot better than 50% and each of his last two ball games or 50 or better  he was sub 37 the game before that and he actually had a run of five games in a row where he shot 50% or better  but again a lot of this is just getting him back up to a only minor punt field goal percent guy he's fine from the free throw line 82% so you know very small positive there  with  starters minutes and this is why I need you guys to hold two thoughts in your head at the same time  in 25 minutes a game so far this year is averaging 12 points three boards four assists almost no defensive stats and two three-pointers on really bad field goal percent and slightly above average free throw number in his last two games where everybody is raving even really folks should be pretty well lasered in on just the last one ball game but in the last two games he's had 33 minutes and then 40 minutes  and in the first one he had 13.5 and 7 with two Steals and the most recent game yet 33 2.2 board 6 assists three steals a 93 pointers before fouling out basically playing the entire ball game almost  there is no guarantee that one keonte gets 30 minutes he's gonna be a nine cat guy  much like GG Jackson the points League noodles is wiggling or the radar is going crazy or whatever I don't know what dumb expression you want to use here because I'm tired and I can't come up with any clever  because you don't have to worry about the field goal percent  same thing with GG Jackson on kind of the both percentage now in George's defense one of his two percentages is not bad the other one is just abysmal or at least has been so far this year  it's really really hard to be a decent nine category guy when you're a strict punch something you have to be so unbelievably good in the other categories to overcome it so someone like for your honest is a bad example because he's Beyond Over the Bar in free throw percentage is just standing in a bunch of other things but take a guy like a Dame who is it 17% field goal right now but no 25 points 337 assists Hyper Elite free-throw number these guys that are punt dudes usually have something else that is lifting them up and over the threshold  lamelo ball before he got hurt eight assists almost two steals a game all so big positive free throw guy and 24 points a game what would it take for Evangeline might be a good example because he's at 41% from the field on 13 and a half shots per game I mean that might be what jonte George is gonna do about 40% from the field on 13 and a half shots per game how good does he have to be in the other categories to make up for that  so Freddie's not a great example because he's inside the top 30 but he's doing it with over one steal and over one block positive free throw number eight assists per ballgame 33 16 odd points maybe we assume that George can get you 16 odd points and two and some odd 3-pointers per game  how many assists do we think he's gonna get how many steals how many blocks we've seen him he doesn't get Steals and blocks he had five and his last two ballgames but I mean you know what did he have two over the previous month before that yes he was due to come up a little bit but we're not talking about a guy who gets a lot of steals or blocks he doesn't get any blocks he has four on the year he's 25 Steals and 50 games this year  and five of them have come in the last two  don't get me wrong I like keyonte George I do very much that's why he's on the ads board today I mean like those of you that are watching you can see it right there on your screen but this is where I need you guys to hold two thoughts in your head at the same time he is an ad and he's all so high  because people are going to see this game yesterday where he put up 33 and six with three steals a nine three-pointers in there gonna start to convince themselves not that he's gonna go for 33 every night  but he's gonna go for like 24  and he's gonna shoot 50% he's gonna hit four plus three pointers and he's gonna get you a couple of steals and they're gonna start to think this guy's got top 50 appeal but they'd be wrong  if you're a punt field goal team you approach this a bit differently because he'll have a much easier path  to value on your basketball team if you're actually trying to Winfield goal percent if you're trying to compete in defensive stats then he's going to he's he has these holes in his Fantasy game that you can probably pay her over by trying to trade him after a game where they're not the case or two games where they're not the case  so yes pick them up in all formats  but if you're a nine cat and you're trying to win steals  field goal percent  blocks  hell even rebounds but mostly the other ones because he's a garden how many blocks rebounds you expecting out your guard anyway specifically I would say field goal percent steals probably the two things that jump out these are things that you're trying to attack  you can Pawn them off to a team that maybe isn't as bend on competing in those categories and they might look at him and say oh like you know this guy's got top 65 top 75 appeal the rest of the year where you're like I mean you know maybe for your build  but maybe not mine  it's one of those weird little footnotes on Fantasy Basketball where  you can pick up a guy who is maybe not the right fit for your build and still get something good out of him by flipping him to a team where he is better for the build  no idea is an ad he is coming off a ridiculous ball game we talked about him a bunch I think on yesterday's show after his 40-plus scoring game um he's you know he's better right now post Daniel Gafford trade that definitely helped him he's seeing some minutes at the five  he's getting Wild and Woolly with his shots  he is also a little bit of a cell high after that gigantic ball game but I don't think you're gonna get there isn't that like  Mystery Box element that people are feeling right now for keyonte George where I think you could sell him on a hope  where with Avi I don't think people have that same like oh well this could just be the way it is I think they've seen enough to know let's be a little up and down but overall he's been a lot better with Gafford gone and you might be better off actually just holding on there  Trey man is another one similar thing like he is both an ad  and sell High  because we know that he has  issues not even just in one percentage but he's actually a negative and free throw percent so far in his young career at not by much it's sort of nominal but he's he's shooting a thousand at the free throw line so far this year but he was in the hot mid to high 70s previous couple seasons in the NBA  and figure at some point again that will probably level off he is a low field goal percent guy just like keyonte George should we just talked about these are guys that you can Pawn right now for like a hope  a shiny new object that put up a big fat line their last ball game ending into the All-Star break you can try to cash in on that  it's a good idea  Marvin Bagley who's not all that far off from this discussion either I think because  you have a little bit more  statistical security with Bagley but it's small  if at all because he's a bad for free throw shooter  although he does she shot 82% this year in Detroit I don't know that doesn't seem like a number that was gonna stick I mean maybe he gets into the 75 he's positive field goal percent guy  so sometimes they cancel each other out you'll get bored you'll get some points if he's playing full starters minutes you'll probably get I don't know one point five combined defensive stats something like that  so a little bit safer and all so at the same time a harder guy to sell high on  because he didn't have a gigantic ball game that you can run off of if you does if he does have a giant ball game you probably should try to sell High just saying herb Jones is also an ad it seems like he's he had his last ball game wasn't as good but generally he's been playing a bit better since Dyson Daniels went down he remains number 75 and 9 camera got off to that very slow start hit the skids for a long time and now he's kind of gotten warm again lately  just a very nice like this season's version of Phoenix's Mikhail Bridges but you know without the scoring effectively based I mean that's kind of what he is he's like last year's Mikhail but without the points in threes to some degree so yeah people should have a little bit more faith in her specially now that one of the defensive guys on that Pelicans roster is hurt  living breathe the herb and I saw Thompson as our Thompson is an ad he has been since the trade deadline so I just wanted to throw him back on there in case anybody was sort of second guessing themselves you got to see how that one goes  your holds board for today Santee aldamas a whole not indefinitely he's usage has been lower than I would have wanted because I came into this with sort of this like  you know when he gets out there he takes you know 10 to 14 shots and starters minutes and then lately he's been getting to starting his minute like took four shots in Thursday's game and 33 minutes  three boards seven assists in a block I mean I like that stuff that's the reason that we were high on him is that he rebounds he passes he gets some steals he gets blocks he gets some threes  but I can't have aldama taking four shots I need him to take a dozen if you're playing starters minutes you better be taking a freaking dozen shots or more Santi  because if you're not you're getting bumped down to the drop board and you ain't that far off of it right now  just sew and sew  Clay Thompson is a whole despite moving to the bench you guys probably didn't need me to remind you of that because he had a gigantic ball game in his first day off the bench but hold to see I would shake out  saddiq Bey is a temporary hole I do have this suspicion deep in the old tummy that DeAndre Hunter is about to take his job at which point we saw this very early in the season all so did Nick Bay coming off the bench was not a 12 team Ross durable guy and I think we're probably slowly stomping our way in that direction right now too  Eren Smith got hurt hopefully he'll be okay coming out of the All-Star break but he's a whole because he was really good lately has been frankly for a while he's number 89 on the season after a very slow start good percentage or good field goal percent guy all so it's three pointers just like Mega hustle dude hopefully he's ready to go on the other side of the All-Star break will find out when we get there but he's old he's old  Dennis Schroder is a hold even though Brooklyn got completely obliterated in their last ball game but again this is not necessarily A you've got to hold him forever kind of deal  but I think we could probably squeeze out a little bit longer Schroeder's one of the guys coming out of this trade deadline Kelly Linux another one where I don't know that we have the final ruling on them yet  I'd rather have Schroeder  then not  coming out in of the All-Star break just to kind of see because like  it seems like they want him doing more  I don't know that this is necessarily the case  just seems like it and then they were so bad in the last ball game that we didn't get a really good look at him so hold on just shooter hold on to Camp Johnson same story in Brooklyn he just came back from an injury though so his minutes were held in check when he was playing better right before he got hurt so hopefully he can kind of pick up where he left off on that front Daniel Gafford and Derek Lively on the Mavericks I think you guys probably need to hang on to both of those guys I'm higher on gaffer than I am on lively mostly because his Fantasy game actually translated a little a little bit better he's better free throw shooter better rebounder but both those guys are healthy right now for the Mavs and we'll see how the minutes Shake out going forward in the meantime you got to try to find a way to hold on to both because there isn't a clear  they haven't really totally settled on who's gonna do what  if I had to pick between the two you guys know I picked Gafford  but I don't think we can take our eyes off Lively yet because what if what if it ends up being a perfect split down the middle because then they'd actually both have fantasy value  trade Jones is cool off in San Antonio of late I'm gonna hang on to him give him a little bit longer he's like one 40-ish range over the last couple of weeks  steals are down scoring a little bit down  maybe gets a turn around he was never a massive upside guy you know upside was like 90 range but again like if you can get him back into that 90 to 15 then he becomes a pretty easy every every day play right now he's like just sitting outside of that but not buy it time and then Grayson Allen who also probably didn't require a spot on the holds board but I threw him in there anyway because damn it why not  Bradley Beals back out I don't know how long frankly I don't care Grace and Allen was a whole regardless  this is basically the same I'm scared board as last week I was going through and I was like yeah I feel like I need to repeat these names so careless Levert is a drop Max Drew's borderline Ben Simmons is incredible headache and boy and bogdanovich's trending swords a drop I'm not gonna go into huge detail on these dudes cuz I don't honestly think I need to but if you need to know more maybe we can hash it out over on social media  you're watching list this week got bigger is a bigger watch list than the last few weeks and a lot of this has to do with coming out of the trade deadline DeAndre Hunter is not a trade dime deadlines related watchlist he was someone I was talking about as a possible trade deadline winner had the Hawks moved to johnte Marie they didn't he's just playing his way back to his starting job at the beginning of the year when he was sitting in the 100 to 125 range which like is annoying and boring as it is those guys are every day plays in most formats  I get it in Roto we're always hunting the guys who are like top 80 or better but sometimes you can't sometimes you just need to use a games cap on a dude who's fine and Hunter would be that kind of guy as he Trends towards a full a lot to Mint of minutes and that's why I'm lower on saddiq Bey now Jordan Goodwin is on the watch list out in Memphis he got a start and you know I think as as if he gets ramped up in minutes that's something to track here on Goodwin  then you then you pounce because he's got an interesting Fantasy game  he gets points he gets some threes get some boards get some assists get some steals  he does well with the counting stuff not as great on the percentages but you hope that maybe  not that many happen and that can be how many field goal of free throw but attempts happen  let's keep an eye on it also with the Grizzlies like they're just rotating bodies in and out every day and everybody's getting to play 24/25 minutes so there isn't like there's no guarantee that he ever gets above 24 minutes ball game and that's why he's on the watch list and all so look like we have so many guys on the ads board we have so many guys that are in the holds board right now that  like there has to be a watch list not everybody can be an ad or you run out of roster like you have to start dropping eighth rounders to pick up these guys  which is not advisable  Grant Williams is on the watch list he's played well since coming to Charlotte I don't know if the field goal attempt stay this High I do all so kind of wonder if lamelo ball ever comes back for that team and that will impact all the guys on Charlotte we've talked about Grant is probably you know in head-to-head streamer territory right now just based on the ligo I'm not gonna hurt you anywhere but I just I look at it I like we've seen enough Grant Williams over the years to to know  that he's not gonna keep taking this many shots  and the rebounds are up because he is playing some small ball Center but like  there's so many reasons that I don't think this thing sticks Kelly Olynyk is back down on the watch list after his injury and maybe he plays coming out of the All-Star break which would be great in which case I'd put him back at the end of my bench just to kind of see how it shakes out but for the moment I don't think that that's necessary because like let's say that his back does cost him a few games out of the break  you can't be taking 0s in head-to-head and Rodeo there are too many guys floating around right now that actually have like clearer value guys we've talked about already Early In This Very show  and as much as I love Kelly Olynyk I'm also fully aware that a lot of what I say and do related to him is from the heart and not from the brain and that's a stupid way to play Fantasy  if you're the team that drafts from your heart you're gonna lose  you might have fun on draft night coming out with all your favorite players or whatever but you're gonna lose somebody drafts with their brain and right now holding on to a Linux would be something I was doing with my heart and not with my brain  Gary Trent Jr also in Toronto played a little bit better in his last ball game I'm still trying to figure out if he's actually gonna be able to get to 10 11 shots per ballgame I'm still leaning towards know which is why he's watchlist and not a hold anymore  because I don't think you're gonna miss out on much he's one of those guys where it's like look even if it starts to click a little bit you're talking about 15 points a couple of threes and the steel 1.2 steals something like that like  is that a game breaker for your fantasy team now  not so much trade Murphy's been coming on a little bit lately I don't know if that has to do with herb kind of sliding into more of those and Danielson and then Murphy able to slide into a little bit more of like what herbs leaving behind or if it's just the natural ebb and flow of a guy who generates a lot of his value based on making three pointers and getting a steal or two those things are gonna bounce around if he's hot he's gonna make the threes he's hot he's gonna make threes and then he's going to probably play more and get more Steals and as he's cold in both directions becomes this sort of feedback loop rolling one way and then rolling back the other so I don't think you have to like add and play immediately I think you could watch list Murphy to see if this thing sticks if you wanted to just toss them into a lineup you probably wouldn't hurt you all that much  Simone fontecchio I think he can probably be downgraded down to a watch list guy this week as well just based on the fact that it doesn't seem like he's gonna get to do a ton besides get some points and some threes  which again clearer path to points League value but I'm not sure that he gets there even in a points League  and also we're seeing Detroit playing Evan Fournier whose on the watch list he's getting 24 minutes a game when Clinton Grimes comes back he's probably gonna get 24 minutes a game there's a lot in Detroit going on that's similar to what we saw going on in Memphis not to quite that same degree because the Pistons are going to play during and Cade and Ivy big men it's when they're healthy  where the Grizzlies really only have two guys and one of them is probably going to be shutting it down for the year in the next month  so it's not quite as severe with Detroit but it's not that far off and it makes it really hard to say definitively that certain guys will have value the rest of the year Royce O'Neill in Phoenix is a guy to keep an eye on he has a well-rounded Fantasy game I think he would have to overtake somebody to get there or they would have to be a more significant injury so probably this isn't thing a thing that sticks long-term but keep an eye on O'Neill and keep one eye on Spencer Dinwiddie in Laker land I you know this is again one that probably becomes more playable if a star is out  didn't witty tends to be mostly assists some points on bad field goal percent and adequate free throw shooting and that's usually not enough in nine cat formats so he's all on the watch list  and I doubt gets beyond that and oh the stream while warm board we just skip over that this week and nobody cares about this one injury replacement board we had some fresh names fresh meat on the list this week let's go through some of the repeat names I owe to soon as a repeat name in Chicago with Zach LaVine out for the year and Patrick Williams out for a couple of weeks  he may lose his value when Patrick Williams comes back don't be super surprised if if that's something that occurs Andre Drummond as we've talked about before 10 to play When the Bulls are going against an extraordinarily large front core like Minnesota or Cleveland there's no guarantee he gets minutes against the other teams and that's when to Sumo was able to be more productive Eric Gordon who I find super annoying fantasy wise is filling in for Bradley Beal Josh Hart continues to fill in for ogn and Obi precious achua is filling in for this combination of Julius Randle and Isaiah hartenstein being out but he probably still plays pretty big minutes even when hartenstein comes back won't play minutes when Randall comes back but we're still at least a couple weeks out on that  I'm not getting into the other Nicks like you know I'm playing out like Burks cause he's feeling in for boy on but not a bitch because Donna which was basically a drop anyway  Burks should have a better chance of value I think Paul Reed Kelly will break Junior streams and Philadelphia while Joel embed his out interested to see what the Anthony Melton does to the rotations and Philly he's likely to make his return after the All-Star break in probably a more limited capacity but his Melton gets revved up does he just get added to the list of guys you can play or does he shove somebody off  rosters in the process  Al Horford is a permanent member of the injury replacement board because any Boston started out means Big Al gets a nice ball game Nick Richards low end stream with Mark Williams out Malik Beasley low end 3-pointers stream with Chris Middleton out I'm in Thompson who he had on this board last week but we're adding Dillon Brooks to the injury replacement board because he's out there taking 20 ill-advised shots a game with Freddy van Fleet on the Shelf Freddy could be back on the other side of the All-Star break that would be about two two and a half weeks since his injury was suffered  I think know about two weeks I guess  uh that would probably put a nail into both of these dudes I'm in Thompson and Dillon Brooks but you know if you've got them on your team already you might as well just sort of hold through the brake see how it goes because we'll do  sort of a news show on Thursday of next week Duncan Robinson with Jimmy Butler and Terry Rozier out does he keep that job if Butler comes back on the other side of the break I don't know  if Duncan goes to the bench you don't start him  if it's haste Highsmith or jovic that goes to the bench you could probably still start Dunkin' Robinson  we had a short term that I know I personally was not on top of because I was chasing family stuff around this is the thing with these like last second stuff Myles Turner and Jaylen Smith were out for Indiana last night that was a two nights ago so I say Jackson got the start  that would be the case if those two guys were out again Corey kispert is a play one Kyle kuzma's on the Shelf although I expect who's to play coming out of the break and Reggie Jackson is a play in Denver with Jamal Murray and Kentavious Caldwell Pope on the sidelines it's kind of nice that actually both those guys are out they provide just a little bit more usage for Reggie and that was enough to get him over the line this is a weird time of day for the show I get it it's late afternoon on a Friday with no basketball heading into all-star weekend I don't have specific pics lined up yet um  I'll probably put some of that stuff out on Twitter as I go through the All-Star Weekend festivities and others some stuff happening today  but it makes stuff of course happens on Saturday and then the game that nobody really cares about happens on Sunday a little bit of news here headed into the weekend just in case you guys were keeping track of things Scotty Pippen Jr on Memphis his back issue is gonna keep him out for at least three weeks that could actually be like kind of winning news for Jordan Goodwin I'd like to see  I'd like to see the Grizzlies in their next one when presumably Canard and conchar and JJ are back how does that impact the minutes of a guy like a Jordan Goodwin and some of these other fringy dudes even a salty aldama who wasn't consistently getting 30 minutes with Jaron Jackson in there if he doesn't get 30 minutes I'm gonna punt on all Donna and then if Goodwin can't get above you know like 2526 we won't go down that path these are either but what if Jordan Goodwin gets to be that guy here with Pippin out for a few weeks it could happen also on the news board Delon Wright has been bought out by the Washington Wizards he will sign with the Miami Heat and he might play a little bit here in the very short term they're down Jimmy Butler who again might be back on the other side of the break they're down Terry Rozier  could dalan get in there and get 20 some odd minutes right out of the Chute probably I'm guessing he's one  one more back court whether it's Butler or hero injury away from being sort of the Delon Wright that you guys know I've always tried to attack any time we know he's gonna get 25 minutes you attack him in fantasy  but I don't think we know that to be the case  and this is you know one of the downside to doing a show here on a Friday where I'm trying to tell you who might be a streamer  nobody plays again for six days  you know that we're in off period now lead comes back on Thursday of next week and yes some teams have kind of a loaded schedule starting on Thursday but talking about them today I can't tell you what to do with the lawn right now you kind of need to see him play in a game  and even then there probably isn't gonna be enough that because we don't know if he's just gonna get East in a little bit they're gonna just throw them to the Wolves say figure it out on the fly to lawn we badly need you out there that game one might only be just a tiniest little bit of data that we need to take the plunge and then it sounds like Jimmy Butler  is expected back shortly his absence was for personal reasons there was a death in the family Terry Rozier might be out a little bit longer but that might benefit some combination of Delon Wright and Duncan Robinson and I may have Junior and  at which point then you're looking at all of them and go on  I don't know  do I breathe signed a three-year contract with the Blazers that's not super interesting right now but it will be if DeAndre Aiden gets shut down at some point and it seems like it will happen eventually  Aiden's been very fine this year he's number 55 and 9 cats likely better defensive stats than folks were assuming myself included like the worst points and rebounds and folks were assuming  me too but again they've sort of counterbalanced each other to get him into that 50 to 60 range he's only played in 37 games  the seasons 2/3 of the way over to the mid 50s and games played for most of these teams  so how badly does Aiden feel like he needs to take the end of the season off as a question he might want to play down the stretch just did like oh hey guys maybe I can still get to you know 5859 ball games this year  and if that's the case then a guy like do a brief doesn't end up being a pickup but Portland is one of the teams that we want to keep an eye on and I'm going to give away a possible chauffeur next week but we're definitely definitely going to be discussing post-break names next week and the funny thing is you know some of these teams have already done it  Utah's already doing it saying all right George go ahead figure it out  and they didn't know what their whole lineup  just one guy  what about Portland are they going to go full youth movement will we see Jeremy grandkids shut down usually that's the way his last like three years in a row been for him will we see genre and get shut down  do a brief becomes interesting  to money tomorrow Jabari Walker these guys start to claw into the conversation retest the most translatable Fantasy game  what about the Grizzlies do they ever like just narrow it down and play seven guys slightly larger minutes or is it gonna be like 10 guys at all play 22 minutes a night  what about the Piston's like the like we just said there like Grizzlies light right now almost everybody's playing 22 23 24 minutes and then you've got you know like three dudes that get a more consistent run we're on the Grizzlies it's two is anybody on those teams can actually Excel  what about the Wizards do they pull the plug on kuzma pool or tyus Jones can anybody waiting in the wings make a big seal of approval on that one is going to be Corey kispert  who puts up these big numbers anytime kuzma sits  so we'll have a show will break down some of that stuff that'll be one of our fun ones for for early next week we'll also talk sort of retroactively about what we saw in All Star weekend we'll get some buys and sells mixed in there should be a pretty fun week where we even somehow managed to conjure up some fantasy stuff to talk about even without games happening so but I know everybody loves the post break stash stuff it's something that folks are asking about his early as like December and when people ask me about that in December you guys know what I say  it's way too far away you can't be stashing that far out here's the thing  here's my end of show rant if I have the voice for it  that's another thing my voice is weak in the afternoon I don't know why maybe it's the maybe it's my body digesting needs to like use the lubricant elsewhere instead of going to my my vocal area so here's my rant on stashing  people that claim they're gonna stash and this is head to head like that means you have to play the guy if it's a daily League  they're probably setting you too far behind where having them start to play better at the end of the year it's too late  and then on Roto you just using up a roster spot and guys come and go these outstanding fill in stream guys that we talked about I just had the  the injury replacement board up there and  look at this board like I'm in Thompson Dillon Brooks these are guys that you want to get in on all formats Horford when he has a chance read Uber a Precious Heart doosan moo there's so many guys on the injury replacement board that are going to give you better than top 100 value that for you to be sitting on someone like I mean takes you know keyonte George or Bilal as an example where  for bilali like there was never a guarantee that he was even gonna get to Value  keonte we always kind of figured at some point he would get to do more for Utah but even now you're in this sort of like oh giant ball game he's starting more of a cell High posture but like playing him other than the last week and a half when he started to get warm again prior to these explosions playing keyonte George every day since November would have tanked your team  he wasn't remotely close to Fantasy value most weeks in there  so you're waiting and you're waiting and you're waiting and you're like constantly setting yourself back you're playing with a hand tied behind your back for months six seven eight nine weeks and there's no guarantee of a payoff this is why you know deadlines stashes or Silly Season stashes or second half stashes those are a much riskier proposition than an injury stash because at least with an injury stash you know what the guys gonna do when they come back  somebody say somebody  shoot I don't know say somebody dropped  I said look at the board say somebody dropped Ogden and obey  because they had to make a run you know what that dude's gonna do when he comes back you go stash him for three four weeks  put him in an eye on slot I mean even then maybe you take a 0 like some of these guys taking a 0 is better than taking the big negative percentages that some of these other dudes would have cost you  so I am pretty staunchly anti early stash as you guys heard with me around the trade deadline that was when I finally started saying I think it was about two weeks before they goes 15 days before that I put the trade deadline show up  on out in the universe I set up the page here on YouTube and I started promoting it and I thought well crap I probably should do a show where you talk a little bit about like some of the guys are looking at  two weeks  two  that's basically as many weeks as I'm willing to stash someone that's not a guaranteed win  that's it  let's be honest guys most of the Silly Season stuff that pops up we don't really see coming anyway  we can do our best looking at these teams that are at the bottom of the standing and still have a handful less than like combined a veterans on them the Wizards have kuzma and pool and tyus Jones those are candidates that may be disappear  what if the Raptor is going to full tank mode I don't I don't know that they will but why they gonna really pull the plug on super young Scotty Barnes or Emmanuel quickly  feels unlikely RJ Barrett y'all can turtle feels like the best candidate to get the plug pulled on the year  what about the Pistons who the hell is even pluggable on that team Evan Fournier you just showed up with their their seen what they got they're kicking the tires on Evan  they've already they're they're they don't even veterans left  Western Conference Spurs don't have anybody to shut down Blazers have Grant and Aiden  Simon still pretty young and he missed a bunch of time earlier this year did we really think he needs to miss more maybe  Grizzlies have shot everybody down besides JJ already  they're only like five or six veterans that we can be like oh maybe they're gonna stop playing him like March 25th  is that worth it to hold Who you gonna hold for 40 days  we're trying to figure out what's going on with the Grizzlies right now  trying to figure out what's going on with the Pistons right now  but that's not even that's still deadlines related that's still trade deadline stuff  so yes we're going to do a show  early next week on second half  like the age old can't the the Buzzy way of phrasing in a second have breakouts I don't like to call it that because you guys know I don't like use the Buzzy words in now I describe it it might have to be the title of a show so that search engine optimization does its little bougie but you know damn well as soon as we get on are I'm gonna be like nah it's not a breakout it's gonna be like Silly Season thing because like how many teams here are we looking at going oh yeah they're gonna dramatically adjust their their rotations right now  nobody  they'll be trade deadlines stuff that's still shakes out on the other side of the All-Star break and there will be three four guys Veterinary guys on terrible teams that start to play every other day every third day that kind of thing and then at some point they'll probably just sort of be off the board at which point then they're back up becomes more interesting on the head to head side but  you know the Wizards we know Corey kissper is closed  there's a really anybody close on the Pistons  the Grizzlies we need young guys to suddenly get fewer minutes so that other young guys can get more for the Blazers wreath  at least there's like a center to Center connection there  but we saw Jeremy Graham is a game and Jabari Walker was still terrible we needed like four usage guys down for the Blazers to get all the way down to Jabari Walker  no guys I don't know I don't know that I see it  maybe lamelo never comes back maybe that's the story so that you know these guys on Charlotte get to keep doing stuff Joey in the chat room says maybe Cade  yeah he's playing on kind of a sore knee  so I mean that would be a thing that drops a lot of usage back into the bucket that would be interesting fun Tech yo Grimes obviously Ivy could those guys get over the hurdle in nine cat so much harder  so much harder to get over the hurdle in nine cat  took me to the end of the show it took me to the 40-minute Mark to rant about something that kind of woke me up a little bit but man I am pooped today hopefully you guys have a chance to watch this show over the break I don't know what you guys are doing the next couple of days come on over hang out with me on social and best wishes we'll talk a little about the Three-Point Contest the dunk contest the All-Star Game will see if we can isolate a couple of fun little prop bets to screw around with and I love Saturday night I love all star Saturday  I don't everybody's a funny duddy these days screw the fuddy duddies let's have some fun with it  enjoy the break I will be back with our next show on Monday and until then I'll see you guys over on social media shout out to manscape.com use promo code ethos 20 to get 20% off and free shipping on your order at manscaped.com again I'm at Dan best person over on Twitter DN b e s b r i s someone's asking about a possible Desmond Bane shut down ah until I hear it I'm not gonna say it  that's where I that's where I stand on that one I don't think it's a full shutdown because it sounded like based on his recovery that he could be back within the month  and that would leave a whole month to the season left so that further complicates thing he might just play like one out of every three games down the stretch  same deal with Marcus Smart who is actually supposed to be back before Desmond Bane we might get word on the other side of the All-Star break that smart could play in like two weeks  would they really just not play him for the last six weeks of the Season Maybe  Marcus Marcus feels like the kind of go just want to get in there and play 1520 minutes  how many of these guys are the Grizzlies need to reevaluate that's another question so maybe they get shut down but I  we always just assumed that if a season's lost that a guy just isn't going to play anymore I don't know that that's entirely true we might just see him pop up just to Annoy Us enough to where we're like oh why did I sit on this guy again  trouble trouble trouble  quote the great Taytay all right we'll see you guys Monday talk to you on the internet
