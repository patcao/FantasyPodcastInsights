welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast morning everybody  myself up here it's fantasy NBA today that's how I wake myself up I yell something into a microphone  yo yo yo  okay shaking out  shake out those limbs can't shake them too far because there's wall right there  there's a bunch of stuff right there I got no space  I got no space  Evan help me I got no space  I'm Dan Bass Pros thanks as always for hanging out  with me  there's this sort of like Regal us thing that happens so thank thanks for hanging out with us who's us  it's just me  anyway  what do we got  we got a Monday recap to do  a few things went down  players came back from injury players went down Josh Hart played all 48 damn minutes and yesterday's ballgame first time that's happened for the Knicks in like a dozen years which honestly doesn't seem like long enough that was my feeling when I saw that I was like oh like a decade ago  Tom Thibodeau wasn't even the coach then  what sort of animal would do such a thing  that well so let's talk about it promo stuff at the beginning find me on Twitter at Danvers many of you are watching on Twitter some of you will hang out with us in a moment  I don't know  I'm out of sorts this morning folks maybe I should have done the streaming show first that one always wakes me up a little bit more cuz I'm like pouring through the names done a lot of that  whatever doesn't matter  uh let's see let's see let's see let's see let's see let's do this thing  hey go  start the top work our way through Cleveland beat Indiana 108103 game that ended up a bit more low scoring than I originally thought it would know Donovan Mitchell on the Cavaliers side so Charis Levert moves back into a startable position he had a really nice ball game yesterday  Isaac Coral probably startable with no Donovan Mitchell wasn't great in this ball game but typically gets you kind of that across the board stuff George and yang filling in from Max strus that's a play you're making only if you need three pointers on where is four turnovers came up came from whoopsies uh and that's kind of the story for the Cavs without Donovan Mitchell if spider comes back for the next ball game you probably bench Carousel version you almost definitely bench a car okoro and then the Yang still likely gets you some three-pointers not hugely impacted by Donovan either way  on the Pacers side TJ McConnell continues to put up really nice lines these days 21 points 14 points three boards for assists 21 minutes I should say two steals that's the big thing with him always gets you one or two steals that's just the McConnell way  and you know is minutes I get it they're not super high he's a  pretty consistent like top 40 top 50 guy when he gets closer to starters but in 2021 minutes lately he's been kind of in that 75 range very consistently putting up lines just like this  I'll admit I didn't think it was gonna stick when he did it once or twice but now we're like a dozen games into this so have at it man  TJ McConnell is a goal  Aaron neesmith cool substantially he's coming off a better ball game he played 35 minutes that's still a team hi I am not abandoning ship on niece Smith mostly because he's getting the most minutes on the team and basically anybody in the universe playing 35 minutes can get you some kind of fantasy value so I'm hanging on there and I have no other additional thoughts on the Indiana Pacers  I think we're gonna move through this one a little bit quicker today  I say that and then I know I'm gonna get caught up on some game that's the Dan best persuade Miami lost it Philadelphia still no Jimmy Butler Duncan Robinson also injured partway through this ball game he threw his back out  and that stinks I don't know if that will cost him a game or not  the  the real shame of all of it of course is  that you're you know with Miami  well yeah I mean they're every other day this week so  you know not bad I guess not good not bad they're fine it'll be annoying  if you have to dump him they don't they don't have a fantastic schedule this sort of at the tail end of a nice scheduling stretch they had that weekend to yesterday back to back anyway Caleb Martin moves into a starting value Asian with Duncan Robinson is out there's just been kind of enough stuff and he probably would get the start in that next ball game if he's out let's go to call the Village instead but that felt like it was more they would Highsmith situation a pulling back just a tiny bit here because we can get into the weeds from time to time the key things are in this iteration let's say Duncan Robinson is out let's say he misses a ball game and Jimmy Butler misses another one I don't know he might he may or may not  if Butler's out I would start bam Rozier  Caleb Martin  and Jaime jaquez Junior  if Robinson is in I would not start either Caleb Martin or Jaime jacquez I would start Dunkin' Robinson you know what maybe I would go with her kids I shouldn't I shouldn't go that far because if he's feeling it for Butler if Butler's back and Robinson's house  then you probably just go bam Butler and Roeser  even though one of those guys I guess or Caleb Martin probably at the start it's really just all about having enough to do and we'll Butler's in there all these guys lose out on all this stuff they get to do  that's that whole minutes versus  actual opportunity discussion  that's not to say that Caleb Martin won't play 3334 minutes and get you sort of some stuff but the thing that I like the most about this ball game forget the four steals obviously that's the thing I like the most the thing I like the most about Caleb Martin's game yesterday was that he took 14 shots  he was just involved on offense  Kelly oubre finally exploded this is kind of the game we've been sitting and waiting on because the thing with Aubrey and and his rank hasn't been all that great lately but the thing with Uber is when he plays this number of minutes and guess this number of shots  throughout his career he's been 75 Ranger better Nine cat and he was like top 175 because he just wasn't shooting and the Steals and blocks weren't there for whatever reason  or he was shooting he just was making them I should say and then all the sudden yesterday they went in he got a bunch of blocks hit a couple threes even got some rebounds  this is why there's going to be some sort of leveling with him the Hope was that it was going to come before the season ended and we got a little bit of a taste of it yesterday Maxi obviously is a go and then no one else on this team in my opinion is a guaranteed go you guys have heard me on the show lately talk about how I have this weird like sinking feeling around Paul Reed lately mostly because he's coming off the bench yes going up against bam out of Bio was probably the big reason that he didn't put up much in the way of numbers yesterday technically I'll say it again technically over since MB went down Reid has been a startled fantasy player  but it just it feels like  it feels like it's trending the wrong way  and it it also kind of feels like  the numbers haven't really caught up with that  like his minutes have been going down and his roles been going down and somehow he's still going in that like 100 range  over the last week though  it's starting to tip the other way I like the one steal and one block over that stretch 23 minutes though is pretty low  eight and seven he's probably not enough to get it done even with one Steel in one block and the field goal percentage is weirdly lower that over that stretches as well the nice thing about Paul Reed is that he has a very high floor because he just has a good fantasy game he's a good percentage is Guy tends to be decent in both percentages and he gets deals and blocks and rebounds when you can do all of those things you don't have to be very good in the other stuff to maintain some semblance of fantasy value and that's why he's never gonna be like an outright drop even when his minutes are low even when his production slows a little bit he's never gonna be an obvious outright drop he's always going to be in my opinion kind of hovering and maybe that kind of doesn't matter group like 100 to 150 range type and that started a lot of formats it's definitely started well if you need a center I just still have this feeling like something is is ticking the wrong way and you've had a few of those lately  no Obama had four defensive stats and two three-pointers but only played 18 minutes so nope  Kyle Lowry finally hit a few shots call it a Revenge game call whatever you want  he's typically just an assistant steals Guy and he did get you his steals here he just happened to take a couple of shots so nope  let's move on  I said we were gonna go fast and then I got kind of caught up on that ball game for a minute Detroit blowing out by Boston Isaiah Stewart who was a nice schedule play left with a sore hamstring we have no idea how bad it is Detroit didn't give a very good indicator but he did leave halfway through the ball game so assumption is that it's not great but also Detroit was getting knocked Around Every Which Way But sideways so there's sort of no reason to extend him  so and this is annoying because Detroit is sitting on a pretty good scheduling spot one of the best starting on Sunday actually they had six games and nine days had four this week and then they also start next week with the game so the Isaiah Stewart was set to be a pretty good pickup for a nice nine-day spell you might have to move off him because he just can't take zeros and I don't know that we're gonna get any info on him today  so you're in a little bit of a tight spot you can try to wait until tomorrow  to get more info on him  but by that point you ice yourself out on any teams that go four times the rest of this week by the only one it's the Pelicans  so not a ton of great streaming options there there are plenty of teams that have three game starting tomorrow and so you could pivot off of Stuart getting like if he gets ruled out part way through tomorrow you're looking at it and you're going okay uh  so two game Max then if he gets ruled out tomorrow  you could turn that into a three game week Stewart might end up being a one or is 0  or you go today you assume he misses the rest of the week you pick up a fringe pelican  and then you end up getting four games versus three but probably four not as good that's the decision you're sitting on right now and unfortunately I don't have a great answer for you I don't know if we're gonna play tomorrow I'm guessing less than a 50% shot but we'd be great to be able to save our roster move no Cade in this one  no fun tecchio in this one Noah's are Thompson still was dealing with his lung slash asthma slash whatever's going on there  so not surprisingly Detroit got run out of the building Stanley and Moody played 34 minutes in this one Jade and Ivy is a play when Kate sits he had 21 five and five James Wiseman got 26 minutes for I don't even really know what reason just blow out Jalen Duren obviously is a guy you hold on to Marcus Sasser got a start he was mad  don't read too much into this ball game I would expect to see Cade back in the next one I'd expect to see fontecchio or Thompson back pretty soon and then of course if Stuart goes out that you then other guys get shifted around will I guess kind of see no ads for me out of Detroit  unless we get some kind of word like if Steward is out there like oh yeah by the way he's gonna miss a week or something like that then you can start looking and say all right well maybe even 48 maybe they were on a little small in a terrible shooting game I don't think any of these guys profile is a rodeo play but head-to-head because of the decent schedule there's some shot at it Boston there in the midst of a very good scheduled run they are right after game two of their five and seven so they're off tonight they play tomorrow off Thursday and then they got a Friday Saturday back-to-back and the nice thing about Boston the reason we should talk about them is because you're gonna get a game like this one possibly two  if you've been listening to this show you're well aware of how Boston's been utilizing their players in these recent back-to-backs if you're new to the program  Boston is sitting basically half their starters on the front end of a back-to-back and have their starters on the other  so in this ball game Jayson Tatum got the day off Al Horford got the day off and Drew holiday got the day off so you got back by the way so that was something you got Luke kornet sliding in for a big lineup situation you got Payton Pritchard sliding in for Holiday at the point guard spot and then with Sam Houser out you got some bonus Jaiden Springer and female minutes off the bench but that's a big fat who cares  I bring this up because tomorrow they'll play their regular starters so Pritchard will be your you know 2022 minute guy off the bench that's not enough for Roto but they're Friday Saturday back-to-back Pritchard profiles as a guy you could probably play in both of those don't think I would go cornet in both of those not with Horford and forcing his both healthy now up but if we get word that same houses back before that back-to-back he'd be someone you could play there as well just as something to look ahead to either had to head or Rodeo whatever Direction you want to go those guys do have Appeal on that back-to-back for Boston  Portland made a game of it in Chicago and that's really all that their fans can ask for right now play competitive basketball and then losing the end that's the perfect way to do it but he's stable came back didn't last very long ankle  soreness forced him out early  to Monte Cara played 14 and a half minutes and was awful in a starting gig and then most of what's going on here with Port Linda's streamables 8 in Simon's of the only guys you play every Dayton played 33 minutes off the bench they just Johnson builds like to he was doing better he had five defensive stats which is kind of weird for him I am not comfortable playing Benton against the Roto games cap yes for schedules dream you know Jabari Walker slides back in his possible schedules stream school schedule stream even tomorrow I don't think he's this bad again Chris Murray Portland has a lot of options and they have a really good schedule and they've had a really good schedule for a while they had a five and seven mixed in there and then went back into it every other day position before they have another back-to-back later this week we kind of need and I will going out is actually kind of helpful because we do need them to thin the herd a tad  see how it goes you're not playing those other guys in the against the games cap Chicago's an easy one they have four startable players right now Kobe white would be the 5th when he comes back so DeRozan IO vouch Caruso those four guys that's it you're not playing Torrey Craig you're not playing Andre Drummond you're not playing dalen Terry you're not playing bit him you're not playing Jevon Carter  easy  Minnesota Utah this one not easy this is a very confusing game  in so many ways and a largely because I have no idea who's gonna play in the next one for either of these teams we can again sort of make our best guesses on that but  shrug  Anthony Edwards posterized John Collins and poked him in the face in the process and Colin's left with a facial bruise basically we don't know if he's gonna be available for Utah's next ball game  what a huge letdown  for folks that have Jazz I had Jordan Clarkson on a points League team I was sitting and waiting for this five and seven thinking here we go baby nope John Collins missed one now he misses a half of another he might miss another one nope  marking and came back I guess that's something let's start with you talk because they're annoying and I wanted knock them out or first here so marketing is a start  kante George is a start Walker Kessler is a start those are the three that are very obvious and also healthy John Collins if he plays very much a start  beyond that it's a little bit of a coin flip Taylor Hendricks started played 28 minutes in this game at 8 and 6 of the couple threes a stealing a block I don't think that's good enough it had to head right now in Roto excuse me it is good enough as a schedule play  Taylor Horton Tucker pass Kris Dunn typically kind of a Sistine steals type so head to head  specialist appeal  with marketing and back sensible is no longer interesting all the Collins now sits out then maybe everybody slides up a notch  Clarkson is someone I would play obviously on the head to head side because you're just trying to rack up stats but Rodeo I'm not now the market in his back because a lot of the appeal with Clarkson was with with marketing and out Jordan was going to get 18 so ball game and then he can sort of overwhelm his nine category pitfalls  now marketing is back  but again I have no idea who's gonna play in Utah's next ball game  they got a back-to-back Wednesday Thursday on the road they play Saturday as well still have a decent schedule this week so try to hang on a little bit longer if you can just to see if any of these guys are ready for the back-to-back if they're not  you might have to start cutting  Minnesota  infirmary the Minnesota infirmary right now they're hanging in there though  you know to the Wolves credit they're they're losing body's left and right and they're hanging tough wolves are a half game back at the Thunder for the top record in the Western Conference mostly because they played an extra game nuggets all so I have game back of the Thunder  that's a race to the Finish those three teams nuggets really look like the best team  in the west maybe in the NBA frankly again  they have a I believe us a slightly harder schedule than the teams that they're right there with but I may have missed that Thunder for a long time had the easiest remaining schedule I don't know if that's still the case that's why I was looking and I didn't find a spot to maybe put like just 10 bucks on the Thunder to have the best record the one seed in the west couldn't find it I'll admittedly I didn't look all that hard  you know lazy  okay so Nazarene hurt partway through this ball game head injury we don't know if he's gonna be back for their next one which is tonight mind you so this is all very relevant if you can make a move for this evening  the guys that we know are upright of the usual starters for this team are Jayden McDaniels Anthony Edwards and Mike Conley all three of those guys in my opinion are very easy yeses in all formats tonight  assuming gobert and nasrid are both still out  we don't know for sure go bear was talking about how he was still feeling soreness yesterday so I be kind of surprised if he just magically wasn't today but again anything is possible so assuming Gilbert or out those three starters are good to go I would also play Kyle Anderson because he spot starting now and I know I've said that I'm not into him this year but with this many guys out there's just so much left over that  him playing 30 some odd minutes that's enough he'll just do enough in those minutes and then I would probably consider nickeil Alexander Walker who has a pretty interesting Fantasy game not great in terms of percentages so you just sort of hope that those don't blow a hole in you but like this is due to add three steals two blocks three threes four boards five assists and yesterday's ballgame  and if Reed is out  on his goodness I don't even know what they look a garden does he started Center I can't imagine he starts at Center they probably just go very very small does that mean Kyle Anderson is there small ball Center  Maybe  even if gar says starts again he's only playing like 11 minutes here that like these other guys are gonna get those minutes  so this one this is for Roto by the way you yeah I think you could play all those guys against a roto games cap for their game tonight and then head to head you know you're on your back to back here there's schedule listens up a bit after today they're off for a bunch and they play I think Friday Sunday or something like that so I don't think that I would use a roster move today to get into the wolves uh but someone like a Jordan McLaughlin might take enough shots to be mildly fantasy relevant that's probably about as far as I'd go beyond the names we already discussed  Memphis took Sacramento to overtime Desmond Bane 37 minutes I guess that dude's healthy  JJJ fouled out in 39 minutes just couldn't get his shot going  and you know you started to see here basically a six-man rotation for Memphis and  maybe we get a little bit of consistency although  the situation for the Grizzlies is they tend to play their guys against the teams  either where they know they're still gonna probably lose or the teams that are sort of fighting for playoff positioning so they're trying to play spoiler a little bit and then when they can tank against other bad teams they do  what I don't know about Memphis is what they're going to do with San Antonio because that's a tank opponent but also and everybody wants to play against one be so maybe you get the starters  here's where I'm sitting with Memphis right now things have have drawn a bit more clear  with their very two-way guys and Julie's sitting this one out and and you know saving their availability a little bit JJ's obviously a go as his Desmond Bane when those guys are in the starting lineup Santi aldama has been playing better  with better players around him I'm still a little bit reticent to play him when JJJ is in because I'd like for all dhamma to get  consistently double-digit shots and he has been over the last few ball games and you guys know I've been I think higher on him perhaps than I should be but certainly higher than most because he does a little bit of everything and then you just pray his percentages don't tank you which they've been okay the last three ish 34 ball games  would I play all against the game's cap  hmm  probably not unless I badly needed power forward he kind of stats  I don't think I would play GG Jackson against the game's Gap either he's running hot right now but when he runs cold it really gets ugly quick  both those guys by the way you can play in head-to-head I have no problem with that Jake Bravia same story I don't think I could use him against the games cap coming off the bench of gameplay 41 minutes yesterday contrast on conchar is very interesting but he became very interesting because Luke Kennard was out we saw the previous game Kennard started over conchar and it was Canard that had whatever was 9 points nine assists or something like that I love Contours nine cat game he gets deals he gets blocks he gets rebounds out of that guard position he gets assists he doesn't shoot very much so you kind of have to be okay with that side but he's like what Draymond Green was three years ago before he got super duper slow and disinterested  apologies got some allergies today  so what do I do for memphis's next ball game I don't know what concerts Situation's gonna be I believe he missed this one for personal reasons so he could very well be back or a Canard I should say  if Luke is back in the next one and it's basically the same starting five but Canard in there instead of conchar I probably play Canard  I don't think and this is again against the games I don't think I would play contract against the game's cap I don't think I would go GG I don't think I would go out dama  all of those guys would be fine on head to head if they're in their same story with larvae but I don't know that we're gonna know who's playing for them until like two hours before the game happens up for the Kings Kevin herder got injured I don't want to say hurt  as bad left early how about that left early  and then it was key on Ellis time who came on and played 34 minutes and had six defensive stats he's gone sort of full Matisse diebel mode if you need defensive stats key on Alice is your man because I don't think herders back for the next one Sacramento is a really good schedule starting tomorrow they go five games in seven days if your league continues Beyond this week he would be very interesting and has a shot like you know I don't know how long herders gonna be out I'm guessing at least one game maybe more than that  but Alice is picking up more minutes anyway of late he's a guy you could get three defensive stats out of each of those games so five games at that rate you know 15 defensive stats over a week is massive  had a whatever your targeting here that's massive so keep a very close watch on Ellis I think he's a worthwhile pick up for tomorrow and then Malik monk continuing to rumble along here he started slowly got really hot got very cold and now he's been very useful hot ish again for a better part of about a month so keep that going and you're seeing more Fox Ellis monk minutes with Keegan Murray and Demona sabonis and Harrison Barnes losing out a little bit there and look I mean this is why I think every and it's not analysts on Earth was saying don't buy in on the Harrison Barnes stuff and if anybody was saying the opposite bring him to me I'll have it all sit him down have a talking to  here's the silly one of the night Josh Hart 40 minutes is anybody surprised he's shot less than 30%  10 11 and 11 he had a triple double sort of like the empty triple double but 48 minutes come on come on dibs don't you know you're going to need Josh Hart to be able to stand on his own two feet come playoff time  poor guys gonna die out there  but don't worry miles McBride also played almost 48 minutes he rested for a minute 29 which by the way surprising twist here they went McBride presumably to deal with Steph Curry  I thought we all thought and I wasn't at the computer when this game started because that's the late games here that was always happen when I'm right in the middle of family time  before the kids go to bed  Nick's dropped their starting lineup I'm looking at it like what where's Precious no precious 18 minutes for a to just not a reasonable matchup for him I do think that and we don't really know the deal with ogn and obey the Knicks schedule is pretty crummy this week actually they're off for two days they only have two games left the rest of this week  my guest would be OG's back for at least one of those so maybe we don't need to worry about this too much now if he misses another one like you go into Denver  I think you probably see pressure to go back in there because they'd want him to deal with Aaron Gordon Donte divincenzo is not gonna be able to deal with their and Gordon  no one in the Knicks starting five  could deal with Gordon cause and I would have been on yolk it so I think they would go bigger for that one now if oh Jesus back he probably just deals with Gordon  so she can't do much with it right now you gotta wait a day two days whatever we'll get our next report on and Obi and go from there in the meantime I'm also not picking up McBride Deuce nice ball game when he gets these giant minutes obviously he's fought like anybody playing 46 minutes it's gonna post fantasy value but I I just I can't imagine that this happens again at least not like immediately  this is the you got two days off to rest kid get in there  meanwhile I severely underestimated how much trayce Jackson Davis was gonna play in The Warriors next ball game some of it it's because Moses Moody went down some of it is frankly because Draymond Green wasn't playing very well so  warriors were trying some stuff some of its because Andrew Wiggins wasn't playing very well  and so they you know Steve Kerr two his credit in this one he's been he's been killed for you know maybe not using his younger guys frequently enough he was hunted for a lineup That was working  go figure it out and they trace Jackson Davis he was a plus six so he got extra run and it was a big one 19 and 9 with 3 blocks  I can continue to think that he probably slowly Trends the other way but he's hot as hell right now and you know you guys know my feeling I'm playing hot players I don't think that trayce Jackson Davis just sort of like turned a corner when Steph Curry got hurt and now suddenly he's a guy that's guaranteed 23 24 minutes of ball game  I also understand that saying that while he's actively having a monster game makes me sound like the biggest fuddy duddy on planet Earth but just be aware  if you're going to use them say against a role of games cap be aware that he could play nine minutes in their next ball game against the Grizzlies although the Grizzlies you know which generation of them you're gonna get probably the one that has real players in it so  maybe he does get to run if this other if these other units think because like Andrew Wiggins  I think I called him a member of the doesn't matter fan club it might be worse than that I think you can drop Wiggins I think you could do better with that roster slot frankly I think you could do better and I don't know how many people are saying this because I don't have time to listen to what other analysts to talk about but I think dream on green is a drop  he's just not  he just not good anymore at Fantasy I don't remember 13 overall on the year and that's fine and like if you're punt points then he's playable but he's also kind of a doesn't matter level guy ultimately  I think we're past the time in draymond's career where he's inside the top 100  I'm gonna hold on to Chris Paul I know it's been weird the last couple of ball games but I still like there's enough upside there to hold on clay you're holding  that's an easy one to say after as a good ball game but gemski you're dropping kaminga you're holding  there's your warriors Tada the aristocrats Atlanta went into La after playing in LA and God defeated by the Lakers and probably La nightlife  you they had nine three pointers they took a lot but they didn't make very many dejounte Murray was I don't know tired didn't have a very good ball game Jaylen Johnson was great he turned ankle late in this one the game was already a blowout so didn't impact his minutes the good news is that he did come back out and sit on the bench for the end the bad news is it wasn't a great ankle tweak and he's just coming back from an ankle tweak and so you have to assume that they're going to be kind of careful  the better news as we go back and forth between good and bad news the better news is that they're off for two days so if there's ever going to be a chance for him to come back without missing a game it would be with a two-day break before they play in Phoenix against the Sun so you might actually get a full Jalen Johnson week cross your fingers  you know sacrifice a chicken or what it was whatever the line from Bull Durham was on Echo Kangoo back finally and looked pretty good actually look a little slow and a little rusty and nobody tends to have great games against Anthony Davis but this is pretty good by all accounts 19 minutes  11 and 4 with two Steals on good field goal percent missed his free throw typically okay there  what I'm interested in and this game again was over early so it's hard to get a great feel for what the minutes were going to look like  and the Lakers were actually playing some defense which was incredibly surprising  they tend to struggle with  honestly they tend to struggle with guys like Deontay Murray but they ended up struggling a bit more to guard Jalen Johnson yesterday  what do we do with Atlanta that's the you guys are all like stop talking in circles Dan click appelez a hole bug zdanowicz is a whole does not take Marie obviously Jalen Johnson obviously oh Congo I'm adding in Roto formats head I'm not adding because they they only have two games arrested the week they go into a four game week next week so if you wanted to add on Thursday it's not going to help you much this week but it would help you through multiple additional weeks should your fantasy season continued to that point and then DeAndre Hunter is a guy that I'm a little bit worried about now so  I think he's probably gonna be fine but you're also seeing this the this is the hunter back and forth when he runs hot  he puts up a lot of points on a lot of mid-range jumpers and he can roll sort of top 60 top 80 range on that when he cools off it turns kind of sour because he doesn't do that much other stuff  so if you want to use that roster slot for someone else I'm actually totally fine with it I do think that eventually a Kong was gonna play some more power forward minutes for this team that'll slide Jalen Johnson down that'll probably squeeze Hunter a little bit  so if you want to drop down under that's fine I don't mind I don't think he's a must hold player head to head with a bad schedule for sure Roto you sort of hunting points and decent percentages  otherwise and  then the Lakers decent games out of the four main guys that's really where you're at with this team when they're healthy that's it  you know what I like seeing for the Lakers yesterday and this isn't really fantasy relevant but I like seeing Max Christie actually get to play a little he's like the only dude on that team with bounce  okay Ruiz got a little bounce Ruiz got a little bounce  and obviously Anthony Davis has a little bounce but everybody else is so slow and near the ground  that whole team that Lakers team can't jump it's why they get out rebounded so hard every game  let's see some more max Christie dammit  I like that kid good catch and shoot three point dude he can rebound okay from the small guard position  I want more max  I think it for the lake Lakers if they're getting a stinker of a game out of Dinwiddie or Tori and Prince you gotta try Max Christie on a night like that doesn't matter for Fantasy dealer tied Nick Van Exel last night for the most three-pointers in a season  for the Los Angeles Lakers he will of course provided he does not now suddenly like the he didn't get hurt so I see no reason to say anything of to suggest that he gets hurt in the near future but provided he plays I would think and even one more basketball game  D-Lo breaks down record and it doesn't get set enough but D'Angelo Russell might be the best 3-point shooter in Los Angeles Lakers history  isn't that nuts  and that's not to say that he's like he has tenure  but  you go back you know 30 years people weren't really that wasn't a thing shooters were stepping that far out  that's 40 years I guess good Lord I'm old now uh  so Nick the quick Nick Van Exel great outside shooter and the Lakers since then I've had some decent ones  but  no one has ever been just consistently reigning in threes the way that Russell has this year  so tip of the cap to you Dilo  your fun to watch  I don't know that there's many things more entertaining in basketball than when a player because Dilo is so streaky when he gets hot it's like  crazy level high he'll just throw it in from anywhere  that's so entertaining  hell of a season for D'Angelo Russell and trying to give him a few  you know  upvotes here after another great ball game yesterday what's his fantasy ranking now we can get this on the Fly where are you Dlow  mid-60s still  yeah he ended up as a reel Draft Day steal at the end of law 64 18 6 and a half the only thing you'd point out with him and say hey what happened here he's only a 0.8 steals thought that might be more like one or 1.1  that would have moved him into a 5th round valuation also by the way 64 games for d low this year he's been healthy on top of everything else  good stuff for D'Angelo Russell  all right everybody big group of you following on

compliments J on Twitter  you are most welcome  uh let's see if you're asking about streaming just remember that we have another show coming up in about 15 minutes after I finish this one  and we'll talk about who do you use for you know good scheduling spot so if your question is about that in this chat room you can either throw it in the comments after and I'll get to it eventually but I can't promise it's gonna be super fast it's actually today I have a really tight schedule or just come on over to our second show today which by the way is a good reason for everybody to actually click subscribe  on something subscribe on YouTube subscribe on iTunes Spotify whatever it is so that way you make sure that the next time I'm live on here doing the the streaming show you guys are here for it  do you think Tyler hero is a hole  if you're in your playoffs probably not he still has no time table  oh Congo or Olynyk points Lee Kelly Olynyk is Donte divincenzo a drop I don't think so  special not with the ogn and Obi in and out right now in 18 and 4 with a steel and 4 3-pointers and good percentages yesterday he's absolutely a hold  is Larry Nance a good Nine Cats streaming option yeah I mean you know well and we'll talk about that more on our second show but New Orleans is the only team with four games left so  sorta  how about is the nazre injury we don't know yet  sorry let's just stay tuned on that one  is it okay to drop Jaylen Johnson or Iowa to assume move for  Trey man know Trey Man actually just got ruled questionable himself so I don't think you should do that  and if Jalen Johnson's back fast he you know he puts up huge number those guys are guys that are putting up big numbers here  TJ McConnell trayce Jackson Davis Jonas Alex Crusoe Walker Kessler on Echo Congo who do you like at these guys oh  well Caruso obviously he's been great all year Walker Kessler I think he's set to have a really nice finish  and then I'd probably go Valanciunas I know he's been bad lately but he's safer than the other guys and then  a Congo and then McConnell and Jackson Davis is Jackson Davis at the bottom for me still I still not fully trusting him and I might regret that anyone dropping Mike Conley after the two games not man he still got two more the rest of the week I think you can find a better drop  is Justin champagne and add an ESPN points League  I don't think so  I think who's most back  so I'm tempted to say no  I'd like to see champagne do it if kuzma's in before I believe that this is a thing that can actually stick long term  Chris Paul or trayce Jackson Davis tomorrow against the Grizzlies I think I'd go Chris Paul should I drop Wiggins for Keon Ellis I don't care who you pick up but yes I think Wiggins has droppable  are you always live on YouTube I try to be yeah um and so and this show will be on YouTube and then you can also just listen to it back on traditional pod channels it gets posted as fantasy NBA today on All pod places so if you ever miss it live that's an easy way to do it  fast I know it's easy like those apps you can play them in the background and stuff it's easier than a YouTube app you don't have to use as much data because there's no video and it's easier for us to monitor's the traditional pods You Tube is tougher  you tubes monetization program is pretty wimpy  all right drop scoot or Banton  in a points League I mean why  what are you gaining they still have three games left the rest this week drop somebody only has two  you can add two games to your Ledger that way you're gaining very little by dropping a player who has three games for likely someone else who has three games or a bad New Orleans Pelicans option  I will be in your streams more looking for I've been looking for Fantasy
