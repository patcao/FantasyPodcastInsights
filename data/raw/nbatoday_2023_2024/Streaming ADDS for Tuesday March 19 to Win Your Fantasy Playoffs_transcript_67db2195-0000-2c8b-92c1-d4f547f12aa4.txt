welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right we got our quick hitter show now streaming time here on fantasy NBA today I hope you guys are enjoying these back-to-backs I've been pulling this week  I don't know scheduling wise it just sort of made more sense for me to try to jam them in one right after the other I'm already in the chair the equipment's already hooked up  off we go at Dan Bass Pros on social media this is of course is a sports ethos.com presentation  and this is the second half of our two for Tuesday well we're gonna talk about how to maximize your games on the head to head side and I have bad news for you today  your choices  suck  should I just sign off after that I've been a good show  let's start with the worst schedule because that's actually not the worst news of all there are a couple of teams who don't have particularly good schedules and you can find a way to move off of them  problem of course is going to be the second half of this show where we don't have that many options for you to go back in another Direction Lakers back to having the worst schedule again such as been the case for the better part of a week now they've they've been an extremely light schedule basically since Sunday March 10th they had two games last week they played first day this week yesterday and now they're off for three days again  so the Lakers two games the rest of this week  and they're off Monday of next week so technically Lakers two games over the next seven days  and I get it weeks don't start and end on Tuesdays but you have to look at the whole breadth of it  they go into a four game schedule next week starting on Tuesday so at least things start to pick up a little bit for La at that point but this is a rough one they're off for three days right now two games Friday and Sunday two games over seven days for the Lakers if you have any fringy players there which you shouldn't because they're scheduled in bad for a while but if you happen to  get off of it  all so bad schedule basically like a massive deadlock of a bunch of teams that all have two games over six days but there are some slight differences among them so they're here are the teams that have pretty bad schedules  the Atlanta Hawks the Charlotte Hornets the Chicago Bulls the Memphis Grizzlies the Dallas Mavericks and the New York Knicks six teams Hawks Hornets Bulls Grizzlies Mavs Knicks  all of those teams have two games over six days to finish this week but two of them played today  so wipe those off the board interestingly it's the two teams that only have a two-game week so their schedule is about to go from pretty bad to horrible after today particularly the Hornets but the maps and the Hornets you can take off the board for today because I know they had a bad schedule this week but as we talked about on yesterday's streaming show there was kind of no reason to move off of them yesterday if you like the player that you had on those teams you might as well just let him go through today and frankly for the Mavericks you might as well just let him go through Thursday  for the Hornets know but at this point he let him go through today so the Lakers terrible schedule but you probably don't have any streamables on that team anyway because they've had a bad schedule  which brings us now that sort of Narrows our Focus to the Hawks the Bulls the Grizzlies and the Knicks  those are the four teams that have had either good or middling schedule the next schedule hasn't been great but it has been the worst on planet Earth they're sort of like gently floating along with three game weeks lately two games over six days including two days off right now so they don't play today or tomorrow they play Thursday Saturday to finish the week if you have somebody on the next you like a lot you can hang tough with it but if there's someone that you were streaming like you know like a precious of Tours or if you induce McBride yesterday these are things where you probably want to be a little bit careful  the Grizzlies I've been telling you guys basically to avoid them because you just don't really know who's playing on a given night they do go tomorrow and they do go Friday so the worst part of the schedule for the Grizzlies is the end of the week when they don't play over the weekend so if you like the Memphis streamer or Fringe player you have probably hold till Friday and then get the hell off the Grizzlies over the weekend move to somebody who has a back-to-back if  you're seasoned is ending or you know look farther down the line  the Hawks they're off for two days now and actually not only do they have two games in six days it's actually three games in eight so slightly better because they play Monday of next week and they move into a better schedule  but the Hawks have lots of Fringe players Bruno Fernando is fringy until Kong came back oh Congo himself is kind of a fringy player DeAndre Hunters of fringy player I don't think any of those guys belong on rosters right now because again there is a team it's not a great opportunity but there is a team left that has four games this week and they're going to be a lot of teams that have three games so if you're sitting on like a DeAndre Hunter who you think might be  I don't know 120 range  production it's hard to say because each game is its own weird little sample size but let's say you guessed it about 120 range for ranking on Hunter two games of that versus three games of like 150 range guy  maybe better  they got tip towards the three gamer  or four games  from the one team that I haven't talked about yet  and we will ingest a second and then the other really bad team we were talking about was the Bulls they don't have anybody that's Fringe level so that one doesn't even really creep in so I guess you could call it a little bit of good news that the only really the only team where you probably had a bunch of Fringe level guys that you shouldn't anymore is the Hawks because the Hornets you could hold through uh today the Mavs you can hold through today or even Thursday the Knicks you could try to just hold the rest of the week but maybe you have a friend but honestly the Knicks the Lakers the Bulls none of those teams you really had streaming level guys and then the Grizzlies are all over the map so who the hell knows with them anyway but if you have someone Fringe on the Griz like a Jameson or a parallel I don't know that's probably your best example as a trade Jameson or even a John conchar or a Luke Kennard what you shouldn't have because he's been sitting out basically every other ball game those are guys that you'd probably want to abandon ship on as well  what about the good schedule well I'll scroll this board down those view that are watching with us here I think it's on the screen yeah it's on the screen I actually remember to do it this time those of you that are watching with us you can see one team  there is only one team with a schedule above the others the rest of this week and that team is the New Orleans Pelicans  there are plenty of teams that have three games the rest of this week  sure yeah lots I mean we could list them off if you guys really want to know who has three games the rest this week well we can use this schedule I'll just highlight these six days and look for any role that has three markers in it Brooklyn Cleveland  Denver  Detroit Golden State Houston I'll go faster Indiana the Clippers who had a bad schedule start the week now it's getting a little bit better  Miami that's 10 already Milwaukee Minnesota  Oklahoma City or Lando  Philadelphia Phoenix Portland Sacramento  San Antonio Toronto Utah Washington  is a 22  she was 17 or 22 I lost track anyway it's most of the NBA  and I probably could have just done this through deductive I could have deduced it  because he had the Lakers and then those 16s I talked about that had two games arrest the week so that's seven and one team with four there's eight the other 22 have three games left  it's quite it's quite evenly matched  which of course means with 22 teams that have three games there are lots of really really good  three game pickups  but if you really wanted a Max it out and I don't think I feel all that comfortable telling you to Max it out but if you really wanted to Max it out  it's the bellies  the pellets are the only team that has four games the rest of this week  the problem here and it's a large one it's a doozy is that the Pelicans really have a five or six player rotation where they go quite heavy on minutes and then a steep drop-off to basically anyone else  lately because herb Jones has been out of the lineup you've gotten a little bit more out of Jose Alvarado  but herb is probable  he got upgraded for today's ball game yesterday so I would assume herb Jones is playing and Jose Alvarado has been it's dropped back down where they were before which was more like 1920 ish per ballgame as most of the 31 he got in the last one  31 minutes of Eldorado that's your almost guaranteed one in half to two steals but I don't think he's getting 31 minutes in any of the four games this week unless you get some rest game oh you'll probably get a Zion rescue in there I don't know that that's gonna change things very much  the other name two names the other name that might creep into consideration would be Larry Nance although he sat out their last back-to-back they say it was an illness  you could scroll back a little bit find out if you played in the previous one he did but he only got about 2021 minutes in that back-to-back I love Larry Nance but 19 minutes isn't enough for him to do fantasy damage it's not  20 something is mid-20s is always been enough for him to get you a bunch of steals on good percentages but 19 minutes you're talking about four or five points probably five rebounds if that three to five rebounds two assists maybe a steal it's not enough  for games of that isn't enough  and Naji Marshall is the other one that comes up he doesn't play all that much but in sort of stark contrast to the Larry Nance when Marshalls on the floor he is firing  he's like wait nasri does what  because what he his Fantasy game actually reminds me a lot of Nas Reed which is step out space the floor hit some threes get some boards get some steals not as we get more blocks because he's taller  not you Marshall is more wingy so steals a little bit more prevalent sis a little higher than rebounds but they're both in that same kind of like if they're on the floor they're not gonna be bashful he had like one bashful game  they're lost at Indiana he played 28 minutes and he didn't take a shot he didn't have eight boards for assists of Steel and two blocks but lately he's been out there 20 minutes a game he's taking seven shots lately  not even remotely close to enough for Roto  not even remotely close to enough  like if you want to look at use a last two weeks basically since Naji Marshall started decided he wanted to go take a bunch of shots 20 minutes a game seven and a half shots that's the usage rate he's out right now and he's top 150 range  Larry Nance is top 150 range over that stretch on seven and four with one and a half steals that's what he does  so both of those guys are in the mix  for four games the rest of this week  can they keep up the pace they've been on and how much was it impacted by the fact that herb Jones did  miss a ball game in there he's actually missed two of their last three  well that's not true sorry herb just missed the one ball game  have are these numbers slightly inflated because of it I think that's more of the avataro situation  is there an inflation on Larry Nance because Jonas Valen Shootist is been getting run off the floor for two weeks absolutely if JV decides to come out and play better for a game  that'll kill Larry Nance will probably kill Naji Marshall a little bit too although again not so much a center as he is kind of like a big wing  medium wing  feel like we're talking about  snacks here  so what do you do well  it's a lot of work  not all of us I think have the patience for it  but look at your board go to your free agent list  you know you're free agent list better than I do I don't know what the hell yours looks like and look for anybody who's playing three times the rest of the week  and compare them are they significantly better than one of these guys I could pick up on the Pelicans  like let's say we're Sean Holmes is on your wire because he probably is on a bunch he was hurt for a little bit he came back and look all that great they've got three games the rest of the week  it's three games over Sean Holmes at probably a pace of about 10 and 6 with one and a half ish defensive stats  or does he pop off and do much better than that is that better enough to go that direction or on Yoko is another interesting example is he better enough over three games the rest of this week versus like anaji Marshall in four my opinion is it's probably quite close  and while I love to say go get the four gamer and hope that Marshall continues his current Pace because you know does what he's been doing the last two weeks four games would get you 42 points that's pretty good almost 20 about 19 rebounds 10 assists  three steals one block  on good percentages  that's actually pretty good  because Holmes would be about 31 points 18 rebounds pretty close there fewer points fewer assists  fewer steals more blocks would be my guests better feel goal percent  what if you're comparing Rashawn to Larry Nance  what if you could go get Nicole Alexander Walker he's probably floating around on some wires oh probably got picked up for folks that were sort of back to back in it  so again I don't know who's on your way or wire but kind of you know sort by like the last two weeks see who pops up near the top  and roll from there  I'll look at another League of mine let's see who's near the top of the board I don't know could be anybody let's see if there are better enough in a three game week over a pelican and four do we think Jonathan Isaac plays all three of these games this week  I have no idea  niang in three games  hanging three games over in Marshall and four  I mean probably  Bruce Brown's on some wires is he good enough in three versus Nancy or Marshall and four  it's closed  it's a very hard call  so I think what I'd say is if you can get someone that you think is top 100 ish  for those three games you probably go that route  if you're talking about comparing you know Naji Marshall to someone in like the 125 130 range you probably go for the guy who just has an extra ball game  because what if someone on the Pelicans misses a game or two in there what if there's a big old blowout and he gets to go big minutes for a day  which I guess could happen to the other guy you pick up too but  compare and contrast run the numbers  where do you win out  typically you went out on the guy playing the extra ball game  but it's much closer  much closer  in this case because your options are so limited  my good friend Andre is messing with us here on the broadcast shake my fist Andre is a  the director of operations actually here at sports ethos he's one of the most amazing humans I've ever met and he's torturing me  but I'm going to blow him a kiss on are he writes hey Dan I'm in the finals of a very competitive league do you think I should drop by Isaiah Stewart or wait for an update and the reason he posts this and I'm gonna let you guys behind the curtain is because  that is my team he's talking about and he and I are playing each other in the finals of a league I have Isaiah Stewart and I need to know if I should go get it a pelican or something like that  Andre  all right let's see what else we got in the chat room scoot or kispert  points League give me give me kissper because the Wizards are missing a bunch of dudes  just says let's go I was new from Twitter awesome welcome over to the YouTube side it's a lot easier over here the chat room is easier to operate you can watch the show after the fact super duper  should I keep Isaiah hartenstein for streaming  two gamer of hardenstein versus four of somebody  I mean harsh tonight has a shot actually in two games to beat these four game dudes in rebounds  and maybe assists and possibly defensive stats like it's it's tighter than it should be  but like two of them against four of Nancy I mean you probably go with the four and just hope that you get one decent one out of Nancy in there because look hard shines minutes cap is a little bit higher but still not massive  Gary Trent or Chris Paul rest of this week  Warriors  yeah three games for each of them  I'm gonna go Trent on that one  hey Dan I'm moving on from Nick Richards and Vasily a mitsuchi after tonight but even so got dropped last Sunday I have first dibs on the waiver is it worth burning that third ad on Dante  or should I save it well so after tonight  you'd get two Nicks games versus one hornet if you're in a if you're in a desperate battle for a playoff spot I'm probably would look at somebody with three games after today but Dante is good enough that in two games he might be able to beat a three gamer and again it depends on who's on the waiver wire so this is sort of that same thing like if the guy in the waiver wire is a 100 to 125 range guy three games of that is probably better than two games of even shenzo but if the guy you're picking up is like a 150 range guy you probably go Dante in that spot so again it has to do with who you're comparing them to  is Herb Jones worth the pickup for a 12 team he's very Hit or Miss yeah if you're streaming and herb is on the wire hell yes because four games out of herb is a massive Difference Maker I mean you could get 10 steals out of him in four games not saying you will but you could  is champagne a pickup over Thai bowl or Paul Reed well I will left yesterday's game so there's no telling whether he's even gonna play the rest of this week so yes on that front because at least you're then going to get a guy who's like upright over Paul Reed I'd say no keep Reed  his minutes aren't great but he's healthy and he's got three games left so you're not even gaining a game in that instance uh but over thigh bull I'd say um yes but if champagne is really the best pickup over Diboll I I'd say hit your waiver wire a little bit harder see if somebody else is floating around that you could use that that might be a little bit more useful  all right everybody let's keep rolling win the weak win the week that's how we're doing it here follow on

last question here Joseph sneaks it in at the end is key on Alice a pickup in 16 teams yes absolutely he's frankly almost to pick up in 12 team or because Kevin heard her went down they don't play tonight but they do have three games to rest of the week if you could hold off until tomorrow and drop somebody that has a bad schedule after today that would be the optimal move for head to head for Rodeo if you're picking up Ellis you're sort of your your hunting defensive stats hard but it does seem like he could be good enough to make to be a difference-maker in those categories all right everybody have a wonderful day back with two shows again tomorrow I'm trying to do it until the end of the season  have a great one we'll see you guys over on social media  and like rate subscribe all
