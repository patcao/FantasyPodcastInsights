welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I don't know how some way we're managing to fit in all the shows that I  I don't say promised but hoped to do this week it's sell a high time here on fantasy NBA today  another bonus episode here on this lovely Wednesday afternoon I am Dan best briefs at Dan best person over on social media and this is of course a sports ethos presentation I've got three more names for you to try to sell high on this week we'll also take a look back at what happened with some of our names from last week  trying to do more of that mostly it's I'd like to say it's like a transparency thing but mostly it's just that  it's helpful for me to remember what I've done so saving copies of the previous file here's the reason that it didn't happen earlier in the season I don't want to go back and re-watch my previous show and I was writing over the PowerPoint presentation so I wasn't able to just quickly access it now like you know a functioning adult I just saved one each for sale and buy PowerPoint deals and so it's really easy for me to go back and see what we did last week anyway um quick note here and I keep remembering to say this at the end of the show but I'm gonna try to get into the habit of saying it at the beginning now if you're watching Youtube has a really easy commenting button I know many of you like to use the live chat during the show but that shuts down when the show is over so please use the YouTube comments box I get email alerts when those come in at some point during the day or night or the following day I get to them  I'm trying to do all of them I can't promise all but generally all so if you have comments maybe players you have questions about on the buy or sell side that's the place to put it the comments not the live chat on this one please do take a moment to like rate subscribe all that good stuff and now we can oh and come hang out with us over on the sports ethos Discord it is free the link is in the show description and we will see you over there um let's Embark Upon Our cell discussion for the week I  again I you know I I think it it makes sense to do a quick look at what was going on previously just to kind of see  whether there was any result yet and  you know it doesn't always happen super fast but we've had a couple of small results so far last week we had Donovan Mitchell CJ McCollum and Vogue zdanowicz on the list  Donovan Mitchell has been outside the top 25 the last couple of weeks it's not  Stark and immediate impact kind of thing but over time that is going to sort of slowly squeeze him in a particular direction and he'll have some Giant games mixed in that'll kind of move him back and it's not going to be this linear process first bite of but as we said last week he was at up at 6:00 steals in particular was just higher than it was ever meant to be and as that stuff starts to come back down to earth the him I think the free throw percent was also really high the expectation for me was that he'd kind of slide back where he was drafted which was mid-second round still good still very very good but not mid first round and he has slid three spots not enough I think for people to really notice that anything was different but we did right those of us that dig in there and look at it at a more microscopic level so see if you can still pull off the same stuff CJ McCollum they didn't play much last week Lakers blitzed them he moved down three spots from 15 to 18 which again not very much these are small things but this is the guy that's probably gonna run more in that like 40 to 75 range depending on how things shake out for CJ I don't think that this Steals and blocks were going to stay as high as they were and again so you still have an opportunity there and then Bogdan bogdanovich actually had a really good week because Trey young got ejected and missed a game with an illness so you might have even be able to sell him for higher than what we were talking about he kind of went the opposite direction not that like I mean you know Trey young being out very helpful pretty easy thing to see there if obviously if we had known that work was coming we'd say wait and sell him after the guy that takes all the shots as missing for a game or two but there was sort of no way to know that that was coming and so that is where things left off from last week I still think you can probably sell very high on Donovan Mitchell I still think you can sell real high on McCallum and Bogdan wasn't necessarily about the production it was about his bulky knee  and it's still hanging in there so again the longer you hold onto it I think we said this last week too the longer that you hold on to him and let this play out the more you can get back because there's this sort of like these curves that meet which is like perception versus what's actually happening and so for Bogdan he's been like kind of floating along at that 50 clip but the perception of what he is started at like 100 and every two weeks people like oh maybe he's like a top 80 and now people like oh maybe he's like a top 60 uh and every couple of weeks the the belief becomes stronger and the value you can get back gets closer and closer to what their actual rank currently is  and then so you're able to  juxtapose that against where you think they're headed and that's where you can create these these little pockets of value  first name on the list for this week is Terry Rozier and I'll preface this week by saying that the names are  I don't say obvious but a little obvious now  we're far enough into the season where I'm not gonna be displaying on the screen what players are doing for the whole year because now you're going to be selling and buying guys based on what they've done for  you know maybe like a four week span leading up to a certain thing and enough time where people are like oh this is interesting this might be a real thing but not the entire season because some of these guys may have started more slowly Rozier being a good example of that but he's been destroying lamelo ball being out a very large part of it but on top of that it's just massive massive numbers he's taking 19 shots of game over the last two weeks he's averaging 25 points three boards nine and a half assists a steal over three three-pointers 87% medium volume free-throw shooter and it puts him inside the top 25 he's been a second rounder for the last month now actually which is fun because he's only been back for like two and a half weeks of that month but still  and here's the thing you know we've seen Rozier put up solid 40 range numbers for a season before it was really only I think two seasons ago that he was number 30 in nine cat on 19 points four and a half assists three threes 1.3 steals 44 and a half and 85 splits those exact same numbers this year would not have him at 30  just because everybody is gone full pinball mode in the NBA but that's 40 range numbers I don't know and I know the folks that are watching and reading along you can see that I said you should sell high for top 50 of possible  because I don't think you're going to get 40 back for him right now  and I don't know that you ever will unless he continues to go top 40 even after lamelo ball comes back so here's what your decision is it's a little bit of a role of the dice either way if you want to sell Rosie or now  you could probably convince somebody to give you like a 50 to 65 range guy back depending on how exciting they are and how big their name is that might be attainable guys between 50 and 65 that have maybe not quite as big of a name but have been running cooler than Rozier would be like a Freddy van Fleet Jalen Brunson Nicolas vus up to number 57 now by the way guys a couple of good ball games and said he is back in front of his 80P I don't think you're gonna be able to get JJ with the way he's been playing lately but it's certainly worth the look dimar is in there I don't know that these guys necessarily beat Rozier the rest of the way but they're probably a good bet to run kind of even with him and have a much safer floor because we saw last year the field goal percent really bought him out for Terry he struggled a hard with turnovers when lamelo was out  we also haven't really seen this Charlotte team healthy what is rosieres role going to be when everybody's there at the same time including miles Bridges including lamelo ball including Gordon Hayward including Brandon Miller can he stay near 40 or is he gonna tip back into the 65 75 range  I don't think he's enough to get you guys that are above  50 even 55 is is questionable but these guys that sort of quietly Dink and dunk along with really good numbers those are guys you might be able to Target back now someone's like oh I'll give you you know  you drew holiday or D'Angelo Russell or something like that I think you probably just stick it out with Rosier and kind of see what happens because you're trying to lock in you're trying to lock in a big time contributor not a not a decent contributor because those guys are still decent you're locking your aiming for you'll like a pretty good sock coming back  and it's possible that it doesn't happen  and that's kind of the other role of the dice because if you think Terry Rozier has a shot to run top 40 top 50 even after lamelo ball comes back then you hang on until lamelo returns you enjoy this you know very this beastly running on right now  see what happens when lamelo's around if he falls off a cliff well you missed your chance to sell high you're not gonna get anybody inside the top 60 at that point you're gonna be kind of stuck with it if he continues to play even pretty well and I would say if if rosier's role in like 60 65 even for a couple of weeks after lamelo comes back the beauty is people look at his last month's numbers they'll still show 35 45 something like that because of the big run when ball wasn't there and you might still be able to move him for someone ranked pretty close to where he ended up and then you also avoid the possibility that Rozier Falls all the way back down where he spent a bunch of time last year  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying

beginning of the season but we'll do our best to try to talk through them  next name on the list is shaedon Sharpe and this is the I think actually think this one's probably an easier one to pull off which  maybe I'm wrong about that but most of what I've seen on shaedon Sharpe is that people were already higher on him then they should have been because it's field goal percent was basically annihilating team so when you combine that with turnovers he became a guy that was ranked  much lower than people realized and because so many teams in had punt field goal and punt turn over is it become the most fashionable punt meaning everybody's doing it so it's actually not that useful anymore now you're competing against everybody else doing the same thing as you  this is a guy that people were thinking oh this guy's like saving my team and he was ranked you know 14500 and 50 the Blazers have been so banged up lately that sharp has had no  choice basically but to play a lunatic number of minutes he's averaging 37 minutes by the way on the season right now over the past two weeks shaedon Sharpe is playing 39 and a half minutes per ball game that's good enough for fourth most in the NBA behind Luka doncic Kobe white and Damian Lillard  and then shaedon Sharpe  and that's just because the Blazers have nobody left right now Malcolm brogden's out Jeremy Grant is out DeAndre Aiden is out  I know scoot came back but he was out for a little bit over this stretch that Sharp's been able to ramp things up  and his numbers have been really good because it happened to coincide this this crazy high usage run for Sharp As actually coincided with a shooting  heater  Jaden's fire and 53% over those last two weeks so he's staying at 17 shots a game he's actually turned himself over that short span into a field goal percent positive so he's averaging 26 points for three pointers six and a half rebounds five assists a steal on 5381 splits but we saw enough of sharp over the course of the season to understand that that doesn't actually add up this is a 42 and a half percent shooter for the year he was taking 15 shots a game for the full season more like 14 before everybody went out  and in those games he was again more like top one forty  the nice thing about the shade and sharp sell high is that first of all you're not gonna get a top 25 guy back I know he's been number 22 over the last two weeks but that's not how you do this thing the nice thing about Jayden Sharpe is that people were already excited about him because of those very popular counting stats like points and rebounds and assists and threes and people are more than willing to overlook the you know poor field goal percent poor turnovers no blocks that kind of stuff it's easy those things are easy to just not look at  so even when he was rolling at that 130 clip you probably could have sold him for a top 100 play  now he's running Ultra hot and people are aware that that a lot of that is because guys are out but I don't think that they actually care as much as they should  because as this team gets healthy and don't get me wrong Sharp's gonna still play a bunch of stuff but he's not gonna be the orchestrator he was one of these guys are out specifically Malcolm Brogden being out he's not going to get as many near the rim things when DeAndre Aiden comes back he's not gonna be his spend as many minutes as power forward when Jeremy Grant comes back the front court is missing right now for the Blazers so everything is falling on Sharp and it's been wonderful because he's just piling up statistics at the moment  but it's not sustainable  and I think you could get a top 60 playback because of these giant counting stats  it's not going to be a big name top 60 guy we just talked about this on the Terry Rozier sell but you might be able to aim for somebody like a Franz Wagner who's right around 60 Michael Porter Jr not a big name right around 60 Daniel gaffer if you wanted to go nine cat heavy you know low turnover guy who's gonna boost you in boards blocks and field goal percent that would probably happen Mark Williams similar fantasy profile will get it done Jonas Fallon shooting us to I admit I was too low on his blocks are better this year did not see that one coming  seems like he's a pretty safe bet to stay inside the top 75 right now  if you go farther down the board you could probably get a Clint capela  you could probably get a Derek Lively I like all of these guys believe it or not and that's again this is a nine cat discussion so if you're hunting turnovers and perhaps some of these big guys are not as alluring you might be able to make a trade for an injured Zach LaVine if somebody thinks he's really gonna sit out the full month maybe he doesn't maybe gets traded a Chris Paul right now is about to go on a hot run Drew holidays down in that range D-Lo Jalen Williams we've had on a Bi-Lo board for weeks even while he's climbing he's like 30 ranks Lots up already there's a crap ton of names you could look at with Shaden Sharps Point scoring lately and I think you've actually got a better than zero chance of getting some of these guys even if their names might be a little bit bigger they're just not scoring the same way  folks  For Better or Worse that time of year again  holiday time  classic Christmas movies are on all the time Thanksgiving parades rom-coms  and anybody else sick of it already  I mean I don't mind the fact that my kids are pretty excited about the toys and stuff but everything else is just so much

expressvpn.com slash hoop ball that's right h w o p b a l l go there right now and you can get an extra three months of expressvpn for free that is expressvpn.com slash hoop ball expressvpn.com slash hoop ball go there now to learn more about one of our fantastic partners  we got one more Bi-Lo on the list and in honorable mention maybe I should have told you that maybe it should have been a surprise  and that is Shane Sharp's teammate Anthony Simons who I promised I would talk about on this afternoon show because he got asked about on our morning show  since coming back from injury Anfernee Simons played just a handful of games I think it's three and he's number 29 in those games extremely limited samples size  if you could sell high and get a top 40 play I would do it  I don't know that I that you can which obviously makes it harder because again people are gonna look at it and say small sample size  but what we're trying to do here is locking value  there's nothing that's a sure thing in this universe nothing could ever see Simon's keep up this pace all season long I mean anything is possible but he's also taking 21 shots a game and as it happens three of the four games he's played this year have come with almost all of the other usage guys in the Blazers out besides the player we just talked about in shade and sharp  no Brogden no eating no Jeremy Grant  so sure Simon Says taking 21 shots a game and six free throws over this stretch  he's also made every free throw he's taken so far  okay I mean he's not gonna go 25 for 25 at the foul line all season long even if you just taper that off to 90% he falls considerably not like forever but a fair amount  start to peel off some of the usage 21 shots down to 1918 something like that  that's how you see this thing start to taper  but there's more to the Anfernee Simons story then just an easy sell high it's not that easy actually man obviously he's not gonna go roll top 20 all season long  but there is this whole battle that takes place all the time between whether you can actually move him for a player coming back that's worthwhile and this comes down a little bit to what we all think is going to happen so  do I think there's a chance that he could roll top 50 all season I actually think that he could potentially do I think it's probable  I'd say no  he was sitting right around the edge of the top 50 last year when Damian Lillard is out but it's also worth noting that there was really only one other guy on the team that was taking shots at that point and that was the aforementioned Jeremy Grant was like Jeremy Grant Anthony Simon's and then  who the hell knows nobody else was really willing to do much of anything during that was only like a two or three weeks band that Dame sat out but we got a pretty good look at it this year there are guys to take more of that stuff  and if that was last year top 50 when he was basically the only man standing if we assume that this team starts to get healthy at some point it sounds like eight and bragged in our very close and Grant is a little bit farther away with his concussion  we're gonna get a look at this pretty soon  so if you can find someone out there who's like oh you know what I've seen every time I know he's not gonna be doing this much all season long but I still think he's gonna be top 40 top 50 I think you probably do it and the reason why is a math game  there is a chance he rolls top 50 all-season long there's almost no chance he rolls top 30 all season long  there is also a chance he drops down into the 60s or the 70s we don't know for sure  but if you can bring someone back who we know bottoms out at about 55 you're locking in safety that's what this possible move is  I don't have any issue if you all want to just see what happens on Simon's he's been crazy since coming back anybody that takes this many shots and this many threes and free throws  I get it there's a there's a certain joy in just seeing what a player like that can be  but if you want to run the safe route  take the check down basically lock in some value maybe you give up a little bit of upside but you lock it in before any sort of downturn possibly hits  that's the way you do it on this type of play  I think it's the targets are actually somewhat similar to Terry Rozier we talked about earlier in the show you know you're aiming for guys that maybe don't have the world's biggest names between like 40 and 65  and see what you can pull back  can you pull back a Freddie Van Vliet  questionable could you pull back a Jalen Brunson I doubt it  could you pull back a vooch maybe I might do that  could you buy low on JJJ probably not anymore again kind of repeating myself talking in Loops here  could you go higher  a questionable  and then Yahoo obviously has the ranks just a little bit different but look at the guys on whatever website you're using look at where they're ranked I'm just looking at the BBM ones right now and look for somebody who you think is just perfectly locked in at like rank 55 and they're just not going anywhere  and see if that person whoever rosters them is thinking you know what maybe I'll take a shot maybe I'll give up this sherbet who is not super exciting but he's yeah that they're good they're fine they're there  take a shot that Anthony Simon's is just the tiniest bit better  and they might be right  but you know what I still don't think you'd classify that as losing your your trade because you're just locking it in you're putting it in a safe deposit box and you're calling it today we have one more honorable mention it's Kobe white and I had to throw them in there because he's running you know like mid-second round pick over the last two weeks  the reason that he doesn't get his own page he's actually a first rounder over the last two weeks so apologies but he's shooting 51% from the field  on 17 shots per game and he's making over five three-pointers at night right now  he's always been a good free throw shooter that's never been a problem for white is six assists are probably repeatable here as long as Zach LaVine right remains out but the 51% and 5 3 pointers and 26 points per game this is all stuff he's all by the way playing 40 minutes a night none of this stuff can actually stick long term if he plays that many minutes every ball game he's gonna get hurt at some point the field goal percent is going to level off and it's going to be unpleasant because a career 4243 percent guy you guys can do the math if he's shooting 8% over that for six to 10 games he's probably gonna shoot eight ish percent under that for six to 10 games or worse for a shorter period or not quite as bad for a longer period you know maybe 40% for like 15 games instead of 35% for six or something like that so the math is going to work its way through eventually  but the reason he's an honorable mention isn't because there's a pretty obvious sell High going on it's because it's actually too obvious of a cell High because Kobe white kicked his crap into high gear when Zach LaVine got shut down  and everybody can see these shooting numbers are not sustainable so if you're like hey man I'll give you Kobe white the person on the other end of your trades gonna be like Aha and how are you valuing him well  that's the question what is he if the Bulls trade Zach LaVine and get someone back that could take some of that new situation  let's for argument's sake say that the usage doesn't take that big of a hit and we're just accounting for the regression in percentages it's important I think the point out that Kobe white remember this was a guy who was outside the top one 60 for most of the Season until the Zach LaVine stuff happened whatever it was two and a half three weeks ago  that's why overall on the year now he's number 77 despite being number 12 for the last two weeks  the two and a half three weeks on has yanked his rank up the board from 160 to 180 range that's where he was all the way to 80  he's rocketing they're very few players that have moved up the board this quickly  he could be if the Bulls  just keep Zach LaVine shut down indefinitely maybe they don't trade him for a while or they do trade him and they mostly get picks back or something that's not interfering with what Kobe's doing  he could run at a top 670 clip with the extra usage that's always been the issue is that there wasn't enough to do in his Fantasy game didn't support it because he was mostly points threes and free throw percent but he wasn't doing enough in any of those things to matter  now he's doing enough in all three of them to matter and he's basically a point guard so there's been this uptick in all the stuff  I have no idea what you could get back for Kobe white that's another reason he's an honorable mention maybe you get like could you get a top 50 guy back I highly doubt it  so it's hot I would say actually the best move right now is just how see this through see how long he can stay ridiculously hot at some point he's gonna cool off  but I feel like you're gonna get more out of it by just riding out the hot streak as to being like hey I'll give you Kobe white and something be like yeah okay I'll give you a top 80 guy back  do you win over like a three-month span Maybe  but your teams might be better off just having a guy going in this crazy you know first second third round run for a couple of weeks  head-to-head or Rodeo  Roto you bank it for the year head-to-head maybe he helps you win the next two or three weeks in a row and the guy you would have traded him for maybe that guy beats him by totals the rest of the season but that doesn't actually equate to better situational value  so yeah he's an obvious sell high and if you can get somebody in the top 50 you do it  but I don't think you're going to be able to do it and that's why he doesn't get his own real slide  let me close that out I think we have one  Buy Low sell High question just an asks how does Pearl look rest of season is bogged on a cell hi yes Bogdan which is a cell High yakka turtle is I think pretty well level off now you got off to a very slow start went on a kind of a hot run now he's just sort of bouncing back and forth between like 70 and 95 and that's probably where he ends up I think there's a chance he could push a little higher than that if another decent stretch comes along or if it's free throw works up from 49% into say the mid like the high 50s and stead that would be a good way for him to move 1520 Slots of ranks but the steals the blocks the field goal percent the boards all that stuff seems to have sort of  kind of leveled again the great leveling the great settling whatever we want to call it  and I would treat yakka portal as kind of a 75 range guy going forward so not really a Buy Low or a sell high right now and that I think answers the one Buy Low sell High question the chat room otherwise has none Buy Low sell highs folks if you have buyers sell High questions throw them into the comments on the YouTube Pages goes for anybody listening or watching if you're listening to the Pod you have a comment go over to the YouTube page just toss it in there I don't tend to see everything that people ask me on social media but you know that's all so away you could try it dropping into Discord is another decent way to do it if you have a premium membership that's the best way to get a hold of me over there again at Dan best person on social media Discord link is in the show description and the comments section for the show I think should pop up basically as soon as I hit end stream which is coming here momentarily Alec by the way asked his who's my cell High he's been my on my cell High board basically since the second week of the year and people keep yelling at me about it Dan he's not a sell High he's not a sell High you say as he goes from ranked 49 to 96 over the last month  it was an obvious one because his percentages weren't even in the vicinity of where they've been throughout his entire career over the last month he's number one hundred and fifteen on 235 and 5 I know the counting stats look good but no defensive stats negatives and turnovers free throw field goal blocks steals  okay  that's what happens I know the 23 points per game is very very attractive  and the five and a half assists out of a power forward attractive I get it  had to headley's he makes more sense because you're punting blocks he makes sense as a power forward the punch blocks your punching free throws he's useful there actually finding field goal he even makes more sense because he's a power forward that's a field goal negative guy I get it I get it but nine cat he was on his way down we knew it  because he was shooting over his head from everywhere  and it's now starting to Let's the term we just use level off  thanks for watching Everybody again shout out to
