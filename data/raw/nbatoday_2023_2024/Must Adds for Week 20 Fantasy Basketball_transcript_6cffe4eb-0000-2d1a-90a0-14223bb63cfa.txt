welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right Fantasy Playoff time for a lot of folks  Clear My Throat at the beginning of the show I was apparently not ready to start talking yet  ready now though maybe  this is fantasy NBA today you guys probably know that already I'm your host Dan Bass Pro it's Monday beginning of week 2 0  they don't start their playoffs for like three more weeks which is flat out idiotic but  it is so  we deal with that as we deal with it click up a preview of what's coming up today as we get rolling here obviously this show will largely be a weekend recap we're gonna go through each team's most recent ball game get you situated for the week ahead what players emerged from the weekend as guys that absolutely positively need to be on rosters who perhaps doesn't begin injury news stuff like that and much like Friday I'm playing on having a second show early this afternoon preferably right after lunchtime if I can get to it quickly and we'll break down the week ahead from a streaming standpoint and if all goes well we'll be able to do that tomorrow Wednesday and Thursday I think Friday might only be a one show day just based on pretty sure I gotta get out of here by like lunchtime but my goal in all that is to give you guys your best streaming opportunities as you hit the playoffs or if you're fighting for a playoff spot but this way we don't have to just cram it in you know four minutes at the end of this the recap show the sort of fantasy talk about all the names kind of thing so that's the plan for the next few days we'll sort of try to keep it cruising along as long as we can again I'm not gonna be able to hit every day it'll be my goal is like 80% or higher hit rate on weekdays for some streaming thoughts but I'll also try to get some stuff out on social as well I'm at in best person for on Twitter d a n b e s b r i s this of course is a sports presentation  and quick shout out to our baseball guys the baseball draft guide available now in the baseball fan fantasy pass that's just six dollars a month same as the basketball rate and first of all you can get that over at sports ethos.com I've got a link in the show

lowest price the All Sport will ever be and also based on expectations here internally the NBA pass next season is going to be seven dollars so you can get the all-sport now and keep that price forever as long as you just keep it turned on  so pretty awesome deal on that front definitely go check out the work those baseball guys are doing and it sounds like the Oracle 250 top 250 baseball names is dropping today in that guide so that's awesome as well  let's get through the game Sunday Saturday and then there are a few teams that didn't go over the weekend this time around or more than usual so expect us to dig in a little bit on Friday so far as yesterday goes Philly beat Dallas there's a wildlife 6 is actually Trail this game 11 to nothing to start the ball game and then opened up a double digit lead at one point and kind of held it for a while  the news over the weekend for the Sixers is that Mo Bamba slid into the starting lineup but Paul Reed is actually still played the majority of the center minutes in these last two ball games he's looked better doing it frankly so they've won their games Phillies won their last two games one of them was against a sort of a pastry team but Dallas is a reasonable opponent and my guess would be that they continue to do it so Bamba will probably start but as minutes haven't changed that much Paul reads minutes also believe it or not I haven't changed all that much he just able to function better with them playing in different second units against seconds string guys so hold on to Paul Reed you're not adding nuclear tomb very nice ballgame for him but we know his body hasn't gone 30 minutes a night so read  Maxi Harris ubreak heeled as a hold I know he's cool off a bit we sort of always knew he would and then Kyle Lowry is kind of the guy you're keeping us side eye on because he's had a lot of assists his last two ballgames he might very well play his way into a roster spot don't completely don't just write off Lowry because it's Kyle Lowry  like he's not that far away from being a useful fantasy player he's a tough add  not actually that's not true because I think they got I think they go four times this week I think it's five six eight and ten if I'm not mistaken he is not particularly heavily rostered these days because he wasn't doing very much with Miami but he's acclimated here to Philly the Anthony Melton is out for we don't know how long and in his last two ballgames Lawry's played 69 minutes and has four three-pointers is averaging about know 11 ish points per ballgame 11 and change five boards and eight and a half assists over that stretch  which is nothing to shake a stick I know we're talking about a NBA starting point guard right now who's main job is gonna be to get the ball to Maxie to Harris to ubreak whoever doesn't have to worry too much about his own scoring but look he's gonna take nine shots that's actually probably enough for him to have top 100 value  I don't know if it sticks shooting percentage is going to hurt you but  I would say he'd be shortsighted for us to not at least consider Kyle Lowry at this stage of the game  and the nice part is I think a lot of people are just sort of not considering him because he's Kyle Lowry and  that's fine it's just sort of a different thing in Philly than he had in Miami even if the minutes are not all that different in Miami he was at eight points and four assists in 28 minutes a game and Phillies at eight points and six assists in 28 minutes a game  and maybe you get last year's Kyle Lowry which again it's always fairly beat up but he was 11/4 and 5 with a steal in two three-pointers in Miami last year and that was by all accounts enough to be kind of a fringe level  starting caliber fantasy player  he was like number one 15 last season  not like I wouldn't put it past him  he could very easily get back to 15 here  before embed comes around obviously is bodies get warmer than you know easier to pick up Larry and stick him on a bench on the Roto side because you know he's gonna miss ball game will play in their upcoming back to back my guess honestly is yes I don't think Phillies that worry about Lowry's body health I think they just need him to cover games do whatever you can until you fall apart and hopefully they their internal thought would be like hopefully beat is closer to coming back but Philly is a really good schedule this week starting Tuesday that would be a lovely time to deploy on the head to head side  am I gonna outright add him and cut someone to Value no special not with the other guys that popped up over the weekend but if you missed out on those guys I don't think Larry is that bad of an alternate option here because the city everybody's always hunting a cysts a bad news out of Dallas the center situation is just untenable at this point Maxi Cleaver was back he Derek Lively Daniel Gafford were all terrible in this game not one of them even came remotely close to Fantasy value so you just kind of have to move on you're not adding Derek Jones junior he made five three-pointers that's not a thing that's gonna stick every ball game so right now Luka and Kyrie are kind of the only nine cat guys you can play for the paths and then PJ Washington is probably kind of borderline points League  useful nine cat he'll have a couple decent games and then he'll fall apart  Boston smoked Golden State by 52  yucky Moses Moody is getting some starts here with Andrew Wiggins and Brandon ski out I mean I don't think you really need to take a big old Moses Moody Plunge  plus the Warriors are off today and tomorrow and they go back to back Wednesday Thursday if you find out somehow that Wiggins and pods are still out for those then yeah you could use Moody on the back-to-back but this is not a guy you're gonna try to get out in front of for any reason so  let's keep going this game requires none zeroes of our attention  Clippers beat Minnesota 89.88 yeah I know reps are calling as many fouls right now they're sort of they decided they're not calling the Tikki Tech stuff anymore getting ready for the playoffs six weeks early Norman Powell was kind of the first winner here with no Russell Westbrook who broke his hand over the weekend  he's out indefinitely  as I told you guys Terence man he does these you know two week heaters and then all of a sudden it kind of disappears The  the winner on just like getting to do more in this was Powell  but also a little bit extra a mere coffee you're not going down that rabbit hole either zubats by the way just  he was getting roasted so they went to Daniel theis instead which I don't think is a permanent thing zoo is like your prototypical plotting third string Center so he belongs on some rosters he belong he doesn't belong on others it's really about fit he's in the doesn't matter club we can have it yay that's actually fun you know what I'm gonna do that on the fly so I don't forget to do it later we are adding pizzas zubats to the doesn't matter Club  while we sit make sure I spell it right on my page here wow we talked on are we have a new member mostly you've got Paul George Kawaii James Harden and then keep an eye on Norman storm and Norman at it's 6 3 pointers and he didn't really do anything else besides three score efficiently  and that's fine but we'd be nice if there was like a rebound and assist any kind of consistent defensive stats  he's a tough one I don't think I'm adding Norman Powell  over on the Timberwolf side the general like guys came back that's the short version at the Edwards was questionable he played slo-mo was questionable but he saw her to played sounds like he may or may not be good for the next one  the what we talked about at the end of last week was  yes I spilled water all over my face if you guys saw that happening live on air  nice work Dan  I have what do an airplane bit here have a drinking problem  if slo-mo misses the next ball game you guys are just gonna watch me do this podcast wet now if slo-mo misses the next one that Nas Reed would move back into a starting valuation but as long as everybody is in all of the main cars then Nas goes back to the fantasy bench  Mike Conley has cooled off a lot of late he'll be fine yeah guys go through slumps  he'll be fine hold on to him Detroit they were able to hang in there for one half of basketball against Orlando and then the ceiling caved in see you might have fontecchio had 15 points in 33 bench minutes schedule play Evan Fournier 17 points in 26 bench minutes also probably sort of teetering on a schedule Play Zone you're not adding those guys and unless Detroit has a you know particularly strong run coming up and they don't really not until at least next week so and Roto standpoint none of those guys matter Roto the only guys you can play on this team are Cade Duran and probably Oz our Thompson right now who's kind of ratcheted it back up you can see he's got a little more pep in his step  he's got the sort of  Unleashed so to speak that is not that he's gonna be like a monster but he's not getting yanked around here anymore and you know maybe I'm sure they'll be a game in there where he does get yanked around but by and large he's just gonna play starters minutes now and I think that'll be good for his psyche so Thompson Kane Duran those are the guys you trust on Detroit in sort of an all formats deal and then you've got a host like Jayden Ivy is a points League type of guy Isaiah Stewart Evan Fournier we just talked about those guys are more scheduling on the Orlando side we got a big one out of window Carter Jr it was extraordinarily efficient he shot 547 from the field and seven for seven at the free-throw line that's just not gonna happen every day this is the joys of playing against a very bad Detroit Pistons team and so for the magic Franz Wagner continues to basically be the only guy you can trust in nine cat day to day  Gary Harris should he actually get consistent minutes would probably be the next one  which tells you that this is just not a team built for nine cat fantasy  Paulo is a points League darling  Wendell Carter Junior is more points League he had some defensive stats here but he doesn't usually get them false and do a much enough day to day his body doesn't handle it Suggs is all so sort of borderline but typically the field goal percent weighs him down just leave him alone  I promise your life will be easier if you just leave him alone  no Nick Richards for the Charlotte Hornets so Grant Williams now slid up and played small ball Center and it was sweetie 13 rebounds and if that happens again then Grant Williams is very much in all systems go he didn't take any three pointers or sorry he didn't hit any three-pointers in this game is probably what I should say which had kind of been his only fantasy note when I pick up Grant Williams not knowing if he's gonna get the next start at Center I would not they played tomorrow and they're off for two days so it's not a great spot for head-to-head if you wanted to sort of pre at him on Roto and see oh well Nick Richards missed another ballgame  okay whatever that's fine Trey man I did tell you guys to sell High when you could these will be the quieter ones he's having a week or two of quiet and then we'll have a big game or two and it'll be quiet again and  back and forth that goes vasilia meets each 12 and 6 with a couple of steals off as a start in this ball game keep an eye on that at the very least I and I don't know that it's gonna be an everyday thing but if suddenly he's playing 35 minutes then he'd be an ad like maybe an easy one I need to see it again guys are kind of in and out of the lineup here for Charlotte they've they're shifting bodies around I mean Davis played 26 minutes which I don't think we can expect to happen but Mitzi just the one that you're  I think maybe more intrigued by Grant Williams as well there was no Seth Curry all so in this one just for whatever that's where so they were down a few more bodies but yeah I mean starting level minutes for us CDA is absolutely worth a play in Fantasy for the assists for the steals for this sort of various stuffs and then you just kind of have to hope that efficiency doesn't jump up and bite  Toronto meanwhile lost another player to injury yakka pedal suffered a sprained finger sorry dislocated finger I should say he left at halftime Kelly Olynyk only got eight first half minutes after playing big minutes in the previous ball game and then he played 18 in the second half and they just they have nobody else at this point so as much as Toronto was trying to keep Olynyk shrink wrapped a little bit he's gonna play and he'll be one of my favorite plays for as long as Turtles out and possibly even after he comes back  Gary Trent also stepping up in a big big way with no Scotty Barnes his shots are gonna go up he's usage basically is going to go up so Gary Trent absolutely belongs on fantasy roster is he is an ad in every format right now and yeah injury replacement stuff but I mean Scotty Barnes we might not see him for a month  so Olynyk and Trent both in my opinion belong on rosters go heavy go hard get him on your team those are two of the bigger names to take away from today's show the next lost Jalen Brunson one minute into this ball game it looked bad they haven't said anything more than me soreness right now which I mean I don't know that I believe that to be true  let's hope it is on the Brunson front Deuce McBride is your streaming fill in he'll be solid Nicks I what are the next schedule look like this week  yeah bad they go one time over the next four days and it's two consecutive three game week so kind of hard to add McBride for the entire week even though he's gonna put up some decent numbers Roto you could probably stream him and if you want to go ahead to head you'd probably do it on Friday because at least then you get Friday Sundays or two games the last three days of the week and might add a game to your Ledger but you certainly can't move to him now and head to head and then Boy by keeping an eye on that pressure is minutes were down in this ball game his production was nice but they decided they need a little more scoring out there for a day and so boy on was that  even still I mean this is the kind of game it's going to take to even get him to the top 100 so you're not adding it you're holding pressure Josh our triple-double Donte divincenzo continues to go nuts and then Isaiah hardenstein is the other one you know  I think you just kind of have to bench him  head-to-head you play him you hope for the best  take another sip without pouring it all over myself Roto I don't know I mean I know this was a better ball game he almost went slot machine style 87 and 8 with a couple of blocks  but if he's only getting 2324 minutes because of his sore achilles I just I don't know how you use him against your games cap right now but I also don't know how you drop him  because he suddenly starts to feel better and the minutes tick back up into the high 70s or low 30s I mean you saw I really this year's a top 40 play and starters minutes  Mitchell Robinson might be coming back later this month we still don't know  so I think you got a hold somehow  on heart and shine  Cavaliers were once again without Donovan Mitchell and without Charis liver Darius Garland was unable to do carry it himself enough samarel hit 73 pointers we've seen him go crazy when when a bunch of guys are down for the Cavs he'd be a pretty intriguing threes streamer  and Cleveland has a pretty good schedule starting tomorrow problem of course is that Donovan Mitchell and Levert can resurface at any point and then you'd be forced to abandon ship on that one same story for Isaac okoro who's gonna put up numbers in 35 minutes of ball game he just sort of has no choice but to do so  but this like in the era of the long stream if you're trying to stream a bunch of different slots for the playoffs and you picking up a guy you kind of want to know that you're gonna be able to use them for four or six days and if starters come back for this team or I guess we should say us starter but two big usage guys then it pushes everybody around on the totem pole so I'm not using a move on a Cavalier in head-to-head I guess it'd be fine adding a coral  if you needed a wing type of number  against the game's cap  and then Max Drew so we've seen this before he's actually better when the team is at full strength  he's more open  it's opener there in the wide open air Indiana lost at San Antonio my precious Pacers over wager this was supposed to be one that they could just put in the bank it they did not 34 and 28 it doesn't seem like Halliburton is fully healthy which I think is I mean I guess he could just be in a slump but it also  has he been fully healthy since  the injury whatever was month and a half ago or something like that  needless to say Indies gone to sort of backup point guards more lately TJ McConnell's had a number of very good games in a row and you know shout out to TJ because we haven't really been doing our job talking about it but he's been very good of late and the minutes haven't been that big or anything but they've been just a tiny bit bigger to make it worse while  like just the just the littlest amount is all it took  his minutes were you know sometimes he played sometimes he didn't 15 16 17 18 points and the last four games it's 20 1917 and 27 and he's top 60 over those that week and a half  it's gonna come and go it'll fluctuate he's on a very hot run right now but if you badly need assists and Steals on decent field goal percent then you got a possible play with again the caveat Indiana schedule stinks this was another one where you're sort of targeting a particular set of stats more so on road that had to head Benedict Catherine still got 32 minutes here somewhat surprising  I don't know that Andrew nemh I guess is probably the guy you'd point to and say this guy lost out on minutes  Matterhorn is a drop by the way with Aaron Smith back its if you haven't done it already it's just a matter of time neesmith is a very soft hold if you can do it probably a streamable slot in head-to-head given their poor schedule this week but if you can hang on and certainly on the Roto side you should try to  holy crap Victor weapon Yama again everybody's rocking it up a fantasy leaderboard as fast as this dude he's passed Donovan Mitchell now he's just on the rise he's number seven in nine cat  it's crazy  not adding Malachi Branham not adding Jeremy Sohan not adding Kelvin Johnson  barely hanging on Detroit Jones but I think softest of soft holes there and so you basically going Webby and vessel and then maybe trade Jones  this is the bi-weekly Lou Dort slightly better ball game you can ignore that Shea monster Jalen Williams monster no notes on OKC we don't have to talk about them 31 rebounds for Yusef that's notable his team lost but he was a plus 10 and a game they lost by eight that is not good news if you're bulb or Drew Eubanks basically like look we can't win without and and Phoenix they're you know they're fine when they're fully healthy they're fine they're pretty good when they're fully healthy but they have no depth at all so when you know one guy is out or whatever it is  they get hit especially when it's Booker because KD looks a little tired this last week or two Bradley Beal was good anyway point is you're starting really so Neil still with Booker out Katie and Beale obviously nerc obviously Grayson Allen had some defensive stats here he is kind of slowed over the last week I would say try desperately to hold on to Grace and all he's had a really good season overall a couple of down ball games okay I get it like you need more day to day and Phoenix is coming off a really good schedule week and they're sliding now into kind of a crummy one this week  so I get it you might be able to pick somebody up like Brooklyn who has five games for grace and three that's probably a movie you could do but if you can hang on I think you should do it  so we heard before the ball game that Eric Gordon was gonna be on a minute and then he played 30 Off the Bench so I I guess not I don't like Eric Gordon's Fantasy game I've said that a hundred times on the show but if you need three pointers real bad and it sounds like Booker's Gonna Miss at least a week Gordon probably can give you those even if the percentage is end up suffering  let's go back to Saturday it was a quiet ones that's why we're gonna have a few things to talk about on Friday Also hey shout

aboard and help Sports eat those grow and support the people and website that you guys love so much  let's talk about Saturday Atlanta the lack of Trey Young starting to catch up with them a little bit but I don't think I'm gonna change my value much you got Jalen Johnson you got DeAndre Hunter you got bogie you got capella you got to Murray you got Sadiq Bay all of those guys are startled  with the sort of footnote that Hunter and Bay are probably more in the kind of doesn't matter range but probably towards the front end of it with Trey out  keep that in mind  and then Brooke Lynn well they've got a great fantasy week coming up because they play five times this week  we don't know what the deal is with Cam Thomas we might see him later this week we might not as it stands if you're head-to-head mode any of those five starters as a go because you know you're talking about 150 plus minutes this week for those dudes and frankly Dennis Smith Jr in five games probably gets you close to 100 minutes that's pretty damn good you could even dip as deep as doron sharp who puts up numbers in 1415 16 minutes of all game  just know he's gonna hurt your free throw percent and that would be if you're kind of hunting rebounds and blocks and field goal percent he's if he but I mean five games you can work a lot of magic with five games Roto side I don't know that I'm starting Dorian Finney Smith the other four starters I would definitely use in Rhode Island with compass and Ben Simmons out that's Bridges cam Johnson who's been great with Cam Thomas not around Claxton and and Schroeder and then Dorian Finney Smith is sort of  borderline although  you could probably play him in All formats just because they've trimmed the rotation down and he's getting 30 for my minutes ball game lately  yeah I'm fine with that  Utah is leaning even a little harder into the tank Larry Martin in is out with a right quad issue we don't know for how long but we do know that he's out for at least the Ballgame County Georgia's on the injury report with an illness so that's not a tank move that's a young guy that they're when he giving the basketball to he had a big ball game 31 points on Saturday great so high opportunity on chiant date  this is the moment  John Collins if you could sell I mean a lot of trade deadlines have passed some of them are still are still going if you can't sell High then you just sort of hold on and hope can take and right away Taylor Hendricks at 13 boards and a couple of blocks that was interesting and with marking it out you can sort of assume that everybody else is going to get a little bit more to do  it sounds like Jordan Clarkson might be back for this ball game but it also sounds like Walker Kessler is still out  so what do you do Roto Collin Sexton John Collins maybe keyonte George had to head definitely all of those guys and then you can add probably Henry's and Clarkson into the mix and just kind of hope that they can rack up a few stats Utah has a three game week that gets really bad after Wednesday then they played two games over 8 days after that you  brutal for head to head  Caleb Martin got hot for the heat in this ball game but you're not adding him because he played 23 bench it's you're going the starters minus Nikola jovic so Jimmy Butler bam at a bio Terry Rozier Duncan Robinson until Tyler hero comes back then you just start here oh and you bench Dunkin' Robinson Portland they're deep into the tank now Jeremy Grant official officially had some right quad soreness ain't gonna push his way through played 15 minutes before deciding that was good  and all of the guys that I mentioned whatever it was before the trade deadline as being like three or four injuries away they're all on the table now  because everybody's gone for the Blazers Grant is probably gonna miss some time scoot is still out Brogden still out eight and still out sharp is still out I mean you got a whole starting five basically on the Shelf which means for one if Anthony Simons is healthy enough to play for Portland this week he's gonna take 25 shots of ball game but it also means you can probably trust to Monte Cara that'd be my second favorite guy to use on the team is a big drop off between Simon's and Kamara but we've seen his Fantasy game translate relatively well Jabari Walker needs a lot of usage to get there and he had it in this ball game he got 16 shots up so if you think he's gonna get into that 14 to 16 shot range to Barry Walker would also be a thumbs up do a brief is a thumbs down for me um he did enough in this one but the minutes don't seem locked in if someone could tell me he was gonna get 29 minutes I'd say go on do a brief but it seems like even when he starts he's still only gets 24 25 Bulls questionable as well if he plays he would probably get 30 minutes and he'd be a great defensive stats stream and I met I don't know how to pronounce Ashton Hagan's I'm gonna go with Hagins it might be Hogan's or Hagins he had a really nice game here really great fantasy line but that's the kind of thing I'm gonna see again before I do anything with it but boy oh boy I was Portland Gone full tank now  not to be outdone all the kind of outdone in this ball game Memphis brought a couple of their older guys older in John conchar and Luke Kennard came back for this ball game Jerry Jackson was out Zaire Williams left part way I made it through most of the ball game first so Memphis continues to be an extraordinarily difficult team to handicap a more than like an hour before their game starts  so they are in Brooklyn tonight  and they have a four-game week  but I don't know if Jordan Goodwin's gonna play in all four of those games  if he does he be an awesome head-to-head play Goodwin very much a go in Roto because if you don't play you just you know save that game's cap for later Santi aldama great play when JJJ is out which I don't know how many times that's gonna happen this week but keep all Domo ready to deploy Vince Williams is in every day or  along with JJ when he plays and Goodwin those three guys are every day there's  the borderline guys are aldama who's a go and JJJ is out Kennard whose missing a lot of games and then he took two shots in 28 minutes in this one so I mean he can he's in tank mode and you could use Kinard for some assistance and some threes but don't expect much else GG Jackson is exclusively a points League guy because all he really does is score so I'm not super into that and then conchar is your across the board guy but his minutes are not safe enough so probably not there either  did you guys follow that I can do it again real fast guys to start if they're in the starting lineup Goodwin JJ Vince Williams Junior guys to start if Jaron Jackson Jr is out would be Alma and then everybody else is sort of borderline safe cool okay Denver beat the Lakers same formula as always tie game until the last three minutes and then they win by 10 as the craziest thing that this happens every single time the Lakers in the Nuggets play each other  every time 6/7 games in a row the Lakers the nuggets have been tied at the three-minute Mark and then the Nuggets win by almost double digits or double digits in this one they were very much powered by Nicole yokich and Michael Porter Jr mpj went 10 for 10 in this ball game including five three-pointers  that's a real good fantasy line that's the best that's all you can say he jumped himself back up to number 66 in nine cat and he's played in 60 ball games this year  people were like kind of hate not him for a stretch this year in fantasy gosh I move on no he's number 43 by totals  that's impressive year for him  anyway Justin holiday it's a big shots Off the Bench basically he became the kcp Phil in because Christian Braun wasn't playing all that well  and honestly holiday kind of saved to the day if he doesn't hit those threes in the middle of the ball game the Lakers were up double digits for a while  and then you know Jamal Murray did Jamal Murray stuff against the Lakers because he always does even Aaron Gordon like the Lakers got to figure out how to get a rebound they got a out rebounded by 16 I was actually at this ball game it was very cool I had it I had an absolute blast um a friend of mine was able to kind of hook things up where I was able to go down and hang out Courtside before the ball game it was it was really cool as far as the Lakers go really hachimura had a great ball game but it wasn't enough and then the Lakers inexplicably went to cam reddish down the stretch and said of D'Angelo Russell I mean this is like criminal level rotations  why Max Christie doesn't get to play a minute over prints or reddish or Dinwiddie I just I mean I guess at least with Dinwiddie he's a Creator but like reddish legitimately can't catch passes  he doesn't belong in there  he's not big enough to rebound  and he's not offensively skilled enough to use be used on that like if you're going to say okay well Jarred Vanderbilt not very good on offense yeah but guess what he gets offensive rebounds and put backs  and he these guys both get steals but one of them gets rebounds put backs and can defend slightly bigger dudes  even did what he I'd rather have Diddy in there over radish  that's Stillness utter silliness anyway uh you're not playing rui every day this is the sort of explosion game Hill be Emmy scores yeah with this starting unit he'll score but they're in a whole lot else going on so the usuals for the Lakers Rockets over Phoenix Jalen green had one of his bigger ball games and these come from time to time if you still have a trade deadline intact see if you can move him pretty easy call there I'm in Thompson 21 minutes and just oh man this kid's gonna have some great fantasy lines in his career  the minutes are not super safe right now  and  that's why I don't think I can call him a hold  what did he play like eight nine minutes and one of those other ball games recently oh man it's so hard though because his game is so neat fan he translatable  I just don't see how his minutes get above about 20 with the whole starting five healthy on this team  and 20 will be enough on some days like this one but on others it won't be and then it's gonna probably level off to outside every day startable but damn  I wish I could make a really good argument to hang on Houston does have a good head schedule this week starting tomorrow so there's a reason but then they go back to a three-game week after that  blah blah  we already talked about Phoenix so let's go back to Friday where there were five teams  didn't play over the weekend can you remember them because I actually wrote them down this time  here we go  Chicago Milwaukee  New Orleans Sacramento  Washington  five teams did not play over the weekend  let's go to question mark  right they played the Bucks this is not Friday that's why I was confusing where is Chicago on this screen so I can ZIP down there we go there's their ballgame down near the end of the board so Milwaukee know massive surprises there Giannis was Goliath in this game but you're effectively starting four of the five stars Jae Crowder is the one that you're not playing from Milwaukee that's a pretty easy one until Middleton comes back and then you've probably take Beasley out and then for Chicago Alex Caruso played which is good when he plays that means that Drummond is not going to get to do as much Andre actually still played 24 minutes he and Caruso kind of splitting I'm right now which is super weird I know but Caruso comes out Drummond comes in and then everybody else sort of slide down a roster spot so if Alex plays 30 minutes you know drum is not gonna get to do enough of Caruso can only go 25 like he did this one then drum and can kind of Teeter on the edge of fantasy value but as we talked about on the show before you're mostly target  the game's for Chicago against big big big big big big big big front courts that's where you use Drummond  what are the other teams I talked about Sacramento Washington let's go to Washington we're speeding our way through this this Friday Washington it sounds like Bilal is back for the Wizards next ball game that's reason enough for me to pause on starting Corey kispert against a games cap you can keep streaming if you want because the Wizards have a pretty good schedule this week it's a four gamer I'm trying to remember yeah they go every other day and then it's a four game or next week as well so you can hang on to kiss bird in those formats but Roto probably not  Jordan Poole Off the Bench continues to be much more interesting than Jordan Poole has a starter so hold on to him obviously as a whole Bagley as a whole kuzma as a whole Tice Jones as a whole and that ought to be that  where was Sacramento where is there a game  Sacramento is down there near the bottom all so they're the Kings Malik Market 39 in this one with no dear and fox who may or may not be back for their next ball game if Fox is out you just get more out of Monk more out of Keegan more out of sabonis more out of herder typically more out of barns you're not playing Davion Mitchell even though he was okay in this ball game you're not playing Barnes you could probably play herder with foxes out I think when Fox comes back I might consider sitting herder because it seems like his hot run is kind of cooled off  and then yes I know Malik mug went Giant in this one but continues to profile better as a head-to-head guy then a roto guy and I believe Sacramento as kind of a good schedule to start this week yeah three in the first four and then they're off for a couple of days so if you got those kings this is not a time to move on from them if you're talking Roadhouse side monk is a coin flip I can't really tell you if the answer is yes or no on a given night look at the opponent and say Chicago and I want to be a lot of points does that mean like lean towards yes probably but  you guys I think catch my meaning on that one and the pelis the pellets New Orleans and this one new doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo rotations were a little bit more normal with the exception of Zion who only played 21 minutes this game was a blowout so they were able to give guys a little bit of breathing room and I think that probably helped to trade Murphy who had six three-pointers 28 and 7 huge ball game for him he's been on a pretty vicious heater you go ahead and you play Trey  until the heater runs out and when it does you'll see his minutes taper off as well because the main guys are back for this team now um you know McCollum came back in that is sort of what changed the balance but you know Zion I'll get a game off here and there and if anybody gets hurt then you've got trade sort of ready to roll JV bounce back as expected after that weird game where he barely did where he barely played it all and not much changes there you're still using herb Jones who was quiet in this ball game but all so apparently played the best defense in the history of man on Tyreese Halliburton  and so you know that's why herb is going to be in there even if he cools off a little bit but he's rolling these days and so you go to roll with him as well  let's take a quick Gander over at the chat room see if anybody brought up a topic that I forgot to cover  enough with enough with Kelly Olynyk please we get it he's the next Michael Jordan know I'll never stop talking about Kelly Olynyk it's it's a joke at this point and if you guys are not enjoying the joke then you're listening to the show incorrectly Kelly's Fantasy game is crazy good that's the bottom line even on a day where he tried almost effectively tried not to do stuff he still managed to put up a fantasy line and there's just nobody in his way anymore so you kind of have no choice at this point which I thought was the case when Barnes went out but they were going to try to keep him limited there also  now they got no choice  uh let's see here oh a question about the Dodgers I can't I can't I know I know Yellow Mama I believe me I'm gonna try to watch the mookie ohtani Freeman top three is often as humanly possible  um  why sell high on key on day George so if you're in a points League the answer is you don't need to but if you're in a traditional nine cat League it's because there are holes in his Fantasy game that get overlooked because he's going to take a lot of shots that's the short version he's not a great defensive stats guy we've seen that now I think we have enough of a sample size to say that he doesn't really get that many he had a two-game stretch right before the All-Star break we had five Steals and two games and since that point he has three over six games these things have a way of leveling out so you know we're talking probably one steel or less he doesn't block shots which is fine because he's a point guard but he's shooting kind of a high volume and I know he was hotter in this last ball game but kind of a high volume 40% please a punt field goal guy but again he's gonna score a bunch and he's gonna get some assist because he's running point a bunch of the time that he's on the floor and a lot of teams are over to willing to overlook that stuff if you can find a team in your league that's punting field goal they'll give you a lot for keonte George but it doesn't even necessarily have to be that someone's just gonna see the numbers he's putting up and say oh 30 some odd points whatever the number was not last 31 points they're gonna just want to guy who  scores 31 points  they're not even gonna care how it got there  they're not gonna care that the previous three ball games he shot 13 for 30 nope 13 for 40 excuse me  13 for 40 13 for 30 wouldn't have been all that bad  like they're not gonna consider the fact that the aggregate of the last four ball games is outside the top 150 they're going to see the last one game and you can milk that because the turnovers are going to be very high well he's playing point  the steals are gonna be low  the free throws fine at least that's good and you're gonna get points you're gonna get threes and you're gonna get some assists but he does things that can break you all so and why it's gonna be really hard for him to settle inside anything better than like top 90  hopefully that made sense just as a math game  should I hold on to Marvin but yeah I answer that question answer is yes hold on to Bagley  and yes I know you were joking about Kelly Olynyk um I'm just wondering if other people are newer that are hearing me talk about him and they're like why is this guy so obsessed with the clinic it's it's a running gag at this point but I do think he needs to be on rosters  yeah I think that's I think those are the only names that I didn't cover in depth that I still could  good questions over there if you got further questions throw them in the comments section I'll try to get to those at some point after the fact and or you could try to get me over in Discord that link is
