welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  that's a good Jam  and welcome to episode 2 today  kind of a back-to-back Ur not quite I guess there was a little bit of a break in between a fantasy NBA today we had to buy low episode first thing this morning  and these shows I think will be posting on the traditional podcast channels almost back to back because  I guess you guys don't really care about my personal life but you're gonna hear about it anyway for the first 30 seconds of today's show so fast forward if you want to but get these days man they get the whole week of Thanksgiving off  its I think the first time that I've actually dropped a back in my day  back in my day we only got Thursday and sometimes Friday off  and then by partway through we got like halfway wins day right that was how it was in the 80s 90s  now the whole damn week off and three weeks for winter break I mean I don't know what the hell I'm going to do with these children over the next like six weeks of living keep them alive will I be probably not  who cares nobody cares about me  keep the kids that's the that's the part so anyway schedules all Goofer it I also have a play-by-play gig later on tonight so today is gonna be a bit of a jam-packed day  I see that the chat room is a hoppin I don't know how many questions we're gonna get to on this one I'll do my best but I can't go that long just because today his so many things all jammed in together but I'll do my best for those that are watching with us live for those that are listening after the fact you can watch the chat room you can hang out wherever you can come chill with us in Discord  link to that is in the show description should be a functional one should work we have a free Discord where everybody can just hang out and have fun with each other we all have a premium Discord for folks who have the fantasy pass or other passes at sports ethos and you guys get access to a bunch of extra cool stuff  so just make sure if you're in Discord and you have a fantasy pass let's let somebody know so the mod can turn on the proper channels for you  somebody to keep in mind  I of course will hopefully see all of you guys on social media at Dan best briefs d a n b e s b r i s let's dive in because again we're on a tight schedule today let's see what do we got here but starting with a Monday review happy NBA cup Tuesday by the way everybody Denver beat Detroit 107 103 without largely Nicola yokich who got ejected in the second quarter after Michael Malone got ejected not not long before that Christian Braun picked up the extra minutes he had a pretty good fantasy game I mean we basically know at this point that if a wing misses time for the Nuggets Christian Braun would be a pretty good ad but a wing is not likely to miss time right now unless something changes because Michael Porter Jr is fine kcp is fine Aaron Gordon is fine all these guys are upright  Reggie Jackson at his first good game in a while and Reggie Jackson someone I actually kind of want to pause and talk about a little bit on the season and I don't think this is a good descriptor he's right around the edge of the top 200 over the past two weeks since Jamal Murray went down he's number one 100 and 160 and there is a lot of disagreement  about what  what whether he's a asset  so here's the thing  he's not  if you're ranked one 60 in a 12 team her you're not a fan of fantasy asset simple as that with the possible exception last year of Giannis antetokounmpo because he was so bad in One Singular category that punting that one category  moved him from 160th to like 20th so obviously that's a different situation  almost everybody down to like a person one guy if you ranked 160 or deeper when you're getting  a full run of it you're not a 12 team guy  and I've heard the arguments oh Reggie Jackson he scored 16 points and Jamal Murray went down and he's getting four assists and he's shooting a ridiculous 54% from the field the magic of Nicolas chart at work right there  I don't care not one of those categories is strong enough to counter weight all the things that he's a negative in which includes free throws right now for whatever weird reason  but 16 points doesn't actually make him a positive it makes him kind of like a neutral which is fine like getting that off the waiver wire 16 points off the wire is good what a half threes negative for a guard 2.3 rebounds negative for anybody 3.7 assists fine but kind of an -4 point guard if you're throwing a point guard out there you're probably hoping for four or more 0.8 combined defensive stats it's a negative  there are too many negatives and not enough actual positives the only real positive he has right now is field goal percent which is great over those two weeks but also largely unsustainable  he might shoot better with yokich near him than he has in his career which is low 40s but low 40s to mid 50s is a jump you just generally don't see from a point guard who's shot profile isn't all that different  just more open  a little bit better and more open  the reason I bring this up is  because like points leaders I guess there's a little bit of a value built into Reggie Jackson still not all that much mine you but it's a little bit better  kids yelling at me in the middle of a show  Thanksgiving week man it's going to totally break me  anyway what the hell was I talking about right Reggie Jackson the he had a better ball game yesterday so that's why I wanted to start from this place he had a good ball game and it moved him up to 160 since Jamal Murray went down in between he's had two games that you could sort of classify as a decent nine category game this one and like the third one after Jamal went down most of the other ones it's been kind of a decent number of points on decent field goal percent and that's kind of an it  so I get it head-to-head Leaguers you're looking at you're like all right if I can drop this guy into a good schedule and spot it could work out for me like maybe I catch lightning in a bottle maybe I get him for one of these good ball games and two average ones and then that would be all right Rodeo players you just it doesn't make sense  he's shown now over two weeks that he doesn't have the stat profile  to be a 12 team Roto League games cap guy unless you manage to catch this one but missed the three bad ones before it which maybe it did I don't know but  that's not a way that's not a way to make a living to try to guess which out of every three or four games a guy's gonna have a better one  and then I kind of saw the flip side of this which was folks talking about how other guys that have better fantasy profiles are not as useful as Reggie Jackson and I just like my brain exploded because  I know that we need to get into deeper Weeds on how we analyze what a player's rank is but at the end of the day a player's rank is actually a pretty good indicator of what they do  the way you want to tweak it if you're looking at ranks is like does one or two categories make a big difference for a player in a way where if you don't care about that category or your laser focused on that particular category or whatever that player becomes more interesting one for your individual fantasy team but that's not the way that I can run a show and frankly that's not the way that analysts should be talking about it and this sort of like this guy's useful  asterisk scroll scroll scroll the asterisk is oh if your fantasy team exclusively needs points and field goal percent but not the other seven categories it doesn't make sense  you guys we gotta make sure that people understand the game they're playing simplify the game  and points hunting is just not the way to do it  we have unfortunately seen a bit of a Slowdown from us our tops and he was in foul trouble in this one but it's been happening kind of slowly almost unbeknownst to the Casual viewer but you know that the stuff he was putting up wasn't gonna last all season long the NBA season is just too long and too grueling for a rookie to put those kinds of adrenaline fueled numbers together for an entire season and over the last  two weeks now I think Thompson is outside the top 150 because the field goal percentage come down a bit the free throws been tough  I mean you still gotta like 11 rebounds over that stretch and 2.1 defensive stats but it's not that insane like we haven't seen this kind of thing before type stuff he was doing the first two weeks  which does make him a little bit of a cell High because I don't think anybody's really noticed it yet but we kind of knew this was coming  Kate finally had a better ball game thank the good Lord I have him in exactly zero places but this was a step in the right direction and if you have him you're hanging on because you know what was gonna get better  Isaiah Stewart and Marvin Bagley are perfectly good at Reggie Jackson like examples of guys that have been able to do stuff in two categories and nothing else  although to Stewart's credit he did block two shots in this ball game but he hasn't been good enough I mean we'll just keep playing the same game what are these guys ranked over the last two weeks is Stewart won 55 Marvin Bagley won 67 Marvin Bagley has been a positive and exactly two categories over those two weeks and Isaiah Stewart has been a positive in exactly two categories over those weeks uh I guess you could add turnovers to that mix so like two and a half  rebounds and sort of blocks for Isaiah Stewart rebounds and field goal percent for Marvin Bagley so again like  if you're category hunting it's different but if you're looking for a 9 category play those guys haven't been it  all right let's Veer away from the we got a reteach how to play fantasy basketball part of the show and into the fact that Jaden Ivey played 30 minutes which to me is intriguing and I you know I don't care what his rank is over the last week or two weeks or something like that because this is very much an isolated incident right now but what if it became not an isolated incident what if he suddenly found himself with actual legitimate consistent playing time  over his last three games I don't think anybody knows because he didn't do anything in the previous two over his last three games he's played 29 28 and then 30 minutes this was the only one of those three that was a good performance  last year with no Cade Cunningham me average 16 points 5 assists for rebounds on 42% from the field and 75 at the free throw line which and 3.2 turnovers which is sort of consistently had him right on the edge of 12 Team playable he was a points League asset because again bad percentage is bad turnovers you can kind of Overlook that this year we need to see what he what he is was their growth of any kind  I think it's okay  if you wanted to pick him up to see where it goes  but I also wouldn't get my hopes very high call this one a 15% chance of success is that high enough to drop somebody useful absolutely not is it high enough to drop somebody that's dead weight sure why the hell not  Alec works is no longer on the table he's been phased out in favor of anything that sticks because Detroit's lost what 12 games in a row and they're on their way to setting franchise records  anyway uh Charlotte big overtime win over Boston this is quite a performance from Hornets team that badly needs wins and this was not the game that we all thought they were going to get it in but whatever they'll take him where they can get him they're now four and nine not surprisingly miles Bridges has made them better it's annoying but it's true I'm still gonna try to win my league without him but he had a good ball game PJ Washington is shifted to the bench and he's I would say probably droppable I mean we can keep playing this game once a guy ranked over the last two weeks PJ 31 minutes a game over those two weeks he's outside the top 200 in and unsustainably low 40% from the field but the other stuff really isn't going to change all that much for him lamelo ball big game Mark Williams he's dominating the questions I think people were gonna have in this one was did anybody do anything with Derek white out and the answer was Peyton Pritchard had a big one but I don't know that I would trust him the next time white is out because it could just as easily have been Sam Houser having a big one and Pritchard not really needed as much but  no this is the way it went Jaylen Brown had some foul issues he wasn't playing as well so mixed and match a tad  Gordon Hayward I think it's the player that you guys are curious what I actually think about it he's outside the top one 40 over the last two weeks but he's only shooting 36 and a half percent  and his role hasn't actually changed that much since miles Bridges came back a lot of what and I talked about this a bit on yesterday's show  a lot of what's different for Hayward is that lamelo ball is starting to actually feel is oh it's  lamelo's a first rounder over the last two weeks know punting because he's shooting 50% over that stretch to sort of level off what had been a brutal shooting start to the year for ball  obviously this isn't going to stick he's not going to shoot 51% for the year but when lamelos rolling like this the balls just gonna be in his hands all the time where when he couldn't throw it in the ocean he was gonna give it to someone like a Hayward or whoever that was performing better so expect this stuff to be a bit of an ebb and a flow hold on to Gordon you play 39 minutes he'll probably get hurt as a result of it they're better when he's on the floor he has his bounce back this year which is a big deal and he has fantasy upside that a lot of these guys don't he has appeal in six seven categories that a lot of these guys don't so hold on to Hayward for now you got to see how this thing plays out  no big surprise is on the Milwaukee side Malik Beasley is on sort of a little mini run these days you can roll with it if you really want to I'm too nervous to do so Portis filling in for Jae Crowder that's good Brooke Lopez has been on a furious run since we put him on our by low list he's a top 25 play over the last two weeks averaging four blocks a game over that stretch and he's inside the top 50 on the year I think he's inside the top 40 on the year yeah 38 now on the season for brolo  and believe it or not like the percentages could still actually get a little better even if the the blocks do come down  this is probably your chance to trade for Chris Middleton if you ever wanted to I think it's still gonna be annoying season but now that his minutes are creeping up a little bit  the Whoever has him is probably not gonna trade him after an 18-6 and 7 game but if you see like a 24 minute game for Middleton where he doesn't do very much that would be your time to go make a move the Wizards let me give you let's play a trivia game who had the best plus minus on the Wizards yesterday  do you think it was tyus Jones if you guessed tyus  you'd be right  who do you think didn't get to play during crunch time yesterday  did you also guess die as Jones because you'd be right again  the the tank is on so hard and the problem right now is that there are a couple of the teams that are losing as often as the Wizards are  even if they're not tanking as hard like the Pistons of the worst team in the league they're two and thirteen there's somehow a game worse than Washington and I like legitimately I can't imagine a team that looks worse on a court in the wizards but yet  they only have the second worst record in the NBA and so if you're going into a tank and you're understanding that some of these other bad teams like the Blazers are going to be in tank the Spurs sorry guys I know that like two weeks ago people were like Spurs are gonna make the play and turn it and I was like easy tiger Sports ain't gonna make the play in tournament  these teams that are likely going to be trying to lose ball games down the stretch if you're the Wizards you got to make sure that you're not accidentally three games in front of them and losing more you have to lose even more even harder to keep up with the other losing going on down the stretch so right now the Wizards are losing to try to keep up with the other losers how's that for a weird sentence still in what we've talked about before this is what I've referred to as a pre tank  Wizards or pretend  they're playing lineups that they know are terrible  and  sort of accidentally losing the ball game  like  Kyle kuzma had 22 points in 13 assists in this game point coups in full effect who by the way is still very much a sell High the fact that he hasn't had you know a week or two of just disastrous games is a great reason to sell him and nine cat  Gafford is a hold he's been able to do it in mid-20s to high 20s in minutes that's been easy Jordan Poole finally had his epic game I'm going to take every shot and do nothing else 30 points one rebound one assist for Jordan Poole yes he did have three threes because you know some of the shots he took were from far it away  who had the worst plus minus on the team yesterday well then he obviously did but who had the second worst Jordan Poole and he played the most minutes on the team Jordan Poole and Denny offiah now that doesn't necessarily mean  that like they were the worst players on the court it could have been just that you know they were parts of lineups that were losing but this is a game the Wizards were actually kind of competitive in until early in the fourth quarter and so that it was like all right let's make sure this thing goes down the toilet  you're holding Jordan Poole if you drafted him against my wishes you're holding Danny Avidia because he's actually kind of an okay this year  you're selling eye on kuzma  you're holding tyus Jones  and you are  his confidence eventually get a kill me everybody  and you are  kind of stashing Bilal a little buddy  whose name is painfully difficult to say and so we're gonna continue to call him Cooley after saying it right one time could I believe  now he's Cooley the rest of the show  he shot five for seven that's generally not gonna happen he's having a efficiency issues you can see the outlines of fantasy game I just don't think it's something that he steps into until Jones Pool kuzma whoever are either shut down or gone  that might not be until next year I added him in a keeper league and I play on squatting on him to see what happens there but if you're in a traditional nine cat League I don't know that it's gonna be enough game to game again last two weeks Bilal outside the top 60 and that's with pretty decent minutes  I just stuff that he doesn't do yet and that's okay but he might and if you feel like you need to be in front of it have at it  I think we can move a little bit faster now all those games are ones where I felt like there were a few teams who really wanted to pour through  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you

is coming in hard today  no the next we're in another blowout  so we don't know that we necessarily have the final verdict on Josh Hart I'm leaning towards thinking he's probably not gonna get 30 minutes when the team is healthy and a competitive ball game  if you can afford to hold a little bit longer I would but you don't have to Quentin Grimes was back so Dante David's Enzo was no longer a play Emmanuel quickly is another guy where again like some head-to-head builds like he makes sense but typical Roto to 12 teamers he's streamers own level  Jaden McDaniels got hurt left early with an ankle injury on the Minnesota side it didn't really they didn't miss a beat Minnesota is good this year as we thought they would be question was gonna be who picks up the minutes was it slow mo was it Nicole Alexander Walker was it more than I was read it was Nicole Alexander Walker in this one but I don't know that that holds he happened to be part of lineups that were playing well so we got extra run but if I be Kyle Anderson the next one it might be a young player  hard to know I don't think that you can just make the blanket statement that nickeil Alexander Walker is going to have a good run here I would rather just sort of wait and see how this thing goes  by the way no one's really noticed it but Rudy go bare after a pretty good start to the year has tapered off a bit remember he was like top 30 to start the season now he's number one oh four and a lot of that is because of free throw he's been among the worst in the NBA 57% on six free throws per game if you're hunting free throws he obviously moves way up the board and the other stuff is fine like decent field goal percent the defensive stats are at three but everybody was yelling at bruske after Rudy got off to a quick start and now he's outside the top 100 and I feel like maybe folks should have apologized a little bit on that one because  he did say that there was going to be slow age  and anyway Clippers blew out the Spurs we're going to probably hear about a lot of Team blog out the Spurs this year because they're not very good  but the story in this one is not in the San Antonio side I could care less about this Spurs I have exactly one spur on my fantasy teams and it's Zach Collins on a couple of them and I'm gonna stick that one out I figured that one banana would have Growing Pains you'd have some of these insane lines every once in a while but then you're gonna get the sort of flip side of it he's number 48  that's fine I don't see any real problem with that  Clippers Paul George good ball game  Daniel theis had a big game Don't Care Norman Powell had a big game I don't really care  streamer level  James Harden Double-Double I think you're gonna see more of those now with him as the starting point guard and Russ on the bench and Kawhi Leonard 21 points for boards three assists the steel block and a couple of Threes Clippers main guys made something like 16 at a 16 free throws the Buy Low windows on some of these guys may be closing up now and they didn't last honestly as long as I thought they would and that's on me I thought we'd have a week or two to kind of continue to drive the value down on these players but the move of Russ to the bench sped up the learning curve and now you probably have to pay normal price for those dudes so I probably not entirely worth it  King's finally had their letdown game which was gonna happen eventually they were on a pretty good run they went on the road where they'd actually been pretty good so far this year but just Pelicans were ready for him and the King sort of warranty left early with a back injury that meant a few extra shots for Harrison Barnes probably you'll see a little bit more for Kevin herder if he gets to miss any time and and again like I want to make sure that I qualify this statement with the following Darren Fox is a hell of a damn basketball player but we knew there was no chance he was going to continue doing what he was doing through his first seven games which was like almost four three-pointers a game while still somehow shooting what was it like 53% from the field and the Steals and blocks were weirdly high for him all that stuff was going to come down was it gonna come down in like slow like hey he's having pretty good ball games and we just didn't notice or was it going to be a cliff dive one ball game  well we got our answer we went cliff dive in this one brutal game on all accounts still having a great year still inside the top 20 but fell from whatever it was he was like number 10 we talked about him yesterday doesn't sound like a big drop but moving a bunch of chunks near the top of the board that actually does take a pretty raunchy game and it's some point he's just like he still took 18 shots in 29 minutes at some point the  the shot volume is is gonna come back to earth a little bit so just know that if you can get someone in the top 20 for Fox you do it if you can't you can only hang on I think it's gonna be a pretty damn good year regardless but it's not gonna be as good as it was so far anyway the king's mostly got murdered in this game so you can go ahead and and not worry about the rest of it pelis side a lot of folks are gonna drop Dyson Daniels and I wouldn't really blame you but his bad game wasn't because Jose Alvarado came back it was because it was blowout and he's not a high scoring type and so if a Dyson you just you need the game to be competitive you need him on the floor to collect his rebounds his assist his steals his blocks  he's a compiler  and he does it in a lot of categories without hurting you in many but if the game doesn't go as long which is effectively what happened here this is like a two and a half three quarter basketball game that's just not enough time for him to get the stats we need to be successful  I don't know what the hell's gotten into Jonah this year but he's passing he's blocking shots and  like we've seen enough JV to know that this type of stuff doesn't stick he's inside the top 40  I'm willing to admit that I was probably wrong thinking that he'd be in the one 50 Reign but I do still think he falls back towards the 80 to 110 zone so if you can get anybody inside the top 60 or 70 for him right now I think that's an interesting sell High name on your board otherwise not a whole lot to parse through here her Jones had another really good ball game I don't think you're gonna get proper value for him coming back so you might as well just enjoy it hi Maya kez had a better ball game again and he's been one that I just and I'll admit it part of it is just because I'm kind of a nervous wreck when it comes to streaming players I want to make sure that I'm getting a guy who's putting out a big ball game if I'm gonna drove drop fill in numbers on it  technically since Tyler hero went down as has been playable in all formats  it's been very inconsistent but he's right around the edge of the top 100 over the last two weeks that's technically playable  am I going to do it probably not because I'm super worried that the bottom is going to fall out  that's why I've just sort of settling on Dunkin' Robinson who's been inside the top 60 since hero went down as the guy you're doing with the in here  by the way Kyle Lowry is somehow all so inside the top 90 over the last two weeks probably because of high steals numbers and making all of his free throws and five assists and over two three-pointers a game but he too in my estimation is too frightening to start game every game with Tyler hero out  Head to Head side you could probably play any of these guys because they've all been good enough but again with the rodeo one sort of like taking a shot that you're not going to land on the Bad Day  so with the heat  this is on me I'm just too nervous to play Hawks or Lowry as a fill-in even though technically they both have been good enough to be a go  I'd rather just roll with Robinson can he's because he's been awesome  Bulls are a team we need to spend two or three minutes on as well and I know that this recap is going a little longer than I had planned but Kobe White had a big ball game which is fine he like generally has not been anywhere near close enough to start day to day but the reason we need to talk about the Bulls is that the Zach LaVine trade rumors  have to be impacting things right now he only took nine shots in this whole ball game just wasn't really involved and he had that game last week where he exploded late but he just he doesn't seem right and I don't know if it's a mental thing or if a physical thing we don't know about  does he know the trade is coming down the pike sooner than later  hard to say  is one player getting traded enough to make Kobe white a consistent fantasy asset  50/50  is that enough reason to sit on him and wait it out  well on the Roto side you could just stick them on your bench and not worry about it for a while so that probably makes it a little bit easier to make the call head-to-head you'd have to play them every day and you know a lot of his recent ball games have been doing much more harm than good  so that's a much tougher call I think in my mind is Kobe white squatting on the stash and head to head and actually having to play his games in an unlimited games had to head format  I don't know how you do it on that side you just take such a hit  I know this ball game was better but you know three in a row before that were either mediocre or terrible  wrote I think you could make a case for squad on a little bit  meanwhile Alex Caruso is a starter on this team you love that don't judge last two weeks he's inside the top 30  yay  that's probably higher than he will be full term full term what do we talk about pregnant see here but either way he needs he belongs on every roster and you know all systems go and I just keep looking back at my 30 deep team and not that you guys give even the first flying you know what nor should you but I forget where I got Alex Caruso in this one but  I got him picked 17 in round seven  so that's about pick 200 roughly  got to pick 200 and he's again rolling top 30 over the last two weeks and top 60 on the year that is a massive win in 30 deep  that's crazy  that's the kind of thing that could win you at 30 deep I don't want to get ahead of myself I need health I need health Caruso's gonna get hurt someone else doesn't matter Rockets Warriors operation played through a back injury he seemed fine  that doesn't look like a guy who was playing hurt Aaron holiday played over Jaylen Green in this game it was just a situation where one guy was playing better than the other  I don't expect this to happen in the next one  but also Jalen green is like the poster child for the difference between a points league and a category League because category leaks he's not even in this in the top 200 and points he's a must roster player  field goal free throw turnovers  that's it Freddie Van Fleet I just told you guys was a Bi-Lo on the show earlier today he still hasn't gotten any steals but man those assist numbers are juicy  and then the guys you the dude you're probably waiting for me to talk about is Jabari Smith Jr who we just talked about on yesterday's show as someone that I didn't draft anywhere  despite an understanding that he does have fantasy upside he can rebound he can get steals he can get blocks his field goal percent can be fine he can get some three-pointers free throw percent has been bad so far this year but I don't know that that's gonna stick this is the kind of line you were hoping for but it's also the kind of line that only pops up once every four or five games and that's what makes him so tough but then people were saying what do I do with him and again I don't have him anywhere but from the outside looking in my advice would be to hold  that's what I said yesterday too you kind of have to hold because he would have been a sell low and if you dropped him somebody would have picked him up for sure and look you got a decent game out of him from holding so keep holding understand it's going to be super inconsistent for Jabari this year and I just hope that the good outweighs the bad at the end of it all  I'll tell you what no dream on green I could enjoy these Chris Paul numbers forever with no Dream On Chris Paul is a top 60 nine CAD guy now and he's still only shooting 40% from the field that's a number that we still will likely see Trend up  his role probably not so big when Dre is back as we've seen but they're also figuring out how to play together a little bit better so I think some of that balances  if you were minutes but more effective minutes  Klay Thompson finally had a 20-point game his first of the year which is really amazing that's how bad he'd been to this point  Clay's tough to roster you know he's been I think outside the top 200 so far this year  because a lot of things have gone wrong but this was a step in the right direction  two I'd call them kind of semi steps in the right direction for Andrew Wiggins this certainly wasn't as big as the other one but at least he got some rebounds a couple of threes  I don't have Andrew Wiggins anywhere so similarly with Jabari Smith I'm I think I probably still say hold and just hope that whatever this is he snaps out of it slowly same story for Klay Thompson you can't drop player like that because you know that if things start to click for these guys they can be way better than whatever you know scrap paper you're pulling up off the wire also I give up on the shards versus Kevon Looney thing it seems very matchup based or maybe it's just whoever's playing better on a given

have been playing better so I don't know that we need to Deep dive that too much Gary Trent has been a little bit better OG and Adobe is a by low right now if you can do that Scotty Barnes we've seen a little bit of slippage there near the top of the board he's down number number 14  still seems like a dude that could end up inside the top 30 so I don't know that again that I would sell for super cheap there but anyway or Lando  oh you know what Johnathan Isaac because he did get near 20 minutes one game and then it came back down the next one  Cleveland you're just looking to see who's healthy because there was no Donovan Mitchell or careless love her and they beat the Nuggets I believe last time out they've got another tough one on their hands in Philadelphia  see who's upright Jared Allen I think is all by low I just talked about him on the show earlier today  Philly Nick button get going again after his three days off he didn't in the last one but it was all so over early so I have some measure of hope I think there's like a like a solid 40% chance that put two messy value until Kelly you'll break comes back but again that's still means 60% chance he doesn't Indiana nothing not until we see one of those Fringe guys get consistent minutes for a week in a row I will I believe it  Atlanta also kind of nothing you know Bogdan bogdanovich has been a play I think we know enough about the whole saddiq Bey Jaylen Johnson minute situation and on Echo Congo has been cooling off a bit after he had a strong run he still number 85 we know this without Clint capela or with Clint capela usually ends up in the 100's good enough even when he's only playing 2022 minutes a game and he is a Beastmaster when he's getting more than that  Portland uh we've seen DeAndre eight in slow down after a tourist start kind of knew that was coming the steals were never gonna hold the way they were you guys are seeing me randomly highlighting words on your page that's just me being fidgety  Phoenix  and nothing you got all these schedules stream level guys and then 3DS that you can start you taught in Lake in La that actually game could I think decide  the bracket know maybe not because you tell lost to Phoenix a couple of times  kante George is fun to watch these days he's having some severe efficiency issues but you gotta love the assists Jordan Clarkson is a sell right now if you can get good stuff for him because he's cooling off we saw it already he was shooting like 60% for a couple of games there and people were like oh boy Jordan Clarkson's gonna average 30 points no he's not he's not Walker Kessler is a bi no one's remembered that he existed but he's gonna come back to a team that has a point guard and I think that's going to be pretty good for him  like ours  nothing I think we pretty much know what they are at this point  are there any questions on the Lakers  question might be can I stream cam reddish Roto I'd say no head-to-head you can probably go yes and hope you catch a couple of steals  all right we're about 40 minutes deep on this show do do do see if I'll do a couple is a lot of questions I'm gonna see if I can find a couple that are that are broadly applicable  so bear with me here while I read through a few of them as we go  let's see who is the better thunder in a ten team or Jalen Williams or Josh giddey nine cat that's gonna be Jalen Williams I know he's hurt right now but  yeah his upside is still and he was on my Bi-Lo board from earlier today all so that's a good broadly applicable one  I'm not gonna do these trade ones like player over player here um probably not gonna do the streaming questions on the board Christopher no no like that one either um  hoping to Target Jared Allen in my nine cat Roto team which do you think will get the job done Austin Reeves Keegan Murray or Draymond Green  I think when Draymond clears a suspension that's probably good enough to get it done  it's not a bad idea you might take a little bit more you might need to pair them up actually with Austin Reeves and I probably would do that  hmm let's see what else we got here  what websites do you all use for player ranks basketball Monsters the easiest one right now oh here I'll even throw that in the chat room so you guys can just click that link  we are building one out by the way at sports ethos so pretty soon I'll be telling you guys to use that one instead  what else we got here that's useful for everybody  what I should you trade Cade Cunningham for anybody else in the top 60  spend a little bit on your team build if you're hunting field goal and turnover that's probably a know if you're trying to win either of those categories and it's probably a yes PBJ says smash the likes yeah I haven't said the word smash on this show yet but I know that's how the kids say It smash that like button  do you like Derek Lively more than PJ Washington or Gordon Hayward I like a Hayward overly over Washington over those  Bilal Bilal to the moon no not to the Moon guys there's way too much Bilal lunacy going on  he can't shoot free throws and underscore very much and he doesn't rebound that much I mean rebounds okay but he doesn't pass very much and that many three pointers he's mostly steals blocks and feel goal percent so far which is cool I like those categories those three of my four favorites  but you can't be a negative in that many other things do I think that he could be useful if the Wizards have any injuries or players get shut down yes do I think that necessarily happens before March  do I think he's someone that's going to be really cool to own next year or the year after that on your roster yeah but he ain't on the moon yet guys and he hasn't really shown the game to be even on a rocket ship to this point here Bilal you're gonna wait 40 more games before you stop 100 well said  guy with name I have trouble reading  uh let's see what else we got here would you trade tyus Jones for keyonte George in a points league and points lie I think I might actually 9 cat I don't think I would Point silly I think I would  are we speculatively adding Kobe white in case the Bulls don't get a starter back in the Levine trade yeah I mean this is what we talked about earlier it just depends on how long you're willing to wait  as a game's Capital you could just sit on the bench and not use them but in head-to-head he's actually hurting you more than he's helping right now so  tough one  uh thoughts on buddy hield same as they've always been for me actually but he healed is a guy that we know is not really part of the Pacers plans going forward and so he's a guy you're squatting on if you think he's getting traded I have him on exactly 0 fantasy basketball teams because once they couldn't agree to extension that was I thought their way of saying this guy We're Not Gonna prioritize  and they have it is minutes have been low and he's outside the top 175 so squat on him if you think he gets traded if he doesn't if you don't think that's happening then you move on  will Chris stops porzingis maintain or should I move him ah  you might see the field goal percent come down a little bit but overall he's a very very good basketball player and he's about 10 slots later than he was last year which is kind of what we expected with a dip in usage in Boston I think this is who he is  his Markle faults a drop kind of depends on if you have roster space if you ever asked her space I think you probably do it hold on rather hold on I should say  who goes first as the hot free agent keonte George or Jonathan Isaac probably George because he's playing big minutes and we know Johnathan Isaac's body's going to fall apart in the next three weeks or we think so  should a 10 category League always favored a streaming spot over a top 100 player I'm going to say yes on that I think in a 10 category or a 10 Team league I should say not ten category 10 Team league you basically want to start guys that are top 85 or better permanently and anything beyond that is questionable 85 to 100 you could make an argument to still play them but if it's someone that you think may drop just behind the top 100 you probably turn that into a streaming slot even maybe slightly in front  I have Markle faults and Ben Simmons who should I drop  maybe both  I'm less confident that Ben Simmons comes back anytime soon so I guess it's Simmons but I could really be wrong on that one because it's all Tea Leaf reading  who's your favorite mid-season sleeper  well you're sort of thinking about  what team might move somebody  Toronto was a team we thought might go selling like a pascal siakam they've been okay enough to where they might ride this out a bit Toronto six and seven they're right in the cusp of a play in spot basically  so I feel like it's got to be the Bulls  so Patrick William's Kobe white these guys that would step into a giant role of the Bulls blow things up that's the direction I'm looking right now and other teams make make kind of slide in as we go  let's see what do we do with Dillon Brooks in a 12 team points League I think you can probably move on from books Brooks it's Kelly oubre worth stashing um yeah I mean woge was saying that they were hoping to have him back about two to three weeks after the injury which you know we're already almost a week into this thing I think  yeah where are weak into this thing so I mean maybe he's back like by early to mid December so yes very much I'm gonna hold on to him  and let's see one last question who are the best trade targets if you're selling Kyle kuzma it's a good question I think I was gonna have who's on a cell High show maybe tomorrow or Thursday  probably tomorrow because there's this Thanksgiving  this is a tough one because everybody in your league is going to be afraid of kuzma but he's number 75 right now  and frankly I think if you can get anybody that's even like close to him you do it so yaka pedal nearby Mitchell Robinson again you like your value in points a lot then these trades probably don't make sense for you drew holiday is down there with him he's a Buy Low and who's Moses sell high so that makes a lot of sense D'Angelo Russell has been pretty consistently in this range so far this year Keegan Murray is someone I would look at for Coos I don't think you're gonna get nerc but you could try so maybe those names good start for you all right I gotta get back to the day guys sorry I can't go full hour or an hour 5 on this when we got to keep it
