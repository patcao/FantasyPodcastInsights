welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast oh we got changes  but all  and luckily for us moment  it's just basketball buddy buddy buddy relax just basketball uh West unseld Junior is out as the Washington Wizards head coach as per this Shams tweet that you can see on your screen  and we'll move to a front-office role so the Wizards took Mercy on poor West unseld Junior and I'm moving him over to the front office where he can  I guess at times just watch this bleep show on television instead of having to be on the sidelines yelling about said bleep show on a night tonight basis  what is this mean  well first thing is we all we already have a report that Brian Keith the top assistant coach on the Wizards it's gonna be promoted to the interim head coach for the rest of this year so they're not going to be looking at any long-term replacement until the offseason and we don't know what Brian's gonna do if anything different but what we do know is that this is a team that has gone full bore not that it wasn't super obvious already but this pretty much is kind of the nail in the coffin for  anything other than complete rebuild  because remember West unsell Junior came in when this team still had Bradley Beal and this team still had I think Chris stop before seeing us at that point and they weren't  it wasn't straight rebuild at that point they weren't good but they were at least attempting to be lightly competitive  this move saying you know what it's fine come over just hang out with us in the front office we're gonna make a assistant you can figure out how to do it we'll go find somebody that's going to  orchestrate a rebuild that's what's next  and so if there was any question on what the Wizards would likely be doing as we approached the trade deadline this I think also sort of puts that in Sharpie you know etches it into the stone whatever this is a team that's tearing it down to the studs so who's on the Move then well they do actually have a couple of veterans on that team and some of them other teams actually want sorry Jordan Poole you're not that guy but Kyle kuzma is a  seemingly a pretty good still relatively young basketball player who was making  is I actually does decreasing salary over the next three seasons is it three more years on his deal after this one but it goes down it's 26 this year than 24 22 and then 19  so he has actually a very interesting salary tyus Jones is an expiring 14 million dollar deal that's a extremely coveted item for a good basketball player they have Dylan Wright on an expiring deal I don't know that anybody wants that they got Daniel Gafford on a very affordable deal he's making about 13 14 mil over the next two seasons after this one Marvin Bagley who I think just got moved to there may be some restrictions on him but there are a number of players on this Wizards roster that they could move for picks or young players probably it'll be picked and expiring contracts and then those the kind of guys that ends up getting waived so we have to start thinking about and I know you know we did a show yesterday on stash candidates  and we did a show like a week in about a week ago on stash candidates as well  and we had already talked about Bilal coulibaly who was Wizards high draft pick this year obviously he's part of their future he has I mean I think we'd be doing a disservice if we didn't at least bring him up again briefly on this show but he does have some glaring issues with his Fantasy game he's shooting 65% at the free throw line this year that's painful especially from a from a guard  big guard small wheat whatever you want to call it he's like six eight buddy he's supposedly the the point guard of the future along with Anthony black  but he's not like a true point guard the Steals and blocks are good for bees at 0.8 of each of them in about 26 minutes of ball game  I am and I do think that it's probably makes sense to use a roster spot on stashing below I don't know that I still don't know that it's a guarantee that he gets there if only Ty is Jones gets moved sorry Anthony black is not on this TV on the magic I don't know why the hell I said that  be a lot I guess is the guy that they want to play point but he's not really a point guard  so you know we're looking at a situation where this guy was averaging 1.8 assists in 26 minutes of ball game and obviously that you know he'd have the ball in his hands more if ties Jones is gone but he's not just magically gonna become a six assist guy overnight  but if this team moves multiple people that to me is where things get very interesting for the Wizards  if they move multiple people because Deni avdija who's on a very good deal and they and his extension kicks in next year as well all so a possibility to get moved I don't know I don't know why they move him he seems pretty good and still pretty young but I guess anything's possible let's say I think the three most likely candidates and I don't know that all three of them get moved but you gotta figure at least one maybe two are ties Jones Kyle kuzma Daniel Gafford  tyus Jones seems the most likely expiring deal everybody needs a backup point guard or even a starting point guard if you're current one is not very good contending teams are going to want ties Jones he'll net something  and there's absolutely no reason to hang on because it's not like you can try it again the following year at least with koosman Gafford if you don't get what you want at this deadline you could try to move them in the offseason you could try to move them at a future deadlines you have more time and you don't have to rush through what's likely to be here a couple season rebuild  this is not going to be like oh they blow it up and they're ready to go again next year this is gonna be a couple of years so they don't have to Blitz through it we've seen they're very capable of losing games with both Jordan Poole and Kyle kuzma playing so again they don't have to move these guys same story with Daniel Gafford I think it'll be wise to do so because you accelerate the rebuild and then if there's anybody else you want to get into the game this becomes kind of your time to do it but now we gotta figure out who those guys are  Bilal played 21 minutes and the Wizards last game lost at home to the Minnesota Timberwolves he had four points and one assist and three turnovers  they're still a very large learning curve there and even if he's playing 32 minutes a game I don't know that he gets inside the top 100 and 9 cat  so I think it's worth exploring but I also think that perhaps  we need to be approaching this from a different direction  perhaps the way we need to be looking at this is  is there someone on this team that 100%  steps into value if someone else player b gets moved  and I hate to say it because I detest detest detest is Fantasy game  but the guy that has perhaps the best pathway forward is Marvin Bagley  I can't stand his Fantasy game  but if he's playing starters minutes on a tanking team  he's gonna score and rebound a lot  and there are these little Snippets of bagley's career where you can zoom in on games where he played 30 minutes a night and you can find some pretty big issues with it because his foul shooting is truly awful this year at 52% but that's not where he's going to be he'll eventually get up to like you know probably low 70s  hard to know for sure maybe he's gone full Yips mode there I guess anything is possible but uh you know he shot 82% of the foul line in Detroit earlier this year so I don't think 52% is a long-term thing  and in 29 and a half minutes with the Wizards because most of these games he's been starter minutes two of them he played starter minutes and then the last one Daniel Gafford was in foul trouble so he was like kind of approaching starters minutes bagley's at 18 points and 11 rebounds with a steal and almost a block of game  we've never really seen Marvin play consistent starters minutes the closest we've come was right after Detroit acquired him two years ago  I know it's done feel like it's been that long but it's been that long and the average 15 and 7 with 0.7 steals about 27 minutes a ball game and that was with other guys actually standing upright on the roster if Bagley continues here Gafford gets moved and Jones gets moved  he becomes the sort of untethered third option behind kuzma and  Jordan Poole was terrible  and I can't stand that I'm actually going down this path even in my mind it makes me sick to my stomach  but uh it's actually Bagley  he has a better path  than Bilal who  as much as I want to talk myself into the cool belief thing  his Fantasy game isn't there yet  you're gonna get some Steals and some blocks not as many as it seems like that's the thing too with with cool belief like he's not at a great he's not at a crazy high number of this stuff  he's at 20 some odd white what I say 26 minutes a game already and he's eighteen point eight Steals and point eight blocks obviously full starters minutes one of each is fun but it's not like  you know 1.5 Steals and 1.2 Blocks he's sort of on Pace for about one and one and you know I everybody doesn't love the Danny Green model of one three one steal one block but the problem of course is that if this is a guy who's scoring 11 points a game with five rebounds in one of each you're talking about  well and a horrible free throw percentage you're talking about somebody that is pressing to try to get into the top 100 and just frankly needs to be better at the foul line to do it  all right Dan that's a lot of talking what does this actually mean you're doing is the question that I think you guys are probably wondering now what am I doing well spot for Marvin Bagley I would consider one for Bilal Kula bleeding  between those two I would actually believe it or not leaned Bagley even though I think the odds are that Ty Jones is the guy that gets moved mostly because I don't believe that equitably if you're not punting free throws I don't believe he's a nine cat play  unless two guys on this team get moved  meaning you need kuzma probably and Jones to free up enough usage to get Bilal pushing that top 100 range get him into the you know 11 12 shots a game instead of seven or eight or whatever we're looking at here if only ties Jones gets moved or nine even that's still not enough  we need more than that Kobe Bryant meme more more  what if cusmos the only guy who gets moved I don't know that there's a direct beneficiary it feels like everybody just ends up doing a little bit more  maybe that's finally what it takes to kind of spring Jordan Poole probably not  but that's what you got going down and wizards town right now you got a team leaning hard into the rebuild and then maybe what if everybody gets moved there's no way anyone's taking on Jordan Poole what if kuzma Jones and Gafford all get shuttled out well then be all and Bagley to me become the very obvious Plays Pool ends up doing a lot of Dia becomes an absolute Behemoth in that spot and you might see  someone like oh I don't know  maybe you get Corey kispert playing just enough but that's a fringy fringy option and I don't think you need to go down that path  welcome foolish Mortals to Fantasy NBA today we are officially now welcome you to this show because I didn't do that at the outset and I wanted to get right into it  and I did so no one can  no one can complain that I didn't get into the stuff today huh  that's right I'm Dan Bass Pros

subscribe I have asked for Ratings all that much this year at least not in sort of the traditional sense maybe I'll try to get that late season push going it's late season still mid-season I guess but it feels late had to head side it's kind of late season uh please do take a moment to go drop a thumbs up on our trade deadline live show that link is in the show description I'm also throwing it in the chat room right now for those that are watching with us live and in person I'm desperately trying to get to 500 pre likes on that show it's at 4:49 right now certainly the pace per day has indeed slowed a little bit but you guys can help on that regard by heading over there and making sure to thumbs up our trade deadline live show page it's got a big old picture a d low on the cover since it sure seems like he's likely to be on the move  other stuff to cover today yeah we got a few things to go over and the other one is what happened yesterday its butt box score analysis time on this show and typical recap podcast as well so we can get that going right away and I'll tell you more about some of our partners mid program for now however let's talk about the Washington Wizards in the Timberwolves who played yesterday no Mike Conley was out with a cold Nicole Alexander Walker got another start and it was uninspiring which is sort of what we expected and that means there's nothing we need to discuss on the Minnesota side  now as read I guess maybe I say there's nothing to discuss and then I'm like well wait a minute we should talk about Nazis number one 15 on the year but he's very much a guy who runs in kind of fits and starts when he's good he's good when he's bad he's bad you gotta catch him on the right night he kind of have to hope that you can pull a rabbit out at get him on the you know he's warm day and you didn't hear which is odd because you figured against the Wizards that would be a good time to try it but  not to be I was thinking that scene from Last Action Hero with Arnold where they're showing like all the things all the the movies that he's been in at the beginning the the movie character he's playing and he it's the Arnold character as Macbeth to be all not to be  any flicks a cigar and sets off and explosion and then he says not to be  loved that damn movie  anyway here's the Wizards Daniel Gafford fouled out in 21 minutes that's why Marvin Bagley had 17 and 15 but again like  much as I dislike bagley's Fantasy game if he's gonna get 30 minutes post deadline if Gafford gets moved its juicy time  and then here's Bilal who  you know even in a game where ties Jones wasn't very good Jones at least did get 33 minutes he'll be fine as long as he's sort of still here  and then Jordan Poole I look like I didn't draft him in a single nine category league and I tried to tell you guys not to draft him in a single nine category League he's truthfully one of the worst picks of the last like five to ten years someone that was getting drafted mid-fourth round that just did not perform at all and it's not injury related either like most of the other ones you can trace back to some kind of injury  you know Michael Porter Jr went really early a couple years ago but then he played like three games in his back went out this is just  he's terrible  any who Denny avya keep it rolling kuzma was you know where well rounded in this game and Gafford you're still playing until the trade deadline and blah blah blah let's keep moving there's not a whole lot else to say about the Wizards  Charlotte in Detroit took the loss oh poor Hornets man they're looking to try to blow things up as well they've already moved Terry Rozier we know miles Bridges is on the Block presumably I don't again I don't know what the rules are here but I would assume PJ Washington  because his wasn't extension is was not an extension it was a restricted free agent contract I believe so I think he can get moved  they're going to try to clear the deck all so I had a lot of you in my mentions yelling about how it was Nick Smith Jr season and I was I did a long segment on a show earlier this week about how I was like look even if it is his season as Zen his Fantasy game is not that good well you guys are not in my mentions after this one are you three points in 17 minutes for Nick Smith who very much needs more people out of the way  right now and oh Gordon Hayward is another candidate to get traded if he ever is healthy enough to play again  in terms of who you're playing for Charlotte right now I don't know that I'm starting PJ Washington I know he had a better ball game here but the Pistons defense had a lot to do with that if he's coming off the bench and basically soaking up Nick Richards leaving for the most part that to me is not quite enough  for PJ on a night tonight basis he also shot the ball well but only six field goal attempts here you made four three-pointers everything had to break his way  so you're going Nick Richards you're going Brandon Miller who's kind of beginning to show signs of figuring things out a little all right you know he'll cool off at some point but like there's just there's more than enough usage for him so that's an obvious yes and then of course lamelo Ball but to me that's as far as you need to go  and then Detroit also a mess leading up to the trade deadline of course the difference for the Pistons is that they're tradable assets are basically Alec Burks and boy on bug zdanowicz and we heard a story this morning about how they don't want to move those guys and it's like what the hell are we even doing here Monte Morris came back and played 11 minutes but he's not his Fantasy game is not good and I don't think he's gonna get enough minutes to matter and presumably he's also on the Block secretly or otherwise  and you guys keep yelling at me about Jaden Ivy and I'm just gonna keep saying the same thing over and over again he is a points League Behemoth with Cade Cunningham out and he struggles in nine cat because his free throw percent is God awfully turns the ball over a lot and his field goal percent is not a positive either  he's averaging 25 and 6 over the last six ball games and he's ranked outside the top 200 how because he's at one point one combined defensive stats negative 45% from the field on 17 shots big negative  63% free throw big negative three turnovers medium negative  those are more negatives than positives  I don't know what to tell you guys that's just math  and yell at me all you want but the math is the math for a reason  I get it  subtleties in the rank board exists but when you're ranked outside the top 200 that's bad and anyway Kate's coming back here possibly as soon as their next ball game so the whole thing's gonna get flipped on its head Isaiah Stewart said a couple decent ones lately this one was more his his kind of more traditional like 10 points and some medium number of rebounds in a three-pointer kind of game  no pass acid Thompson who I'm very interested in down the stretch but not yet pass Burks I'll play until Cade comes back  really the only guys that like once things resettle here it's Duran Bugatti and Cade Cunningham those are the three guys you're starting on the Pistons and you don't have to worry about a whole lot else  Grizzlies beat the Heat  silly expression got themselves a cold pack beat the Heat this summer  feel like I'm doing a a bit Miami is lost for games in a row and this one is sort of an unacceptable loss as they fall now into a tie with the Pacers who are also losing because they're down Halliburton and their magic or losing  and the Hawks or always I mean this is like the the middle crust of the East is in a rough way right now Vince Williams with everybody heard literally everyone know Luke Kennard no Santi aldama so the Grizzlies were down two more people in this game JJJ played but he was the only player that Miami was focused on defensively bam out of Bio everybody else was swarming him and he had a bad ballgame as a result so other guys had to step up and they did Vince Williams Junior he's a play every day Luke Kennard when he comes back as a play every day  and I'll say so okay very short term  when we know John contractor can put up like kind of quiet nine cat numbers he had 11 and 10 here with a three a steal and a block on good percentage is  you know that's conchar is probably playable so long as Luke Kennard is out because he's kind of like the next guy up for that particular roster slot  David Roddy had an okay game typically his Fantasy game is just three pointers so I'm not that tempted to go down the David Roddy path and then Xavier Tillman who had a really nice line and only 18 minutes off the bench but my takeaway from this game in addition to the fact that you're you're rolling Vince wiliams and conchar is your Kennard fill in who was already a filling for no Desmond Bane who and so on and so forth my takeaway is that as soon as salty Alma is healthy he's a guy that looks like the Grizzlies are going to want to get involved  because my initial thought process and this is Miami that so like bam adebayo is a large front Court player he's not a like a post player in the traditional sense  but he's big  and  The Grizzlies at least for this game we're comfortable saying all right JJ he's your guy in the starting lineup and Jerry Jackson got a annihilated by bam but you know I thought that Tillman would get the start and they'd let JJ deal with you know hey would Heisman or something like that  but Tillman didn't get to play all that much and maybe some of that is injury related maybe it's because he's on the Block and they don't want him to get reinjured  but suffice it to say I am currently pretty excited about Santi aldama the rest of the year  and I know he's hurt he's dealing with this sword knee's  but based on what we saw yesterday the fact that even with aldama Outlets if you're Tillman didn't get a bump in minutes that tell me that went out almost back he's gonna be getting 25 to 32 minutes most games  and you know we need his percentages to be a little bit better than they were but in my eyes that means aldama is one of my favorite it's not even a stash anymore active stash is what we like to call him he's my favorite Act of stash right now because it's like the Grizzlies are pivoting in his Direction kind of regardless of who else is available for them right now  and aldama does have some interesting fantasy upside if the percentages are not that terrible which they are kind of terrible right now but let's say they come back a little towards you know where he was last year  this is a guy who can put up  very well rounded lines you can score you can board you can pass you can steal he can block you can hit three pointers you just need the percentages to not be a train wreck  and you're talking about a guy with some kind of decent fantasy upside you guys might remember the beginning of last year  remember the beginning of last year  where JJ was out and not for nearly as long as any of us suspected and myself included I thought Brandon Clark was gonna get to play a bunch but it ended up being this donkey aldama show at the beginning of last season  JJ came back like four or five weeks into the year but that first little bit less than a month for all dhamma  he played well he had nice lines steals blocks threes  yeah he was doing it all and he in my eyes is probably getting better year over year so if you look at the games were all Thomas played 30 minutes the lines are pretty consistently good  and that's kind of what you're looking for here can he get all the way to 30 I don't know but in my eyes it's worth a try to me this is one of the biggest stories from last night that the other big men for the Grizzlies didn't really play all that much and it's like they're just keeping the seat warm for aldama  this is game one for Terry Rozier in Miami and it was generally kind of ugly Caleb Martin and Bam out of Bio had decent games and everybody else stunk and this is gonna happen for a few week or two while they work in their new piece specially because the rest of the heat are in a in a serious rut right now  when jaimez comes back there is I mean it may be you see him start for Heisman but I don't know that there's enough for him so I think you can probably punt on everybody that's not one of the main heat guys now and that includes Caleb Martin who I know I had a good ball game yesterday in 29 minutes off the bench but I don't think that we can count on that you definitely not adding Josh Richardson he was starter in name only here he's sort of place holding for a Rosier and  that's I think where you just settle it you just go with the four names  and don't worry about anything else  yes Houston not a good look here Rocket's now 20 and 23 they've really fallen on hard times and teams like the Jazz and the Lakers are very grateful because that's allowing them despite all so kind of muddling through it to maintain their play in spots  Portland beats Houston in overtime oops that's a bad win for the Blazers too they got to remember to keep losing ball games but DeAndre ayton finally busted out that's much needed after some very quiet ball games Anthony Simons blessed it out Jeremy Grant busted out Malcolm Brogden filling in for shade and sharp busted out I did a big segment on Jabari Walker and everybody got mad at me again because I said all right well like you know let's keep it together this is a guy in my eyes that  really needs Jeremy Grant to get moved for me to feel super comfortable about it because when sharp comes back he takes Brogden spots so even if Brogden gets moved to the deadlines that sort of a one-to-one flip there and there's not quite enough usage of available at the moment for Jabari Walker to hold consistent fantasy value  so let's assume Brogden gets moved sharp comes back that's sort of a wash scoots gonna play more as the season goes so where is this extra playing time in usage gonna come from for Walker  I wish I had an obvious answer like maybe Matisse died will gets moved and that's a couple extra minutes but it's not like there's usage coming from Bible he hated he takes none he says no usage we need a usage guy out of the way and the only reasonable one to move would be Jeremy Grant but he's on a contract for the next half decade that is a difficult player to move  so I like Jabari Walker just fine I just think that he's probably going to be quietly punching along as like a 100 to 140 range guy and I don't see a big upward leap coming for him anytime super soon trade deadline or not  as far as the Rockets go Jeff Green got the start for Jabari Smith Jr Rockets are flailing right now they are getting a lot of production from Freddie Van Fleet and outrage and goon and not enough for everybody else and frankly not enough defense  the defense has completely vanished for this Houston team and I don't know that Jabari Smith Jr is the obvious answer I just think that teams have kind of figured out how to counter with the Rockets are doing and teams are scoring at will  it's not all on Chene certainly some of it is and it's not like they have a better option there because he's one of the two guys doing anything on offense for the team right now although credit to Jalen green he did have a slightly better shooting game for once  the team just has no depth and it caught up with them they're exhausted at least everybody that is not sort of used to the Grind of an NBA season and so they're not gardening anybody right now  whoopsies tari Eason gonna fix that I don't know he'll help  Milwaukee game one under Joe prunty while they wait on installing Doc Rivers who got himself a four year 40 million dollar contract  oh my goodness  I don't know what to tell you folks anyway hey Max Drew's over 50% again slowly he turns inch by inch screws back up to number one oh nine on the year he's shooting 40 and a half percent  ever so close to being in every day start  again again hang on  Jared Allen continues to punch along here Donovan Mitchell had sort of a weird shooting game struggled a bit careful it came back that I guess that was something same Merit four more three-pointers you guys don't want me to just narrow what happened yesterday that's not a distressing I think you can start Levert until Darius Garland comes back it's like Spruce now started all Again Sam Merrill I just if you need three three pointers on any given night and you're not worried about the other things that might come from this player then I guess that makes sense  I don't I mean we didn't really see any large-scale changes for the bucks yesterday compared to what they normally do this is just a team getting sort of like the coaching bounce the Wake Up Call game  I'm not gonna make any adjustments to the Bucks unless something forces me to with or without Doc Rivers  Devin Booker another Giant game he's mad lately Bookers On The Rise he's back up to number 18 after he had fallen into the early third round and you know this is how the season goes guys get hot guys cool off he's in a in the middle of a massive heater right now if you can sell Booker for a mid-second you probably do it but also at the same time like he's still fine it'll be fine even when he cools off a little he'll be fine just a massive massive game 46 points on 23 shots  Bradley Beal he's settled in Grayson Allen's a hole in the hole KD was due for a slightly quieter ball game this was a Starker cooldown than I expected but he's still number nine so I don't think we're worried about it Dallas side Kyrie missed this ball game he was dealing with a sprained thumb he said he'd be fine after the last ball game but then he ended up needing a day off so hopefully he'll be back pretty soon Luka Tim Hardaway Jr Derek Lively those are the three guys I would consider  Lively got eaten alive by the Suns and shouldn't be all that surprising I do still think that Dallas badly needs to upgrade and maybe Lively ends up being a really good basketball player I know they're excited about him  and I like his Fantasy game he reminds me a lot of like early Nick Clarkston  who's not like an old customer but he's been around for a few years now but the maps are not going anywhere this year with a rookie as their big man and the sort of mishmash of wing depth they have they need to figure out how to consolidate into better players  which is why I keep thinking they got to go get someone like a Daniel Gafford or click up Pella or some more reputable big man that isn't gonna make the rookie mistakes they're Lively's making  and he's making a lot of them again they liked him a lot and he's their best option at Center but that says a lot of not good great things about their other Center options  Dante Exum came back played 18 and a half minutes off the bench I don't think he ultimately gets inside the top 100 and frankly I don't think any of the stream or types get inside the top 100 long-term in the very short term with Kyrie out Hardaway is the one that I'd be looking at  Chet and Wendy went to head yesterday and Chet's team is a lot better but when we posted the more exotic fantasy line which is kind of this story here lately this year Victor has actually passed Chet in nine cat rankings Wendy's up to number 13 now thanks to a hot shooting stretch chat is down to number 19 which we always kind of figured his free throw number is at 78 instead of 90 where it was early this year the rest of his stuff feels relatively repeatable you know I don't see any reason why he should fall out the top 25 or 30 we all started that one banyan's minutes limit might be getting raised up which is another very nice feather in his cap my goodness like these really gonna do more  it's kind of amazing I did not think that Wendy was gonna get into the first round in his rookie season mostly because I thought he was gonna have a trois field goal issues and giant turnovers and I thought you know I'd start to run down a little but they've been able to throttle him back and he just goes so hard in the minute he's on the court that that's worked out great for fantasy  now you guys know I can't stand the rest of the Spurs from a fantasy standpoint as far as the Thunder go there like they have no news every single night Aaron Wiggins got hot but who cares  as far as the Spurs go you got the good Devin vassell game that's notable because he had been pretty cold this pushed him back up into the 60s on the year he's hovering a little bit behind his 80P but not by much and  I mean look at the rest of this mess no trade Jones Blake Wesley started point he did have six assists but he shot five for five so you're not gonna believe that that'll happen again  Malachi Branham at 11 points don't care that Colin 17 minutes don't care there's a lot I don't care for me Kelvin Johnson 19 minutes he's basically been phased out might even be a candidate to get traded I don't know that it matters if the Spurs trade people because they're veterans are not really playing anyway  hold on to trade Jones he's been playing well prior to this injury Zach Collins is just a weapon Yama fill in vessel is doing fine still think of you can sell on him it wouldn't be the worst idea in the world but it'll probably be okay and then everything else is so settled that there isn't anything you could do about it  before we get to Atlanta and Golden State because I do think there are a couple of angles in that late ball game just a quick reminder everybody to please it

you can see that the capella O'Connor continues to kind of tip  I've got to think that Atlanta has exploring capella trades even if they're not super vocal about it  we know Deonte Murray's on the Block  and you know Jean's taking a lot of shots right now he's up near you know 20 shots of ball game but that's why I'll trade is out on the year he's at 17 and a half you drop those back into the pool with everybody else I mean look Jalen Johnson took 16 shots yesterday I had 12 Bogden only 11 he's a guy you could see a little bit of an uptick there but you dropped Jean-Marie shots back into this the pool with everybody else and that helps a lot of guys as you're kind of seeing here with Trey young out a lot of very fringy fantasy players look playable and I'll tell you if DeAndre Hunter was healthy he'd be another guy that's probably playable when one of the superstars is out and that's kind of what it sounds like is about to happen if Murray gets moved try Young's gonna do a bazillion things and then Jalen Johnson is already a go Bogdan bogdanovich will get plenty of usage every day he might even be the starter or is it Hunter even said he'd pay who somehow been like the most fringy borderline fill in player the entire damn season basically since Jalen Johnson got hurt like three weeks into the year someone's been out to clear the way for him and if the next person to be out is Deonte Murray said he could maintain value we know the main guys will Johnson booked zdanowicz Trae Young  hoping that oh Kong season uptick there and then Hunter who I mentioned on a stash show yesterday as somebody that I would strongly consider sticking on a bench because if you put an extra two shots in his bucket that's all we're talking about here not like three four five extra I'm talking about one and a half for two extra shots for Hunter then he gets inside the top 100 so there are a lot of options here in Atlanta as the trade dying lot deadline approaches I think you know I I probably still prefer Santi aldama we're talking about things to do as you're listening to the podcast but the under Hunter like he was just outside the top 100 with the team mostly healthy so  put them in a similar spot with Murray's Usage Now split among the crew and it almost feels like a given that he moves up a little bit  now for the Warriors we got massive Jonathan coming today  and this is one of those ones that's that's going to be hard to talk about because  it's going to sound like I'm going buzzkill mode but it's not about being a buzzkill it's about kind of understanding you know what a player actually is as a supposed to what they did on a given night  over the last three weeks coming goes inside the top 75 is it 18.5 points five and a half boards and not much else on a sleep a three 1.2 combined defensive stats but each shooting 61% over that stretch and 82% at the free throw line so he's become a big positive in uh well both  percentages in a way that is just frankly not sustainable like as much as we may or may not like kaminga Fantasy game he's not gonna shoot 62% long-term  he might be in the 50s you know 50 some odd for the season and if you look at previous years he's been about 52 throughout his career  but mid-60s is not gonna happen and frankly from the free throw line he's at 71% this year but 68 for his career he probably didn't just magically become a mid-80s free throw shooter either  come as problem is was has been and probably will continue to be that he doesn't get nearly as many defensive stats as it looks like he should get he doesn't pass and he's rebounding is only kind of okay so where is the big massive push gonna come it's just kind of hard to see now after a giant ball game like this one it feels sort of nuts to say well you shouldn't at least like give it a try on the head-to-head side and see what's going down but also we need to remember Draymond Green only played 23 minutes that's going up Dario charged played only 16 minutes which can't get a whole lot lower cavoni only played 10 minutes which again all so can't really get much lower so this is kind of like a best case scenario for kaminga who in mid to high 20s and minutes  probably gets into like the one 25 to 150 range  but fantasy holes are the thing that you're gonna be looking at so head-to-head go ahead pick him up see what happens Roto  he's also the Warriors best trade ship if they really wanted to go all in here  we'll see I don't think Brandon projects he needs to be rostered I think he's gasped I think the Warriors have sort of their guys back and they're trying different things right now and they beat up on a bad Hawks team  Klay Steph Drake those guys are the obvious choices and then the only other one you're even thinking about not Wiggins not charged not pajam ski is kaminga who again Rodeo I don't think I'm doing it head-to-head you might as well see what happens the holes in his Fantasy game are less annoying on the head-to-head side as you can just sort of roll up stats and not worry about where he might be a negative and so that's why I think I'm probably okay with that decision  and that is your combo
