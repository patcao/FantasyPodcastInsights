welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast I cannot believe you guys talk to me into this episode this is not the way I like to operate  I like to celebrate the wins I like to avoid the losses you guys know that's the Dan best person method we don't take chances on draft night  so that we can avoid possible pitfalls  so that a show like this if it feels like I'm clowning on anybody who took a chance a chance  but that's not what this is  it's not it's because I did a show about a month ago on the best picks of the year and a bunch of the folks in the chat room and in the comments were like now you got to do the worst I was like I don't really want to do that  and then they say yes you do and I said no I don't and they said  you come on man do the thing it's all right fine  so we're doing the worst picks of the year today in this little one-off episode maybe we'll do another one of these at the end of the season I want to keep it light this should be with levity this show is not to make fun of anybody who ended up with these these people on their teams it is not to make anyone feel small for taking a chance and ending up with someone like one of these players on their teams this is so that we can laugh about it  as it happens  as it happens I don't have that many of these guys in the old man squad  but that's the thing we get a few of the hits not all of them but we get very few of the Colossal misses that's the old man way you don't take massive chances because you don't want to lose your season on draft night so I don't want anybody to think that this is like me clown on other people it's not this is By Request we're going to have a little fun it's going to be silly we're gonna laugh I hope maybe cry a little  anyway uh welcome to Fantasy NBA today I'm Dan best briefs this is the worst picks of the Season as we approach the trade deadline I figured this was the reasonable time of year to do it  you guys already know who the number one is but we're not gonna start at number one we're gonna start at number three because there are three of them today and number three is scoot Henderson  yeah  yeah  um  there are some good guesses by the way if you're watching live or even in the comment section I would love to hear more opinions on this  in the chat room someone already mentioned Andrew Wiggins as a possibility and yes he was very much close  he is not number one he is not number two he is not number three scoot Henderson is number three and I wanted to make an example of a poor rookie on this because I thought look if I can take anything out of this show and if I can impart some kind of wisdom it's don't spend a top one 100 pic on a rookie ball handler  it doesn't work scoot Anderson at an 80 of 96.7 which effectively makes him an eighth rounder  and his her game ranked on Yahoo right now is 373  which is  a not very subtle way of saying you're better off just taking zeroes out of that roster slot  better off taking 0's  scoot is averaging 12.2 points 3 rebounds four and a half assists point six Steals and 0.3 blocks with three turnovers 78 and a half percent feel free throw and 37% from the field you have to be punting about eight out of the nine categories for scoot to be a net gain the one you would not be punting would be the 4.6 assists this does not preclude scoot from having a good second well it's less than a half now how far along are we today 56 57% through the year so this doesn't preclude scoot from having a decent last 40% of the year I would venture to Guess that he'll probably have a pretty good last 15 to 20%  but so far he's in the top three because you spent an eighth round on it  and I get it you're like well come on Eighth round what is that even really mean well I have bad news for all of you it means a lot because the other guys with an ADP near that point which I think let's see we'll pull this number up here and  make sure we get that the names right that you could have drafted around where scoot went at again 96 and change  oh there we go now I started alright DeAngelo Russell Jonas Fallon chunis Jabari Smith Jr  Keegan Murray  you go way farther down the board and find some very juicy names Trey Jones who's picked it up here lately again this is 96 these are guys that go in 8th round or thereabouts  Derek white was at 87 Austin Reeves Mark Williams before he went down Jalen Duren at 93 Tobias Harris at 90  I know this it can feel a tiny bit overwhelming where the hell is Daniel Gafford and all this isn't he somewhere in this mix 100 dado Gafford was at 100.8  so this was not a throwaway pick  and that's why I don't feel that guilty about putting scoot on this board because it wasn't so far down the list it wasn't like pick one 25 when you're starting to get into the drugs and you're like wow you take a shot whatever happens happens  school was earlier than that school was right in there with Gafford  ahead of him I had him  I got two people in the chat room right now saying he went in the sixth round ahead of jailyne Willie's ahead of Anfernee Simons  thank you to one more posture and I know I'm interacting a lot on this one because I'm trying to I'm trying to make it fun this is an interactive one I we're gonna have a good time Kenji points out  yeah I mean these are guys that I yell about not drafting rookie ball handlers but again so like this one  I  kind of chat room they're talking about me he writes scoot my  life that's amazing  um  so this one I thought I could impart a lesson along with it the lesson here is you just don't take a shot on rookie ball handlers inside the top 100 you don't do it  I had Chad Holmgren on my old man squad born and I explained in excruciating detail why that one is so different and then when is just sort of his own  Universe of pick but you don't want someone who is at the mercy of a horrible field goal percent or extremely high turnovers unless there's going to be something that's so over the moon about them that they can wipe that out and for most of these guys it isn't the case some people in their minds they think back they're like oh yeah Trey young didn't he have a good rookie year know he was dog due through February  he got really good the last month and a half  that's like your best case scenario for these guys  number two will surprise a few of you and it is Josh giddey  some good guesses in the chat room  you haven't I mean you guys all know who number one is but number two I think this is the one that's going to surprise a few people no one's really noticed  how bad Josh Getty's been this year but I want to make sure you all know notice it today because Josh had an 80P of 58.9 that's a fifth rounder and he's currently ranked number one 100 and 167 in nine category League's  on 24 and change minutes per ball game his minutes have gone down his production has gone down  he's been largely healthy so at least I guess there's that which you can't actually say for scoot he missed a bunch of time early in the year so please get he's been healthy  but I wanted to try to avoid putting guys in  this list this top three that were punch type guys and scoot's not a punt guy like I said you basically have to punt gate categories for him to be a winner and forget it you basically have to punch seven  he is subleague average in scoring threes steals blocks field goal percent turnovers by a little  neutral in free-throw percent and a slight positive and rebounding and assists  that's not a guy you're trying to get in the fifth round  that might be a guy that could like say okay well I maybe I can build a little bit around this if I draft a bit like 130 but that ain't gonna fly in the 5th round  notable players who were going around Josh giddey in the draft this year Brooke Lopez Franz Vagner Jalen Williams  Rudy gobert you want to go farther down the board or farther up the board either way you're going to feel terrible about it up the board Jared Allen shingun Nick klaxon OG Anna Nobi  who is now getting going  this was I mean listen I don't think I have to convince you guys that someone you're drafting inside the top 60 was a throwaway pick this was like a critical fifth round Guy this is where who else won in the fifth round Scotty freaking Barnes one in the fifth round people like you could have had a first rounder here Tyrese Maxey went in the fifth round people  admittedly they were towards the front end of it  giddy was towards the back end but you catch my meaning this was not a throwaway moment  this is a guy that people were hoping would give them top 50 production and he has been outside of about a week and a half like two weeks ago  not playable in nine category leaks not really playable and points leagues either  like if you drafted him in points League he's like well you know at least his turn over his percentage is the hold him down but other stuff is gonna be good now the other stuff is not very good either  even if you wipe out those three you still only have two positives left out of the remaining six categories  that's not good enough  now this is another one  where I thought this was a relatively easy handy cap and totally different reason than the scoot Henderson won that one was an easy handicap because rookie ball handler for giddy it was like look all these guys are getting better around him where exactly is the extra stuff going to be happening for giddy is he gonna be running the team know it's gonna be Shay's team Jalen Williams is gonna do more when you chat we're going to come in he was gonna do a bunch of stuff they had other dudes that they were just adding to the mix so I thought like best case scenario was getting repeats what he did last year which was like 1:15 ish range okay fine not that's like borderline startable but not a guy you take in the top 6 0  by the way more guesses coming in in the chat room I want to try to address those as they come through Walker Kessler no not on the board here because as annoying as he's been to Ruster  he's not even remotely close to his far down the board is these guys Kessler's number 81 he's a seventh rounder who was drafted in the fourth round not good  but not a team breaker the way that these names have been because scoot you spend an eighth round pick on it you you hurt your team  giddy a 5th rounder that has not been startled and finally the number one that we can all laugh about together yes everybody knows where this is going  Jordan Poole Jordan Poole Jordan Poole who is making a strong case to be labeled the worst player in the NBA and it's not because he has less Talent than other dudes in the NBA it's because on a nightly basis I just can't think of players who make more bad decisions than Jordan Poole  he's played in 45 games so far this year and I can count on one hand the number of times I thought Jordan Poole looked like he was doing today  he's averaging 16 and a half points two three-pointers you like oh okay Dan that we're getting somewhere 2.2 rebounds and starters minute it's 3.4 assists as a guard in starter's minutes  a steal  okay  0.4 blocks I don't actually even know where those came from but you'll take them 41% pretty good volume from the field 87% of the free throw line that was supposed to be a Saving Grace but he's only taking three of them a game  ranked 170 with an easy 80P of 47 point five on message from the chat room says he can create his own shots he just can't hit a single one of them  I'm really enjoying the chat room by the way  so good I can't put them all on the screen and I can't read them all fast enough but you guys are awesome this is exactly what I was hoping for from this show let's just all have a good laugh about it I am eternally grateful that Jordan Poole was a guy I listed as a stay away guy on this podcast specifically because there was always this this this fleeting hope that was  what if Jordan Poole takes 25 shots a game what if he takes 205 shots a game and averages 30 points a night because there's just nobody else there that was the upside  and if that clicked then you're talking about a guy that justified his fourth round 80P because that was like okay this guy could be top 25 in a perfect world but we had just literally just seen it last year that Jordan Poole has gaping messy holes in his Fantasy game and yes I said that in a discussing way just to make sure you guys were paying attention last year with the Warriors he averaged 20 points a game and he was still just barely inside the top 50  it wasn't like he wasn't getting opportunity with the Warriors in an offense that was built to get everybody wide open at the three-point line  and he was still a train wreck  bad defensive stats bad rebounding bad turnovers horrible field goal percent  he had so far to go he needed to get back to his percentages from the previous year on a higher volume and I thought to myself  nah  now I'll admit when draft season opened  when draft season opened Jordan Poole had a pre-rank on Yahoo in the 60s and at that spot I said all right I might think about this because I was a sixth rounder and again six round is not a throwaway pick but I thought like perfect universe  top 25 top 30  terrible Universe top one 50 I could justify that type of risk in the sixth round I cannot ever justify that kind of risk in the fourth round and you guys definitely don't need me to go through the dudes that were getting drafted near Jordan Poole because you already heard me talk about Tyreese Maxine Scotty Barnes and they went behind him other guys that were drafted almost in a dead Heat  if you were just like take somebody boring  poor thing is Jamal Murray vooch DeRozan  oh yeah it hurts I know I shouldn't even do this part of the exercise  the nice thing about all of this of today's show is that I have one  on like nine cash teams I have one of any of these guys and it's Jordan Poole on an 11 cat League where I thought his volume would be good enough and even there he's been a disaster well I was I was punting field goal percent and all I wanted was a guy who was gonna take a ton of shots and then miss however many of them and he didn't even  he didn't even not even taking shots  you guys really wanted me to have Andrew Wiggins on this list but he's not gonna be their honorable mentions and I didn't want to put these on the main board because I thought they'd be kind of an uncool move and so I put them on a side slide here that I'm calling did you think this was a points League  and these were guys that should have been pretty obvious but they had ideas Zion Williamson Paulo Bunker Hill RJ Barrett Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle these guys got drafted somewhere across the board even in nine category leagues yes even Julius Randle folks in the chat room he's ranked I think outside the top one 20 but again these are honorable mentions only because their their numbers are so heavily  on being bad at one specific category  so that's that's the issue there like Julius randle's number one 20 but he's very good in points boards assists  bad and defensive stats he's bad because he's bad in the three points League categories and Paula moncaro is bad at the three points League categories in RJ Barrett same story Zion bad in two of them Clarkson bad and two of them this is  these guys don't count these guys I can't call them the worst pics of the year because presumably if you were drafting them you were either a in a points League or B like if you're drafting Zion you were punting for you throws if you're drafting if Randall you were probably hunting free throws if you're drafting Clarkson you'll probably punching field goal like these were guys not like the ones we just discussed scoot giddy pool those guys are not good basically no matter what your punting these are the weirdo punt guys who still get drafted in 9 cats even when teams are not really punting and I don't fully understand it but I wanted to get him on the board and Andrew Wiggins probably does belong on some kind of honorable mention here think about Wiggins is that  he was drafted pretty late like right around right around scoot  and  technically he's been a little bit better than Scoot and Scoot was number three on this list so Wiggins couldn't possibly have been in the top three if you guys sort of follow the circuitous logic of getting there so if Wiggins was slightly better than Scoot and Scoot was the last name I got on this board then he couldn't have done it so yes if there was an honorable mention slide Wiggins would almost definitely be on it but I didn't do an honorable mention slide because I don't know I felt like I had picked on enough people all ready and that was that all right thank you chat rumors that was really fun I loved seeing you guys just yelling in all caps about this stuff I would encourage anybody who finds this show after the fact post some comments if you guys want to like vent about someone else you drafted if you take issue with the way I rank these guys whatever this was supposed to be silly and fun I hope it was I didn't mean to make anybody feel bad let's have a lovely rest of our whatever the hell they of the week this is it's Tuesday but you can listen to this anytime you want and we back tomorrow to
