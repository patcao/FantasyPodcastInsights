welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  all right let's get this party started everybody we have no games to recap from Tuesday so we kind of needed to have a little bit of a different  plan going into Today's Show and that plan is we have a massive 14 game Wednesday to preview so that'll chew up a few minutes but I thought we could do a little bit of a player Deep dive on a few guys that you all listed on Twitter  by the way as I'm opening the show we just got word that Walker Kessler got downgraded to doubtful so I had briefly considered making him one of the player deep Dives but now that he's probably not even playing tonight we're going to go ahead and leave that one out  reason behind some of this thought process for me just in case anybody cares and I don't know that you guys do but I want to get more specialty programming on our YouTube page so yesterday we had a buyer sell show with Raphael Johnson seemed like folks enjoyed that I looked around the YouTube space and the podcast space for how other content creators are doing this buy and sell thing and it does seem like for the most part they split it into two separate shows there's buy show and a sell show so perhaps we'll do that going forward allows us to focus a little bit more time on each individual player we don't have to sort of zip through the names the way that we kind of did yesterday with Roth  but I want to do some buy shows I want to do some sell shows  I'd like to do we already have our weekly preview show with their ball that's every Monday afternoon we have our Friday weekend review show which is good we don't currently have a waiver wire show you used to have that here at sports ethos it was behind the paywall  and for a long time that was run by Erica Ong who had been with sports he was for very long time what am I good buddies in the industry but that doesn't exist right now so perhaps we'll get that one mixed in I don't know if the weekend is feasible but that would be the right time to do it because folks are making their waiver claims on Sunday they're just a lot of other I thought kind of specialty shows that were not doing right now that I'd like to do as part of this sort of growing offering as I focus even more on podcasts videocast things of that nature so hopefully with a little thought I can come up with a few more things if you guys have ideas of shows that I haven't thought of feel free to throw them in the live chat you can also hit those with me or hit those hit me with those over on social media at Dan Vespers d a n b e s b r i s on Twitter where I hope I will certainly see many or all of you guys that listen to and watch this show  this is of course fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation make sure to join us over in the ethos Discord a link that I have now confirmed works both in the live chat in the show description on Twitter wherever you guys want to find it come hang out with us over there I'd also like to mention here before we dive into the Wednesday preview as the first part of today's show that Bruno and I are doing our first Secret Show today the only way to get on the mailing list for The Secret show is to sign up for said mailing list there is no other way to get the link other than you know obviously somebody passing it along to you the link to that I just put in the live chat I threw it up on the screen YouTubers you can cut and paste that it's a mailer Lite sign up form join our email list you will get the link to my secret show with brewski we're going to be doing these periodically throughout the year again the only way to get those is to either be a premium subscriber that costs money joining the mailing list does not cost any money those are the two ways you can get that link to see our secret shows  first things first however on this program we have a colossal Wednesday to go over so let's start looking at some of that  make sure that I get my face in the right place on the YouTube screen there's really no right place for this space but let's just go through it top to bottom because there's a bazillion things going on tonight 208 of the 30 NBA teams play this evening which means we'll have some things to go over and a couple of explanations to why we're looking in certain directions from the top mostly chronologically the Wizards will start with the Wizards Daniel Gafford had his first really nice Ball Game of the Year his last time out can he do that again is sort of a simple question on that one Jordan Poole we're going to talk about later in the show he's one of the underperformers so far so I don't want to spend too much time on him right now during this Wednesday preview part but the big question I think with pool is  is it a Buy Low or is it just that he's not going to get anywhere near his ADP and that's what we're gonna be determining on three names later on today  for the Hornets the only real question mark is Brandon Miller he got a spot start with Terry Rozier missing their last ball game it's seems like Terry is probably going to miss another one can can Brandon succeed where he failed last time around is it the players around him does it create sort of this usage hole that he was able to soak up when he was coming off the bench we'll get a better idea of that after game two  Celtics Derek white not with the team at shoot around but he is expected to join the team ahead of the game coming up later tonight that was all so what we heard about Monday's game and then he did not join the team before that one so I wouldn't say that it's set in stone if he sits out Al Horford potentially gets into the mix oh and we just got news breaking 30 seconds ago that Draymond Green is expected to be out for tonight's ball game for the Warriors due to personal reasons so that'll change what we're looking for in that Warriors game later on  Sixers  that should be a fun ball game by the way Boston 2 Point Road favorites at Philadelphia Philly we're looking to see what Nic Batum who seems to be the new guy who got the minutes in their last ball game I don't know if that's something that continues here but we'll keep one eye on him I don't think the platoon's Gonna Get Enough consistent playing time to be worth your your while and we see every time with the Clippers at least every time he started to get more consistent playing time something started to hurt on him well more than anything we wanted to know is this going to mess up Kelly oubre  he had a bad ball game I would argue Kelly is kind of first bad ball game of the year his last time out but unfortunately it it ran right in conjunction with Nick Button getting to do stuff  which was good sort of find the open space quick trigger 3 kind of thing do they need as much scoring out of Aubrey as or they didn't even scoring out of that spot in their roster as Uber was providing and then does he end up moving back to the bench which is probably good for Kelly this is all stuff that we want to pay attention to over on that Billy side along with whether or not the Anthony Melton can get his minutes up and over 28 in this sort of lower usage role for him behind MB behind Maxi behind Tobias Harris behind Kelly oubre even for shots we can't it's not going to get done in 2425 minutes the way that it did in Memphis when he was coming off the bench and able to take a bunch of shots in a row and kind of run things a little bit he's not having that opportunity now in a way that we expected him too so we need more minutes out of D'Anthony meldon I want to give it as much time as humanly possible though because we know that if he starts to figure out his place with this team with this roster with this construction it can get good really quickly I want to miss it  well I was gonna ask about Walker Kessler on the Jazz but since he's now downgraded to doubtful I'm gonna assume he's missing tonight's ball game the other thing on Utah and I'll say it as many times as it needs to be said before everybody listens to me  Jordan Clarkson and Taylor Horton Tucker are not worth your time in nine category leaks  tht I feel like a lot of you would argue the THC had a pretty good start to the year like he's done more than people expected he's number one in 177 Jordan Clarkson one would certainly argue has had a very bad start to the year so it's not like we can say hey he's been good and he's still this low he's been awful and he's number three and eight he's doing so much damage to your fantasy team that whatever small amount of good he's doing which right now is assists that's the only category where Clarkson is above League average one out of nine mind you he's shooting 34 and a half percent from the field that'll get better 75 at the free-throw percent or at the free-throw line that'll also get a little bit better although he's not a positive free throw impact guys kind of a neutral one from the guard spot three and a half turnovers a game 0.6 steals only three and a half rebounds only 13 and a half points yes some of this stuff is gonna get better for Clarkson but even in a good scenario we're still talking 120 to 160 range  I don't think these guys need to be on fantasy teams and I'm just gonna keep saying it over and over and over again until you all believe me your team will get better  when you move on from these dudes you will win more  by the Pistons just signed Kevin Knox to a one-year deal at no one should care at all  Pacers Lord I wish we had something to pay attention to on this Indiana team I guess we could say that Bruce Brown inconsistency is something we can pay attention to because he's number one thirty two right now in 30 minutes a game I thought we'd see more assists out of Bruce the 12 points and two three-pointers and four rebounds is around what I thought we'd get I thought we'd get more than two and a half assists and perhaps that's a byproduct of playing on a team where Tyreese Halliburton is initiating most of the stuff on offense as opposed to kind of looking a little bit more at last year where the yogic offense was  everybody sort of past past past past and that's how we ended up at three and a half a system ball game last season but the other thing with Bruce Brown I think is gonna get better he hasn't blocked a shot lit yet this year  and it's not like he's a massive shop blocker but he's averaged about point six blocks in 25 minutes per game over his career so you gotta figure that in 30 minutes a game which by the way this season is the most he's played that number should at least be around his career Mark kind of the way this steals is right now steals have point nine his career Market is point nine in 24 and a half ish what I say 25 minutes a game so maybe that's a number that even takes up to 1.1 ish like what it was in Denver last year  if we just assume the assists stay constant and the scoring stays constant the one thing that moves him from where he is now which again not great 132 but half a block a game basically two blocks a week is enough to move him to the top 100 that's all it takes for guys in that range it's these small very small almost microscopic shifts and if he ends up somehow getting an extra assist ball game and he becomes 12 for and three and a half with a steel half a block in two three-pointers that's a guy that you want on your fantasy team so I'm sticking with Bruce Brown for now I just  I I  can't say move on not to a guy who has shown the ability to have some nine cat value not a ton but some and is getting starter's minutes  otherwise with the Pacers were just praying  throwing up a prayer that somebody ever starts getting consistent minutes but it just it doesn't seem like that's going to be the case so  fat  friends going on line with out express VPN is like changing while leaving your window wide open  now you might be a bit of an exhibitionist  and you may not have anything you feel

and the answer is almost definitely know it's just sort of more stuff for other dudes  otherwise not much I mean everybody keeps asking me what I think about Jeremy Sohan I've been saying the same thing since before the season started which is that he has massive efficiency issues and moving him into this point so on role wasn't about to make those go away  he's also not a guy that you need to start in nine category leaks  for the Knicks we saw Josh Hart get 30 plus minutes off the bench in their last ball game that was great make sure he's not on the wire now we got to make sure that it actually happens consistently otherwise I don't think much I think we got a pretty good feel for the rest of that team  Clippers this is an obvious one James Harden day two this is just going to be this slow  I call it  somewhat sine wavy in that you'll have games where everybody everything looks better and then you'll have games where things look worse as the pieces fit together and it's gonna depend a bit at least  on the defense that they're playing against they went up against the Knicks team in hardin's first game which I'm sure everybody loved Roland into Madison Square Garden as he makes his Clippers debut but the next can actually play some d  CL Brooklyn's not gonna play a whole lot of Defense specially not without Nic Claxton so this game could be higher scoring you might see the pieces seem like they fit really well but it's this sort of seem versus reality thing good players great players in this case Kawaii great player PG hard and these guys are really really really really really really good at basketball  they're gonna just find ways to score in a fun way against the team that's not that great on defense  and they're not going to be exposed as much for the chemistry stuff that still needs to be worked on what I would say in general  and this is pretty much the case whenever a massive usage yeah as hard and says I'm not a system player I am a system whenever a system arrives to a new team there's usually going to be this immediate  feeling  that you want everybody to just explode  but that doesn't happen  so what actually happens in these spots is that  the day the news breaks  is a sell High  because suddenly hardened it was like oh hardin's going to a play for a team  instead of doing nothing at all  and it on that player  but you also have a Buy Low window on everybody else because there's going to be an overreaction based on these early games to Kawhi and Paul George Paul George had his easily is worse game with the year and you know wasn't even all that close because he was  top of the board first round and that one bad game dropped into the middle of the first round oh no he says well also realizing PG is not going to shoot 50% for the year  not the point point is now you have a Buy Low on everybody  because there's going to be an overreaction to each guy doing less  big turnovers chemistry issues  clunky clunk offense as guys figure out how the piece is fit together and this is a big how do they fit situation this is a harder fit than Harden going to Philadelphia because there was like oh the one main Superstar is a center you run pick and roll with that Center make sure he gets the ball whole bunch of times bingo bango hey we're good to go with the Clippers their Center is a roll man a screen enroll man that's what if eats a zubats he's a big body who has okay hands and he can finish around the rim  the Clippers offense prior to Harden's arrival was a lot of times Paul George and Kawhi Leonard taking turns initiating whether that's ISO pick and roll whatever there was a bit of a take turns offense going on and that's just not gonna work with three guys so they have to rethink the way this whole ship floats  and while that's happening this type of stuff I believe tends to take about five to eight weeks you will have by low windows in there that you can probably exploit on all three of those guys  for Brooklyn nothing really Nicole and cam Johnson each got a sign to their G League team so that means those guys are getting a little bit closer yay  it seems like  cam Johnson is closer than Clarkston  but will sort of wait and find out I think cam got upgraded from out to doubtful  so that means he's probably one or two games away I don't know what the story is with Claxton but this is your opportunity if you wanted to buy low on Claxton you probably wouldn't have to stash more than like one to two weeks that's a that's a golden opportunity to get a top 50 fantasy player for presumably pretty cheap because whoever drafted him is feeling I think kind of miffed about the whole thing  for the Pelicans is it Jordan Hawkins time again in a really good first ball game we heard from the pals that they're going to be doing a little bit of matchup stuff so guys like Dice and Daniels might seem more playing time but  is that real or was that coach speak  for Jordan's got first dibs if he mucks it up then we'll go look at somebody else  I gotta believe that it's more that one the latter so Hawkins probably a safe Burger board guy with CJ McCollum out but we'll get a better feel for that tonight  Timberwolves is Kyle Anderson a streamer or is Kyle Anderson better than a streamer so far this year the answer has been streamer he's bounced back and forth between about rank 85 and ranked one 50 based on what dirt whether his last ball game was a really good one or a really bad one last one was kind of a bad one so he's back down in the 140 range right now I'm giving him a little bit longer on teams where I drafted him because not that I spent a whole bunch of draft capital on slo-mo I you know I took him in like the 130 some odd range  but I had a measure of belief in him and also if anybody goes down from Minnesota which they haven't so far but if anybody goes down from Minnesota then he very much moves in front of that but if he's only a burger board play then that's not a guy you need to sit on all season long and hopefully we'll get the answer on that over about the next week or so  Laker's the walking wounded by the way cam Johnson just got ruled out so we got our we got our official ruling on that and Ben Simmons is questionable with hips soreness that's some old man stuff right there I know that feeling  for the Lakers Anthony ER I think they're expecting to get really hot tomorrow back for this ball game so at least there's one little piece of good news jaxson Hayes I think is still questionable but Gabe Vincent is out for a little bit longer add is also questionable  Jarred Vanderbilt is still out think Tori and Prince is back it's messy team is beat up most injured team in the NBA so far  obviously of 80 plays that's good for the Lakers also good for us determining who maybe steps forward if everybody's out though and it's like just cam reddish Christian Wood  Taurean prince and rui hachimura a lot of those guys could end up being kind of interesting so let's pay attention to that there may be some streaming opportunities would I believe is above that line Christian Wood  you know is lines have not been too succulent so far it's why he's number one eighty but when he's getting playing time he's been a pretty good fit a couple of three pointers some rebounds can get a block  worth the next exploration at the very least I think and I've been saying that for a little bit here  for the Rockets we should be getting tari Easton's debut if you want to add him and stash him you can don't expect much there's their uh the expectation not for him is 15 minutes  and if that's the ramp up you're probably looking at least a week or two until he's at whatever they actually want to do with him  which means someone's probably gonna pick him up and drop him over during that stretch or you can just wait and you know when he gets into the low to mid-20s and minutes you can kind of reassess whether there's enough fantasy stuff going on there for a pickup you know your league better than I do you know whether it's super competitive that's but you're kind of making the call on Eason for the Pistons sounds like Alec Burks and Jaden Ivey are still out so do we want to float a Marcus Sasser stream maybe Jalen Duren questionable if he's out then you're looking at an Isaiah Stewart or Marvin Bagley stream or both and that's really you know Pistons are in Burgers zone right now bucks nothing really Cavaliers we got a good name Adam Max Drew's last time around as the team continues to get healthy we're waiting to find out what his final role is going to be he's not shooting the ball well at all right now if that goes up does that counterbalance what we assume as a drop off in rebounding we shall see only time will tell but I'm sticking with it to see how it develops on the max Drew side and then obviously we wanted to know if Jared Allen is up to full minutes yet or if he still kind of in that 2829 range  also Charis Levert I keep bouncing back and forth on him he's probably not going to be a nine cat guy because of percentages issues but I also think it's percents are going to come up a little bit and he's had a pretty good size role for the team to this point so  head to head I think you sit on him a little bit longer Rodeo if you want to stash him on your bench and not play him against your games cap that would be the way to go it I also don't think you're gonna feel all that terrible if you did drop him and move on because the upside for liver and is really only when guys get hurt hurt otherwise you're thinking like can this guy get inside the top 100 maybe and so then you're toiling away on it when other things are going on out there  thunder nothing  heat I guess the question with Miami is can you still Buy Low on Jimmy Butler you had a huge ball game and jump from like 80 to 40 in the rank board  so probably not but I don't know maybe you can in your league  Grizzly's guess we'd like to have some kind of clarity on the center position if there ever will be any and I'll keep saying this I am secretly waiting for Luke Kennard to have a larger role it hasn't been one yet but he's one of the best 3-point shooters in the league and it does feel like teams just need maximum floor spacing these days so if all of a sudden can art starts playing 30 minutes he's gonna be jacking up nine ten three pointers a game  that's that's a guy you'd have to add as it stands right now you probably don't for the Suns Bradley Beal might might be making his season debut I'm assuming he'd be on a minute's cap so I don't know that I would play him against my games cap on the Roto side obviously head-to-head you get out of your ill and you fire him up this will be interesting because now does that make Bradley Beal the point guard until Devin Booker comes back and then are they finally sharing that role we still just have no idea  because Booker and Bill haven't played a game together Devon's only played two of their games so far  meanwhile Kevin Durant has played all seven  who had that going  well this is why you can't just assume certain guys are gonna be in and out and by the way Booker's been pretty beat up the last few years all so  anyway uh Beal that's that's certainly your question mark there for the Bulls not much really on Chicago you know they got a nice win in their last ball game against a bad team does that wake them up or was that a one-off every win for Chicago  you feel a little bit better about your fantasy assets there because they're gonna try to Ram their heads against the wall and hope that they can  use their heads to knock the wall down  it's been ugly so this point but never win makes those guys just a little bit safer  Raptors precious a true I think is getting closer to coming back I would like to know if y'all could Pirtle can keep up good numbers once precious is around it was not a promising start to the year before a chewa went down  meanwhile Scotty Barnes as awesome as he's been and he has been awesome he is also very much a cell High averaging 23 points two and a half threes 10 boards six assists and three point two defensive stats those are  Anthony Davis size numbers on the defensive end some of that stuff is coming down I think you should be able to get a top 35 player for him right now and I think you can do that you probably consider it  where the hell were we oh and then Gary Trent  well I mean is there any reason to be patient here I think the only reason to be patient with Trent is if you think he gets traded because it just doesn't look like he's going to have a job in Toronto unless somebody gets hurt  for the Mavs kind of the same old stuff Derek Lively foul trouble last ball game what is this one look like assuming Maxi but is still indeed out and then Grant Williams who's been rolling I see no reason to hop off that train I imagine he'll probably hit a shooting slump at some point and then maybe that's where he falls back towards the edge or outside the top 100 but it's not happening yeah so continue  Warriors pumpkin Andrew Wiggins has to be the thing on the docket here he's been so so bad so far this year  and he's just not involved and he looks slow and he's not taking it to the rim averaging only 0.7 no that's not right how many free throws per game I guess he's a three and a half free throws per game but he's only making 54% of them which is a career low shooting from the field is basically a career low his three-point attempts are back down again his field goal attempts last year were at 14 he's down at 10  I don't know what the hell's going on with Wiggins  but something is not right  and  I know I've been saying on the show he is both the Bilo and all so a player that I want nothing to do with on my fantasy team it's possible that he might not be a Buy Low it's possible he might just be bad now  which is weird to think but every part or maybe hurt but every part of his game is wrong  what is one steal through eight ball game so far this year this is a guy that's average to steal plus almost every year of his career the last year he was at 1.2 he also 0.8 blocks two defensive stats per game last year the lowest number in Wiggins career is like 1.4 defensive stats per ball game  mostly he's been at one point seven to two range and this year he's at 0.6  his minutes are down by five to seven mostly because he just doesn't look like he knows what the hell's going on out in the basketball court  I feel like there's something wrong with him and the Warriors aren't telling us because players don't just  you know I know he's not like the springiness chicken  but he's born in 95 he's not old  28 supposedly that's the prime  something is wrong with Andrew Wiggins and the Warriors are doing a hell of a job of keeping it under wraps but we can all see that something isn't right with him so  I almost feel like they're doing him a disservice by whatever it is that's going on keeping it under wraps but like there's no way he's 100% healthy will he ever get back to 100% I don't know because this does look a little bit like the Andrew Wiggins that came back after all the family stuff last year and you just sort of Wonder like is it in his head is it a physical injury a mental one how are we gonna get Andrew out of this thing and I don't because there's no obvious timeline on when it's going to magically fix himself whatever is going on with him I don't think that I would even buy low there I think you just want to get the hell out of that business and if he shows signs of taking more shots being more aggressive being more engaged on both sides of the basketball that's probably when you think about making your move  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it

drizzly.com that's dri z l y.com today must be 20 one plus not available in all locations  super weird stuff though  now gets any chance Reggie Jackson becomes a thing while Jamal Murray's out I'm somehow doubting it but you never know Blazers Time Lord feels like well we're still waiting on the final ruling Mary as a procedure that could cost him two to three months he also has a procedure that would cost him the rest of the season  either way the Blazers don't have that many other centers on their rosters so he figured 8 in who was already getting the Lions Sheriff's sentiment it's at about 30 out of the 48 of them each ball game that probably goes up to 32 I don't know how they can play in 3233 minutes for an entire season because that's just kind of hard on a big man but hey extra minute or two will take it if that's what happens because Aiden  he and demonic the bonus pretty good shots to lead the league in rebounding this year and if Aiden starts to play more well there you go  what the hell was he talking about I lost my place the Kings can they compete without the air and fox  yikes  that was really bad in Houston and a rocket science I know they're better than they were last year but you know that's championship team or anything and they made the king's look like a like they were a level below  my guess is that Sacramento is better in this ball game probably take the last one kind of personally in a way that  I don't know it's almost like they thought they'd just be able to compete in the last couple  but the Blazers are not very good so this should be a good battle and frankly a winnable ball game Kings are obviously better at home Beam Team stuff  I still trust Malik monk over Davey on Mitchell filling in for Fox and the other thing on the Sacramento side is I'm starting to get some should I buy low on Keegan Murray and he was a name that I considered for the second half of today's show in the is it a buy or is it a abandoned ship and Keegan Murray is very much a buy  he's a Bi-Lo you shouldn't 36% from the field 75 at the foul line all the other stuff for him actually looks really really good usage is up  so all of that would indicate that he should be out in front of where he was last year and he still playable in nine cat even with this very cold start so yes Keegan Murray very much bye  I don't know what it would take to pry him away  you want somebody off like a very late pick that's that's doing really well that you feel like maybe could fall off a cliff at some point I don't know who that would be  buddy hield feels like a similarly value player that  shooting the ball better here in the opening frame this guy's could flip-flop pretty quick Aaron Gordon if you think his field goal percentage defensive Stats come back to earth that's an interesting one if you want to go get Keegan Murray that feel like Aaron Gordon PJ Washington is an intriguing one it could probably get you Keegan I don't know that I would give up much more than that I don't think any obvious enough to get it done  any who that is your big Wednesday look ahead before we dive into our uh players  I can't think of what I want to call this segment of the show what did I call it in the title I already forgot what I labeled this thing oh by lower bust volume one that's what we're calling it by low or bust and the three names

one we haven't done a show like this before let's bleep and see how it goes first name on the list is  Karl Anthony towns  who we did talk about a bit on yesterday's program with Raphael Johnson but when I asked who you guys wanted me to talk about on Twitter there were still a lot of I want to hear about cat so let's spend a little bit more time on towns and perhaps it's that you guys wanted to hear me voice my own opinion on the situation a little bit more is let's start with the quick answer to the question is Karl Anthony towns a buy or is Karl Anthony towns a bust  he is a bye  I feel pretty confident in that call  but it's a little bit more nuanced than that right now cat is averaging 16.7 points per game 1.33 9.2 rebounds 2.7 assists a steal 0.7 blocks on 38% from the field 90% at the free throw line  okay  that's where he's out right now  the first thing that I think everybody's eyes are going to jump to is that 38% shooting from the field  and we can feel I think very confident that that's not a number that's going to stick  largely because right now 3 pointers aren't dropping  he's taking the exact same number of Threes this year as he did last year and he's making almost one less per game  because last year he shot 37% by the way career 39% are from downtown and this year he's at 23 and a half if you adjust the numbers up just from 3-pointers alone his field goal percent goes from 38 to about 47 or so  it's not all the way back to where we needed to get but if you look at his overall field goal attempts he's at 6.2 out of 16.2 actually I got that wrong you would be at seven out of 16 so we'd be a little bit less than the number I said  the twos also aren't dropping but we don't like let's assume the two the shooting percent from two doesn't change that much because Rudy gobert is clogging the lane his two pointers are probably going to be a little bit tougher this year  maybe it gets all the way back to where it was but we can't just assume it does the way that I think we can assume on the three-pointer side  the other thing last year he was at 8 Reba game this year he's at 9.2 that's actually a really good sign  and he's doing it all on the defensive glass he hasn't gotten his usual set of offensive rebounds yet which perhaps that's a number that takes up a little bit even if the defense of numbers come down  a sister lower that probably stays because the offenses not running through him as often as it did in the past but also his teammates need to make shots a little bit better so I think we can also assume assist probably come up a tiny bit from 2.7 maybe to about three probably not all the way last year remember he was in the fours before he went down previous series of 3.6 before that he was at 4.5 he's not the only guy anymore one steal pretty reasonable for him let's he's been around point eight to one throughout his career 0.7 blocks is a little low for him but again he's playing Power Forward instead of Center a lot of the time  maybe that number ticks up to 8. 9 0  one thing with cat that I think we can guarantee is that the three-point percentage is going to get better  and if it does  I'm gonna assume the 2% gets better as well  he pretty much jumps back to where you need him to be  because the thing weighing him down right now is that he's been a big negative field goal percent guy  if his 38% from the field jumps up to even 47 or 48% like again  career 52 and a half  since he started jacking threes it was more like 50-ish  but we don't even need him to get all the way to 50  this is this is a game of just kind of simple math again if he's at what's he shooting how many shots per game right now 16.2 shots per game last year he was at 7.3 out of 14.8 shots per game that got him to 20 and a half points if his field goal attempts are indeed back up a little bit this year to 16 let's just say he's making slightly less than eight of those  eight shots out of 16 would be 16 points if you say two of those are threes that gets into 18 points if he's making three free throws that gets him to 21 and that's a very conservative estimate  so that's just with the field goal percent getting back where it needs to be his points per game his field goal percent goes from being a negative to a neutral basically scoring goes up by probably three maybe four points per game maybe even five three-pointers go from one point three to two and change I would probably get him to around  let's see two point one ish if you're gonna mimic last year if he continues to take 5.7 per game so all of these things that's like the rising tide phenomenon is field goal present goes up by 10 11 12 percent points go up threes go up field goal percent goes up  it's this big lift and he jumps way up the board now does cat get all the way to where he was drafted which at the end of draft season was like around 20  probably not  probably not  what I would point to though is that last year before cat went down he was around number 25 on a per game basis and then he was worse than that when he came back because he was sort of working his way back into game shape  25 is probably kind of a ceiling for him in terms of per game stuff  but if he can say healthy  then all of that is sort of a moot point  because 25 in healthy would beat his ADP of low 20s because not everybody's gonna stay healthy now we don't know if he's going to be upright the whole year but  yes this is a bye situation on cat  the other part of this is what its gonna cost to get him  because  you're not going to pay his Draft Day price when he's off to a slow start there that's not a Buy Low anymore that would be a buy what someone else got him for what you're looking to try to do is to get cat for someone probably in the 40 to 50 range because they're well in front of where he is right now but you still believe that he beats them when this thing is all said and done who are some of the names between 35 and 55 that we think probably fall back a little bit over the next I don't know how many weeks or months  Jalen Duren is at number 37 he probably falls back a little bit  Mark Williams at 41 almost definitely falls back a little bit he's shooting 81% as much as I think he's incredible as our Thompson is at 3.4 defensive stats per game he falls back he's been amazing and you're definitely not selling for anything less than a pretty awesome player  you probably have to package these guys like would you give up Mark Williams and Oscar Thompson for cat that feels like a lot but I think maybe you can consider doing it Michael Porter Jr at 44 if you pair him up with someone like Jalen Duren or Mark William's that probably gets it done if you wanted to go one for one you might be able to get it done with Opera and Shen or Evan Mobley those guys are in the late 40s Drew holiday you probably would have to pair him off with somebody maybe it would maybe you could get it done with like ogn and Nobby paired off with someone these are plays you can make I believe right now on Cat and it probably ends up being a small size win next player on the  I already forgot what we're calling this board  this is by or bust I remember I remember I got it next player on the buy or bust board is Jordan Poole who is off to an atrocious start to this season 18 and a half points I'm sorry man that's a really bad start pool averaged more points than that with the Warriors last year  2.33 we were hoping for more 1.8 rebounds you're on the floor for 28 minutes you can't get too damn rebounds dude 3.7 assists we all were hoping for more their 1.7 steals is actually likely to come down a little bit for him so oh  hi volume 43 and a half percent from the field not breaking you yet and only 79% of the free throw line 2.8 turnovers we figured that was gonna be a higher number this year  so Jordan Poole is an interesting one he's number 95  in nine cat per game right now which I think might surprise some people I think there was this feeling that he was actually lower than that he did have a better shooting ball game his last time out in that brought him back inside the top 100 the question we have to ask ourselves on Jordan Poole is  what gets better and what stays the same  with pool  I have to believe the usage goes up  or maybe it's not even the usage maybe it's just the playing time because the Wizards are getting blown out every damn ball game and you can see it those that are watching with us here you can see the game so far this season for pool his minutes are all super duper little low because his team is getting spanked  Wizards have had six ball games he's cleared 30 minutes in two of them  in those two ballgames a win the Wizards only win of the year against the Grizzlies  back on October the 28th he shot for 23 from the field four for 12 from downtown and had 27 points for boards to assist a steal on a block and as we mentioned for three pointers  seven out of nine free throws which again a number we hope comes up for him  and the other one their most recent game a lost in Philadelphia which stayed closer until at least late in the third early in the fourth and Philly kind of opened things up because indeed nuts he scored 23 points with the board six assists a block and forth three-pointers and three out of three free throws I'd love to be able to come on here and tell you guys that I have all the faith in the world that the Wizards start playing all competitive basketball games  problem is they are really really bad the Wizards are real bad  and like right now Jordan Poole is playing fewer minutes with the Wizards per game then he did coming off the bench with the Warriors each of the last two seasons  he played 30 minutes a game with the dubs each of the last two seasons in fact he was within three seconds  30 minutes and two seconds in 21  29 minutes 59 seconds in 22 took 15.6 shots last year which is the same almost exactly as this season  his free throws her down  quantity and quality  the rebounds are down assists are down the only thing up is Steals and we know that ain't holding  so while we know the Steelers are coming down  I don't know if it's going to get all the way down to point eight maybe it's 1.0 1.1 it's not gonna be one point seven and the blocks at point seven are also not going to stay where they are  so we're going to need a lot out of Jordan Poole to counterbalance the things we know are on their way down if we assume that the Wizards start playing slightly more competitive ball games I think we can also assume that means Jordan Poole is gonna get more like 18 shots per game instead of 15  he's taken 18 shots per game twice this year it wasn't in the two competitive games it was in the season opener and then the one right after that since then he's taking 11 13 14 and 15 there's a big learning curve going on in Washington  but what I would also say is  I don't think pool gets all the way back where he was drafted and I don't think it's super close  pool was taken around 40 with the hope that he could have so much usage he would just overwhelm the bad stuff  but right now if you bring his Steals and blocks back to their career Norms you're talking about like a revved up version of Jordan Clarkson  which is 150 or later  so  we don't need to and this is what makes it harder we don't actually need pool to go from 95 to 40 we really kind of need him to go from one 50 to 40 when those defensive stats level off  heat to me and the funny thing is he in cat or right next to each other on the rank board 94 and 95 but they've gotten there in such wildly different ways it's cat being really bad at shooting and a number that you just know is going to fix itself versus pool who's been in a whole bunch of blowouts has been really really good defensively field goal percent is not that low we know the free throw number is going to come up so at least that will start to counterweight it a little bit but there's gonna have to be a whole lot of usage two three four extra shots per game I believe to even get him inside the top 60  so while Jordan Poole is probably a by low I don't think I'm doing it because I don't think I can go I don't think I can get him cheap enough yet  I would want to be able to get Jordan Poole trading someone away who's in the 60 to 80 range right now or 50 to 80 range right now that I think is going to fall off a bunch  but I don't think that's gonna get the job done I don't think somebody's gonna give up Jordan Poole for someone that I think is going to fall that's in the 50s like Gordon Hayward is 59 but that's not gonna be enough to get you Jordan Poole it's not gonna be close the guys in that range like  I the guys that are doing slightly better than that I don't think I would want to give them up for Jordan Poole  maybe Mark Williams maybe they both end up near 60 at the end of this whole Adventure  I don't think I would want to give up Jalen Duren I think he's got a shot to be ahead of that Mark  Dillon Brooks isn't going to be enough to get it done I don't think you want to give up like we talked about with Cat Operation I think I'd rather have Shen than Jordan Poole  felt that way I think on draft day and you guys know I'm not a huge Shane gun guy but I'm  I thought he was getting drafted like kind of around where he belonged  pool I didn't think belonged where he was getting drafted he just kept getting pushed Higher and Higher and Higher and now I think in a good scenario he gets back to maybe 60  65  but how are you going to be able to convince the person that drafted him to give him up for  I don't know man Jalen Johnson and Kelly oubre together it's not gonna happen  and then you start to look at underperforming guys like is that gonna make any sense and you could be able to go get him for Marcus Smart know  you gonna be able to get him for Clint capela know could you pair some of those guys maybe but now you might be giving up way too much  so I guess if I have to pick between buy or bust I take bust  the answer to all of these is somewhere in a gray area in the middle but  I don't think he gets back to where he's gonna be and I don't think the price is low enough on him yet  whereas I think maybe you might be able to get cat at us at a low enough price Maybe I'm Wrong on that one maybe you'd have to go higher than I said but  I think it's doable and our last name on the first ever buy or bust segment here on the show  is Mark Health faults who's hurt right now so that clouds the analysis a little bit  but it's all worth pointing out that so far this year folks played in four ball game the first one was a blowout win where he only needed to play 24 minutes the second one was actually a closer ball game where he got outplayed by the other back chord guards  kind of throw those out I think we can do our analysis on folks on the most recent two ball games the magic back-to-back in Los Angeles against the Lakers when he had 14 and 8 with a steel two blocks on seven out of 16 shooting and against the Clippers when he had 12 points 5 boards only one assist weirdly and a steal on six out of 11 shooting role that stuff together and you get an iteration of Markle faults that's actually an awful lot like the second half false last year  which for those that forgot was kind of in between 70 and 100 sort of bouncing around in that range depending kind of on the week really but he was about 15 points four boards six assists 1.4 steals I think that's always going to be a pretty good number for him about half a block 51 and change from the field 84 at the free throw line  by the way he's over one fell shooting so far this year so you know make of that what you will it's a very low volume bad impact for free throw  oh for one means nothing at all it's gonna show up on the board as bad but he's missed one for free throw in four ball games  but what do we think happens to the other stuff because right now in his four ball game's faults is at 11 points for boards four and a half assists 1.3 Steals and half a block on 50% and then 0 at the free throw line but again  you can throw that out  but two of those are in the games that were decided either decided early or he just wasn't playing as well where he averaged nine points he throw those out he's actually at 13 points not 11 if you throw out those first two games it actually doesn't change as a system Ark very much but it does change as rebounds because he had only six boards his first two games and he had nine boards in his most recent too and that's just a byproduct of being on the court for normal starters minutes  so I think it's quite reasonable to assume that false is somewhere between 13 and 15 points this year around four rebounds maybe a tiny bit more than that even  I would think somewhere between four and six assists they do have a lot of guys that can handle the basketball and 1.3 or more Steals and half a block  but where is that getting him because he doesn't shoot the three pointer at all which is is going to sort of deflate his number and he's not going to rack up assist and points so it's not like he can be a big time Elite guy there the thing that he's really good at is steals  so those have to be there and I think they will be but again without being a focal point which I don't think he is they got plenty of shots guys on the team that would prefer I think to take shots before he does  it does sort of limit what the upside is for faults  that said he's at number one 143 right now partially because he hasn't hit a free throw yet partially because the numbers are being yanked down by two games where he didn't play as much and partially because again he does have that sort of ceiling on how high his numbers can go unless he just magically falls into a bunch more usage  but I would say between buy and bust my answer is by on false I do think that he still gets back where he was roughly the second half last year maybe not all the way there I had him pegged as like around a 90 range nine cat guy and he's at 140 right now but everything seems to indicate that he should be able to get back to that 90 range  what I don't know is what it would take to get him  because you're in this weird spot where you don't want to overpay  maybe you could find someone that you think falls back outside the top 100 that's in the 70s and 80s right now that's probably your best pairing  like a I don't think Bogdan both Donovan which is gonna get it done nobody even realized that he's having this crazy steals start to the year  and I don't think I would go any higher than that but if you're looking in the 70s and 80s a couple names that jump out are guys like Deni avdija although maybe he profiles is a 90 range guy anyway PJ Washington who we've seen oh time and again fall outside the top 100 mostly because that field goal percent at 55 is probably not going to hold for him Tim Hardaway Jr is at 80 right now you know the three pointers are not going to stick at almost four per ball game and he's not gonna make every single free throw he takes all season long Grant Williams who I really have liked so far but he's also shooting 56% almost exclusively on three-pointers that's not gonna hold  Kevon Looney probably won't get it done saddiq Bey at 87 is an intriguing one if you think Jalen Johnson continues to two minutes away from him if you think oh any of those guys would get you markelle fultz those are the names I think I'd be throwing out there because they are performing better than 90 right now but I think they fall behind 90 and false catches up with them so that's kind of the pairings at least that makes sense in my mind  so those are your three  buy or busts here on the first ever edition of buy or bust I will say the chat room is open we're gonna do a little lightning round here I have a couple of minutes because we're only doing one podcast today actually that's not true the brewski Secret show is sometime this afternoon but that won't be a super duper long one I will say again here's the Discord link throw that up on the screen it is in the show description and if you want to get on the mailing list to get the link to the secret best brewski podcast the only way to do it is to sign up at this link that I just put on the screen if you're listening after the fact we've been tweeting it out over at at Dan bass so over at ethos fantasy BK I'm gonna try to remember to put it in the show description but I'm probably gonna forget unless I actually physically do it right this second but I can't because I'm doing too many things at the same time oopsies what are you gonna do and then of course all so please take a moment to hit that like button  remind you again here mid show subscribe Please Subscribe come on I know there's new folks that are coming in subscribe we got good stuff going on around here whether it's the show or the pot or whatever  all right let's do a few questions before we wrap things up what are your thoughts onto Anthony Melton Josh Hart and Christian wood would you dropped for any of them mmm  this is Roto question head-to-head I think I  yeah I mean these guys are gonna be better than scoot for the next three months you might regret the scoot drop in like February when he starts to get to do all the stuff in Portland but it's not gonna be super soon  I have  I feel bad about telling anybody to drop scoot because he's gonna be really interesting in a couple of months so it comes down to how long you can sit on him  in Roto I would prefer to have any of those guys over here right now heart is the one where you feel like maybe there's enough upside to make the swap I don't know about upside for wood or melting right now but you're probably best served just sitting on him if guys like heart melting wood or on the waiver wire that means that decent guys are going to be floating around none of them have the you know January February March but potential that scoot does  Daniel Gafford or PJ Washington give me Gafford  roadside definitely Gafford head-to-head that's a little tighter I think I'll still go Gafford  what is Kyle kuzma's rest of season outlook do I think he keeps this up no I don't think he keeps up 50% shooting from the field he's never been a 50% at the free throw line so percentage is likely to come down big usage is likely stay high you probably Falls from around 50 range where he is right now and nine cap maybe back towards the 80 to 100 zone so a little bit of a sell high but not by a ton  Daniel Gafford or Derek Lively rest of sees it give me Gafford he's still has no competition really  RJ Barrett is available on the wire do I drop would moving Spencer Dinwiddie not in a category League RJ Barrett will destroy your poor team  points League you can drop  Wagner or wood for Eric but categories know you just leave them on the wire because he's horrible in category formats  what do you think about pairing Simon's or vessel with somebody in a trade for Jalen Brunson it's hard to Pare off injured guys and trade up  just telling you man I don't think any of those guys get it done I know brunson's been slumping a bit to start the year but  can't trade away an injured guy and expect to get somebody better it's not gonna happen get the thought out of your head and then you'll have an easier time excepting the reality  not as read or Walker Kessler tonight well it sounds like Kessler's doubtful so you probably got to go nazreen Donovan Mitchell and Gordon Hayward for Anthony Edwards and Devin with cell which side do you like I think I like this the Donovan Mitchell side I Anthony Edwards has been really really good  and he still number 34  because  well because the defensive stats haven't really been there yet but I also think the 52% shooting at 83% foul stuff those things come down a little bit and Donovan Mitchell's number two it's just these in a class of his own in this particular trade  should I start yakka turtle or Mark Williams today was in that makes the decision a lot easier because then you're definitely going Mark I think I'll go Mark Williams anyway  Max Drew's vs Cole Anthony in a roto League give me strews  either of them worth playing tonight Cavaliers are in Oklahoma City  I think you could you could probably sit on it  yeah go ahead and sit on it  would you trade Gordon Hayward and Ben Simmons for Nick Clarkston yes how about Freddie Van Fleet and Gordon Hayward for cat um  hmm  no  I don't think I would I think Freddy is we haven't seen any steals yet from Van Fleet he's a big steals guy and he's eighteen point five he's gonna have a few he's gonna have a week where he gets like 14 Steals and that number's gonna jump to one and a half and I still think there's a decent shot he beats cat per game but also they're probably just gonna be really close so a little bit of an overpay  hey Dan who should be dropped if Duran place today among my  Kobe white Kyle Anderson mobile Wagner uh you could drop Kobe or Mo I don't really care there probably Kobe White  I was head to head so he's a little bit more useful there yeah  I just go vogner  you know he's a streamer at best anyway  Mike Conley versus New Orleans Milton versus Boston or manual quickly versus San Antonio for today I don't know man that's a DFS question and I am not the best at DFS I would probably lean Connolly just for the safety of it all  but is it the right decision to trade away Tyrese Maxey for Kyrie yeah I'm good I think I answered this one yesterday actually  points League Jared Allen and Klay Thompson for Jalen Duren and trade Jones  I don't think trading away Jared Allen's a good move right now he's still having his minutes ramped up so I'm gonna say no  hey Dan love your show listening at work now in New Zealand awesome outstanding  you're a work now isn't it like  like four in the morning no that's not right two two three in the morning something like that what the hell is the time in New Zealand right now I'm gonna look it up time in New Zealand  oh 7:38 a.m. how's that possible  you're three hours no that can't be right is that really right isn't that the same that's like the time in Hawaii right now  that seems nuts  now I'm obsessed with time zones again  would you trade Jalen Johnson to get Keegan Murray know  should I accept cam Thomas for Freddy Van Vleet I get Van Vleet yes greetings from Denmark what do you think about the trade Cade and Brook Lopez for Scotty Barnes and cam Thomas in a points League  oh Camp Thomas is likely to see a pretty Stark drop-off at some point here but he's a big part of what they're doing right now  Scotty Barnes has been crazy  I think I'm man I might go  sheesh I might go this guy Barnes Camp Thomas side believe it or not  Yahoo made cam Johnson available now who's the drop for a streaming spot  Brogden Jalen Johnson or Derek Lively  probably Lively  should I trade DeRozan and deje for Trey Holmgren and Reeves in a point League oh my God I have no idea this is too much for a live show question sorry dude three for three sets a bit much  am I yeah there we go  would you hold Gary Trent Jr is he a drop he's probably a drop Jaylen Brown for Karl Anthony towns  I might go down  yeah give me towns on that one we'll go towns  someone wants to trade me cat for Paolo boncarbo yes you take cat for goodness gracious  okongwu or Markle faults I'm gonna go oh Kong one that one  I just sold the Andre eighteen for mikal Bridges that's fine yeah I think I'd rather have Michael Bridges  good trade  Kobe white or Jalen McDaniels in nine cat that's Jalen by a little bit  Booker or Trey young rest of season probably Booker  just strict rankings it's Booker  needed a center I traded Freddie Van Fleet for voucher I think we'll both will get better how did I do is basically the question here I think I'd rather have Van Vleet but if you need a center you need to send her  well PJ Washington still be relevant once Bridges returns  relevant yes but he's also sort of running hot right now so I would expect PJ to fall just outside the top 100 like sort of the usual should I sell Brook Lopez for tyus Jones know I think I'd rather have a Brooke  higher upside between Caris LeVert and Christian would I don't know that either one of them has super high upside but I go Christian Wood because we know Anthony Davis is gonna miss games at some point and that's when you get to sort of cash in on the Christian Wood stuff  would you sell eaten for Jalen Brunson um only if you need a guard I think they end up pretty close to each other actually  Demar and click capella for Tyrese Maxey  Fair Deal probably slightly into the Maxi side  where do you think Mike Conley and PJ Washington and the year Conley around 100 PJ around a hundred and ten  is my best educated guess but everybody so damn close in that range  who should I drop once CJ McCollum is back but you're getting way out in front of this one man you're team might look totally different in a month and a half  Malcolm Brogden Marcus Martin Lee or D'Angelo Russell it's probably Malcolm Brogden  would you trade PJ Washington for Jalen Johnson yes  do I accept a trade that would get me Trey young for my campus yes get Trey young there Marcus Smart Jordan Poole is Zach Collins who do I start tonight out of those three you probably go Jordan Poole and then pray  I know  oh our New Zealand friend confirms it is actually 7:30 a.m. there what's the time in Hawaii right now 8:30 what that's crazy  New Zealand in Hawaii or one hour apart right now  I gotta Google time zone map  I know that like  laterally what's that is that longitudinal or  latitude  guess it's laterally supposedly probably latitude I get that like  you know East West New Zealand Hawaii or not that far apart but it's kind of crazy that they're one hour difference  man this is wild all right new zealanders I guess we can hang out a whole lot more these days thank you daylight saving time  anywho Scottie Barnes for Chet Holmgren his Chad a good enough Target  I mean you're you're buying high and selling High  but  sure I don't care you can go either way on that one you're pretty good shape I think I would probably look at someone else who's maybe not likely to see some kind of dip but  yeah it's fine  Tyler hero or Nico vucevic  let's go vooch on this one  here has been really really good I just I can't see this  this pace holding all years specially the Steels but  you know I'll go vouch by a nose  cooked or raw sushi rolls I'm not a big Sushi guy I don't know if you guys have seen the episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm where Larry David walks into a Japanese restaurant and everyone inside yells chicken teriyaki at the same time at him  I'm a little bit that so cooked is the choice there cuz I'm not I'm not a rough Fish Guy  my wife hates it hates me for that because she loves Sushi more than anything and we don't get it very often because I just you know what I really it's not that I hate fish raw fish all that much I really don't like seaweed  I freaking hate seaweed  it's gross someone at a recent Sushi meal was telling me that they make a rice  wrap instead of seaweed I would be willing to give that a very strong try because I just I can't stand the the texture I can't stand the aftertaste of seaweed  so just sushi on Rice I know that like sashimi  I'm actually kind of okay with that it's not my favorite but it doesn't turn me off the way that an actual seaweed so like a hand roll oh God or the the what's the one that are like in the big funnel I think that's the the hand roll right those are so much seaweed  Ben Simmons are tyus Jones I'll go tyus  is scoot worth a first waiver priority on The Wire I'm going to say no he's hurt and it's gonna take him a while to acclimate  do you think Josh giddey is a Buy Low I don't I mean he's sort of a Bilo but he's also I think a bust and he was on my bus list prior to the season starting because  he's going at 60 finish last year like 110 and it wasn't like his role was gonna get bigger with Chad Holmgren coming around  I gotta wrap it up guys write an hour 12 now would you trade yakka turtle and Keegan Murray for Zach Levine yes  DeAndre eating and Derek white or cat give me eight and Derek white I I think it's a bit of an overpay for cat there  someone keeps asking the same question about eighteen from Michael Bridges I answered that question Mikhail by a little bit  why is heart an ad he played 30 minutes off the bench and last year in New York when he was playing 30 bench minutes he was a top 65 play and we have to believe that if that's the role that he now Falls himself finds himself in that he's an easy top 90 with some upside so that's the Josh hard answer  who's a good big to Target for tyus Jones nobody right now because tyus is underperforming at present scoring only 10 points per game because like Jordan Poole he can't get himself into a damn competitive basketball game now that's not right he had 12 should I get the numbers right on Titus Jones 11 points per game but he's playing only 26 and a half minutes per night so if they get into these competitive ball games it stands to reason that his stuff is just going to slowly get higher because he's like a solid 20% fewer minutes than he would be getting in a normal length ball game add 20% to everything he's doing right now he goes from number 104 to probably number 70 something then you want to sell or just ride it  it's November 9th now news in November 8th in Hawaii which is crazy yeah that's that's absolutely nuts because you got the International Date Line in between those two spots the boggles the Mind man like you fly just a little bit like they're us they're separated by one hour but an entire day so technically this separated by 23 hours but that's just  whoa  crazy every time Jalen Williams was dropped in my league should I drop Brogden or smart drop Brogden Jalen Williams should not be dropped that's crazy  last question have you seen any news on over Jose Alvarado I have not  and I think some of you are getting back to your work day anyway that's it lots of questions We're not gonna be able to do all of them every time but figured what the hell my voice is starting to come back and  you know  only one show this morning Secret Show with
