Dan best price I know I'm not going to be doing as much while I'm on vacation this weekend but anybody can attest that I spend entirely too much time on that idiotic website and I will continue to do so because it's honestly the best way for me to get quick Snippets of information to all of you guys and then hopefully I can steer you all back to these podcasts to get a little bit of color on said information  for those uninitiated are we can review we're going to go through the ads the holds the drops the almost drops the injury streamers the watch list the new bucket I'm calling the stream while warm players so let's just dive in because we've got a lot to cover specially when you consider we're going to be looking a little bit at next week as well  we'll begin with the ads that's everybody's favorite part add number one is Gary Trent Jr and I've talked a little bit on yesterday's show about how you know I'm making I'm not making any massive adjustments on the Gary Trent one but him starting is notable  it's not a  it's not a full ignore kind of thing  because it means that to some degree mid-20s and minutes is kind of guaranteed now he's gonna start the first and third quarters guys will get tired and they almost have no choice but to put him back in at some point in the second and fourth so now where some nights he might only see 2021 minutes off the bench now you're kind of looking at like 2 4  and in good on good nights you might see him get up into the high 20s to low 30s perhaps I do have fears about how many shots he's going to get to take with these players around him but I like the fact that they've inserted more scoring around Scotty Barnes who they want to kind of be run in a little bit of Point Dennis Schroder now runs the bench unit so Trent can be a part of where art frankly just do the things that he's a little bit better at which is shooting the basketball  don't drop anybody that you like  but if you're sitting on say  like an injury replacement that only has you figure one or two games in them even if it's a pretty good one  you know if you're like trying to play Zach Collins on the day when banana sits  you're probably better off going for someone like Gary Trent who might have value as long as they leave this line up together which I don't know maybe it works for a while because they won their first game against the bad team mind you but it's always good to get win even if it's sort of a gimme  so Gary Trent that's number one  this is not in any particular order by the way this is just in the order that I looked at teams scrolling through all of them to make sure I didn't forget anybody  Aaron any Smith is another ad he was on this board last week I'm keeping him there because the news of this week was that he got inserted into the starting lineup and that's good again it's the same kind of story he played 34 minutes in the Pacers game on Thursday evening at 12 points 5 Boards of Steel couple blocks and forth three pointers he's getting as many minutes right now as he can handle basically Indiana loves hit the heart he plays with  yes there's a chance he might run out of gas because he plays so damn hard  but as long as he's getting this kind of run and while his role is expanding and they like what he's brought Indiana has won a couple of games since they put him into the starting lineup same story with Jalen Smith we'll get to him in a little bit he's on a different board here I think they're nice Smith is a guy that needs to be rostered in all formats  Brandon puts on the ads board which you know that this one requires some explanation he was on the injury replacement board last time so he was already a guy that I thought belonged on rosters  basically I wanted  in this show say this is a guy who might actually stick for the year and it may have something to do with his energy level if he can keep it up the whole season  it may have something to do with whether or not Andrew Wiggins can ever find a way to wake up over the course of this season  but right now he's good enough to be better than injury replacement  there's not a whole lot of explanation that's required on this one because he's putting up really robust fantasy lines and it's you know it's hustle stats but they're they're translating to boards to assist to steals to blocks it doesn't even matter whether he's scoring on a night-to-night basis he's like doing Draymond stuff but out of a guard position or kind of guard wingy I guess  it feels like even when Draymond comes back but jenske is gonna stick I don't know this for sure  but it just seems like they're better when he's a part of what they're doing  tari Eason this is like the third or fourth week in review show in a row that I've had him on here because I still have people on the internet saying Dan do I  do I pick up tari East and I'm like yes absolutely  absolutely and it's been that case for a while now is with Jabari Smith Jr nursing and ankle injury and Dillon Brooks dealing with a core injury  there's just absolutely no reason  why  taree shouldn't I mean I guess the only reason is that he has a sore knee but if this young dude can battle his way through a sore knee and I pray to the good Lord that he can his Runway is colossal so make sure he's on a roster he's very good at rebounding he's very good at steals from a power forward position I love everything about this dude's Fantasy game we saw outlines of it last year but with not really enough playing time or trust to get there but he made you don't love what Ethan does on a basketball court by the way it does beg the question of what the hell Stephen Silas was looking at and I know that we've asked this question a thousand times but what the hell was he looking at last year if he's like preaching defense and he's got this guy who actually knows how to play some defense that he's not using what the hell are we doing  Marcus Smart he's been on this board a couple weeks in a row is a stash now we're actually getting to see him play which is good there was no John Morant in memphis's game in Denver which meant that Memphis went back to not be in competitive and Marcus Smart was fine in it but the inefficiencies are going to kill you when he's actually asked to go and  like try to be an offensive Cog as a post to defensive role players stalwart steals Guy  I am  I'm not convinced that Marcus Smart is going to be inside the top 120 in nine cat  I do think that it's important to make sure he's on your team in case he is  because again the number of guys out there on the waiver wire that have actually like been a top 80 fantasy player before is not all that high anymore and smart is one of them and he's not super duper old yet so make sure he's on your roster while we see this thing through they've ramped his minutes up quicker than expected but even still you know I think he's the guy who you'll see his it's not really that his roles going to grow but it's Comfort level is going to grow and that to me is where you might be able to make some Headway  and then finally Taurean Prince and I'll admit I'm recording this show well it's live actually so those of you that are watching with us you know we're doing this show before the Lakers game on Thursday night where the Lakers have due to an injury to Camp Johnson once again changed their starting lineup and now really hachimura is in there to replace cam reddish sorry not cam Johnson and really being in there might actually take shots away from Tori and prints so I you know we'll see how that shakes out but when the Lakers are healthy they're running this very weird caca made me starting lineup where nobody has any offensive ability and the fact that Dorian Prince is like the only guy in the team that made a three-pointer means that he's getting relatively consistent playing time  and he's shooting a whole bunch of Threes because he's playing alongside LeBron James one of the best passers in basketball history and Anthony Davis and so he's basically gonna be open all the time and he's constantly making two three four three-pointers a game with some steals obviously that translates to some points couple of rebounds just because he's out there for so damn long and so he belongs on rosters let's get to the holds next on the board Dennis Schroder not that anybody was gonna drop him um I do think there's a little bit of a fear that him coming off the bench  and it's not unfounded guys that shift to the bench typically don't do better but some still do fine I think you gotta at least kind of see how the shooter thing shakes itself out if nothing else he's been trending down after a very hot start to the year Dennis was number I think like he was inside the top 60 after the first two or three weeks and then over the last month he is number one 56 7 assists is good and the steel has been good but most of the other stuff has been kind of clunky and yes I think there's actually a pretty good fear at least for me that he ends up as like kind of rolling along in this 130 to 150 range the rest of the way but you got to hold him for now  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game-winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama

y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  I'm also holding Collins Sexton for the moment I thought that guys coming back would pretty much eliminate Sexton but so far the Jazz have actually kind of let it let it ride a little bit  I don't get it but actually no it's more I don't get why they didn't play him at all before all these guys got hurt that's what really confused me because sex and again played 30 minutes that's despite Jordan Clarkson being back in this last ball game Conte George is back Chris Dunn is still starting like the guys are there and he's still rolling and it's a guess a good thing that we didn't sort of pre drop on Sexton because he's posting pretty good scoring numbers and he has these holes in his Fantasy game that I don't think are ever going away like doesn't get that many defensive stats doesn't really shoot the three ball all that much I guess a little bit more these days than before  doesn't rebound or assist all that much  but he scored a ton  and he just don't find that type of stuff on the waiver wire so  Adam keep him added hold him whatever it requires here  but he healed as a whole um I had on this list basically with the fear that he might have a bad ball game and his second game Off the Bench here for anybody but the minutes have still been there and the scoring still been there and it almost feels like he's more he's happier coming off the bench I don't know that that's necessarily true but he's able to come in and kind of gun a little bit in a way that maybe has a starter that's not as easy a thing for him to do because you have to defer make sure Halliburton is doing he's sort of the first option and then Hallie's trying to get it to everybody but you bring healed in Off the Bench it's like look buddy when you're in there now fire away man don't worry about it and he seems to enjoy that so hold on Buddy hield he's had two games off two good games off the bench so far and giving that they've been good games this is probably not a message that I needed to deliver but I'm doing it anyway and just kind of getting out in front of the fact that he's probably gonna have a bad one at some point in the next game or two and just remember that Dan said hold because he's had a couple good ones so far  Malik Beasley is a hold not indefinitely you know this is again if this is a guy who starts to lose his role or basically starts to cool off more permanently will reassess  his minutes have been down the last two ballgames one of them was because he was bad the other one was because they played a Brooklyn team that wasn't running actual starters out there for three quarters of the ball game but he did still hit 5 threes in that one the thing that worries me a bit more about Beasley is that the rebounds and assists which were non-zero and steals frankly which were also non-zero at the beginning of this year have started to be zeros more often  rebounds have been able to kind of hold in the in the four range but the Steels have really come down he was over one game now he's back down to point nine which is much closer to kind of where you'd expect for him in 29 minutes of ball game  holds for now he's trending down so again this is not forever  but at least give it some time  Derek Lively is basically played off the court the last couple of ball games and he's just getting a schooling from the NBA but some of its been just getting beat up this one was foul trouble 5,015 minutes and just got annihilated by Rudy gobert and Anthony Edwards and Cat who actually didn't have that great of a ball game but these guys were just going after him the whole night he'll be fine the Mavs don't want to use Dwight Powell for 30 minutes of ball game even if he was sort of better in this ball game they got their veteran presence in there and blah blah blah this is still Derek Lively's future in Dallas he's the guy that needs to be rostered don't abandon ship on him just because of two bad ballgames and frankly I'm hoping that somebody else on him in one of my League's so that I can put in a waiver claim on it this situation and turned it into something else oddly he's actually being added in fantasy League's over the last couple of days presumably still on the heels of that 20 in 10 game back on December 25th on Christmas day even though his last two have been bad my guess is that he gets dropped a little bit overnight after I do this show I when the hell does Dallas have their next ball game Dallas  plays again on Saturday they're in Golden State  Warriors don't have anybody in the front court for him to worry about so he'll probably bounce back for that one but hey what if he has no one more bad one maybe he starts getting dropped maybe we can cash in on and then we'll see Malik monk is a hold for me as well he's been cooling off the Kings as a team have been kind of a two-horse monster so far  and and so monk is also not an indefinite hold he there's a possibility that he ends up falling back into that kind of stream while hot group  but I do think some of his issue right now is that he's dealing with a right foot injury that he keeps trying to play through his numbers have been down the last three or four ball games in a row is minutes have been down the last four games including one that he missed against Minnesota the assist still looked pretty good no steals no threes really so he just he just doesn't have the lift or the speed right now I feel pretty good about him bouncing back maybe the next time the Kings have kind of a lightning of their schedule which  honestly like this last week it has kind of been it hopefully they can  help he can get right because the king's schedule gets kind of intense starting next week which we'll talk about at the end of this show I think they go four four back to back before a two gamer so hopefully monkey can get his legs back underneath him you got a hold him for now simply because he was so good for so long and then D'Angelo Russell because mostly I just don't believe that the Lakers goofball lineup is going to stick I can't I  just seems like Madness  they've got LeBron and they've got Anthony Davis and that's starting five and we've talked about  Taurean Prince being  solid  but and yeah I actually kind of like rui hachimura and the starting five instead of camera is you get a little more rebounding in there and that's been a bigger problem for the Lakers than you know always having like a long guy on another teams  starting scoring guard  but even still what the hell we doing here like at some point delos gonna run the second unit and Reeves is gonna move in with the first  and just a matter of time so you got a hold on  or alternatively ELO gets traded all so a possibility we've heard him rolled into these aquiline rumors I'm sure that's not the only one that he's being packaged or being sort of considered to be packaged in maybe that's the way that D-Lo gets his value back but either way you can't abandon ship  it would be a very poor decision to bail on Delaware not because he has been playing poorly because he has been and wrote all you got to keep him on your bench right now while his minutes are at like 15 of all game uh but because we know he's very good offensively and at some point it's either going to be the Lakers or somebody else is actually gonna let him go a little bit  his offense typically outweighs his defense not all the time you know Denver was too good at picking on him so that's where he got benched in favor of Dennis Schroder but like you cannot make the argument during during a regular season the Lakers are going up against this many teams where it's like okay yeah you know we gotta have more defense out there because it's not that it's rebounding  so fine I don't mind the really thing but if your argument is we got to get deal out of there because he's not rebounding enough well okay I mean that's why you pulled off and reads at some point you pull everybody that can actually space the floor around LeBron and Anthony Davis  so that's why I'm holding D'Angelo Russell let's keep moving  here's the guys that I'm kind of scared either nervous or dropping herb Jones  I've  so here's the thing um  I didn't draft herb Jones  I wish I did because he got off to an insane start this year for six weeks of the Season he was an absolute Juggernaut I didn't draft him because I figured with a healthy Pelicans team he wasn't gonna have room to operate I was wrong Trey Murphy being out proved to be enough wiggle room for herb Jones to really go nuts  but since Trey has been at full strength herb has done nothing that he had one good ballgame in there and something like eight bad ones and at this point like I get it guys get cold but he is just legitimately doing nothing at all so  you know you got it you got to make a change  Gordon Hayward is a drop for me he's been a drop for a little while now he's hurt on top of everything else so in addition to just sort of generally being not all that good now he's also out for at least a couple of ball games just it's not necessary all the magic centers are a drop Wendell Carter Junior hasn't been good enough go go bats they was fine while he was out it's been  you got moving her mixed in there as well none of these guys is separating themselves and when you have a three-headed monster at Center  that's bad  I mean like that isn't the most obvious thing I've said in Forever that's just bad so none of those guys need to be roster I didn't think Wendell Carter Junior needed to be rostered anyway because I never thought he was really a 12 team 9 category guy and now we're seeing that with the competition he's running into that's just not necessary and then Zach Collins is the other one this is more of a like  finesse it sort of spot  where uh for Collins  you've got these games where women Yama is either sitting out the back-to-back or on some sort of minutes restriction  and so it feels like they're going to be enough opportunities for him to actually go  and get some fantasy value  but at the same time  there are there are way too many spots where he just doesn't really get to play so for now I'm holding on Collins I picked him up when when was ruled out for a game late last week and then  almost kind of like accidentally held on because I didn't see that when he was back in until it was too late and Colin still at a good ball game and then we got the word coming down the pike that Victor was going to be on some sort of minutes restriction going forward and he wasn't going to be playing in all the back-to-backs it's like okay well Rodeo I could save Collins on my bench and just deploy him one or two times a week when the situation warrants it Head to Head it's a little bit tougher but if he's good too out of every four ball game and like serviceable in the other two that's probably enough for him to be on rosters but I don't know  and that's why he's on the scared nervous Zone but not quite a drop  before we get to the watch list and then oh boy do we have an injury replacement board for the ages still I want to remind everybody again I know most of you are going to be watching this one after the fact because it's 8:00 Pacific time on a Thursday night and that's fine those of you watching listening after the fact please pause what you're doing right now pause the podcast subscribe if you're watching the YouTube feed please find a place to hit a like button if you're you find me over on Twitter at Dan Bass Pro like something I posted there all of these little things and there are thousands of you guys so there's tons of opportunities to just click one thing that's really all I'm asking of you each time you listen to a show or a tweetstorm or whatever just click one button it goes so far  thank you  here's the watch list I you know the watch list are not guys that I'm going to go hyper deep on but worth mentioning at the very least Jalen Smith who's been inserted into the Indiana starting lineup but they've had his minutes pretty well capped out in the mid-20s I think he was like 22 his first game back 24 and a half this last one in the starting five there's a lot to maybe like about him he's been shooting the ball extraordinarily well this year but it just it feels like we need 30 minutes and I don't know that we're gonna get there I'm not sure his body necessarily can handle it so watch list on Jalen Smith for now Julian champagnie out in San Antonio he's starting I don't think he's gonna get enough shots in what they're doing  he blocks some shots which is interesting I liked his is defensive stats out of this sort of wings you know small power forward Realm  but it just like if it feels like you need just a sum any kind of usage at all for him to be fantasy relevant and all I don't know that he's gonna play more than 25 26 minutes a night most evening's with the Spurs bringing Kelvin Johnson Off the Bench to be sort of your bench Gunner right now of a cell Sohan Branham Wendy like when all these guys are upright it just doesn't feel like there's enough there for champagne to get shots to do stuff  I would assume was on my watch list it does still kind of feel like the Bulls need one more player to be hurt for him to be consistently useful  he played 33 minutes again on Thursday night  John Jay Drummond having fouls in the first half and then Chicago sort of trying out running small at times that yes played some kind of a role a Coby white coming Crashing Down to Earth in his field goal percent these days that's playing a little bit of a role  if you wanted to add IO you could I just I don't know how you'd have the stones to play them in a roto games cap format head-to-head you could probably get away with it I just in my opinion you need Caruso or tomorrow out or Kobe white any one of those three guys being out and I would fire to Sumo up in every format but right now even when he's playing these big minutes there's no guarantees gonna get to do enough in them to be consistently fantasy relevant he is close though  Cody Martin is worth a watch list I don't I don't think that he's gonna be a guy who gets over the hump mostly because I'm not sure that the Hornets actually trusted his body can handle enough minutes to get over the hump but you know that could change so keep an eye on him and Andrew Wiggins is on the watch list basically permanently on the chance that he remembers had to play basketball but it just like doesn't seem like that's in the cars  maybe it will be I don't know  just doesn't seem like it every time I'm like oh maybe we can just waking up then no  I don't know has he even strung to have decent ball games together so far this year I don't think he has  Peyton Watson you can watch out in Denver I don't think that there's gonna be enough for him to do in non blowout scenarios they he did enough he had a pretty good ballgame here against Memphis so that may be a reason to buy but this ball game Denver was kind of trying to rely on the non-main guys where they could you saw Justin holiday pick up some minutes anyway here's the thing I don't want to be too bashful about this so if you want to add Peyton Watson I'm actually okay with it I've got in my watch list because I still want to see this I still want to see him actually do enough for multiple games but he was not shy about taking shots and that's kind of a good sign I suppose so  is that enough  yeah maybe  you could possibly upgrade him from watch list to injury replacement board if you really wanted to and then really hatchimals on my watch list because you know starting lineup and even when he's coming off the bench he's one of the Lakers that's willing to take a bunch of shots I don't think there's enough to his Fantasy game to Warrant anything more than a watch list right now but at the very least you can put him there and we'll take it day by day but again Peyton Watson right now of the names on this list he's the one that you could probably consider upgrading to the following oh that's not right I did this out of order Payton Watson's guy you can consider upgrading to the injury replacement board the stream only while warm boards also known as the sow s o w s Bobby Port is not read Jaden Ivy and Cole Anthony people are gonna kill me for the Jaden Ivy take but I just don't care because  he has these gaps in his Fantasy game he had a huge ball game Detroit almost beat Boston and over time he was great 22 and 10 with 33s  and he shot the ball well  but he turns it over to Audi misses free throws typically his field goal percent is only okay  and usually he's not scoring 22 with 10 rebounds usually you get some points  some Steals and that's kind of it fouled out of this one but overall again very good ball game Friday I don't take anything away from him in this Thursday game and he's had a few good ones kind of Blended in here but unless he just made this big flying Leap Forward  the fantasy stuff for him typically doesn't the good doesn't always outweigh the bad  it's close enough for right now where you can stream because he's hot he's shooting the ball well he's over 50% the last couple of weeks  on the season he's at 45% or last one week I think he's over 50% no not even that no now with this ball game I think he is and you know he's like top 60 when he shooting the ball better getting to the foul line has been both good and bad for him the Steals and blocks are super high this last week there's a lot of unsustainable stuff going on but again one thing I've learned  this is sort of like Dan's lesson to Dan  if a guy gets super hot just because you don't think he's gonna be great all the way through the year that doesn't mean you can't just play him while he's hot  and that's kind of what's going on for Ivy not right now for Cole Anthony buddy will at some point probably again get hot same story for Nas read Bobby Portis has been pretty warm lately  you roll from there  what I was talking about a moment ago on the paint and Watson front was oh my God the injury replacement board if you want to put Peyton Watson on the injury board have at it here are the rest of them in a lightning round format so buckle up  Andre Drummond for vooch Al Horford anytime a Boston forward or Center sits and he's not rested himself Cara silvert when Darius Garland or Donovan Mitchell is out right now it's both Craig Porter Jr Isaac okoro sometimes Dean Wade Garland Mobley spider all out at the same time Kelly oubre Jr when Nic Batum and Joel embiid are out Paul Reed for Joel embiid Kobe white for Zach LaVine Patrick Williams for Zack Levine Brandon Miller for lamelo ball PJ Washington for lamelo and Gordon Hayward out at the same time said he'd pay who was out for Jalen Johnson now he's in for DeAndre Hunter Nick Richards for Mark Williams Tim Hardaway Jr Dante eggs and Derek Jones Junior all filling in for Kyrie Irving Grayson Allen for Bradley Beal who might be back this week and Malcolm Brogden for shaedon Sharpe hi me how Kaz Junior for Jimmy Butler and Duncan Robinson for both Jimmy Butler and Caleb Martin out at us same time I thought about trying to do that in sort of a classic racing cockle lowest Einhorn Jim Carrey Ace Ventura  mode  but I wasn't sure I could pull it off you guys think I could have done it  is worth trying  under drumming Al Horford Harrisburg Craig Porter Jr Dean Wade Kelly Bridge Junior Paul Reed Kobe white Patrick Williams Washington I make it has Junior Duncan Robinson at one of a model America you guys I don't know how well you guys remember Ace Ventura butt  that show meant the world that movie meant the world to me as a kid  oh man all right  that's your weekend review  now is your breakpoint where everybody can take a deep breath and get ready for the weekend  I'm already tired  um  I do have the streaming grid that I want to throw up not throw up that I want to put on the screen for those that are watching with us because I've done a little bit of kind of individual color coding  but the one thing I will say about the week ahead while I'm working on some of this remedial text stuff going on in the background is that  everybody plays three or four there is not an avoid team for this coming week all so it's worth pointing out because I'm doing this show three days before next week starts it's pretty much impossible  for me to guess what day-to-day or questionable players are actually going to be healthy on Monday so unfortunately you're gonna have to follow the news on that one I'm not gonna be as useful to you all as perhaps I might normally be but this is a look right now for those that are watching and those that are listening don't worry we'll talk about it this is a look at what's going on for next week there are a lot of options  again because everybody's three or four you can focus on  I mean like weekly leagues that becomes sort of less of a thing that you have to think about streaming is lightly less important because most teams are going to be relatively evenly matched in games played yes there will be some clubs that just have an outsize number of three game weeks and some teams in your league will have an outside number of four game weeks but by and large the games played discrepancy in your head to head matchups should be as small this coming week as any week all season long  with I guess the possible exception of n Season tournament week where you had that sort of overflow and then other stuff beyond that um as far as you know looking ahead to whether or not there are days that get a little bit cluttered next week Monday is an eight gamer next week that's New Year's Day Tuesday is 6 Wednesday is a big one that's a 12 gamer so if you're thinking about a possible overflow Wednesday is that Thursday's two Fridays a big overflow day Saturday is four and Sunday is a nine game day so Wednesday and Friday of next week all so possible overflow days and that's something that you should be thinking about as you plan ahead that's January 3rd and January 5th  try to if you can front load or back load your weekly grid  how do you do that well  first of all it depends on whether or not you have any moves at the end of this week that you could use say on like a Sunday if you don't look into next week the Charlotte Hornets go Monday Tuesday back to back and that is it they are the only team that has a strong Monday Tuesday schedule there are plenty of teams that go four games to start the week in the first six days those are probably easier ones to focus on if you want to stream multiple slots those teams are the Houston Rockets the Indiana Pacers the Milwaukee Bucks the New York Knicks and the Utah Jazz all of these teams by the way with reasonable fringy streaming options that you would then likely hold all the way through Saturday  if you'd prefer to take someone that you had this week into a game on Monday and then make some adjustments on Tuesday there are also a handful of teams that go four games in six days starting on January 2nd and running through the seventh Tuesday through Sunday of next week  the Brooklyn Nets who had a good schedule this week but then sat everybody for one of those games womp womp the Golden State Warriors the Memphis Grizzlies the New Orleans Pelicans the Orlando Magic and the Sacramento Kings all go for games Tuesday through Sunday  these are really nice ways for you to use one or two moves and turn a roster slot into a five gamer basically meaning if you picked up somebody that goes on Monday and goes four times the first six days of the week you shouldn't have to use another ostrich move on that slot until all the way until Sunday which again you could pick up somebody that goes Sunday the Clippers go Sunday Monday so to the Phoenix Suns at the end of next week not this week I'm talking about the end of next week so if you wanted to sort of roll into the next one that would be a way to do it  if you are only streaming one roster slot next week which again I think most of us should be aiming for two there is a way to kind of meander through the week and maximize games play Charlotte Hornets would be your move on Monday for their back-to-back the Milwaukee Bucks go Wednesday Thursday on the back to back you actually have some choices for Friday Saturday Boston is Friday Saturday back to back Houston Indiana the Nicks the Sixers and the Jazz oh and the Wizards are all back to back Friday Saturday and then as we mentioned the Clippers would be your team that finishes up next week January 7th and then the first day January 8th so those be your four moves Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday to turn one roster slot into a seven game week and also start the following week with the game on Monday  personally  I have four moves in a Yahoo League I prefer to stream number of moves per week that you have for me again it's four for you might be three or five or six or whatever divided by two so if I have a maximum number of moves of 4 in my Yahoo League I'm in a stream at least two roster slots in the playoffs I stream and plus or you know four divided by two n divided by 2 plus 1  all stream three roster slots and I'm looking six to nine days of how long I can hold on to a guy  all long streams at that point because that allows me to have emergency moves to drop somebody who gets hurt during the postseason that's not a thing you're going to do during the regular year because you want to make sure that you have your best players for you know X number another eight to eleven weeks or whatever following today so you can't make those same you know cut throaty moves that's why typically two rosters slots is enough so if you're gonna roll that way like I said the teams that start the week with the good schedule for six days Houston Indiana Milwaukee  and I think Utah always the other one and of all of those teams Milwaukee actually has the slight Edge the Nicks also by the way four games in six days to start the week Milwaukee is three games in four nights to start the week so if you really wanted to you could move off of a buck on Friday pick up somebody that has two games the rest of the week let's say that maybe you don't like the streamer you're using on the Bucks like if it's campaign and they're not doing anything for you jump to somebody who plays twice Friday between Friday Saturday and Sunday two out of those three days that's like a solid half of the NBA so you have a lot of choices and go from there  also a reason to look at Milwaukee is because they don't play on Friday  so you get those four games the first six days Wednesday is your overflow day but three of those four games you're actually making sure that you add  and that's the last thing I want to talk about on this big like double freak out show is  how do you avoid  the  the high pro the the Overflow days Wednesday and Friday  well you got to look to see who plays on the other days and who has multiple games on the other days so which teams don't play on Wednesday and Friday it's a pretty short list mind you Charlotte doesn't play on Wednesday they go Monday Tuesday but then they also go on Friday  so are you really getting three games out of them next week is there any reason at all to hang on to a hornet after Tuesday the answer is a pretty resounding no if you're streaming a roster slide you almost have to assume that whatever games you're getting out of that slot on Wednesday and Friday don't even really count  sure some of you got either lucky or very unlucky I guess we are lucky that you don't have that many guys that you that you really are only like nine or 10 players going on Wednesday and Friday that's really fortunate you're gonna be a team that has a big games Advantage you are the Rarity you are the exception and not the rule next week  so scroll through the board figure out who is not going when's day Friday which is like basically nobody I think every team in the NBA plays either of those days with the exception of San Antonio  I think they're the only team in the NBA that doesn't play either Wednesday or Friday next week they go Tuesday Thursday Sunday so yeah it's only a three game week but there's no overflow  conversely you might have a player on Toronto that goes Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday they play four games but you might only be able to use their Raptor for two of them  so spur might actually add a game to your Ledger next week  you can count pretty much on well not one hand I guess it's slightly more than one hand the teams that don't play  on both of those days even  so San Antonio goes on neither of them Philly goes on one out of two  Milwaukee goes on one attitude we just talked about them a moment ago  Golden State goes one attitude Denver goes one attitude Charlotte goes one attitude and Boston goes one attitude  the Boston's only a three game week so one of their three is wiped out by that Charlotte's only a three game week so one of their three gets wiped out by it  Denver's a four game week so they have a pretty good schedule because three of their four are not on those chunky days same with golden state great team to pick up on Tuesday because three of their four games Tuesday through Sunday are not on overflow days  and who they'll already forgot I was talking about Milwaukee we talked about they're a pretty good one Philly only a two gamer if you can't use your Philadelphia streamer on Friday San Antonio there the best of the bunch starting on Tuesday because you get three games or rest of the week and none of those three is on an overflow day that matches up by the way with these teams that have four games Tuesday through Sunday when they have at least one maybe two  so I talked about Sacramento having a pretty good schedule Tuesday through Sunday but if you're an overflow mode it actually be better to go saying Antonio because you could get all three of your games in there where with Sacramento you might only be able to use two  so this is something you need to look ahead to before you look at your lineup for next week before you make a single move thinking about next week in mind go see what your Wednesday and Friday looks like and go think about what that would look like depending on which players you turn into streamer slots as well  I will do my best to get some kind of thoughts about this out on social media I make no promises about the likelihood of that happening again I'm going to be out of town  I'm not gonna be in a place with fantastic internet service it should have some I've been told that there's Wi-Fi at the Airbnb  we'll see how reliable it is  every winter I take a trip someplace for two to three days and so far I think like 75% of the time we've had a power outage at some point in there so hopefully that holds up a little bit better I will of course we checking scores well I have some quick hits mixed in there we will probably not have tweets storms Friday Saturday Sunday we will probably have those back on Monday I talked as fast as I could my voice is shot thank you all for watching this double bonus episode all mushed together into a 45 minute
