about to do it today like rate subscribe all that good stuff and let's get into the news of the day  big news today of course is not a player it's a coach Adrian Griffin  axed  sliced carved  punted as head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks I probably should have looked this up beforehand but I'm pretty sure he has like three four years on his deal so as embarrassing as it might be for Griffin he can sit in a lounge chair for the better part of half a decade and basically never work again if he doesn't want to but he probably will so he'll probably latch on as an assistant coach somewhere who knows maybe take some time off the bigger news is not the fact that Griffin was fired but the replacement  and it's duck Rivers  how I asked you all how  to quote  the great Jesse Pinkman how does he keep getting away with this  Doc Rivers who by all accounts seems like a  like a pretty good leader  we know he led the Clippers through a tumultuous time with the Donald Sterling the end of the Donald Sterling era and then into this sort of majestic new Steve Ballmer universe  and he went to the Sixers and he led them through a little bit of tumult but at the end of the day and you know I I try to give everybody at every level of everything as many benefits of the doubt as humanly possible Doc Rivers has been flat-out bad at head coaching  I mean pretty much since like year  Sterling  you know he got the Clippers through that  that was great  they needed someone that could Shepherd them through a difficult time  but since then he's just had a series of Epic playoff Playhouse  of poor adjustment making in the postseason  and you were talking about the Celtics Big 3 Championship which like we're talking a very long time ago now  that's like 15 16 years ago  he hasn't really had  the type of and I get it like medium deep playoff runs you could call success it's to some level  but like compared to expectations  he's been a colossal disappointment for the last 14 ish Seasons outside again of being  the guy to help the Clippers with a transitional era  he was the right guy for that a strong a presence the Clippers needed a presence to get them through that era  is that what the Bucks need is a presence  feels like what the Bucks need is ingenuity  it's like fresh new thought on how to run a defense or an offense or whatever  I mean maybe Doc's been doing a whole lot of soul searching and self-reflection but it sure seems like he's mostly just yucking it up on the sidelines which frankly seems like a really good deal and as a broadcaster I would give anything to have had the job that Doc Rivers just gave up it's also and looking at the Shams reporter on all this thing and I'm not gonna throw that tweet up on the screen because it would take me longer than it would take to just read it  the Sham Suite from about an hour ago says and I quote the Bucks started discussions with Doc reverse as an informal consultant in early December it's a month and a half ago  and Tuesday  that's two yesterday began working toward a lucrative contract to have him replace Adrian Griffin as head coach  so this dude  the doc  comes on as a consultant informally though don't worry friends it's not formal it's a very informal Consulting gig  he just gonna be giving you some measured guidance on a few things a month and a half ago that's how long it took Doc Rivers to convince the people in charge through I'm sure a series of very well-meaning notes as his condolences Consulting gig that the problem could only be solved by one man and it was the informal consultant  the call is coming from in inside the building I mean this is brutal  I get it man Cutthroat and all that but  if doc screws this one up  and I'm not far be it from me to say what's gonna happen next we've seen  I think enough of Doc Rivers since the Boston Celtics Championship to have a pretty good idea of what's gonna happen next but we don't know anything can happen anything can happen  if he screws this one up  this will be the last chance  because you can't do what he just did to get the job  to  effectively and like maybe more details will come out about this I I reserve the right to go back and change my opinion but as of this moment  my opinion on this situation is Doc Rivers snake to head coaching job  he came on as an informal consultant six weeks ago and informally consulted his way to a job that they had just given to Adrian Griffin  after firing  Mike Boonton holes are  Adrian Griffin signed  a  thing as 4 million a year  I forget how many years were out his deal  so it wasn't like  you know some of these had coaches getting eight nine 10 million dollars it wasn't one of those blow it out of the water contracts but it wasn't nothing  that's a lot of money to just kind of have floating around out there  what does it mean from Milwaukee's fantasy prospects you know I honestly don't know because Doc Rivers has had different impacts on different players he tends to be kind of big man friendly on the offensive side but  no the big man in Milwaukee is  you know Dan Vespers favorite Brooke Lopez but he's not exactly the feature the focal point on offense for that team  so we'll see  honest goodness I have a clue I would assume that fantasy values stay somewhat unchanged we'll probably see some more adjustments on the defensive side hopefully that doesn't knock out any of what Lopez does well and you'll probably see a coaching bump of some kind you'll probably see the Bucs play well for a few games and then I feel like reality is gonna set in and the whole thing is gonna realize that  what did they really get here  anywho  let's talk a little bit about yesterday Denver beat Indiana 1141109 Indy hung in there pretty well considering there without Halliburton for the week  but he healed had a total garbage game but you're hanging on as long as he's starting you are holding he's been very good as a starter for Indiana he has these games every once in a while where he's a total tank messed disaster don't worry about it  uh Andrew Neymar hard at 157 TJ McConnell had 17 and 7 Off the Bench they split the point guard minutes 2721 which unfortunately kind of and I both both of them actually had okay lines in this particular ball game but by and large if that's the split the neither one of them has sustainable fantasy value with Halliburton out you need an em hard to get about 33 minutes to get there you need McConnell to get to about 24 minutes to get there so as they're currently billed we needed to just tip  one way or the other by like three minutes and  then we'd have a take  and I get it a lot of you watch a podcast like this and you're like Dan they both had good lines why aren't you saying pick up both of them  well because we know enough about these guys this is a show this podcast is teaching you how to handicap fantasy basketball as well we know nem heart stats at we know McConnell stats set you can't be swayed by Neymar shooting seven of nine one ball game  you can't be swayed by McConnell taking 11 shots in 21 minutes that's not gonna be his stick  now his field goal percent generally is good so with McConnell that's why you only need 24 minutes because the steals the assists the field goal percent this interesting combo of stuff usually gets him there but we know from many years of McConnell and from far fewer years of nem heart what it actually takes to get them there here Neymar going perfect six for six from two in this ball game not a repeatable thing we know that  Erin E Smith I think is a hold and a lot of these guys by the way will be better when halliburton's in there because of how the offense gets run because nem heart just isn't that great of a point guard  easy peasy lemon squeezy nothing on the Denver side Everything is Everything nothing is nothing start the starters don't worry about anything else and then you know I should probably should clarify Aaron Gordon is a start the starter only in particular formats he's not a nine cat value on the year  there's just nothing ever changes in Denver so we don't really need to talk about it  the next beat the Nets 108 103 this ended up being actually we had more slightly more competitive games yesterday than I think we thought we were gonna get going into it good news for the Nets is that mikal Bridges had another excellent ball game he's on a nice little run right now and he's pushed himself up to number 83 over the last month I think  and 78 on the year so the month actually it's really more like the last two weeks for Bridges whoops Dano you had the wrong timeline plugged in he's number 28 over the last two weeks and nothing about what he's done over the last two weeks is all that wildly unsustainable he's at 25 five and four the defensive stats are a little bit better he's at 46% from the field which isn't like blowing the roof off the building or anything and then if you go just the last week for Bridges it's kind of the same thing field goal percents a little higher free throw percent is lower  this all feels repeatable this all feels like what we thought we were getting with bridges on the year so hope he can keep trucking along as sort of somewhere between 25 and 45 and if you can do that maybe we'll forgive the first half of the damn season  as far as the rest of the situation out here remember we talked on yesterday's show about why I didn't want to deal with pressure to chewa well here you go he didn't even start Jericho Sims got the start did block four shots that's the good news for Sims the bad news is that he doesn't really post much in the way of fantasy value because if he didn't block floor shot four shots in this game they're really would have been kind of nothing for Sims so I'm not picking him up I'm not picking up a Chua because I don't like his Fantasy game and then Josh Hart and Donte divincenzo neither one of them was all that great yesterday but I continue to lean the Dante in The NeverEnding battle for Wing minutes to even genzo Grimes heart  I don't wish injury on anyone but I do wish that one of those three guys was not there  that would make that whole situation a lot simpler  as far as the Nets go I have concerns I have consent continuing concerns about cam Johnson who finally had a better shooting game yet 195 with 43 pointers on good percentages no steals but you know I'm not gonna toss this one back  problem is that he and cam Thomas are at this point kind of splitting minutes  which is not at all what we thought was gonna happen going into the year  and this is another situation Brooklyn's another situation where we just need to thin things out  we know Dorian Finney Smith and Roy so Neil are on the Block it sounds like mikal Bridges  Nick klaxon and probably cam Johnson are not on the Block we have no idea what the situation is with Cam Thomas Spencer Dinwiddie is apparently on the Block and he had one of the worst fantasy lines of the whole year in this game with forests and over for shooting in 18 minutes I've said on multiple shows this year if you're just joining us for the first time I don't trust Spencer Dinwiddie at all in nine cat he's number one 50 one of the worst field goal percent guys in the NBA all he does is get you a few assists that's legitimately his Fantasy game this year because 13 points on the year is  League average slightly below it the two three pointers I guess is ever so slightly above League average they're just like nothing that he does great the assists are fine usually but not outstanding and so  and points League's I guess you hang on there cuz his massive fuel goal percent issue is less of one if that's not a factor if you're punting field goal that obviously he moves up the board quite a bit  so okay fine but nine cat he's not an everyday play I know he's been 75 ranck ish over the last week he had two or three good ball games in a row but if you go around that you can't just look at the meat of the burger you have to look at the bun and lettuce and whatever the filler is going on there that's been didn't witty this year he's number one 50  you are who you are playing 31 minutes of ball game so it's not like there's just more usage coming his way I don't know how many places he could get traded where his job would get better either  but I do know that if Dinwiddie gets moved Dennis Smith Jr is someone that I would like to use a lot  and I don't know that dinwiddie's necessarily going to go anywhere but it sounds like he is sort of available for trades  and Dennis Smith Jr is very low rostered  10% in Yahoo leaks again we're 15 days from the trade deadline  that might be worth exploring when Dennis Smith Jr gets starters minutes he puts up some incredibly well-rounded fantasy lines  dunscore that much but big steals good assist decent rebounds if you'll go percent is not a complete train wreck when he's not taking a bunch of weird three-pointers we saw last year in Charlotte  he had long stretches of like 50 to 80 range fantasy value  does that make Dennis Smith Jr a stash maybe maybe I'll do another show on trade deadline stashes everybody liked the first one we dropped last Saturday  I kind of have a couple more names dad to the list and I think Dennis Smith is probably one of them now what happens if Royce O'Neill and Dorian finney-smith get moved  that's a tough one uh presumably cam Johnson sees some Advantage there because he probably has to pick up more power forward minutes  and then cam Thomas would also see a bump because he then fill in more on a at the small forward spot would Lonnie Walker get enough run I doubt it who comes back in these trades all becomes questionable does Ben Simmons  show up does he make an appearance  set it once I'll say to million times I've gone on record saying I don't think he plays more in about five games this year but  we'll see  Portland playing a game under protest lost one 11 to 1:09  the protest is that Chauncey Billups Blazers were leading this game by a point down the stretch and Chauncey Phillips was trying to call a time out refs didn't see him Blazers got whistled for a double dribble and then Chauncey got punted  Thunder got two technical free throws and then ended up winning the game by two points that's rough man  but it doesn't really matter from a fantasy standpoint fantasy wise you got your sort of good scoot Anderson game which again you know we've gone over this so many times so I hate to repeat myself but I feel like I kind of have to because I have to treat each show like someone new is listening scoots number ranked near the edge of the top 400 this year at some point one would assume he begins to figure out the NBA game a little bit but he ain't there yet  because every time we've had one of these sort of popping off games 19 and 7 here yet 33 and 9 on January 14th  then there's usually two weeks of him learning curving it again  being very very bad for a few games  Willie figure it out this year I honestly don't know with guys like scoot guys that come into the league and they're trying to learn the game usually takes into at least February so if you're gonna call him a stash he's a late season stash and it might not pan out but I get it  DeAndre Aiden was terrible and he's been bad for a few games in a row and he's frankly kind of been bad ever since this knee thing cropped up and I wondering if it's actually gone he's a tough hole but he's a hold because he's the yandere he's a starting center on an NBA team Malcolm Brogden continued to use him as a fill in for shade and sharp and Jabari Walker 14 and 13 I think I called him extraordinarily close to a pickup on yesterday's show and  so here's my here's my reticence on Jabari Walker who's number 138 over the last two weeks I had somebody in my mentioned screaming at me that he was a pickup already like well okay like let's let's dial the the rage down a little bit there there really isn't a stretch of time this year where jabari's been inside the top 1009 cat and a lot of that's because he's posted almost no defensive stats of any kind to speak of  he had a block in yesterday's game which is a start but also I mean we're talking about another guy and talk about someone yesterday  where  Walker if given full starters minutes you to assume he could get you over one defensive stat for ball game but it's just not a guaranteed because he's basically been playing starters minutes for the better part of a couple of weeks now and he's averaging under one defensive stat per game  that could come up yes and you gotta like the rebounding and you gotta like the fact that he can knock down a three-pointer but then I kind of look at this team as if to say all right well you know who's on the Block for the Blazers what could happen here  Malcolm Brogdon seems likely to be traded  I don't know that anybody else is likely to get moved they're possibilities on this team you know if somebody really opens up the chest for Jeremy Grant  that would be the one that Springs Jabari Walker  but it's not like someone else was really standing in his way right now  and he's posting you know kind of Bobby Portis like numbers without as much scoring  that's not really a nine cat line but I don't want to come off on this show like I'm down on Walker I'm just not seeing the obvious path to more Jabari Walker other than shut down time so when Grant starts taking games off and basically things that free up more usage because scoot will step into a lot of that and you know Brogden he gets moved but presumably at some point here sharp will come back and does Simon's get some days off and maybe maybe not because he missed a giant chunk of the season to start it off and so he sort of already running way behind the eight ball on games played but yeah you figure if Grant doesn't get traded he'll probably get a game off every week but between the trade deadline and the end of the year and maybe he'll get the last like two weeks off and you figure Brogden doesn't get traded he'll get a bunch of time off and so on and so forth and so maybe these things do happen and maybe you know every couple of games Jabari Walker can get 14 shots like he did in this one and that's enough for him to be inside the top 100 but the problem is the in between  wherein Hadley's you just sort of swallow the other ones and in rotol League's You're Gonna Leave Me on your bench for what two out of every three three out of every four ball games is that enough to Warrant your roster spot  I actually think the answer is it's very close right now it's not an obvious know but I also think it's not an obvious yes  if you got some dead weight  feel free you know we gotta added in a bunch of spots because he's had a couple of double doubles lately in his minutes have been on the rise and again you like the rebounding but even in this what you'd call kind of a good stretch for Walker since he came back at an injury like week and a half ago he's played six games in that strike and he's averaging close to a double-double but like nothing else bad shooting bad free throw  a 3-pointer  almost no assist know almost no steals or blocks as well  the amazing thing is that he's only unrested in one of my League's so people are willing in those leagues to wait on him getting double digit shots because that's what it's going to take six seven eight shots a game is not gonna get it done we're gonna eat 11 to 14 shots somewhere in that window that would be enough because now you're talking 14 points you're talking 13 to 17 points you're talking those nine rebounds 14 and 9 is a much safer building block than 10 and 9  I know I'm not a big Points Guy but an extra four goes a long way when guys are hovering in that 100 to 170 range  and then maybe we don't know we haven't seen it yet it's not like the hasn't played a decent amount this year maybe the defensive stats get a little bit better that's the kind of hope if you're like look there's got to be some upside built in here  there may or may not be so far there hasn't been on the defensive side but also we just don't have that big of a body of work to say that it can't be in the future  I got nothing for you on the OKC side I told you guys that Josh Getty was gonna fall off a cliff here at some point after his hot run and then it happened and then he'll get warm again and blah blah blah  Utah blown out a few of any of the Jazz that didn't get obliterated in this game consider yourself fortunate I don't think anybody was streaming funky because he'd been so cold lately but then he came roaring out with a six of nine shooting game Colin Sexton was sort of like the everyday guy that survived this I guess you could argue Walker Kessler kind of did too missed a bunch of free throws but I had four more block shots Chris done 17 minutes not enough keyonte George one out of eight shooting good Lord he did get nine out of 10 free throw shooting but  I mean that's these are the games where George is better is the blowouts John Collins had hit his one good game every two weeks enjoy it but marketing was bad and just a rough one Jordan Clarkson was bad you knew that one was coming at some point soon  and New Orleans just ate him up  New Orleans at 23 3-pointers CJ McCollum continues to be maybe the surprise of the year as number 20 still in nine cat I've no idea how he hasn't fallen off yet  but he hasn't fallen off yet defensive stats are super high field goal percent is remained very high turnovers are super low and like you know he had fallen back a little bit prior to this monster game  herb Jones had a big one but he's been so inconsistent lately that it's really really hard to recommend him as a as a all the time play he still number 67 on the season but a lot of that's because of what he did to start the year over the last three weeks he does sit inside the top 100  a couple of giant games Blended in there have helped a lot of the you know some of the more the games were Trey Murphy sat them out a and a lot of it's because he's shooting 57% from the field over his last 10 ball games 12 points only three boards to assists 0.7 steals 0.9 blocks it's just been sort of like a little bit of everything for herb over that stretch but it's been good enough  yeah  I struggle with it because you kind of need to catch these big ones  or like if you could if you pulled this one game out of the last 10 games for me Falls Way outside the top 100 now again you're sort of playing with math and a way that you can't do because if you're starting them every day you would have gotten this ball game but what if you got upset with him and benched him prior to this one  you screwed yourself but you'd be very human to do so  I still think Trey Murphy probably as the slightly better Outlook between the two guys but neither one of them in my opinion is a must start dude every single day or Murphy he's been in a little bit of a cold snap and he's kind of unusable when his field goal percent is down generally you like the three-pointer field goal percent free throw percent steals mixed that Murphy gives you  but this was by the way this is like it took a year but I finally got massive Vindication on last year's stuff do you guys remember and you know it's gonna have to be people that actually listen to The Show for multiple years in a row but you guys remember last season when I had a dream Murphy on my injury replacement board for the entire year and people were so mad about it like I was saying something negative about him I was merely saying  that there was no definitive proof that he would have fantasy value if the big three guys on the Pelicans were healthy  and we've seen it now this year the team is fully healthy and Trey Murphy's number 120  there aren't enough shots for him when everybody's upright  now 120 is technically startable in most 12 team formats so that makes him a hold and I guess to that ended makes herb Jones still kind of a playable guy also in in a slightly more boring way but they both stay inside that marker  but everybody was screaming at me like oh we've seen a Trey Murphy he's top 60s top 50s top 60 on like yeah dude you guys haven't seen it because last year there were four I can literally count them on one hand games that the Pelicans had all of their guys for it was in November  and then they were just done Brandon Ingram was out for two months Zayn was out for basically the entire year and Trey Murphy went nuts  because he was getting he took 15 Shots by the way in this blowout anyway but he was getting 15 shots a game which just isn't gonna happen regularly when everybody's upright he's 10 11 shots a night  I still like him as a hold like I said but he's a frenzy one  and Herb Jones he's technically a hold but he's a frenzy one obviously way better when Trey Murphy sits or if one of the big guys sits  but just barely good enough even when they don't  and then Larry Nance who you guys know I have the softest spot for in my heart I so badly want Larry Nance to get 23 or more minutes nightly he's  he's teetering on it man but 1819 minutes is just not enough long-term I know this game in particular he did do enough but over the last what do we at now last like three weeks what's the minutes look like for Nance he's at 20 minutes over the last three weeks and he's technically been a top 75 play on 9.6 boards a three a steal and half a block 65.93 splits which I think we know is is not a sustainable number so if you pull out if you move him back towards his normal percentages then he does fall likely outside the top 100 but I just I want Nancy to work so bad I think on the head-to-head side you could probably play him every day understanding that Zions gonna get some days off and Trey Murphy's gonna get some days off and all those little things will help Nance in the long term and then you're going to get games where the pills play a team where they need defense overall fence and he'll get more minutes than JV just like one night every three or four ball games it'll flip and so you roll it all together and Nancy is probably inside the top 120 but  now for gamecap Roto you're kind of hunting someone 99 ranked or better  I did pick him up in a couple of spots places where I badly needed a center you know teams where I had like Robert Williams go down and Mark Williams go down and  sit on one Center in some League you know and I got to have somebody in here so let's do a dance but if you're good at Center  you you started don't need Larry Nance and his 20 minutes per ball game because there's just there's no upside at all as long as the team is mostly healthy  and finally Lakers without LeBron they actually kept this thing pretty tight with the Clipper shot almost 60% there was just no way the Lakers were going to win giving up a 60 percent shooting night a Jarred Vanderbilt Tori and Prince rui hachimura all got to do a bunch more with LeBron out don't read too much into that but it was nice to see Vando  he's he's getting his legs a little bit back more every week that's good for the Lakers who probably end up swinging a trade here in the next two weeks but like look at the team right now the angel Russell is kinda carrying the team he's been better than LeBron the last couple of weeks  I don't know anybody wants to hear that and look on me taking anything away from LeBron he's a freaking cyborg but LeBron is ranked outside the top 100 over the last two weeks because he's had no defensive stats he's been a bad free throw shooter very high turnovers his field goal percentage has come back down kind of where I thought it would be this year and so you've seen some drop off and LeBron is now a third rounder per game which oh look I don't want to say I said it did tell you guys he was probably gonna be third round or deeper  I didn't think it was gonna take 40 games to get there but LeBron is finally coming down to earth  with the understanding we wasn't going to be asked to take as many shots this year that is used to just gonna be lower he was carrying it on a ridiculous frankly unsustainable field goal percent that has now dropped and the Steals and blocks have come down a little bit although he's still at 1.9 combined which is pretty good  but if you look at like the last little stretch here he's made a lot of bad decisions he's been very stagnant on offense and it's been Dilo that's been carrying the Lakers on offense top 20 run here for Russell over the last two weeks  that's obviously not gonna keep up he's shooting 50% and hitting four three-pointers over that strike this is the moment to trade Dlow because his value will never be higher either fantasy or reality  does Deonte Murray make the lake Lakers a championship team no I don't think so does he make them better longer term yeah he does he's a better basketball player than Dilo the question I guess is how much it costs the Lakers to upgrade that spot and you're almost thinking about what comes next because D-Lo is sort of mid to late Prime and Deontay Murray is still very much early Prime  from that to that end it makes a lot of sense for a Lakers team that's probably looking more towards the future is it the move that gets him over the top again I don't think it is  in my eyes the Lakers need to make that move and then probably something for point of attack defense that maybe they're hoping that Gabe Vincent comes back and can give them that but I don't know I can count on him to actually have any healthy stretch this year  I think you got to go break the bank and get out Alex Caruso but whatever meantime assuming LeBron's back for the Lakers next ball game you're just starting the four main dudes and then for the Clippers  I did say I had zero faith in Mason Plumlee a lot of people yelled at me for my take that I would rather have Xavier Tillman who also kind of crapped himself in the last ball game but I still would rather have Xavier Tillman because we've seen the Clippers are willing to go small they went small in this ball game wasn't even really all that clear who soaked up all the sentiment it's Daniel theis played 21 of them and he wasn't all that great and plumblee wasn't all that great and they ran like little baby units for some stretches  wasn't even really clear who the center was in those units  in any event Clipper shot the crap out of the ball and so they were kind of able to get away with it even though their defense was bad because they went so small in the Lakers were able to just go to the rack a bunch of times but Kauai and hardened and Norman Powell and PG and Terrence Mann and freaking a mere coffee and even Russ like everybody shot the ball well  but the Lakers they were like look our only shot of winning this game is if the non-super star is missed some jumpers and Russ a mere coffee and Terrence Mann hit 83 pointers at 10 trees so  tough luck tough nuts  Kawhi Leonard second career triple double in this ball game that's fun little footnote for Kauai whose number six per game in nine cat hmm  chef's kiss on that one  oh yeah that's been a good one James Harden with another decent ball game he sits mid second round Paul George is number 12 Clippers are a fantasy just an absolute gem Hall  and then Russ is the thing everybody like Dan should we go get rust no no he was pissed he's played well against the Lakers he had three three-pointers one of them not wearing a shoe  you got good rest here you're bound to get a bad rust and so you know don't overextend yourself on on Russell Westbrook but we'll keep this one on the relatively short side today  quick reminder to check out our buddies over at manscaped.com promo code there is ethos 2-0 to get 20% off and free shipping on
