welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right no funny business today we got 11 games to recap I got a very busy day  I think  I don't know you guys know I can't think more than a few hours ahead at this point in my life there was a time man  look back fondly on those days there was a time in my younger years  that I could actually just remember all the things I needed to do in a given day and now it's one item at a time compartmentalized chop it up  get it all done that way somehow  anyway  good day to you all welcome to Fantasy NBA Today sports ethos presentation I'm your host Dan Bass Pros  at Dan best person on Twitter  in fact most of you that are watching live right at the very beginning our actually over on Twitter right now so hello YouTubers you're filing in folks watching listening after the fact love you guys  please do take a moment before we dive in and we're gonna dive in almost immediately today to like rate subscribe  I know it's towards the end of the season how many people are finding this show now for the first time at the very end of a basketball season but there might be one  and if there's even one of you  feel free to say something in the comment section that would be fun I'd love to know if there was like one person that was joining us for the first time that'd be cool actually  anyway don't in the comments you can throw in the chat room whatever it all makes sense let's just start going through yesterday's card well we'll pause it things that are of significant note and right out of the shoot we got a significant note Chris Paul back for the Warrior's after an extended absence  and he looked good and his return  hit a couple of three-pointers hit three of them actually nine points four boards six assists four steals three threes it helps to play the Wizards that's for sure but a good sign and someone that I think you can generally start in fantasy his minutes will I would think ramp up pretty quickly because his injury was too his hand not to his lower body not to his core anything like that that you United kind of the ease back in a little bit more Clay Thompson it's six more three-pointers Off the Bench so he continues to be a hold in his new his new digs the bench  uh Brandon pajam skis the one that I'm worried about he had seven four and four he did have two steals a block and a three to kind of float the fantasy line but again if this is what you're going to get against the Wizards  I don't know how good this could look against anybody else you can give him a soft hold right now just to kind of see how things shake out over the next call it three ball games but I have a feeling that pods is gonna be a drop and it's also worth pointing out that he did this in this one with Andrew Wiggins out  he didn't like he was starting for Wiggins Moses Moody got the start but only played 22 minutes Moody did less than what Wiggins does so everybody else had a little bit extra but then you could see some of that now is sort of shuttling towards Chris Paul and for that reason I think we probably see pods back on Waiver Wires within the next week or so but probably wise to just give him a little bit of time to kind of see how the piece is all fall together  over on the wizard side we finally got that good Marvin Bagley game where you didn't tank your percentages for a night 20 points 9 boards a steal two blocks at three pointers a couple of assists  and this is the kind of thing we were hoping for which was more usage  and good minutes because they're just isn't another starter they're willing to play they have her Sean Holmes but they don't seem particularly willing to utilize Rashawn Holmes so all of a sudden now and there was no Denny Ave for this game so that's why Landry shamet started again also because Bilal Kula believe was out so you had this sort of like Russian nesting doll thing going on there it's like oh well what happens if obvious out well then we open that doll and hey there's below well what a b laws out and you open that doll and then you get all the way down to the little bitty Landry Shaman the middle of the dolls and he's not a play Corey kispert is interesting these days though  I like what we're seeing out of him and I've been talking about him for a few weeks someone even commented on a show I did like a week and a half ago they were like why you spending eight minutes on Corey kiss burn  this is why  the dude is actually a little bit better at basketball than we were all giving him credit for and he's been solid for like three weeks now  the issue of course is when he's coming off the bench we just don't know how much he's gonna get to do so as a starter kiss bird becomes a pretty easy play took 15 shots he's not bashful these days and then if anybody gets shut down on the Wizards not that they need to lose more ballgames but at some point these you know the veterans the highest Jones is the Kyle kuzma's they're gonna be like I'm tired man let me let me take a breather  and then you really get the whole explosion time and then I know he shot the ball horribly and had six turnovers but I actually kind of like bench Jordan Poole he's more of like a top 100 level guy instead of 150 just because he's shooting he's seems to enjoy coming off the bench and just firing like a loony bin  so right now  and obvious sort of the wild card here because he's heard but bagley's a start tyus Jones is a star kuzma's a start pool is actually a start right now believe it or not and then kiss Birds the guy who was sometimes start  so we're up and obvious too so we're up to like five and a half six guys on the Wizards that suddenly now are posting some fantasy value and that's fun  good stuff  Cleveland in Dallas this was a wild one maxed went nuts he had five three-pointers late including a 50 footer to Win It  Ridiculous by the way here's the numbers for Spruce set seven three-pointers 21 points 4 boards for assist two blocks overall the funny thing he was on his way to a pretty mediocre ball game before he went completely insane  and you guys know that I just cannot  figure out what I wanted to do with Max Drew's on a game to game bases his wife made him the official  cover art for the doesn't matter Club because he's going to have a game like this and you're gonna be like oh  screws and then he's going to have a game like the one he had the previous day which was not very good but the one before that was actually kind of good  he's gonna bounce back and forth between good games and bad games and he's gonna settle somewhere between 100 and 130 which is a guy you can definitely use on the head-to-head side because he's been extremely durable and he's getting you sort of a smattering of things but a guy that's hard to use against a games cap because you don't want to get him on the crappy days and then accidentally not play them on the good ones  what do you do I don't know I actually don't have the answer to that one  so you either play them you don't doesn't matter  Darius Garland being this terrible is a bit of a surprise I do have him in a league  this is another scenario where I bought into somebody else telling me what to do I just I'm like  yes sometimes I get in the right direction on stuff like that but nothing makes me more annoyed then when I'm like all right well people say Darius Garland's pretty good and I'm like looking at his number from last year and gone sky was top 50 in what was like a pretty good and repeatable season why am I why are we collectively why are we drafting him in the late 30s or early 40s just didn't make any sense because people were like oh you got to get a cysts like yeah okay maybe anyway he's 108 he's six Lots in front of spruce some of that's turnovers but some of it's just that he's been kind of bad but it's not like you can do anything about it other than complain which is what I'm doing right now so let's go back over to the other side of this one Dallas Luca wow I mean honestly this is the season that everybody's been waiting for out of Luca for I don't know how many years now basically the year where he's not fatiguing as the year goes on he's played in 50 ball games which is solid enough and his percentages are still  decent field goal percent is basically like a net neutral even if a slightly pot small positive for your guard to get you that type of number  and the free throws which is normally a colossal negative he's managed to keep in the high 70s so kind of minimizing the negative impact there and then everything else is just insane which it always is points 3 rebounds assists that stuff is always crazy for Luca the question was how much would the bad stuff percentage is typically yank that down the board and this year the answer is not much he's been crazy  also the fact that he's  because embed is not going to qualify Luke is going to be the NBA leader in scoring and it doesn't seem like anybody's going to be all that close on a per game basis Shea just Alexander by totals is a pretty as a shot to beat him probably will just because he's played seven more games right now but like but Luke is doing this year is crazy and we probably should talk about it more but  whatever Kyrie another good ball game out of Kyrie Irving he's number 11 on a per game basis  the missed games have been a pain in the butt but from a per game standpoint he's been exactly what it was expected there  the issues with Dallas right now is they can't decide who they want to play at Center Maxi kleber got 27 minutes at Center off the bench in this ball game Derek Lively started and played 22 Daniel Gafford their big trade deadline acquisition in the guy that I'm trying to convince you guys to hold on to played Seven Minutes in this game and got roasted in the seven minutes that he was on the floor and it wasn't all his fault necessarily it was just sort of a lineup that he was a part of  but Jason Kidd is not gonna stick with any of these three centers if they're not playing well on a given day and so for Gafford he was the odd man out  I'm still gonna try to give it a few more ball games here I know the ceiling is falling the sky is falling the whole thing but like  is it really good to be Cleburne  we're trending towards none of these guys being on Ross's  possibly an injury would free up both like if Cleveland went down again live in probably both be playable with Lively goes down Gafford and Cleburne Gafford would probably be playable because Maxi needs solid like 32 minutes to hit fantasy value  but right now they're all healthy which I guess you know good for Dallas bad for us  gaffer's gonna get dropped everywhere after a seven minute game and honestly I don't blame those teams for doing it see if you can hang on just a game or two longer it's not a lot to ask I know it's hard right now and if you're you know fighting for a playoff spot and all that stuff this is sort of like bottoming out  and you might be able to just pick them up off the waiver wire in a couple of days if you've not on your team and I'm not saying he's necessarily going to be awesome but what it looks like right now is all three guys are going to just be cooked as long as they're all upright  Brooklyn Orlando was a blowout Brooklyn was without Cam Thomas in this ball game they were with without Ben Simmons in this ball game  and so we got kind of a look at okay what happens if a lot of usage gets poured back into the communal pool  and the answer was you kind of need to hold on to cam Johnson in those scenarios he played 29 minutes and sort of I don't know anybody had business playing 209 minutes but he did and he got the start again partially because of who was out for this ball game and Dennis Schroder so I feel like if Cam Thomas and or Ben Simmons misses another ball game you can probably play both of those guys if Simmons comes back and plays his 19 minutes or whatever it is he probably need to reassess but this is one of the reasons that I keep saying hang on to Camp Johnson just a little bit longer it's been such an up and down frustrating year there's no sugar coating that part  but the Brooklyn Nets are awful  they don't have their pick so there's no reason for them to tank  but there are reasons to just sort of see what they've got Kevin Ollie Now new head coach kind of mix and match bodies a little bit see what makes sense  and hopefully one of the things that makes sense is just sort of more aggressive iteration of Cam Johnson now I don't again we have no way of knowing that's to be the case but still feels like Ben Simmons is one game away from being cooked if he feels like cam Thomas's injury will keep him out for a couple of ball games so we got kind of an opportunity to assess this situation same thing with Dorian Finney Smith so you kind of got three dudes on this club right now we're like well maybe so Schroeder Dorian Finney Smith cam Johnson  cam Johnson would be my my preferred hold among that list but it's possible that all three end up barely useful it's also possible that all three end up crap so I don't know that you need to like well rethink that thought I think I'm holding cam Johnson in most formats because we know he can be quite good Schroeder is a tougher one because we know he we need him to get well he needs to get for Fantasy value a lot of usage and then Dorian finney-smith like you just need 33 minutes of ball game which  maybe so he'd be the lowest on the totem pole there  or Lando had no problem taking care of business without Paulo Monteiro in this ball game everybody got weird minutes because the game was over early you're not making any adjustments to your evaluations with this team which is basically like fronts Wagner is a nine category player and then everybody else is just scraping at it  they need an injury for someone else to be a nine cat guy and that's not a thing that it's nice to root for so we'll just sort of quietly Move Along  the belly bellies took care of the zombie Nicks who you know they had some Gusto the Knicks had some Gusto and they lost Randall and lost OG&E and you just like you knew they were gonna run out of gas because they played all their guys for 45 minutes a game and that can only work for a couple of weeks until they just like don't have the energy anymore  meanwhile over on the Pelican side McCollum not back yet so Trey Murphy remains a very good stream when he's starting herb Jones is a play right now as well and that's kind of it on the Pelican side for the Knicks they're still trying to play everybody Tibbs is 40 minutes no heart and shine on the back-to-back Jericho Sims was like yeah  I don't really like Jericho Sims fantasy Game Boy on bogdanovich got an opportunity because they basically couldn't play hardenstein the full ball game and then sometimes boy ons gonna get hot and this will happen and then you know two or three ball games in a row it'll be bad  also know Jalen Brunson here miles McBride is a much better feeling than bug zdanowicz or Jericho Sims so Brunson out brick bride becomes sort of like a nice little one to one thing there but generally even chenzo precious Josh Hart and shine runs in those the guys that you're playing it and then if you have these sort of individual streamer moments McBride is in my opinion you only won that I would take a shot on and let's Suddenly It's like oh heart and even chenzo or both out then you could probably go the boy on route but  I would need almost a guarantee that he's getting 14 shots and there are very few days where someone can give me that kind of guarantee  Philly was terrible Tyrese Maxey had 32 points in the rest of the team at 67 yeah gross  anyway this game was over early so you got terrible lines out of Tobias Harris Paul Reed Kelly oubre and Buddy hield all four of whom you can start in the next ball game  sad news of the day this is the game with it the Anthony Melton back out with back spasms he was just dealing with a spine issue so to know that there's now spasms in the back again  even if this spasm turns out to be a thing that goes away in a couple of days you can bet your butt that it's going to impact him mentally he's gonna start thinking that his back is just not gonna be alright  I hate to say this I hate to say it out loud  but you can probably drop D Anthony Melton he was on his way to ramping up but now the health thing becomes too big of an issue I'm willing to change my stance on this it doesn't make me happy to do it but I can't  Rodeo you can sit on him and see what happens you know throw on your bench because you got a game's cap you can deal with their head-to-head you just you can't afford the 0 is in the eight minute game and the fear and the slow ramp up again the fact that he was up to 17 18 minutes since last ball game was like okay great we got the ramp up going he'll be a 20 in the next one he was probably on his way to get over 20 in this ball game I can't I can't advocate in head to head leaks where you're fighting for anything at all to sit on a rer ramp up it's just too slow Celtics I mean whatever start the starters they don't have on back-to-back for a couple of weeks so you won't get your Al Horford fill in game until then and so we wait  Utah they're in there in a bit of a tank mode these days they're playing some young guys and they're feeling it out taeler Hendrix had eight and eight with a couple of steals yeah I'm not all that super excited about him or this year I'm you know I'm a redraft guy Walker Kessler at least finally got a better ball game played 29 and a half minutes off the bench 1412 and a couple of blocks so you're starting Collin Sexton you got six steals here this is you know that's like his quota for two weeks sex and Kessler John Collins crummy or ball game but you can start him Larry Martin and obviously you're ball game but you could start him and then I'll say the same thing I've said how many times now 10 150 Georges  hope you catch lightning in a bottle  he doesn't get that many defensive stats his percentages are going to be rough the turnovers are probably gonna be kind of rough so it's gonna be really hard for him to be inside the top 100 and 9 cat  I mean I don't know what more I can say on this front like there hasn't been that much pushback which is kind of good it almost feels like  and maybe it's because you guys listeners and my Twitter followers maybe you guys are just sort of like significantly better than the average fantasy player but  remember keonte had that really strong shooting stretch going into the All-Star break and then I think the first game coming out of it and then he's been abysmal shooting his last two so it's kind of level things out a little bit so over that stretch he's right around the edge of the top 100 but that's what like three really good shooting games in there if you and I can't say you can remove them but do we think that he's  I guess the question is do we think that he's gonna be in the like 44% range because that's where he is over the last two weeks or do we think it's gonna be more 40  it's actually kind of a significant difference because he's taking a lot of shots right now  over that two weeks band for George  he's taking like what 14 shots a game I think let me get the exact number here yeah 14 and a half shots per game over the last two weeks for George so is it gonna be  kind of bad or is it going to be atrocious  that's gonna be the difference between whether or not he's a nine cat player or not because if it's just kind of bad he could probably survive that with threes and assists and some scoring because the volume is higher right now and that'll probably put him my guess would be in that scenario between 100 and 1030 100 but if it's more like 39.40% shooting on volume and heaven forbid you know he's not making four three-pointers a game now you're talking about a guy who's between 130 and 200  so I don't know which one it's going to be but if you happen to get another two or three game span where he's shooting 50% sell High which is what I yelled about last time it happened  we just like here's the thing you know I spent so many hours every day handicapping this stuff that people like Dan how did you know that this is gonna happen you know it's not rocket science it's just not  Atlanta they're doing the whole you know we lost our Superstar we're gonna pick everybody's gonna pick it up here now it helps that they played Utah on this ball game but everybody's doing a little more Jaylen Johnson who I mean wow if not for his five weekend injury holy crap bogdanovich Clint capela DeAndre Hunter dejounte Murray even said he'd pay those you can play what I just list five six guys a lot of dudes on this Atlanta team that are all playable right now with no Trey young because that's just so much stuff to do that got dropped back into the big pool  I love the big pool  I actually don't I hate water Milwaukee blew out Charlotte this game was over very early Charlotte doesn't have enough players to play a bench so a lot of their guys still got normal minutes like Brandon Miller miles Bridges Trey man they all played starters minutes in this game even though it was a blowout disaster  Trey man is a similar but slightly different situation to keyonte George I think his stats at translates a little bit better than nine cat but it's the same thing if he goes on it's slightly better run you try to sell high if not I would say that the if you're just looking at it from sort of a strict ranking's standpoint you're probably looking at Treman and saying okay well like a best case scenario for him he could maybe get more to like that 75 80 range which I don't know that keonte gets there but the worst case for man is probably lower because I don't think is a sis are going to be as high as George out of these are gonna be as high as George I don't know that his steals are going to be as high  turnovers are probably be better um well yeah yeah tremendous turnover should be a little bit better over the last two weeks straight man is about 10 slots ahead of George and he's done it with big steals over that stretch is averaging two steals a game over the last couple of weeks five boards that's again probably higher than we're expecting out of him in the long term for boards here in 34 or 33 minutes yeah I mean all right that's sort of a taint table so I think I'd probably prefer Tre Mann over keonte George by a couple of rounds but it's again that same thing so when he gets hot and  for keonte the hot stretch is gonna be like a top 60 top 70 range kind of thing for man the hot stretch might be like a week and a half where you goes top 40 again same story try to move them when they run super hot because it's gonna be a big sine wave the Peaks will be high The Valleys will be low  we knew Nick Richards was gonna have a slower game after his big one like he's a top one 25 billion Center that's just what he is there's almost no reason to even think about it and Grant Williams not surprisingly slowed down it was bound to happen boy if you didn't have Giannis Bobby Portis or Dame on the Milwaukee side this game was over way too early  Brooke Lopez two steals two blocks that's basically the whole line  Jae Crowder at a slightly better game so did back on it did I mean I don't Malik Beasley is generally streamable right now with Chris Middleton out don't make adjustments to your valuation in a game that ended this fast  Detroit and Chicago I mean this was like what a weird weird ball game and Detroit ends up winning it and there's just like so much to hate about Chicago as a organization  this game being such a perfect example of the weirdness the Bulls were terrible in the second half they scored 40 total points in the second half of this ball game and why they didn't sell off all of their pieces Remains the greatest mystery in and like I get it they don't want to be non-competitive but  they're not competitive  it's just not how is it that the Bulls front office is the only there's like 25 people in that in that building that don't see what everyone else sees I'm so sorry Bulls fans it must be very very frustrating to be a bulls fan these days oh  we'll get to their side in a minute because there's only bad news coming out of the bull side on the Detroit side Jalen Duren Cade Cunningham those guys those are your everyday safe plays as our Thompson still getting big minutes despite the return of Isaiah Stewart is a very good sign  that's good  now that I had to say that so many times but that was one of my big worries was Isaiah Stewart going to ruin Oscar Thompson actually getting playing time and the answer at least for one day was no so strong hold on Thompson do you have to play him every day on the Roadhouse side and as a bit of a coin flip but very much a guy that you need to be holding down the stretch because it's seems like they're going to be starting to now force feed him minutes that's good news  the bad news for Detroit Isaiah Stewart's playing big minutes and he is Fantasy game doesn't translate very well it's mostly rebounds some three-pointers and every once in a blue moon he'll score a little bit not really enough for nine cat so probably leaving him alone and then that bumps Simone fontecchio down around who actually had a really nice ball game he had five three-pointers he took nine of them in 21 minutes that's not sustainable is you said yesterday was not sustainable Quentin Grimes seems like he got pushed a little farther down the totem pole so with Stuart back  he's not good enough himself to get on 9 cat rosters and then now that means that fante and Grimes pretty much have no path to it so  subtraction by addition  but at least you got a good not line out of us or Thompson  all right Bulls  so the only thing that came out of his ball game on the Bulls side is that Alex Caruso left and came back dealing with I think his hamstring right yeah hamstrings stuff he had five steals it is 25 minutes think the Bulls could have easily gotten a first round pick for Alex Caruso at the trade deadline easily  and I get it moving it cooked Zach Levine cook until next year we hope that would have been a lot harder but DeRozan they could have moved Caruso they could have moved  they could have moved the Bulls could have gotten assets beyond their wildest dreams  for at least one or two of those guys and they just elected to play it out and be bad it's just so frustrating  from a fantasy standpoint things are not all that goofy at least the only thing that we learned from this one is that if Caruso goes down Patrick Williams still on the Shelf Andre Drummond is actually the next man up  so the Bulls are like look if we don't have Caruso we're just going big we're going jumbo goal line package here  goal line package so if Caruso's out you could probably wiggle out an Andre Drummond stream  not I wouldn't have done it going into this ball game but he did pick up a lot of the slack for kerusso missing whatever you know the last 10 ish minutes of what he would have gotten in a ball game like this one so that's notable Allison notable because the you know the Pistons are not a gigantic team big enough because the steward during front court is sort of like big ish and wooch can hang with Isaiah Stewart at power forward and that's really what the Bulls are looking at canoe hang with the opposing team's power forward if the answer is yes then we can go jumbo  if the answer is no they're gonna go voucher Center  otherwise things stayed pretty much constant on the bull side just keep an eye on whether or not you can get something out of Drummond when we had another six defensive stats as what an unbelievable like late season push for wembanyama who was already good at the beginning of the year but he's just  like he's he's solved at the NBA puzzle in two and a half months that's way quicker than I thought that was gonna happen  kudos to you Victor I thought it would take him a year  now maybe towards the end of this season but he did it halfway through and so now he's just steamrolling he's up to number eight eight  he's got a bit of a gap between himself and Donovan Mitchell  on the per game side and then Kawaii like I don't think he's catching Kauai and Luke up but I mean  what's stopping him right now  there are no fantasy stats to speak of on the San Antonio Spurs none was a start Trey Jones is a start when B obviously  that's it I don't care if Kelvin Johnson has one good ball game he's not good  I don't care when Jeremy so on I don't almost a good month because we know he's also a problematic in fantasy  you guys may wonder do I like when a team is really easy to handicap and fantasy the answer is in life no on a podcast yes because it keeps us moving Timberwolves were without Karl Anthony towns for this ball game and then lost slo-mo halfway through so Nas Reed got 33 minutes and if Nas gets 25 minutes or more and Nas is in all systems go fantasy guy  make sure he's on rosters in case nasri gets either a fill-in start or if like one of the main guys is down  cat being down means that there's going to be enough usage although Anthony Edwards took 29 shots which you know typically maybe not the thing you want but against the Spurs they can get away with it  um  yeah just keep an eye on what's going on with the Wolves because nazri would be your your your jam there don't worry about Monte Morris they just they were able to run different lineups because San Antonio is not good  he was Houston also not very good these days what a weird year they've had got off to a blistering start and the rockets now 25 and 33  they are  very close to their season win total I think it was like high 20s right  was like 28 29 something like that  and I said something like  I get that they want to be good but I don't know if they're going to be and it's gonna be close actually at the end of they'll probably go over but I think it'll be close I'm in Thompson only 17 minutes here still hold give that one a little bit longer otherwise nothing else to talk about in the Houston side never anything to talk about in the Thunder side so we can just keep on rollin to the final game of the evening the heat got Jimmy Butler Nicolas yovich and Terry Rozier all back for this one so Tyler hero is the only main Cog not in they're still missing Josh Richardson and Thomas Bryan is suspended but as far as like the main guys getting Butler and Rosie your back on the second half of this back-to-back one was suspension one was injury that was a big get for Miami who didn't play all that well but sort of played it well enough  from a streaming standpoint well from a reality standpoint or like big names stuff you know Rozier obviously just get him right back in there but those guys being back pushed Delon Wright to a small role pushed High ques to a low usage roll push Kevin Love to a smaller role push Caleb Martin to a smaller role pushed Haywood Highsmith to a smaller role yovich is not somebody you're trusting full-time anyway so just like and this is what we talked about on yesterday's show it's not always just about how many minutes because Butler and Rosie played 63 yovich got 15 those guys all being back that's about 78 minutes back into the mix it's not just about finding 78 minutes to take away from the other guys it's about the fact that Rozier 14 shots for assists three free throws Butler 12 shots nine assists nine free throws the balls just in their hands instead of in Caleb Martin's hands or hot chez's hands or writes hands  that's why those guys are not useful anymore but then at least you've got Dunkin' Robinson feeling in for hero who was still good enough because you get the 34 minutes that gives him enough time to get a steal and a few rebounds and a couple of assists and that's just sort of the whole like  is this guy gonna be good enough well he's just out there for a really long time  yes  here comes back you don't play Duncan Robinson if he stays out of looks like you can continue to do so another injury in this long Tuesday card one of many DeAndre ayton who had actually finally started to play well and the word after the Ballgame was that his hand hurt a lot that's what Chauncey Billups was saying so he ain't coming back in the Super near future I think a best case scenario would be a week or two  which brings us to  do up wreath  and to money Kamara  there's a lot going on with this Blazers team  we have  Malcolm Brogdon still out we have shaedon Sharpe still out  we have scoot still out and now we have the Henry now  which you know  on its base is  interesting  because it gives us a lot of names to maybe look at  but it's also incredibly difficult in the modern NBA I know you guys remember like a decade ago if someone went out there was a guy that just took their place not all the time but most of the time now because everybody's position on the floor is so fluid  there isn't like one obvious guy in any scenario now I would think that with eight and out wreath is going to start at Center is he guaranteed 27 minutes no definitely not he's playing poorly like he did in this ball game he started the second half right and but he still only played 13 minutes they just went small and obviously the opponent will also factor into this a little bit  going small against bam out of Bio probably not that great of an idea but you know whatever for Portland this is why they got stomped in the second half they had no real solution  of the the fringy names which I will put on the board as doop wreath  to money Kamara  even Matisse thybulle  wreath probably gets the spots start so he would be the in my eyes the most likely pick up because you're like well look if he just plays medium he'll get 26 sentiments and that might damn well be enough for him to get to you know 120 range fantasy value but he's awful and no one else comes back for the Blazers then maybe you lean more towards Kamara because his Fantasy game is probably a little bit more translatable  but the minutes are less set and stone perhaps I don't know that he has the easiest path to them now the other thing that complicates this is what if somebody reappears for the Blazers what if scoot is back sounds like he's still probably a couple games away same story for Sharp and then Brogden you know he may just be going player coach mode the rest of the way but  and then if you're thinking what about Jeremy Grant and Anthony Simons like I don't even know if they can shut anybody else down or because they're already down so many bodies that like  someone has to go out there and score 20 points so they're gonna lose by 45 every night  the Blazers are a mess I don't know that this is this maybe one of those situations where it's just so the water is so murky  that there's almost no point in trying to see through it  if you insist on sticking a flash light into the murky murky swamps that is this fantasy team  Matisse thought I will is probably your highest floor guy because he's gonna play 30 minutes of all of these guys are still out and so he's gonna get you three defensive stats and then it's like all right have anything else happens great  if you want to take sort of the shot which is like try to continue my metaphor of swimming in murky Waters that's like opening your mouth for a minute it would be Reef say all right I'm gonna hope and pray that I don't accidentally swallow a syringe when I put my mouth and these murky Waters uh and that would be  Ruth gets a few games in a row where he plays like 29 minutes and if that happens he'll be fine  the safest move what I'm going to do  probably nothing  hope that DeAndre Aiden comes back and it doesn't take all that long  quick look at the chat room here let's see what we got in the chat room well I'm looking at the chat room this is a great opportunity to remind you guys you can find me over on social at Dan best briefs and to please go buy something because the season is winding down and so manscaped is also probably going to be winding down their partnership for this 2023 24 campaign but I want to make sure that they come back in September and that means I want to see if we can move three that's not that much three manscaped units go to escape units whoops Dan ethos 2-0 is the promo code over there  ethos 2-0  20% off  free shipping  ethos 2-0  20% off  free shipping at manscape.com  go get something post haste questions from the chat room we'll go lightning around on these bad boys Kelly you are Cole Anthony rest of season give me Kelly oubre in leaks that have a Max of four moves per week how many streamer spots would you recommend two  two  and in the playoffs if you can go full long stream mode  maybe even three I typically during the regular season go and so that will math it this one and is your number of weekly moves that's our stand-in variable  divided by 2  so if n is 4 which it is in most Yahoo default settings and divided by 2  two moves two streaming slots  in the playoffs I go and divided by two plus one  so typically I gets me to three I'm looking for guys at that point that go four games in six days six games and nine days if they're any teams that go five games over seven days that would be one that I would invest probably two of my three main slots in so it doesn't feel quite like a stream because you're sitting on guys for a while but then there's you know sometimes there's sort of staggered overlap so you're making one move every two or three days but you're getting a lot of games out of a guy in over two days or four you're getting over six seven or nine  that's for playoffs ah this question I actually answered during the show we dropping Melton sadly yes which is a real shame as a NetSpend Simmons has me mega fearful when it comes to back issues yeah as it should be and this is sort of in relation to the Dean Anthony Melton situation Ben Simmons has is a head case DeAnthony Melton by all accounts is not a head case so there's there's other things that are at play here and  so like I don't actually firmly believe that Ben Simmons even wants to be playing basketball that much anymore but I feel like he's doing it because he wants to prove that he's not a head case I think Milton is actually just gonna like quietly try to get right and play again but yeah you can't hold on to D Anthony for that second ramp up  best Bristol are you a fan of the music artist Moby that's not a question I expected to get today um you know like he had his few jams when I was younger  like mid to late 90s right that was so mid to late 90s would be sort of high school for me middle and high school and you know he had his few Jams he had the one in the Christopher Walken SNL skit I think that's Rockefeller skank right and he had the one in Cruel Intentions was in there that know and then what she's all that that was no that was Rockefeller skank I can't remember which ones which um it's fine I don't have a Mobi album or anything like that but I know a few of those those jams from  25 years ago did I miss your take on Daniel Gafford apparently my take is see if you can hold for another game or two but I also understand if you can't because it's like everybody's a mess there someone running this Sports ethos account sent to tweet at us I don't know who's in charge of that one right now I just traded Bradley Beal for Jeremy Grant hoping eight in his halfway to Cancun already yeah well I guess what Jeremy granny gonna be all that far behind him also big news to reveal at the end of today's show why did he wait until the end of the show because he's an idiot friends that's why Dan waited until the end of the show the baseball draft guide is out  it's out now so if you guys are out there and you're like how can I support Dan how can I support Sports he thought those how do I make sure that's Sports ethos continues to stay alive and grow and Bud like a delightful flower in springtime it is Springtime in like three and a half weeks go get yourself a baseball fantasy pass or an all-sport fantasy pass now if you're listening you're like Dan I love basketball and I really love sports ethos but I don't play baseball if you're on an NBA fantasy pass reach out

it'll mean the world of the guys over in the Baseball division to know that you're supporting their cause Joe orrico and his awesome team I've seen the articles in this draft guide they are with by the way all the love to our NBA guys as well probably the deepest Dives that I've ever seen maybe outside of like pandas player profiles because he would go 400 players deep on everybody's catching that but these are like the dynasty articles are insane the sleepers the busts the starting pitcher profile some of these things are four five six thousand words for just one little article in a draft guide and the orico 250 Joe's rank board comes out I think later today tomorrow at the absolute latest he's gonna start dropping his individual positions on the rank board and then you'll get the sort out the whole thing the aggregate after he gets through the positions projections also in that MLB draft guide were likely to have a draft tracker available as well all of that the MLB fantasy passes six bucks a month same as the NBA fantasy pass but again if you on something already hit me up all sport is the way to go get yourself baseball and basketball and in a couple of months when we're
