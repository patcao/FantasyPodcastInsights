welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right folks streaming time  it's Friday we'll try to take you through the weekend into the beginning at least of next week as well  but given the way that my personal schedules laid out I think think we're gonna have time to do some of these over the weekend as well we get a Saturday or Sunday streaming show go and we won't have anything else it'll be you know quick 15-minute deal over the weekend but if I can jam those in I think it would be useful  and you know you get so much injury news every day that it feels  like you know we do these shows we do these streaming shows when you try to look ahead a day or two it becomes extremely complicated because you don't know who's gonna get ruled out and frankly in the time between when I created this stream like 10 minutes ago and going on are Desmond Bane got ruled out for tomorrow and Luke Kennard sounds like he's getting ruled in for tomorrow so it's literally happening every half an hour meaning if we can do a show on the day of the games we should try to do a show on the day of the games  where my welcome to Fantasy NBA today one way or the other I'm Dan Bes thanks as always for tuning in everybody please take a moment if you're joining us for the very first time to like rate and subscribe I've been I'm gonna try to ramp up how much I bug you guys to do that I can even walk you through the how to rate a show deal on the podcast app your Apple branded mobile device  they'll do some more of that over on social media time to make a push I think on that side Sports ethos.com the website Sports ethos on Twitter is well Sports ethos is one of them you can also do ethos fantasy BK for just the basketball feed and again I am Dan d a n best press b e s b r i s  who has bad schedules  all right suppose we can start there that's seems reasonable enough that's a good place to be begin because then you know who you can perhaps  dump  Toronto who had one of the worst schedules yesterday continues to have one of the worst schedules they are a day closer the Raptors are to their one loan game the rest of this week which is on Sunday  but bad news for Raptors fantasy holders is that they're off again on Monday before they do then finally start a better scheduling stretch where they have a back-to-back and actually six games in nine nights so the Raptors go from a bad schedule to a pretty good one between Monday and Tuesday of next week but there are really bad team to be sitting on if you had a raptor you should have gotten off of them yesterday but believe it or not they still have the worst schedule even today  also among the bad schedules Milwaukee believe it or not now goes from having a really interesting schedule because they played on all the light traffic days to have a pretty crummy one yes they played tomorrow so if you're sitting on a buck you can hold through tomorrow I would recommend abandoning ship on Sunday because they're off back to back days yes they have four games next week yes one of them is a back-to-back on Monday or on Tuesday Wednesday or two of them are I should say but then they go Friday Sunday of next week which are very much overload days Friday has 12 Sunday has 13 because the NCAA Championship is on that following Monday do you have to move off of your bucks no absolutely not if you have Malik Beasley who's been eminently streamable lately you could just hang on the problem of course is having one game over four days usually you can find somebody who gives you at least a one game bounce  and in this particular case there are teams that can give you a two-game bounce that have three games over the next four days the difference of course is that those teams play on the high traffic days so are they worth while to your team and we'll get to those clubs in just a moment but that's the way you'd want to be tilting because there is an opportunity to get a two game bounce  over the next four days off of Toronto and off of Milwaukee  provided you're not overloaded or full on Friday tomorrow today excuse me and Sunday  the end of the weekend  who are the ads well let's talk about the good schedule first and then we'll get to the ads the good schedules belong to Orlando they have a back to back today tomorrow ah and then they're off Sunday and they play on Monday so three games in four days or you can go four and six if you really wanted to extend it all the way to Wednesday of next week that's perfectly reasonable  because Friday and Sunday are the overload days Monday through Thursday are all pretty normal  and Orlando gives you that flexibility with the back-to-back today and tomorrow where if you really wanted to move on on Sunday you could do it you also have some options Mo Wagner Cole Anthony these are guys that are kicking around on Waiver Wires you might be able to find  oh I don't know I don't think I'm willing to take a shot on Jonathan Isaac who I love for Roto league but Head to Head too much risk on the back-to-back  and that's probably about as far as you go with Orlando but those are pretty good options for the back-to-back  also with a good schedule and you know most of these teams have three games in four nights it's just has to do with kind of what order there in Charlotte has the next best schedule they go three times in four nights the back-to-back is Sunday Monday so you don't have the same flexibility and if you happen to be overloaded either today or on Sunday then you don't get to maximize it in that capacity  but Monday is a pretty low tide day um  the back-to-back being Sunday Monday means you're pretty much stuck holding for then and then they also play on Wednesday of next week so you could hold for six days and get four games that way and finally the third team with the decent schedules the Chicago Bulls I think folks that were watching along you saw as I was scrolling past this club there's there's  Chicago and who they just say the Charlotte Hornets yeah Charlotte's the other one and Chicago you know the only real streamer level guy on the Bulls is Andre Drummond and they are all so off for three days after Monday so if you want the Bulls route you have to drop on Tuesday  not only they are they offered three days but they don't go into a back-to-back or anything after that so it's one game over a five-day span  which I get it you know one out of five is 20% zero out of three is zero but both of those are way too low for you to be using on your fantasy team  I already mentioned the players that you could roll with on Orlando if you wanted to go the rat that direction if you wanted to go Charlotte or Chicago we just talked about Andre Drummond Charlotte has a handful but silly I miss itch is streamable specially if you're hunting assists Grant Williams is streamable if you're looking for three's in a couple of rebounds for boards and field goal percent entry man if he's floating around on Waiver Wires a streamable if you want kind of a little bit of everything with maybe not the world's greatest percentages but there are a lot of options on the magic and the Hornets between the two of them even if there aren't all that many on the Chicago Bulls  you have some pretty good options if you're trying to upgrade but those only make sense I'll repeat it again if you're not full today and Sunday because if you're full today and Sunday you might not be able to get both of the games played they have the rest of this week you might be able to get one out of the two so I think today's what Friday today is a dozen and Sundays 10 or something like that just off the top of my head I'm pretty sure that's what it is of looked at a lot of schedules here over the last couple of weeks so apologies if I got that number wrong  in all likelihood you probably are full today or extraordinarily close to it Sunday I think there's a lower probability if it's you know 10 games out of 15 2/3 of your team is playing if you've got a 13 game or 13 slot roster like on Yahoo you probably have eight to nine of your guys going so it's probably some room on Sunday the other you know the thing you really need to be checking in and is on today  which is why if you're sitting on someone like a Boston for instance that only has one game left the rest of this week or at Atlanta they only has one game left the rest of this week and I know I mentioned the other two teams in Milwaukee as a worst schedule and Toronto because they're one in four but there are a lot of teams that only have one game left this week in three days  so those are also possibilities  you'd have to then probably it's a little bit it's not as good because those teams go on Monday so it's not a bad schedule per se but you could turn a 1 into a 2 with a team like Boston they're one of them Atlanta's another one we've talked about Indie as one because they're done after today you're not gonna make a move there but after today you could make a move on those clubs Phoenix and Portland OR done for the week after today that was what other ones that you look at we talked about Toronto with just the one game left over the weekend New Orleans has just one game tomorrow Memphis has just one game tomorrow so there's all these teams that only have one game left the rest of this week  you have to just make sure again there's scheduled are not as bad because they play on Monday the clubs we were just talking about not the not Toronto not the ones that I had mentioned earlier but the ones I just threw into the mix  that aside from Milwaukee play tomorrow Saturday and Monday but again if you're really going hard at this week the players you should be looking at dropping are the ones that only have one game left the rest of this week even if next week their schedule starts a little bit better because you want to maximize your games turn a 1 into a two if your schedule allows for it if you're full today and Sunday he pretty much just hold through today then there's no reason to make a move today if you're full today you're not making a move what the hell's the point make a move tomorrow or make a move for Sunday  I don't care when you do it just don't do it today  if you are looking towards trying to get a pretty good start on next week your options are somewhat limited because Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday are all kind of medium days with Monday actually being the quietest of that bunch  so there are no Monday Tuesday back-to-backs next week so there's really no way to hyper front load your schedule Atlanta has an excellent schedule to start the week they go three times the first four days of next week and they are believe it or not the only team that does so so if you can hold on to your Hawks through their one game left this week try to do it because they got three games in four nights to start next week and then when everybody else is playing on Friday and Sunday once again the Hawks are on the in between they play on Saturday so you not only get four games next week but you get four quality games Hawks have the single best schedule of any team in the NBA next week and frankly it's not all that close because most of the teams that have a really heavy schedule play on Friday or Sunday or both  not all of them but many  ones that don't for next week again if you're looking at next week Brooklyn they go Monday Wednesday Saturday Sunday so the only one of those overload days but again Sunday's basically a wash just 13 games that day you're almost definitely gonna have at least 10 guys going so teams that are not playing on Sunday at Atlanta Denver Detroit and Memphis those are the only four those teams do have an advantage early in the week  Memphis is sort of a maybe because they play on Friday meaning you might only get three of their four games  Detroit same Monday Wednesday Friday Saturday Denver Tuesday Thursday Saturday so you're getting all three of those games and that is we just mentioned about Atlanta Monday Wednesday Thursday Saturday that's a great spot where you're going to get to use all four of your Hawks next week try to load up if you can I know the streaming options are not all that good Bruno Fernando is kind of the only one that making any sense right now but you know if you get four good games out of Fernando congratulations you ain't doing any better than that  so that's a look ahead and next week we'll also cover that a little bit on tomorrow show and on Sunday show provided I can get those out I think we can also there has been a request that I put out the streaming information on Twitter the day before so I'm gonna try to do that for tomorrow lineups now basically when we sign off this broadcast I'm going to take over to social media we'll try to get that out there I'll do a little like reminder Tweets in the middle of the night just in case anybody missed it and I'll do my best to try to make sure you guys can see what day it's for that's also kind of important but that's what's coming up here  quickly check out the chat room looks like we got three posts in there during our quick hitter Daniel thinking about dropping keonte George to activate Donovan Mitchell today Utah has three high volume Day games next week  all right well let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about here Cleveland they go Tuesday Wednesday Saturday Sunday so they got three games on days where  things are pretty full or not full I should say and Utah Tuesday Friday  Sunday oh yeah absolutely I mean this is this is like not a question mark anyway I'm assuming you mean Donovan Mitchell oh yeah Utah is a great team to unload for next week because you really only lose one day  in all likelihood dropping keyonte George won't cost you games next week  other than Tuesday  and we're talking about Donovan Mitchell here like this is a monster they go Tuesday Wednesday in their off for two days but they do play on Sunday  but regardless this is Donovan Mitchell you'll you'll push somebody on Sunday to get a first rounder in your lineup  hey Dan should I drop Grayson Allen one game and pick up Cole Anthony for two no hold on to Grayson Allen for today and if you really need coal Anthony you can pick him up tomorrow  because Grayson Allen is better than Cole Anthony  so I would rather have a game of Grayson Allen today versus a game of Cole Anthony today and if you wait by tomorrow you'll have an even better idea what categories you need to hunt and then you just pick up someone that goes  one game the rest of the week you have your choice maybe it's called Anthony maybe it's a pelican maybe it's a Buckaroo maybe it's a Grizzly Desmond Bengal ruled out Luke Kennard just got ruled in Kennard tomorrow could be a really interesting grab  and my first fantasy basketball season 7th year in fantasy sports and I'm in first in my medium competitive 12 team lead thanks to you doing my buy right now I'm killing the field this week against no one yes my man ride us to Victory we allow 10 weekly moves oh my God any strategies with that much leeway or just go a ham on the ads I mean  honest to goodness I've never been in a league that it that allowed 10 moves but I would  I would stream like five roster slots  with the amount of there aren't even enough streaming guys on Waiver Wires to use 10 moves on you might not get to use them all it's so many that's crazy  holy mackerel I hope the waiver time is short because otherwise the whole league is going to be on waivers by Tuesday  I don't know if you use all 10 normally I'd say use every move you have but like  if you have a good roster  13 14 players something like that you know drop your 9th best player that's  like guys probably pretty good  I don't Jordan to answer your question I don't have strategies for a 10 weekly move League I think you probably just you know with Sunday being washed everybody's playing basically it's a Six-Day week of effectively so I mean really try to front load get a ton of games Monday through Thursday because he ain't gonna make a whole lot of ground up on Friday Saturday or Sunday Dan I could use a second streaming spot but I can't choose who to drop between Chris Paul Paul Reeder Yusuf nurkic  uh it's probably Chris Paul in a vacuum let me quickly check on each team schedule for next week  um  Bibby Dooby Dooby Doo Warriors Tuesday Thursday Friday Sunday so yeah probably only get to use them for two of those Paul Reed on Philly is Tuesday Thursday Saturday Sunday so that's better  and then  nurk Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday  yeah it's probably Chris Paul believe it or not he's been really bad lately and his schedule isn't all that great  unbelievable I know what a Time  all right 18 minutes and we'll put a pin in it good luck everyone let's get some points to night and again I'll try to get back with you tomorrow morning with a streaming show for Saturday and please do check over on Twitter at Dan best price that name is on the screen it's very easy to see if you're watching on Twitter make sure you hit follow because when
