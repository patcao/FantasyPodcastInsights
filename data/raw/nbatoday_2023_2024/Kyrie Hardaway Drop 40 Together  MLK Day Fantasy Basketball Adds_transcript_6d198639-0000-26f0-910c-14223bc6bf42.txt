welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  sizable recap upcoming on today's show  with your still unshaven  rabbinic look Toast of a fantasy basketball podcast I am Dan vasper this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos.com presentation you can find me over on social at Dan best purse some of you I believe are even watching this show on social right now because we've opted for the simulcast here over the last week or so it seems like it hasn't created any  negative  like it doesn't seem like there's any downside to doing the simulcast I still don't entirely understand what the positives and negatives might be but we'll just keep doing it for now  we got a lot of games to cover today big Boosie MLK Day slate to recap we had some guys that returned from injury we had some 40 burgers a few of them actually had 340 Burgers yesterday  that's a lot of 40 burgers  news of the morning trying to do a better job of giving you news of the morning not much today uh Jae Crowder is the news of the morning that he's back for the Bucs he'll play a little bit he'll probably get mid 20s and minutes but that's not gonna creep in we'll play no role at all in your 12 Team league he'll be useful in some deep performance though and then also everybody on the Nuggets who was questionable for this game against the Sixers  on the injury report yesterday they've all been upgraded to probable  so I think there was a fear that perhaps the Nuggets might try to arrest some folks but it's a TNT game and so Adam Silver came in and was like nah  you get arrested these dudes you get a weight  nuggets  nah  that's good news if you have nuggets  I hope you guys liked the weird little one-off show we did yesterday the trade machine episode I don't know it's kind of fun I have no idea if it was a Smash Hit  seems like it was somewhat well traffic a lot of comments in the in the chat room was we were rolling through and so maybe we'll try to do another one of those down the line in the meantime let's just dive straight on in again everything you guys need to know is in the show description Discord link sponsor links Twitter feeds all that good stuff just make sure you follow that's like a big thing like rate subscribe all that good stuff and let's go ahead and dive in  Houston at Philly the continuing Saga of how the Rockets depth has been tested and as kind of been exposed  to that end you know there hasn't really been any one culprit with the Rockets other than the fact that they've just sort of  Fallen apart here after a hot start to the year  they are a decent basketball team but they were never as good as they looked at the beginning of the year they've been very bad on the road from the outset Rockets are four and fourteen which is worse than the Trailblazers on the road  15 and 6 at home so at least they still got that going for them they're the you know I think we talked about this couple weeks ago they're like the Sixers from whatever that was two years ago I think where they were insane at home  ultimately Dillon Brooks being back is going to be helpful for the Rockets but they're just sort of  I think teams have figured out a little bit what they want to do you've seen various parts of their game of kind of come back to earth  they I'm sure would love to get tari Eason back but at the same time this is like basically the lineup they had to start the year when Ethan was also hurt and they were putting together wins at that point  so what's going wrong now  it's nothing obvious really I mean Shen goon's been fine Freddie was not good in this ball game but overall he's been decent lately Dillon Brooks being back gets them to almost full strength it's just  I think this shine is come off a little bit and now we're seeing okay they're you know they're more of a middling team than a team that's way up near the top  and that's okay these things take time the young guys need to get better Jabari Smith Jr needs to get better Jaylen green badly needs to get better  and they I'm sure would love to get  tar he said healthy but cam Whitmore I'm in Thompson to very promising rookie on this club they will also need to and will like Lee get better but these things take time  from a fantasy standpoint the only thing you're dealing with here on the Rockets is thinking all right how long am I willing to sit on tari Easton and that's sort of format dependent because if you can't you should and if you can't then well you know that better than I do as far as Billy goes Joel embiid is back and he's real back 41 points 10 rebounds he did it in three quarters again Tyrese Maxey was better in this one he's been kind of slowly tapering prior to a couple of big ball games here so it's good to see him push back up from 20 to 15 range that's good news  my question coming into this game was whether Kelly oubre Jr would have enough wiggle room with no D Anthony Melton but yes Joelle and bead in the lineup and the answer was no not really he only took eight shots in 26 minutes  some of that was blowout related but I mean really how many more shots did we think Uber was gonna get if this game was tight down the stretch  and extra what three four minutes would be the Assumption there  so do we or don't we stream ubra Junior with Melton out for at least a week my inclination is to say no  head-to-head makes sense I think Philly if I'm remembering right as a pretty good schedule this week Rodeo where I make a lot of my final decisions okay is this player good enough to use against a game's cap and I think the answer there is no  New Orleans had all their guys back  you know talk about the ultimate weirdo stretch here the Pelicans rested everybody and got a win in their last ball game and then brought everybody back in this one and got a loss and that type of weird stuff happens when two teams play each other  a couple times in a row  which is what just happened Pelicans beat the Mavs on Saturday  118 108 with all backups and then the Mavs beat the Pelicans yesterday with their starters 125 120  Kyrie Irving is on a serious he's on a bender right now at this point he's up to number nine on a per game basis he passed Kevin Durant and Larry Martin and during the last little stretch he's got a little ground to cover if he wants to catch Luka in per game stuff but the way he's playing right now I think we talked about it on yesterday show he's been the number three player in fantasy since coming back from his foot injury Luca being out certainly doesn't hurt the case Tim Hardaway Jr is a stream when either of the two superstars for Dallas is out and then  as far as the other guys go well first of all Derek Lively being back he's someone that definitely needs to be rostered  but as far as the fringy guys go no Derek Jones Junior and no Dante Exum for this one but nobody really stepped up Josh Green was the one where it's like well maybe there is enough shots and now now it's not worth it's not worth taking the plunge I you know as guys come back like if it was right now if it was Tim Hardaway Jr as like the second in command and then you had Exum I might I'm probably consider it or Derek Jones if one of those guys was in I'd probably play them if when Luca comes back I'm not sure that I play the Mavs streamer type guys right now  and then as far as the Pelicans go we talked about it again on yesterday's show so I feel like I'm repeating myself a tad but Jonas Valentine's is now trending down a bit I don't think it's gonna be a precipitous drop off but with Larry Nancy around and providing stuff that JV does in which is defense for the most part  they're going to be games where they pivot in his Direction  This was the reason that I was low on Valentine's coming into the year and obviously missed badly because he's been very good but now we're starting to see some of the nonce effect which we didn't really see during obviously Larry he's injury but over the last two or three weeks you Valentine's is more like top 80  which is still higher than I was willing to take him I thought he was going to be more in that 100 to 125 range so yeah I still was too low but this is starting to look a little bit more familiar so JV might be more of an 80 range guy now going forward as long as Nance stays healthy which again could be two days could be a couple weeks could be the rest of the year  and I think you should treat JV  accordingly  getting a much of Trey Murphy questions he's a hold because his three Steals and efficiency are good enough that it sort of counter weights the fact that he doesn't do much in other categories  this is the magic of how good can you be in one thing in nine cat and how bad can you be in another and which thing actually wins out  Detroit got a win yesterday ladies and gentlemen it was a it was a day it was a wild wild day Detroit now four and 36  it was gonna have to come against one of these bad teams they beat the Wizards 12917 Alec Burks 34 points on 17 shots if you're getting two points per field goal attempt and not taking that many free throws to get there that means you're a hot as hell and he was Burke said 83 pointers he's very much been streamable with Cade Cunningham out and said Cade Thompson who the hell is Cade Thompson Jalen Duren one rebound away from a 2020 game while also shooting 8 out of 8 from the field good to see him basically back at now full strength these top 50 over the last three weeks and that's without defensive stats he really hasn't gotten any over the last few weeks so there's room for additional stuff but listen  I want to talk about how much I love Jalen Duren and you guys know I do I've talked I've mentioned it a few times over the last like nine calendar months that watching during rebound is actually one of my favorite things to watch in the NBA if I could somehow manage to stomach more Detroit Pistons basketball people just explode off of him when he's healthy and he's dealing with his ankle stuff throughout the season so far but when he's healthy he goes up for a rebound and guys just crash off of his body  the sheer the sheer power and strength  of Jalen Duren is  ridiculous  but I'm also a pragmatic fellow so I know that you know 70% shooting on pretty good volume 82% at the free throw line that's stuff's probably not gonna stick  still some blocks probably are a little bit higher he's eighteen point eight combined in his last 10 ball games  16 and 12 the 16 feels a little bit on the high side for him so all these things they'll level off and that's okay but because he's fun and he's good ah durians not really the story for Detroit Burks is a story as our Thompson playing 27 minutes and actually doing something with them was a little bit of a story I think you can watch list him for now  Isaiah Stewart having an okay ball game not a story in my opinion this was the Wizards defense hard at work and then Jade nivi just continued this same pretty remarkable stretch of excellent counting stats 24 points 7 board 6 assists three blocks two three-pointers he was actually pretty good at field goal percentage yesterday's game as well but five turnovers in bad for you throw percent and right now  you know that you're playing this points League you're not playing this game but nine cat you're playing this R is the good outweigh the bad  and lately the answers been know which seems nuts because over the last four games he's Aberdeen 21 six and six with two and a half defensive stats  and yet he's outside the top 150 in nine cat  because he's shooting 43% on 18 shots a game  58% on six free throws and committing three turnovers at night  the ultimate points League Line and maybe Russell Westbrook vintage Westbrook was the ultimate points league line but this is very much in that vein  now if you're punting one of those three points League E categories the percentages or turnovers then yes is valued does jump quite a bit because he's been very very bad in all three of those things so I get it head-to-head leagues there are certain builds where he makes more sense nine cat if you're attacking all nine lately the answers been no  what can I say that I haven't said already  Washington side Daniel Gafford took a headshot late in this ball game we'll see if he's good for their next ball game He's listed as questionable right now if he's out they really don't have many other options on the roster at this moment all though by the next ball game one would assume that Marvin Bagley will be active after this trade with Detroit he probably gets the start if gaffer's not there all the maybe they go Anthony Gil and they bring Bagley Off the Bench  short version I don't think I could go down either of those paths  you got to be a bit of a masochist to want to go down that path  otherwise Wizards kept this game relatively competitive and so you know the normal guys played the normal minutes that's all we really can ask for with this team  Orlando beat New York in a very ugly basketball game which left us with very few players posting fantasy value GoGo bitossi played 29 minutes normal if he's gonna get that kind of run  then he typically has value Wendell Carter Junior was actually very very good it is 19 bench minutes didn't even play and the answer to the question is no question being do I bother with any of these centers  no  Jalen Suggs has been trending down pretty hard I'm trying to give him the longest rope possible but he's now outside the top one ten on the season the field goal and free throw percent of both plummeted the steals have really come crashing down as well  I'm giving Suggs 2 to 3 additional ball games that's the Rope here how much  how much rope  that's how much rope  if you can't pull it together the next two to three games and I probably move on if he can hopefully he will and that would be something but it is worth noting that Cole Anthony had a better game yesterday so he got some bonus run Marcel faults starting to show signs of life he played 23 and a Half Men it's that also impacts what Jalen Suggs is able to do because if he's not having a great ball game these other guys are going to cut into it so what do you do with all that information well it's becoming conceivable I don't want to say that it's definitely going to be the case but it's becoming conceivable that none of those three guys end up with nine cat 12 team value  markelle fultz you know he's gonna get games off he's he's skipped their last back-to-back they're gonna go very easy on him and I don't know how long it's gonna take to get him up to 28 29 minutes it might just not happen the rest of the year I don't know  let's assume that it does let's assume that it takes well he came back on January 7th so it's been about 10 days to get him up into the 20s and minutes call it another 10 days to get into the high 20s say another week and a half  to that end you could probably consider stashing if you want to sort of active stash Markle folks if you're in a head-to-head you can say all right you know I'll play him over the next 10 days he would happen so you'd keep him on your bench not using against the game's cap  but perhaps if he gets up to 28 29 minutes a night then he posts you know somewhere in that 90 to 120 range which is basically startable if not at all exciting  and also potentially ruins the value of guys like subs and Cole Anthony and the process because now you've got this sort of subtraction by addiction not addiction fantasy sports is the addiction that guys go down on this team you get stuff for other people by the way friends Wagner still out  Gary Harris as well  for whatever that's worth Caleb Houston  is your  three-point streamer head-to-head side only guy chumo Kiki was fine  so there's a lot to consider with the magic right now hopefully that was somewhat Illuminating as far as the Knicks go there just not that good without Jalen Brunson you saw it here like they went up against a good defensive team and they just they had nothing Julius Randle was bad  Deuce miles McBride was good again for the second game in a row which was egg on my face I was like no way this guy does it again  and he took 17 shots which probably isn't the way they want their office to be cooking but do you was decent again I still don't have the stones to pick him up and hopefully brunson's back anyway Dante even chenzo is a whole  but I'm not mostly because I'm a wimp I'm not adding McBride if you wanted to I suppose you could it seems like he's a decent stream with Jalen Brunson out I just know as soon as I do something about it then he's gonna disappear  this Hawks Spurs game which ended as a 10-point loss for San Antonio was at one point I believe a 30-point game Spurs came roaring back to make it interesting Trey Jones hold Victor one pajama excellent game Jeremy Sohan I don't care that's your Spurs breakdown Devin vassell is cooled off hard Kelvin Johnson we knew was gonna cool off he's done that as well  people keep asking me why I'm so mean about the San Antonio Spurs and I just don't trust them  every time Devin vassell climbs the board he goes falling back down a little bit keldon Johnson he's like he's falling way out of contention now  so that's why I tried to move them anytime I could  as far as Hawks go Jalen Johnson was awesome again every time you think he can't be more awesome he goes and he is then more awesome he's number 32 in nine cat after this six steel performance  oh  I wonder if click Capella's gonna get moved the Hawks are trying to convince us to Care they've had a very easy schedule lately and they haven't actually looked all that good even during it thing is the Hawks are tied with the nets for the 10 seeds these two teams that both appear to be completely bottoming out along with the Raptors or right behind them  these teams should not be buyers but I guess you never know we hear a lot of rumors about dejounte Murray being on the Move we have no idea who would come back in a potential Murray trade presumably there'd be somebody that's playable but if he leaves that leaves a lot of usage on the table which would help someone like Bogdan bogdanovich who has now finally cooled off not that it wasn't something we were hoping for it was something we was going to happen  the steals are still pretty good for him I mean this game was terrible but  overall they're still pretty good I just I keep waiting if capella gets moved and you get an all Kangoo situation if Murray gets moved  that would actually potentially solidify someone like a Sadiq Bay longer term who's been a filling guy basically the entire year to this point  but we're speculating at this point  so let's get back to actually talking about something that's really happening  Warrior's lost to the Grizzlies the zombie Grizzlies this is a bad look  a lot of what's going on with the Warriors is a bad luck they are 18 and 22  they are not good  they are a 500 team at home which oddly the Phoenix Suns are also 500 team at home but they have a winning record on the road there are not many teams in the NBA that are  competitive  that are not better than 500 on their home court  you say a lot of things about some of these teams like are the Lakers actually competitive not really a lot of the time but guess what they're 14 and 7 at home Rockets 15 and 6 at home  gonna go Eastern Conference  Bulls on a great team 13 and 10 at home  what point am I proving the point I'm proving is  I think there's a chance the Warriors go a direction that people aren't expecting I know everybody's like oh Warriors are gonna make a big splash they got to make a last run at it  they could also get wild and pull the plug  do I think it's gonna happen and no I give it like maybe a 10% chance but  it's something to watch they've got Chris Paul on the Shelf as a possible trade ship it sounds like they don't want to move Johnathan kaminga who had 20 and 11 in yesterday's game  but let's just go through it real quick and I'll tell you what I'm doing with each of these guys obviously you're starting Steph and Klay who wasn't very good those are the two sort of no-brainers on this team Draymond is back he played 24 minutes that'll ramp up into the 30s he's worth rostering to kind of see how this goes so Draymond is a roster  Dario saric had 13 and 7 but only 23 and a half minutes  no I don't think he can do it in that amount of playing time on a nightly basis  Wiggins played 31 minutes at 16 and 5 with a couple of blocks this was certainly a step in the right direction but I there yeah no I don't believe what I'm seeing at a Wiggins because every time it looks like he's gonna have a slightly better ball game he goes and has a terrible one right after it  but his minutes have been better the last three so that's at least something to monitor weighs is a monitor guy same story for Jonathan comingo who I don't know I don't know that his minutes are gonna be locked in in the mid-to-high 20s every ball game keep an eye on it he's better in head-to-head than Rodeo because he has some big gaps in his Fantasy game but monitor Jonathan coming God I don't think that he's gonna be a nine cat playable guy but he could surprise us just like Wiggins could surprise us trayce Jackson Davis is a drop and Brandon ski kind of like Jane's sucks for me right now I'm giving him about two more games with the team healthy to see what he does because he still got 27 minutes but it does seem like he's going through that doldrum period of the year and right now he's hurting more than he's helping  Memphis side I think we've got some obvious plays JJJ certainly is a play Vince Williams is a play Luke Kennard is a play save your Tillman is probably a play I know he wasn't very good in this ball game but 30 minutes at Center usually gets the job done  I'd like to see what happens between Tillman and aldama who only played 17 minutes but he did have a pretty good fantasy line in his 17 minutes I don't think he's a mustad guy right now Jacob Gilyard not an ad David Roddy not an ads I are William's not an ad GG Jackson is the only player I have mentioned because he's running extraordinarily hot right now  this was a much more well-rounded line than the last one  and the thing is we're dealing with a player where we sort of don't really know what they are fantasy wise he had 20 and 6 with a couple of blocks in the previous game he had 23 and six with two Steals and two blocks in this one he's getting added everywhere like he's going to be this like rest of seasonal but I just I can't I can't possibly believe that this is going to keep up long-term  because these two gigantic games these shots 64 and 67% he's at 7 3-pointers and he's done it in under 30 minutes a game in both of them  now yeah there's usage for days on this team because Bane ain't anywhere to be found smart ain't anywhere to be found John Moran is out for the year  like what's to stop GG Jackson from putting up some numbers the rest of the way nothing really like he could legitimately put up some kind of numbers the rest of the season  but you know a cold spell is going to come  and when it does the question becomes can the fantasy game supported is he really gonna be a guy who's getting like a block a game is that is that a possibility listed as a power forward in fantasy sights but he's just he's basically playing like wing for this Memphis team  so what is it become the answer is we don't really know so if you want to call him a speculative add I'm good with that he's just sort of a little farther down the totem pole in my eyes on this team mostly because of the unknown and a lot of people love the unknown and I'm horrified by it up Cleveland's been playing really well it doesn't hurt that they've had an extraordinarily light schedule lately  and they played a couple of teams that they can kind of pick on but this was a decent win for them both have been playing better lately now you know calves prior to this win over the world the wolves wolves wolves my all my talking about bulls at him  they had loss of the Raptors on New Year's Day and then beat the Wizards twice the Spurs and the Nets so the four game win streak for the Cavs was a bit overblown  this one was a little more impressive  as far as fantasy goes for the Bulls you're starting to starters there's like this is a pretty straightforward one for the Cavs  like I Max Drew's is in just a number to believable deep shooting slump I  its more and more difficult to say that you have to hold on but the thing is the dude is averaging some of the most minutes in the league he's just shooting 39% from the field and he's at 30 basically for about the last month and a half like it's a long cold spell but his minutes aren't going anywhere somehow so this is very much a Snowball Effect kind of thing right now he's cold and he's thinking about it something needs to break him out of this funk and when he does and you start to get on that positive feedback loop he starts to take more shots he starts to feel better he takes even more shots he feels better and it's gonna sort of snowball in the opposite direction so I can't in good conscience recommend a drop on streus because he's out there for 35 minutes a damn game  he just cannot throw a hoop a ball in a hoop he can't throw a pebble in the ocean right now  luckily for the Cavaliers their defense is excellent  careful vert your streaming while Darius Garland is out Jared Allen has been very very good Dean Wade and Sam Merrell each had better games here but I wouldn't read too much into that let's keep moving  Jimmy Butler back for the Heat  and he looked like Jimmy Butler 31 points 5 boards four assists two Steals on terrific percentages  he's someone that we had called a pretty straightforward by low he jumped from number 48 to number 402 with one decent ball game a few more and he'll be in the mid to low 30s we are just not that far away from Butler being he's probably not gonna get into the early teen's like he has over the last couple of years but again like all we need from Jimmy Butler is one or two games like what Jalen Johnson did yesterday just come out and get like a six steal game  because right now the Steels are the thing that's holding him back he's at one steal a game in about 25 games this year yeah it's exactly 25  he gives you like a four Steel game and a 5 Steel game back-to-back and all of a sudden he's at like 1.2  that's what's gonna move him  his return  basically meant that streamers are dead the era of the stream with Butler and hero they were out for a while Miami at all these streamers I met akaz Duncan Robinson Caleb Martin Haywood Highsmith I mean everybody's been rotating through even Orlando Heisman had a brief stream stretch in there  I think it's probably dead Caleb Martin played 34 minutes off the bench behind the Holyoke  he was fine but not good enough to Warrant a roster spot and this game was really a big three game for Miami bam hero Butler they did all of the stuff  I'm interested to see what hockey's role is because he probably starts instead of yovich when he comes back but again we're looking at a team now that has yogic Caleb Martin Josh Richardson Duncan Robinson all of these guys that could Challenge jacquez from a minutes is there enough like is he definitely gonna get 30 minutes when he comes back in this now log jammed situation I don't know that it's necessarily a guarantee  so this may be the end of the streaming time for now I guess  on the Brooklyn side good to see Mikhail Bridges put up a nice ball game well rounded didn't shoot great from the field but had points boards a steel blocks threes free throw percent  few we need to quite a few more of those though  cam Johnson was bad he's a hold Spencer Dinwiddie was bad and he might not be a hole  because Dennis Smith Jr has been out playing him pretty much Knightley  Dinwiddie on the year is number one 56 right now so if you're concerned I feel like you have almost every reason to be cam Johnson with a couple of bad ball games he's falling outside the top one 30 with a really bad stretch laidley  and for Brooklyn they're just not good so  the trade deadline also looms over this team  could they clear out space to play Dennis Smith Jr I doubt it I don't think that that's a goal for this team but if he suddenly just becomes better than the guy in front of him that would be something you'd want to pounce on I don't think you need to do it after this one certainly not with the team mostly healthy minus Ben Simmons who by the way Ben Simmons played three on three he's apparently getting closer to a return I'll still believe it when I see it but when he comes back what does that mean for who's starting Dorian Finney Smith to the bench probably  but then didn't what he's not even really your point guard anymore  Ben Simmons might actually make some of these guys better like him being around might make male bridge is Cam Johnson Nick's in those guys probably are better with Ben Simmons on the court but he would hurt Dinwiddie he would hurt not I don't know how much Camp Thomas can still suffer he's been relegated to bench Gunner role and you only get minutes when they badly need him which they sort of did yesterday  Royce O'Neill had a good ballgame but you know you're not going in down that rabbit hole either I just I don't  Brooklyn I find to be extremely annoying right now the short version so hold on cam Johnson I'm actually okay if you wanted to move on from Dinwiddie know to Dorian Finney Smith know to cam Thomas noted Smith Jr for now no no and then obviously Nick Clarkson is a start as well before we get to Boston noticing a lot of folks have joined up and are watching live so that's cool thank you for that the chat room is open although I don't really do I'm not gonna do all the questions I'll do a quick scan through to see if there's anything that I obviously missed and if that's a question there then I'll come back and I'll kind of address that towards the end of the show also friends please take a moment to like rate subscribe however you're taking in the podcast that's the

they don't lose very often Celtics 31 and 9 they are kind of running away with the best record in the league and they haven't lost at home yet  they're 19 and 0 at home this is a road game  no Jalen Brown which meant Al Horford gots to spot start you know we're at a point now in the season where Boston is so far out in front of everybody that they might start giving guys scheduled rest days which this may be this was for Jalen Brown Al Horford is going to start getting like probably a start a week which doesn't make sense on the head-to-head side I get it but Roto games cap he almost deserves a roster spot because I mean he's numbered 88 on the season right now  he's 52% rostered so I sort of get it  but when he starts you know he's a top 50 60 70 range guy  for rotor games cap if you get  like I don't know how many what are we talking about the rest of the season is what about another  12ish 10 to 12 weeks something like that if you get one to two of those weak that's a big deal  and who on the Tyrone do side what we're seeing is that John tape Porter now got the start at Center and he didn't get many minutes that young actually got more but they were both terrible because Pascal siakam is mostly playing Center and Toronto's mostly going small RJ Barrett continues to be warm enjoy it while you can because when the bottom falls out it's gonna get gross Scotty Barnes I do think there's a little bit of a tiring thing going on he's fallen to number 16 now it's still a fantastic season I don't want what every time I do this people are gonna be like oh no Dan you're you're pooping on Scotty Barnes know I'm not pooping on it's just like to stay inside the top 10 is almost impossible if you're not just a bona fide every night superstar in the NBA and Barnes has been amazing but expecting to keep up his Pace specifically on the defensive side rebounds deals blocks always felt a little bit of a reach  so he's coming down a little I still think he's going to be a second rounder same general story for Tyrese Maxey but these guys have come off from first round value  Pasco is on the trade block we know that what happens if he gets moved  who comes back  there could be an opening if seacom gets moved  if no Center comes back you figure out a Turtle slides in and gets a whole bunch of extra playing time which would be great for him but you know guys moving like Emmanuel quickly slid into a really big role on this team that things can happen every time I say things can happen I think of oh the Places You'll Go the Doctor Seuss book  things can happen and frequently do  to people as brainy and footsy as you  Indiana blown out in Utah I know India's shorthanded right now but boy the Jazz are wrecking machine they're 9 and 1 in their last 10 ball games and it's better than that if you go back farther than now 15 and 5 at a home winners of six in a row and they are not that far away from climbing out of the plane  bennedict mathurin turned ankle in this ball game you what you weren't starting in many way but now you certainly are not buddy hield is startable while he's starting I don't know nobody for Indy really had a good ball game here so basically throw this one out I'm still playing TJ McConnell this game ended early so he only got 19 minutes  and he just needs Halliburton back I mean they're they're bad without Tyreese Halliburton  and there were worse without Albert and Denise Smith we were sort of semi watching Isaiah Jackson but he only got eight minutes because Utah was gonna spread everybody out and destroy you for the Jazz I'm playing the same three guys every day which is Walker Kessler who played 25 minutes and had five blocks that's cool I know his other stuff wasn't great but you take the five blocks believe me you take the five blocks marketing and Collin Sexton those are the three everybody else is a bit of a crap shoot Chris Dunn if you get defensive stats great if you don't you wouldn't be worth playing  keyonte George is at a couple better shooting games in a row but you know that's not gonna stick forever Jordan Clarkson the field goal percent is starting to come down a little bit but he had some steals to kind of float his value in this one he's gonna be iffy night tonight and then a bunch of you guys came out of the woodwork yes yesterday to tell me I was an idiot for telling you guys to hunt on John Collins  after one good ball game I mean this is the thing guys I need you all to have better short-term memories  I try not to be  I try not to be a jerk I really do but that one pissed me off  the John Collins oh Daniel an idiot really pissed me off because over the last month he's number one 50  150 in 23 and a half minutes per ballgame he came out and had one good ball game against a Lakers team that can't rebound to save their lives and everybody was like oh Dan you're an idiot  Dan you're an idiot  like nah dude  we watched this night in and night out  night in a night out the defensive stats are not there he had him against the Lakers but outside of that he's averaging like I think less than one combined defensive stat over the last month no sorry he's at one point one combined  yeah the 53% from the field is fine 83 at the free throw line also like it's all likeable but he's just not on the floor enough and doing enough to be in every day kind of guy if suddenly they were like oh by the way John Collins You're Gonna Play 29 minutes instead of 24 it would be a different story because he could roll up an extra rebound or two he could roll up an extra point or two he'd be 15 and 8 and of 12 and 6  that's difference making  but we've now seen what Utah wants to do on a nightly basis which is to mix and match find the right combinations for any given night and keep everybody flying high energy 25 minutes a game full blast all the time  it reminds me actually a lot of what the Grizzlies used to do like two or three years ago when they were super deep  they are much thinner now  forget all the injuries they were thin even before the injuries but you remember when the Grizzlies were just like 180% 180 miles an hour every minute and as soon as someone got tired they yanked him  it wasn't you know LMU in the 80s but  it it had that feel and that's kind of what Utah is doing now they're spreading the floor and they're running and they're just going all the time attack attack attack attack  and if John Collins isn't gonna get 30  he's not a top 15 guy  I don't know what you're cut off is 120  so no I'm not an idiot I'm just someone who watches every single day instead of one day  mad about that one that one really pissed me off that everybody was just like waiting in the wings to say all Dan you're a moron you call them a drop and then he had one good game it makes me that pisses me off I do all this work and that's the thanks Lakers beat the Thunder um okay so he had a bad shooting game Lakers went offense over defense and somehow it actually worked out so there are a few things that happened in this ball game and you guys know I watched the Laker games a little bit more closely and I follow along with folks that have sort of tracking data on them as well  first of all if you want to talk Thunder Shay played through a sore knee and he didn't look like himself this is one of his more pedestrian games of the year he shot under 50% which doesn't happen very often and he just wasn't as aggressive as usual  luckily for the Thunder they have Jalen Williams whose way better than people realize he's now number 50 and 9 cat and he just keeps crawling up the board he'll be a fourth rounder probably by the middle of next week  but otherwise there is a whole lot to go on here  Chad Holmgren still got his three blocks but fair to say Anthony Davis probably still a little bit better than Chad homegrown but everything's fine there  let's hope that she doesn't need any time off  as far as the Lakers go this scenario I know the result let's talk with D'Angelo Russell first 14.6 assists two steals a block and a couple of Threes the five turnovers were not good but everything else is what you want the main thing with Dilo is that he started and played starters minutes some of that has to do with the fact that cam reddish and Gabe Vincent are out  but not all of it  I do hope the Lakers finally realized that rolling a lot of camera reddish was not a great deal or not a great idea  they need offense  I don't know that their roster is ever going to be good enough as an aggregate defensively to deal with fast players this is a slow basketball team  and the one guy on that team that can that has a little bit of speed two sorry two guys in point of attack defense are Max Christy who struggles and other parts of his game because he's still very young and gave Benson who was been out basically the entire year  Austin Reeves is not a good point of attack Defender delos not a good point of attack Defender Taurean Prince what if he was at one point in his career not anymore cam reddish is like kind of okay at that but not great  so a lot of guys are gonna get beat on this team meaning there's going to be helped and then they're going to be kick outs to open three pointers and teams are doing that to the Lakers so and my hope is that at some point here the Lakers were finally like look we just we can throw camera at a shout there and we can throw Tori and prints and Jarred Vanderbilt out there all we want and those guys are gonna try to cover their guy but at some point the other team is going to get a switch and then they're going to beat someone so we need to be able to keep up  and so Lakers went back to a starting lineup That was basically the one to start the year  there was briefly a moment on Twitter where it looked like they were going to go Vanderbilt at small forward which would have been like last year's playoff run team but they went Tori and Princeton stead for the presumably for the floor spacing  I don't know  if D'Angelo Russell is going to keep this starting job forever I don't they won yesterday small sample size and some things had to break their way but they did win  and overall it still feels like a better idea for the Lakers to go try to actually score a few points in the first quarter as opposed to praying the defense is going to hold which it doesn't because someone they're starting is going to get beat because they're not gonna go Anthony Davis LeBron James and three exclusively defense first guys that's just not enough of offense eventually another teams can hit some shots and you're gonna get buried  but this  realization I hope was what happened is why I kept preaching Bi-Lo on D'Angelo Russell or hold on D'Angelo Russell the bending whether you had him he was our Prime Bi-Lo on last Thursday's by low show and I put the Buy price at you might be able to pick him up and then someone I forget one of you guys in the chat room was like he's not wrong I just dropped him you probably could pick him up which I was really funny  I appreciated that comment but this is why because when he starts he was rolling top 65 earlier this year and then the Lakers just kept yanking him around and he got more and more irritated and lo and behold he's had a couple of starts now and he looks like a happier player and D-Lo was doing a really good job of playing the passing Lanes he was just more engaged  this probably does hurt Austin Reeves a little bit all the way he was fine yesterday just that you know he's not gonna be solely in charge of who's handling the basketball when it's not LeBron and frankly the Lakers looked better when LeBron was not the primary initiator on offense when he was able to cut or move the ball or be the screener because LeBron is gigantic  Christian Wood is playing well lately not well enough to be using against a games cap Vanderbilt at a better game but again not good enough to use against the game's caps same story with really hot tomorrow pretty much everybody else besides the four  actual offensive threats on the Lakers can be dropped in Roto um  and if somebody likes what they're seeing at a d low right now uh you could maybe even sell for 75.80 range and that's probably too hard to pull off but something to think about  he could still get traded might still get traded everybody just assuming the Lakers are going to trade d low I don't know that it's necessarily a lock it's your kind of feels like it with the way they've been treating him  but we'll see  we'll see  and that's your card from yesterday today is a small one so we're not going to bother with the with the preview there instead as I roll through the chat room I once again want to remind everybody to please take a second to subscribe however you're taking in the show and if you're watching one of our video feeds make sure to like button and follow over on social media  we had a question about Jalen Suggs and

we're not a big website I think we're bigger than small now we're like a like a medium medium sized fantasy Sports Website The Way We Grow is by beating other sights  I love all of these people but we need to beat them it's a silly like there's just only so many eyeballs to go around so  just being honest here like we got to be better than everybody else that's the only way we win  and that comes down to everybody right down to the folks running the news feed  which is at ethos fantasy BK by the way  hey a new listener awesome man  sorry  welcome happy to have you  um let's see here and do do do do do some of these I want again I want to take questions that I think can value to everybody  so our ask is the value column you're showing is that considering only nine cat or other categories as well yes so mostly I talk about nine cat if you want to make any tweaks to it I count on people watching to sometimes do that themselves  if there's you know someone like a Jayden ivy for instance we did a little bit more we talked about him a little more because his game was so well suited to points or punt or whatever but typically we're talking nine cat and I did a poll earlier this morning asking people what format they play and like 70% said nine cat which actually kind of surprised me a little bit um let's see  is Bruce Brown must roster I didn't talk about Bruce Brown today so we'll throw him in the mix know actually well well halliburton's out the answer is probably but when Halliburton was in that was a note now yesterday's game was was flukey because they got blown out and Bruce I think was out for that game if I'm remembering right didn't he not play that's why matheran started so  with Halliburton down and niece Smith Down Bruce Brown is startled when that team is fully healthy I think the answer's no so he's more of an injury fill in that he is an actual startable guy plenty of you guys I say a lot of questions in the chat room that are trade stuff you guys feel free to answer each other's or you can put it in the comments section on the video after we wrap this up which is happening now because we've gone over 50 minutes today it was a big card to recap
