welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast streaming show and today I promise  this is not going to take us that long this is a low activity  streaming day  I assure you  I'm Dan bass this fantasy NBA today episode 2 today big thank you again to  Dre on the morning show  and this is a sports ethos.com presentation  as we always do we like to look at the board coming into the show who has the bad schedule who has the good ones and are their names that we should be attacking  so here's the thing  we're schedules in the NBA right now  they're sort of isn't one  I mean yeah there's some like stuff around the edges Dallas Miami Sacramento all of those teams have two games off starting today  but they each have two games left after that Friday Sunday and so yeah I mean you know like I get it if you're overloaded on Friday then maybe that game for those teams turns into one where you could  get rid of that guy  so like say you have Caleb Martin or something like that and you are overloaded on Friday you've got 11 guys you don't need Martin in your lineup okay fine then you got four days off  part with them  pick up somebody who's got three games left  I mean maybe they're even if it's a game on that same day but the other thing is like even if you have 11 guys going on Friday odds are someone's gonna get ruled out at the last minute so you'll be down to 10 or 9 or 8  with the amount of last second substitutions in the NBA right now they're almost like 12 is probably safe you could probably get 10 guys in there at a 12  probably won't have more than two late scratch I mean I I don't know you might have three you might have four late scratches  the NBA is crazy right now we're two and a half weeks from the end of the season and everybody's getting ruled out all the time  so they're just sort of aren't obvious moves to make today the teams that have the worst schedules after today okay fine then you're looking towards the end of the week you turn one game into two you look towards the following week whatever  but it's just outside of if someone on your team got hurt that's the big thing right now did you just lose somebody  Shay being the big one but it's not like you can drop him  and  maybe he's back for the next one we don't even know  unless you lost someone  for  if it's like a fringe or slightly better than Fringe level player  that isn't playing tonight that you thought was and now you're like oh no I might be I'm only getting one game out of this guy they're just aren't really obvious drop choices  the way I could figure in my mind we've talked about earlier this week the teams that had bad schedules for the whole week those teams were Phoenix  Portland I'm trying to remember the other one that went just Monday Wednesday Friday there was one more I'm sure of it  was a Toronto that was Monday Wednesday Sunday anyway we had these teams that were on the high traffic days and only had a three game week Toronto's different because their last one is not till Sunday so they're off for three days after today and okay that that's a bad schedule but you know Portland  that was a team that you should have probably gotten off of yesterday because the choices aren't that great and they're playing on only the high traffic days  but thinking about today again like the only thing that would crop up would be like if you were streaming Royce O'Neill with Bradley Beal out and Roy sends up getting scratched for some reason he's not he's not even on the injury report but just type oftenly okay then you're looking at Friday possible overload okay you move off of that you go get somebody that's got three games  but if you're just sitting on a roster where you don't have a potential lost player to deal with there isn't to drop  not an obvious one at least  your best schedule is a little bit easier to quantify today but even that's not all that clear Atlanta is the best one because they're starting a six games in nine days stretch so if you're League extends beyond the end of this week Beyond Sunday the Hawks are really nice they've got three games left the rest of this week including two on non overload days they go today and Thursday Saturday so it's part of a back-to-back and then they go Monday Wednesday Thursday next week so you front loaded with three games in four nights that's a really good schedule to get three games here and three games there good Atlanta  that's a move you could consider making because it also brings you additional games play to the beginning of next week when the Hawks are  possibly I'm trying to I'm doing a quick scan here to make sure I'm not about to say something stupid but I'm pretty sure the Hawks are the only team that goes three games in four days to start next week  the only one  so that's why that's a move you could potentially make if your league extends Beyond it if there's somebody on your team that say got hurt today or if you have someone that has two games left this week  and two games the first four days next week okay you go from four games over nine days to six games over nine days and again  you know it's not that big of an impact but you're getting two bonus games played over the length of your pickup and if say someone you're picking up you're swapping out for a hawk today maybe you were only going to get to use them for one of the games this week  well the Hawks have games on two overload days so that eliminates that problem so potentially you could add as many as three games over that stretch if you have a team that has a really bad schedule over the nine days maybe it gets a little bit better like Dallas they've got three games over eight days I guess that's not quite as juicy so the Hawks are the best one or Lando is probably the second best scheduled except theirs are heavy on the overload days they go today Friday Saturday so they got that back-to-back Friday Saturday and then they roll into a four game week next week so they've got seven games over 12 days which is fine four games over six is probably the link that you feel obligated to hold a magic should you pick them up  and then obviously the third chunk are the teams that are going on the quiet days but you're not gonna make a move to those guys today because they'll play until tomorrow and those teams are Boston Milwaukee and New Orleans same teams we've been talking about for a while  Atlanta would all so fall in that mix but they played today too so a lady gets that big bump up the board because they're like those other two teams but they've got another game and it's happening tonight  so that's it  that's the whole story guys  unless you absolutely positively have to make a move today you shouldn't do it  now if you're looking for names of players on those teams I don't have any good ones for the Hawks you're looking for guys maybe there's a chance that DeAndre Hunters floating around on a Wire Bruno Fernando and Vitae are the lower level guys that again like you really moving to these dudes right now  magic have some better options but you need to be more open on the overload days for those to make sense so Cole Anthony Mo Wagner would be the two best likely waiver wire guys if Jalen he's likely  I'd say I think Suggs is probably roster but obviously if he's not he would also fit that mold  and then Jonathan Isaac you pray he plays the back to back when he probably doesn't  there's no reason for him too but maybe you pray that he plays the Saturday game and set of the Friday and he probably don't go down that path  that's an ugly dangerous and terrifying Road  tomorrow we'll have a whole lot more to cover because tomorrow you have some teams that  we talked about Memphis only has one game left after today it's on Saturday so you can turn them into more  but it's also worth pointing out there are no teams in the NBA that goes three times in four nights to finish this week  so if you're just trying to max out this week even if you made a move off a team that has one game left starting after today the best you can do is get to a team with two games left so if you're doing that you want to look towards the beginning of next week as The Gardener's begin blowing leaves in about a four foot Runway between two buildings  shut up out there I'm trying to finish a show  no they're not shutting up all right well that's super annoying and extremely unprofessional no matter how many times I yell shut up they're not gonna hear me over the sound of their own equipment which is so dumb because there's nothing there there are no plants back there  it's a walkway  I got a nine minute show I'm trying to do in there blowing during the nine minute show this is the only time I've heard them whole the whole damn day all right well that's it Beauty part is there wasn't much to cover today quickly here going to the chat room see what you guys got going on Dan is Corey kispert or Mitch Robinson worth an ad know you're not adding Mitchell Robinson because it's going to be a very tough and weird ramp up and you don't know when he's going to play  Kiss Bert maybe three games left I think he'll probably have some okay numbers in at least half of one to one one to two of those depending on when Kyle kuzma gets into the mix so I'm fine with kuzma with kiss Bert on that three game run but it's gonna depend very heavily on who the drop is for anything like that because again I just don't think today is that great of a day to make a move oh who is good to bench today between Draymond Green Kelly Olynyk I'm in Thompson Donte divincenzo Clint capela Jalen Williams what  it's probably Draymond or capella  if you're going oh if I'm going for percentages  threes and steals  okay um well Capella's only gonna help you in one of the percentages and probably nothing in threes and very low steals with blocks  he's the weakest if you're just targeting those categories  all right Dan who do you like better for a head-to-head points League Bruno Fernando Wendell Carter Junior Wendell  is Donovan Mitchell and add yes he's targeting a return on Friday I don't care how many minutes he plays if he's back Friday Sunday get a first round dude in your lineup absolutely Oh no you're talking about Mitchell Robinson are you but Donovan Mitchell's back Friday Also Mitchell Robinson and had no no no it's probably gonna play 15 to 17 minutes here for a game and then 18 and then 20 and so I'm like that it's gonna be brutal should I drop keldon Johnson for Mitchell Robinson and appoints leak no you should not Mitchell Robinson B Mitchell Mitchell Robinson Mitchell Robinson whoa Mitchell Robertson should only be added  in Rotel leagues right now  and head-to-head you're asking for a lot of trouble who's been out for what three months with this ankle injury he ain't coming back and playing 30 minutes out of the chute  and even once he's healthy he's probably splitting time with Isaiah hardenstein who's been amazing for the Knicks when he's not dealing with the Achilles thing himself  so you're looking for low to mid-20s is kind of like a max out Point here over the next I would think weak  that's a that's a tough call I especially again with the overload days and stuff like that so likely know on that front and that is that we did it in under 13 minutes  who boy I knew we could do it I could do it follow on Twitter at Dan Bass Pros thank you for watching our double dose today if indeed you are part of the double dose and we'll be back with a couple more tomorrow so long for Wednesday we'll get some points tonight
