welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  anyway good day to you all you know I don't usually get a chance to do shows on the weekends so this is kind of fun for me to slip this in before we go back about our day it's not going to be a long episode but it is a different one this is what I am calling and you saw it on the graphic in the background I can make my face smaller I'd show it again but I don't think I can right now let's make a deal  fantasy basketball edition  the way this works at least for now is I am trading away a player  and I need you guys who are watching or on Twitter or something to send me offers for that player  now  this also is maybe not the greatest idea of a show to do live that may be a lesson that I learned here in episode 1 because that means that the front end of the show I need to wait for you guys to put stuff in the chat room so if you're watching right now while I am introducing the concept please do take a moment and offer me someone in the chat room for Scotty Barnes that's the player du jour  what I'd like to do is then go through some of those offers  and see if any of them makes sense meaning I will either accept or reject them and give you guys an opportunity to understand why I'm doing that thing  if this doesn't work we'll change the way it's work we'll change the way we build it meaning instead of making it a live show I will take suggestions beforehand on social media bring those over and I'll just run through them  maybe that makes more sense I wanted to see how this would go live  before I went the other route because I like doing shows live I like to be able to hang with you guys in the chat room but again we'll sort of see how it flows  I'm also trying to figure out and you know I don't know what this is necessarily going to work but I'm trying to figure out a way to do it on the other side where I would like to be buying on a player because I think buying low is actually more is easier to do than selling a high it's much it's hard to part with the player that you become really attached to when they get off to a really good start like a Scotty Barnes now again there is value and you guys seeing what we could get for him in this discussion and people are throwing some names in the chat room so it looks like maybe this does work after all on the flip side I don't actually really know I keep thinking it through on how to run a buy show but I don't know what that would be maybe I say hey look I'm  it's still sort of in this Cell mode but it's a different one like I'm trying to buy player X whoever that might be calling Brook Lopez right now would have been Keegan Murray but he exploded Keegan was like the easyest by low of the century yesterday before right after Jimmy Butler was the day before  I can't figure out how to run this on the buy side so I'll keep working on that one but we're gonna try Let's Make a Deal  I'm trading away Scotty Barnes there he is on the screen for you guys I opened it in a  photo viewer window let's see if we can make this bigger there we go that's taking up most of the window now but let's also shrink it down there we go that's perfect there you can see his face you see is Yahoo stats you don't you're not subject to all the other stuff that's floating around  okay let's go to the chat room I'm selling you all Scotty Barnes  who are you guys offering me  dejounte Murray  is player number one that's being offered to me so first and foremost I guess what I should do with this this concept is let you guys know what's going on with Scotty Barnes he's currently ranked number 11 in nine category League's on the shoulders of 21 and a half points two three-pointers 10.4 rebounds  I know that's crazy six assists 1.5 steals 2.1 Blocks he's shooting 48.5% from the field 75.7 percent at the free throw line and he said 2.9 turnovers per game  I'm not even going to Cloud this episode  with analysis of Scotty Barnes because that's not even really what it is this this episode is about you guys offering me things and then me telling you why I would or would not do it so it's not about like what my projections are on the player that I'm trying to sell it's not even necessarily whether it's a buy or sell high it's just a sell a player and then we're gonna work our way through it so dejounte Murray is the first offer on the table and this one is an interesting one because you guys know I like dejounte Murray I don't like him with all of my heart I like him with like half of my heart he's number 39 in nine cat right now 21.8 points 2.33 pointers 4.5 rebounds 5.6 assists 1.1 steals 0.4 blocks 49% from the field and 84% at the free throw line with 2.8 turnovers per game  I  reject this offer and I probably need like  a sound effect or some very large  reject words that I can put up on the screen let's see if I can do that in the middle of a show can I just have the word reject fly up there on the screen um banners know that wouldn't be it okay I don't know how to do that I'd have to figure out a way to just yell rejection on this one and for the meantime I'll just I'll just yell the word rejected I rejected johnte Marie because while I was not super high on Scotty Barnes coming into the season and so far that's been a pretty big Miss know maybe I don't think he stays at number 11 but I do think he has a real good shot to stay in front of Deontay who listen I have no I think this is a reasonable thing to try I don't think it's going to get it done in your legs and it doesn't get it done with me because dejounte was number 36 last year and a season where Trae young was having kind of a Down Season Atlanta by all accounts got better around Murray and Trey young and so I just I don't believe that dejounte is gonna do that much more than he's doing right now I think he would be a mid-30s per game guy who last year showed us he can be pretty durable when he wants to be and so far this season he's played in the Hawks ball game so that's a good thing but from a per game basis I don't think he's all that far off where he's gonna end up maybe in a good University you get to Shantae up to 1.3 1.4 steals that's where we could squeeze some value back out of him the perfect scenario for him is steals somehow Trend up towards two which could still happen you know limited sample size the theater here Gordon hayward's averaging almost two steals a ball game if deante gets up towards two steals that's how he gets back up into that kind of top 20  maybe even a little bit higher than that that's how maybe this trade works out but as it stands right now even if Barnes falls back I don't think he far is back far enough and I think you could get more for him then Deonte Murray right now second offer Jared Jackson Jr hmm see now this one I might argue is more tempting JJJ is number 31 and 9 cat right now 21.4 points 1.83 6.8 rebounds 2.4 assists 0.3 steals 1.9 blocks 50% from the field 80 and a half percent at the free-throw line number 31 and 9 cat and I think one would be quite reasonable to note that his defensive stats are way down season overseas and not a small amount a big amount last year he was at three blocks per game and one steal four defensive stats last year 2.2 this season  if you believe that's a number that goes up and I think I kind of do  I think I accept this offer for Scotty Barnes who I think does fall back what do we think Scott falls down for Scotty Barnes like you know it  okay so look last year he was at one point one steals and 0.8 blocks and 35 minutes a game it's up to 37 which by the way is completely insane I believe in his uptick in scoring  I believe in his uptick in assists because he's now handling the basketball more  what I don't believe for Scotty Barnes is that he's suddenly now of like an 11 rebounds what he's doing but he's gonna try to do that all season long he's gonna run out of gas so that number is coming down 2.1 blocks no I'm sorry that number is not staying where it is you know two seasons in the league he didn't break one block per game and now he's at 2.1  steals okay maybe there's a news over a universe where his steals come up a little bit I don't expect to steal rate to change all that much he's on a crazy heater in those things  the shooting the threes the scoring the assist that's stuff I think Trends up from last year but as the Steals and blocks come down as the rebounds I believe all so come down he falls from late first round to probably more like  I think you'd put him in the late 20s or early 30s which is why I don't think Deonte was enough but JJ is enough I accept your offer Shamir of Jaron Jackson junior for Scotty Barnes  next offer Kawhi Leonard for Scotty Barnes ooh this is a tough one Kawaii so far is number 33 I don't think okay so let's step out of our game for a minute and just note the fact that I don't think this is the right time to be selling on Kawhi Leonard so forget that for just a second I know we're just kind of playing a game here  folks picture this nightmare scenario  you're hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of beer Wine and Spirits then get them delivered right to your watch party compare prices across multiple stores in your area find the best deals on Game Day drinks and get back to armchair quarterbacking from you guessed it your armchair  download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's drizly.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  over the next two to three weeks I would rather have Scotty Barnes  because the Clippers are and unmitigated mess right now and I don't think that that's about to just magically fix itself overnight it's going to take time while they sort out this James Harden inclusion situation which has not been pretty so far  that said  after things start to settle then this would be enough so if I have Scotty Barnes I don't think that I take Kauai right now I don't know that the person that's trading away Kawaii would be willing to part with him once the Clippers start to figure out what's what because we know Kawaii is a top five player and it's just like  everything that's Gotti Barnes is doing he's still not inside the top five how well it's because he's not a positive and either of the percentages he's actually negative and one the other stuff is pretty amazing but that's why it's so damn hard to get inside the top five or six in fantasy like you just have to be good at so many things and Kawaii can be we know that's who he can be when he's making free throws which is weird it's free throw percent is down like 10% right now that's basically the big thing for him the other stuff is actually not all that far off Steals and blocks probably tick up a little bit as again pieces settle but this will be enough for me in a couple of weeks it's not enough right now so therefore today  I reject your offer Michael Fleming with the policies  Cade Cunningham this one I don't think I need to get into too much this one is a hard rejection For Me Kate is currently ranked number one and 180 I know a lot of that is because he's at 5.3 and ungodly number of turnovers per ball game I just don't think there's a planet  okay the planet is a points league but I don't think that there's a category League Planet out there where Cunningham gets anywhere near Scotty Barnes this year I didn't think Cade got to his ADP and I wasn't drafting him there because of it I don't think that he the only way you're going Cade is if you're punting field goal and turnovers  I do think Cades defensive Stats come up so he's very much a buy-low opportunity right now which means that in terms of trying to sell him for a buy High guy like a Scotty Barnes  I wag my finger and disgust and I say nay mark  I reject your offer of Cade Cunningham  Nicholas offers me Jalen Brunson which is more enticing than Cade Cunningham  but not in Tyson enough I had Bronson behind Deontay Murray to start the year and I've seen nothing to move me off of that position I know Jalen is a bit of a by low right now because his field goal percentage is way way down but we also know that with Brunson as long as Julius Randle and RJ Barrett and Emmanuel quickly and all these other guys in New York are actually still going to be taking some shots there's just no way that Brunson gets above top 30 on a per game basis and if you're gonna price Scotty Barnes out of my hands you need to offer me somebody that I feel pretty damn confident is going to end up inside the top 25 at the end of this year which is why so far the only offer I've accepted that's been thrown my way as Jaren Jackson Jr who I think does get to that point and we're seeing better scoring numbers for him so all we need is the defensive stats to tick back up even a little bit and that one works itself out but for Brunson I I don't even expect his steals to stay where they are right now he's at 22 and a half points two and a half threes three and a half rebounds almost five assists just over a steal on a pitiful 40 and a half percent from the field 82 and a half percent at the free throw line he's okay from the foul line that's not a big plus for him the field goal percent is one of the reasons that you drafted Brunson and it hasn't been there yet yes I do think that comes back I think we get Jalen somewhere back around where he was last year which I believe was in the 40s and nine cat and that is not enough to prise Scotty Barnes out of my hands so thus I reject your offer of Jalen Brunson  I think there are a few joke offers in the chat room that's why I'm skipping over them for now but I'll throw this one in there is Zion Williamson I'm gonna go no on this one and Zion to me is always overdrafted because people are punting free throws and they think that that's just gonna be enough and there was one season where it was but there's this hope that he somehow starts getting defensive stats  and every once in a while he does it in one game and then everybody's like hey is this a thing that's going to stick and no it doesn't it's not know it happens in one game out of every like five or six and then the other ones he doesn't and that's how it ends up at like 0.6 to 1 steel and almost no blocks per ball game field goal presents gonna get better for him so that will improve but the free throw is going to be a pretty goodly negative and so this one's a hard rejection you will not get Scotty Barnes for me on that one  Nic Claxton sorry Patrick I'm not even going to entertain this one with a breakdown he's not only hurt  uh but he didn't even get off to a good start before that  klaxton even if you're punting free throws right with funny thing is that he actually made all three of his free throws this year he was only averaging is one game or sorry he made one free throw this year 7 points 7 rebounds in three blocks I know that klaxon is coming off a good season last year and so there's this there's a little bit of a how can you say yes to JJ and no to Nick's in when  like this Steeles and the blocks were one of the big reasons that Nick was ranked as high as he was I just  I don't know that klaxon gets back to where he was last year and right now I need to have someone with that proven ability and upside even beyond that to pull a Scottie Barnes out of my arms and forks and he's he's just sort of a no I've been offered a two-for-one of Claxton and Gordon Hayward that's all so not gonna be good enough for me with apologies  before I get to the next couple of names if you guys are enjoying this weird little one-off show please do take a moment to like And subscribe I'm trying things I think it's fun to do different ideas for shows and so this is one of them we'll try other stuff as well but please do like rate subscribe all that good stuff see if people can find it and we'll roll with it from there  by the way also you can find me on social media forgot to say that this is a bonus fantasy NBA today episode I'm your host Dan best person you guys know that stuff we got another Kawaii in there but another two-for-one  us our Thompson and Jaylen Johnson know that's not gonna get it done for me I do like Jalen Johnson a lot he's number 74 I like Ozark Thompson a lot he's been incredible to this point I actually know what I think no I got that wrong on Jalen Johnson he's a little bit higher than that right now right yeah I lost him there he is he's at 50 Oscars at 43 so you're offering now two top 50 guys currently for Scotty Barnes who's number 11 if these were guys that I thought would definitely finish in the 40s I might say yes so it is a little bit tempting but I also believe that us our Thompson probably cools a little bit the Steals and blocks rate is is nuts right now I'm super into his Fantasy game I don't know how you couldn't be but 10 rebounds for assists and 3.2 defensive stats feels kind of hard for a young guy to sustain for an entire season  Jalen Johnson I think the 60% field goal number comes down for him so I think both of these guys probably cool little over the next month and so that's why with apologies Chris tempting but I reject Alpine there's an interesting one he's number 47 right now and it's a little bit weird because his sort of the popcorn stats as we call them points boards and assists all a really good to this point 19 points 8.3 boards 6.1 assists and the field goal percent has been really good 62% on 13 and a half shots per game there's been a lot of really nice positives for him but the defensive stats haven't been where I think we expected them to be he's really not blocking anybody right now which is probably good because the Rockets has a team are playing much better position defense including a very large step forward in understanding principles on that defensive side but it also helps that the guys in front of him the Freddy Fame leads to Dillon Brooks's you've seen some reserves come in and do it doing a better job of just keeping guys in front of them so albertans not back there getting into foul trouble and trying to swat a bunch of shots and just always in the wrong place  all so he's been a mess at the free throw line so low defensive stats bad free throws has kind of sagged his numbers which makes me think two things could happen  one do we see any kind of slowdown in the popcorn stats 198 and 6 is pretty high so far we have it seen an indicator that that's slowing down but it could on the other side do we see an uptick in blocks is that something that comes around over the course of the season  same thing with free throws does that get up into the mid-to-high 60s and then maybe he's not kind of a punt free throw guy which he is right now and just more of a kind of bad free-throw guy which you can stomach a little bit better  so um the answer that question is we don't really know because we haven't seen goon with these competent pieces around him and him playing better defense so not getting totally played off the floor  competent doesn't have to be great just needs to be competent and that's what he's been so far  I'm inclined to stick with Scotty Barnes I think the chances that he stays above even if you think Shen goes forward from here I think Scotty Barnes has a pretty good shot to stay in front of that Mark so again tempting but rejected  oh this one might be the hardest one so far Tyrese Maxey  Tyrese Maxey is right next to Scotty Barnes with a super hot start to the season in fact by nine cat ratings is actually ahead because Maxi hasn't been turning the ball over at all 26 points 335.3 boards seven and a half assists 1.1 steals point eight blocks for Tyreese 48% from the field 92.5% at the free throw line he's been a big wowie so far I thought he'd be good this year and I didn't think he'd be anywhere near this good  it's kind of like Shea last season where I was like yeah I'm on him he was on the old man squad but I don't think it was gonna be the top three guy I thought Max was gonna be good this year he was drafted near what like 40 45 I thought he'd be in the in the late 20s mid-30s something like that number seven yeah no I didn't think that was gonna happen  like Scotty Barnes I do think that Tyrese probably cool is a little bit as the season goes perhaps you see a slight downtick and free throw us like down to can blocks all so feels quite reasonable maybe an uptick and turnovers  and there has to be a worry that Philly uses some of the pieces they Acquired and picks to go get another medium high usage guy  if those things happen you could see Tyrese fall a couple arounds and value  as it stands right now the down ticks for him are not that big you know blocks going down from point to what point three point four it's something but it's not massive turnovers ticking up  from one to what one and change to something but it's not colossal so I think that both of these guys come back to earth a little so now you're just thinking which one comes back to Earth farther  I think Scotty Barnes comes back to Earth a little bit farther than Maxi and so on this one I think I accept your offer the second one we've gotten through so far JJJ and Tyrese Maxey has been the two or the two acceptances to this point  let's do maybe two more names I want to keep this to a half an hour show dear and fox this is actually a really good one I know he's hurt right now let's assume these back in the very near future he was number 17 before going down  admittedly 31.3 points per game is probably not a number that he sustained  let's assume that dear and fox probably ends up a little bit more like what we saw out of him last year which is 25 points for board six assists one point one steals  and doesn't take this flying Leap Forward you know free throw is suddenly not a negative right now Steals and blocks her way up scoring way up  all this stuff comes back down to earth a little bit it's a pretty good offer because if you think Fox does take a small step forward you might say okay well maybe Fox does like remain in that in the 20s this year and of the 40s would that be enough I'm not willing to risk it  I'm  personally concerned that this is an injury plagued season for a bunch of Sacramento Kings they were one of the healthiest teams in the NBA last year which feels kind of flukey to me  and I do believe that they end up a little closer to the 500 Mark a little step backwards Fox would be a part of that even if his numbers take a small step forward I think that there's a health risk involved and so I  reject your very reasonable offer of deer and fox  I got two more good ones here on the oh there's three more good ones  four more good one ah man I'm not gonna get through this thing Desmond Bane is a good one I'm gonna make the analysis shorter on this I'm gonna go no on this because  I actually really like Desmond made a lot he's number 14 right now but we're already nine games into the 25 game Joss suspension and Jaws gonna put a huge hole into veins usage he's taking 21 shots a game that's just not gonna happen when Jack comes back I love love love Desmond Bane I love his Fantasy game but we know a massive drop is coming for him and with Barnes you're like okay well a lot of things seem like they should come down for beIN we're fully aware of it steals usage blocks on top of the usage it's all coming down he likely Falls from where he is now which is on the turn to more like early 30s after the fact so even if you think Scotty Barnes falls back like a round round and a half even two rounds we know Bane is falling back that far so I'm gonna pass on that one  Jimmy Butler for Scotty Barnes  all right you guys might have gotten me on this one  I think I'm gonna go Butler  because a lot of stuff is down down for him and I don't think it's just magically twisting into the low range Butler's number 44 right now we know he's gonna get himself into the top 20 that's just the way it works so basically and this is the wrong time to sell by the way on Jimmy Butler because  he's taking a personal day it and he's been off to a little bit of a slow start  but at some point he's gonna go on one of his runs and the field goal percent is gonna jump up to 48 49.50 and the Steels are gonna jump up from 1.4 to 1.6 or 1.7 and the assists are gonna get from three and a half to five or six and he's gonna look like Jimmy Butler always looks and he's gonna be a top 15 fantasy play and so on this one again maybe not the right time to sell on Butler but I accept I will take your Jimmy Butler for Scotty Barnes because I do think these two ships pass in the night  domantas sabonis this one's a hard one because I always felt like he was being a bit over drafted this year he was number 20  per game last year and it like that was probably the best it could have possibly been in a million years  and Scotty Barnes  what if it doesn't fall off that hard so I'm actually believe it or not gonna pass on this one so bonuses free throw number is down I think that probably comes back at some point this year so that'll rebound and everything else is fine 17 and a half points 13 boards seven assists that's all great that would get him into the top 25 if the free throw number gets back to sort of career Mark first bonus and it might but I don't think that I would take that chance right now which is crazy because 100 out of 100 people would have drafted so bonus over Scotty Barnes and this day today I actually am not taking that deal  and the last one is Anthony Edwards and this one is also a pretty hard one Ant-Man up to number 27 right now  and I think this is pretty close to where he ends up 50% from the field 80 at the free throw line feels like about as good as those are gonna get 21 shots a game 28 points converting is about as good as it's going to get I was never an ant on the turn guy this year I think he does take a step forward funny thing is I was really high on the Timberwolves this year but I thought people were getting too high on Anthony Edwards and so on this one I'm gonna say no I think Scotty Barnes is just taking a bigger leap this this season then Edwards has I don't think it gets much higher than he is right now at 27 the only way that he gets higher is if you maintains all of this stuff in the turnovers go from 3.6 down to maybe like 2.9 something like that and then those guys might end up right next to each other because I think Scotty Barnes probably falls into this late 20s early 30s range and I think Edwards might fall back five ten slots over the year so this one's Fair it's quite fair and if you wanted to use Barnes to get Anthony Edwards you probably could right now but I actually think I'm going to go barns at least for the next little bit I just I think that we've seen this massive step forward it may come down to which of those two dude stays healthier over the course of the year and so that may be as a little bit of a coin up I'm going to reject it which I know is insane um but that one's kind of a 5051 for me and that is the last offer we will take on this funny little one-off show I hope you guys enjoyed it let's make a deal Scotty Barnes Edition we had requests by the way if you have requests feel free to put them in the comment section not the live chat cause I'm not gonna check that after the show is over someone said how about Paul George maybe that's an a future one I think we got a can we do this for Hardin PG Kauai in the coming weeks maybe I want to try to focus more on guys that you'd probably classify as more of a sell high this to see like hey well what I do how far do we think this guy's gonna go is it a bias is it a cell is it a whole that kind of thing and that's why I picked Scotty Barnes today  because yes I think we all kind of assume he's gonna fall back a little bit but how far was the question and I hope we figured that out in today's show  thanks again for watching everybody I'm Dan best for so hope you enjoyed this special Saturday edition of fantasy NBA today
