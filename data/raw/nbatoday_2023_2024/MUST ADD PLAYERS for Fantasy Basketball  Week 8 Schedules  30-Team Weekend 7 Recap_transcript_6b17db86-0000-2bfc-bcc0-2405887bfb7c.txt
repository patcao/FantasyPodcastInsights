welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  all right so look folks I may be overdoing it just a tiniest bit on vocal use these days  try to fight it off try to put it off try to just power through and a certain point you realize  maybe it's a bit much  good news is I don't have any play by play Giggs until January so that'll take a little bit of the strain off but just looking back at  this week for instance we did two shows on Monday two shows on Tuesday two shows on Wednesday one show on Thursday two shows on Friday  and then I had two basketball games to call on Thursday and two basketball games to call on Saturday  and that's probably just too much you roll it all together and it's something like two four six seven nine eleven thirteen fourteen it's about 14 ish  hours of yelling  so anyway um woke up this morning and just everything through the neck up into the lower jaw was swollen and tight  but I gotta get a show out because tomorrow I will be  playing hooky for a day  I'll be honest with you guys straight hooky we promised our older kid for his birthday in November  he could either have a giant party with all of his friends which you know my wife and I were not so secretly crossing our fingers he'd be like no we don't need to do that because he's got elementary school friends and Friends left over from preschool and a bunch of friends from Little League and then their parents and if you throw a party like that suddenly you're at like 100 people in your apartment Courtyard and realizing oh my God what if we done or your other option was pick one friend and go to Disneyland and that's what he chose and so that's tomorrow meaning we got to get tomorrow stuff done today that's what this show is normally we do two shows on Monday we're gonna roll them all into one episode right here right now a weekend recap show and a week a look at the week ahead so welcome everyone to a combo episode of fantasy NBA today I know everybody's sort of getting settled in for football right now NFL kicks off at about 45 minutes so any of you that are hanging out live I do appreciate it I don't expect many of you to be here on Sunday morning so weird time to do a fantasy basketball show specially when the in season tournament just finished up yes yesterday congratulations to LeBron and the Lakers for winning the first ever NBA cup it was actually pretty cool  as a Laker fan it was doubly cool to see that team kind of humming right now very cool to see kind of a Tyreese Halliburton coming out party over the last little bit not that like we did generates didn't know but the universe didn't and now they do  but again all that rolled together this isn't exactly like a prime time for fantasy basketball right now but I want to get the show out I want to get it going hell you know on top of everything else it might be kind of an interesting way to for us to figure out if doing some of these Monday content episodes earlier  is actually a good idea like maybe getting it posted sooner is useful for folks so  in every event we're throwing some darts at the wall and we'll see if any of them stick today so again thank you to anybody who's hanging out live anybody that's watching or listening after the fact please take a moment to like rate subscribe all that good stuff let's dive straight in and do our weekend recap normally it's a reverse chronological lighting round but every single weekend game happened on Friday there were no Fantasy games that counted on Saturday or Sunday so there is no reverse chronology to any of this it's just a Friday recap at this point and then we'll take a look at so certain that the streaming plan basically for the week ahead which is actually a very busy week most teams in the NBA have four games this coming week because everybody had two so the assumption is that everybody's pretty well rested other than the Lakers and the Pacers and so the NBA has a sort of diving into a big fat thick week 8  and that makes streaming actually less important because everybody should have a pretty relatively equal number of games played but let's we'll get to that in a minute first things first first of all find me over on social at Dan best person I think I forgot to throw that in there but you guys can do that as well Toronto at Charlotte uh  Raptors are starting to come apart a little bit you know Scotty Barnes was able to power to them to some wins early in the season that maybe they wouldn't have gotten otherwise they now lost three games in a row including this one to a team that they very much should not have lost to they're now nine and 13 the 11 seed which I get it you're still only a half game out of a play in spot but with every loss the Raptors inch closer to being a cell team and that's something we'll want to keep tabs on both for reality and for Fantasy purposes because we've known Pascal Ciocca and Gary Trent have been on the trade block for quite some time Trent is the sort of easier to move there but see Yakima is the more relevant one  as far as fantasy goes there's basically no  there's basically nothing with the Raptors all the time there are very predictable Club Dennis Schroeder's fall off he's now down to number 130 on the year was I thought predictable and then admittedly I thought maybe I got it way wrong when he started a top 50 clip for two weeks but he is now settled back into where we knew he would be and I feel again very much less stupid about calling him a one I think I said he was going to be outside the top 120 150 range and that's exactly where he is now the great leveling it levels us all as far as the Charlotte side goes that's arguably the more interesting side we got a kind of a good report on lamelo ball over the weekend that he was going to be evaluated at some point this coming week they expected him to miss at least one more week but the fact that they didn't say you know at least another two or three I thought was good news because we know his ankles are busted and so anytime it's like all right he's not that far away I take that as a positive  meantime Nick Richards actually outplayed Mark Williams in this game William's likely kind of playing through a lower back injury and the time off is going to be nice for him so don't read too much into that Richards is an excellent backup center but he's not going to get all that many minutes when will Williams is fully healthy otherwise  PJ Washington is sort of your Fringe guy on this team he's the one I've been going back and forth about the other  the story right now is just to start the starters with Charlotte Brandon Miller Gordon Hayward Tara miles Bridges if you're willing to and and Mark will Williams I think when this team comes back out of the multi-day layoffs Detroit lost again at Orlando and it was ugly Jalen Duren is out for at least two weeks after his latest ankle situation Marvin Bagley got the start of this ball game and then he left part way with you can see it on your screen if you're watching the YouTube version back spasms  I'll tell you right now I have no idea what Detroit is going to do at Center if I was the Pistons I would probably just slide Isaiah Stewart up to the five and run small  but you might see James Wiseman who did actually get to play 16 minutes in this ball game he's terrible not a good basketball player neither is Marvin Bagley so I'm probably not picking up Wiseman outside of points that would be the spot you'd consider it if Stuart slides up to the five he actually probably is a 12 team her across the board that's been his issue as playing the four because it doesn't allow him to get that many rebounds and as the five you get more boards you get better looks on offense or close to the rim you get more defensive stats on the defensive side and duh  so you know kind of waiting to see on that one will get her Detroit report presumably before their next ball game which again doing this show on Sunday makes a little tough for me but just kind of stay piped in on that  Killian Hayes is the hold there was all this Bluster going into this game in Orlando about how Jaden Ivey was gonna get to play more and he very much did not play more so hold Killian Hayes just to kind of see how this thing shakes out  I  if you guys want my honest opinion on this I don't think that Haze ends up as a rest of season guy but if he's running hot for a little bit which he kind of is maybe that secures him enough playing time in the short term so hang tight  by the way I'm not playing him and Rodeo leaks right now I'm too nervous about what he might do to various percentages had to head he does he does make sense  on the Orlando side Jalen Suggs did not play in this ball game I mean when he went down I thought it was going to be a while but they're making it seem like it's not gonna be all that long so I guess that's good we mentioned Gary Harris as Steals and threes streamer and he did have two of each of those in this ball game so you know whatever  talk about to say just  Hammer dunking all over the Pistons was kind of the ultimate in in dignity if you whatever you want to call it on that piston side but we've seen enough of this potassium versus movagar thing to know that anytime either one of them looks like they're getting something going it immediately Fizzles out so just leave that crap alone call Anthony's gonna get all he can handle here while Suggs is out and that's probably the only player you're really looking at on in all formats  Atlanta was without Trey young for this ball game so you I think you had a pretty good feeling that they weren't gonna beat the 76ers Bogdan bogdanovich got the start he played 39 minutes which you know great fantasy wise but all so yikes  I don't know how he's possibly hold up to that for more than one or two days of ballgames I actually much prefer booked out of itch playing 25 26 minutes and just going Buckwild Off the Bench and trying to keep him upright now again one or two of these ball games terrific  I'm very nervous he's been great you just going with it if you can sell on bug zdanowicz I think I would just not because it's Productions gonna change all that much but because it's Health could  mean time the Hawks just badly need obviously Trey young but also they really need Jalen Johnson back and he still multiple weeks away  said he is a start Hong Kong was better in this ball game he blocked a couple of shots did have five vowels in 18 minutes such as life when Joel and beat is on the other side of the floor but you guys know our feelings on Woo which is hold as long as you possibly can embiid has gone pretty crazy lately too he's shoved himself into the number two spot behind Shae Gill just Alexander and overall boards basically at a dead heat with Tyrese Halliburton meanwhile Nicola yokich has been shooting the ball so poorly lately he's falling down behind Anthony Davis into the five hole  I really do I do feel like and we talked about this leading up to the season the championship hangover is real  it's a real thing  anyway not even the point Sixers obviously and B Maxie Melton these guys are all easy starts to buy his Harris should be bouncing back at some point soon ubreak up to 23 minutes here in his second game back make sure he's not on the wire because he was very good prior to his injury let's keep on moving  Wizards swamp another Blowout at least I was Jones did get 28 minutes so that was something I don't fully understand how the minutes are being distributed on this ball Club but you know anytime Jones gets basically above about 25 26 he's fine I think this game may have actually pushed back inside the top 100 in nine cat yeah he's 96 now which I get it top 100 sort of an arbitrary marker but this is why and everybody was like can I drop ties Jones and I'm like no you can't because  if he gets 26 27 minutes or more  he's a Fantasy play in all formats  trying to figure out when the Wizards are going to get blown out is is a task in all in and of itself but  this is it cool to believe at a double-double 11 and 10 but bad free throws no real peripheral stats you guys know my feeling on him he's a guy that I stashed in a keeper League because I think he'll be good when the Wizards lean into the full tank which I know to say that they're not in full tank right now is  distressing but they're still playing two or three which you call like NBA veterans  and at some point even those guys aren't gonna get to go and then be all is gonna have free reign but six shots just isn't enough he needs to do more we need him doing more  you want it stash for two or three months be my guest I'm not in redraft spots  and then I don't know how many times I have to yell at Kyle kuzma is a sell high but  he's down to number 82 now  again there's this this Rosie lens around him because he's scoring 23 points with six boards and four and a half assists and so people are willing to overlook the fact that he gets no defensive stats and his percentages are running above career Norms but as all of that stuff comes back down so does coos I like his usage he's typically getting enough minutes to put up value which is good on a team where minutes haven't really been guaranteed yet but you gotta try to lock in like I still you know he's ranked in the 80s on basketball monster is nine Cat Board I think you can probably trade him for someone near or even above where he's at and I would definitely do that  oh also on the below front Dylan Wright should be back in the next two weeks and that'll be a thorn  Spencer didn't witty was someone that I've been sort of watching to see if he can hang tough and he was better in this ball Game Wizards defense certainly helps enforce steals helps as well but that was a good sign for him cam Thomas when he turns cold he turns very cold he's actually falling outside the top 100 now and again it's this whole thing like people see the 24 points per game and they just totally Overlook everything else  he doesn't rebound he doesn't pass he doesn't get many defensive stats he's not horrible at those right now but he's become a pretty big negative and field goal percent because of volume he's a hold Camp Thomas is a hold but when he goes on one of his Mega heaters he'll score 30 for a couple games in a row he's probably guy you try to move in those situations  no other big thoughts on this one cam Johnson had a slower ball game he'll be fine this game was blow out and you know some guys get their stuff in a blowout before a game gets out of hand and some guys don't  Dennis Smith Jr had been playing kind of well he missed this ball game he's questionable for the next one with some back stuff so we'll keep an eye on it  Nixon Celtics had kind of a fun one  but  but this game ended closer than it actually was Celtics were able to pull away kind of Midway through I think it was in the third quarter they opened it up the Nicks  and this is a Thibodeaux special played the starters  at the end for unknown reasons and Jane Lin Brunson tweaked and ankle at the end of the ball game which is just like and and the guys that cover the Knicks are good at what they do the who the media coverage these days the there are some teams where the media coverage is just like 99% slobbing which is just a man like we need people that are actually going to dig in and get information the next guys do that they do a good job they'll they'll pick the team apart good or bad there it's always getting analyzed so thank goodness for that and they're giving Thibodaux hell for leaving Brunson in a game that was basically decided now the fantasy good news there is that if Brunson has to miss a game and again we won't really know until the next next ball game gets closer  downside of doing this show early is Emmanuel quickly would be an obvious start he's great fill in for Brunson I don't even know if he'd be in the starting lineup but his usage would be so high that he would get an opportunity all so Mitchell Robinson left this ball game he did come back but Isaiah hartenstein you can see on your board if you're watching he played 29 minutes and had a huge fantasy line if Mitch Robin has to miss any time I healthy heart and shine this year would be a very easy Phil and choice as well  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no terrifying isn't it

not quite enough for me not quite enough more of a schedule play than anything else but keep an eye on some of these Nicks possible fillings a Dante even chenzo got the start for Quentin Grimes and  didn't do anything  shuffling along kristaps porzingis came back for the Celtics and was very good Al Horford at a double-double Off the Bench he played some extra minutes because Jalen Brown got ejected I love Al Horford I would love to tell you to keep playing him but you shouldn't this was a this was more flukey than anything else typically is minutes are in the low to mid-20s Off the Bench that's not going to be enough for Al on the day-to-day he's a guy you obviously drop it when we're seeing this is out but when kp's healthy that's gonna be a no  Minnesota blew out Memphis no trouble here despite the fact that Anthony Edwards left early with a regen of his hip injury Nicole Alexander Walker picked up a few extra shots in the mess Troy Brown Junior picked up a few extra shots you're not playing either of those guys on the Roto side you are playing Nas Reed right now while he's getting 23 24 minutes a game because he is a fantasy  stat magnet whenever he can get out there at some point he'll kind of cool off again but he's a go go bear is on a heater right now he's making his free throws and so everything then floats up the board with him my Conley's been wonderful the choice is right now in Minnesota are relatively straightforward so we don't need to spend much time on it as I think are the choices in Memphis Jaren Jackson Jr has been playing better this is another decent ball game for JJJ Desmond Bane slowed down a little bit but who cares he's been fine and you're not playing anyone else other than maybe like big time reach on Santi aldama who I do have stashed in one or two spots but you know with Tillman back now smart should be back in the next week or two Josh should be back in the next week and a half or so it's really gonna upend everything with this team and so I don't know that you really need to hold on to anybody other than JJ and beIN on the Grizzlies right now at least in terms of like who's playing because they're gonna have all these dudes coming back and those are the guys you'll end up looking at and everything gets sort of thrown into the blender at that point  calves were without having Mobley and Charis liver for this win in Miami it didn't really change much fantasy wise Dean Wade got the start for Mobley and did nothing Max Drew said a Porsche shooting game but he still got 17 shots so I ain't complaining and then you know the main guys were the ones that did the damage move on from that one the Heat or later Robinson got played off the floor a little bit this ball game I still think that if bam and Highsmith miss another one you play Robinson because you can see even in 20 minutes his Fantasy game is very very intriguing he gets assists he gets rebounds he gets points he gets defensive stats he can actually space the floor a little bit of it didn't hit me threes in this one the heat are a streaming Gold Mine other than apparently Duncan Robinson and this ball game who had one of the worst fantasy lines of the entire season  it was like somebody whacked him in the face right before the game he had one point on one out of two free throws so it took a Mist to get their want to assist owe of seven shooting and six turnovers in 23 minutes again maybe the worst fantasy line anybody's put up all season long that said he's been a good stream with Tyler hero out despite this horrendous ball game I know it's hard to sort of deep swallow that one down Kevin Love played 28 minutes out of the blue in this game I don't know why really I know game got ugly so SPO was kind of mixing and matching a little but you're not playing Kevin Love Josh Richardson had a nice game Off the Bench again not a guy you're playing in Roto it's too dangerous Lowry's a guy you can stream while everybody's hurt or land o' Robinson his guy you can stream while everybody's heard I know it's crazy to say Duncan Robinson after this game but he is and then lately Caleb Martin has kind of supplanted I met jacquez Junior as the safer kind of wingy stream for the heat because when Caleb starts running hot he takes more shots he gets threes and that's the difference for him because he know he can get a few rebounds a few assists so just be out there long enough to get them the issue is easy to take any shots and right now when he's  warmer he'll take them  there's a regression thing with Caleb that comes and goes so he's a stream right now but if we get to tomorrow or whatever the hell the Heat's next ball game is I I have misplaced my pants the Heat's next game is indeed tomorrow Monday in Charlotte and if we get a report that like you know Bam's back and Highsmith is back then that shakes up the whole front Court Martin I wouldn't play jaquez I certainly wouldn't play Robinson or our land oh Robinson you definitely don't play it Heroes back then you bench Duncan Robinson so there's a lot that could change between today and tomorrow but that's where things stand for Miami right now  Warriors lost to the Thunder and over time the good news for the Warriors here is they finally let Jonathan comingo play a little bit and he played a bunch in the second half of the previous ball game and he fouled out in 29 minutes of this one he's very much a speculative add maybe the most interesting thing that happened over the weekend was sort of this emergence of kaminga and I don't know what's Steve Curry is gonna do on the day-to-day but if you're first of all if you're in a keeper or a dynasty format  coming in needs to be on a team  post haste because the Warriors are getting real old  and whether they like it or not he is their future I don't think that they like it actually but that's that's the honest to goodness truth so he needs to be on rosters if you're in any kind of format that extends Beyond this season and even in redraft right now I think there's a case to be made to pick him up and just kind of see how this thing goes Chris Paul's been out Gary Payton's gonna be out for a while yet  and so you know all that could mess things up and if Andrew Wiggins ever decides to wake up a little bit that could change things if Draymond Green doesn't foul out in 35 minutes maybe that changes things a little bit but overall it feels like Steve Kerr's thinking like I gotta switch something up because the usual crap just is not working right now  does that mean that can make is going to get another chance in the next ball game it does not mean that necessarily but he's played well in this one and he played great in the second half of their previous game and I feel like that's kind of earning him a little bit of trust and a little bit more leash and we'll see how it goes so I say add coming up keep him on your bench if you're in a roto don't spend a Gamecock on it until you see how this whole thing plays out but had to head you know you might as well spend a move when someone like this pops up that could actually be arrested season name could  I don't know why I think the percentage is Art 10 15%  but you know mid-December that's actually kind of a high number for  could a guy be arrested season dude most of the moves were making right now are injury replacement guys where it's basically is 0% chance someone's gonna be rest of season value and coming get better than 0 I don't think anything's gonna happen to Clay I think Wiggins has a chance to get benched at some point although they still like his defense but overall he's just been such a gross negative for them  we saw Looney lose a bunch of playing time here in favor of sharks and kaminga so things are things are shifting a little bit and we should pay attention  meanwhile the Jalen Williams freight train has officially left the station hopefully everybody had a chance to buy low on Jalen Williams because he's now up to number 68 and he still hasn't even gotten his steals number up that much  this is a dude who can roll top 30 when things are really cooking and hopefully everybody bought low Chad Holmgren still Truckin man what a what an amazing start to his year he's number 10 in nine cat right now  grotesquely amazing  and then she's crazy but let's keep moving here  Chicago Alex Caruso  play 19 minutes and left early this is the Alex Caruso story in a nutshell  Demars gonna have to do a lot on offense vouch Kobe white these are the guys are gonna get all the usage for the bulls with Zach LaVine out that's been enough to get Kobe white cooking it's been very close to enough to get Patrick Williams cooking but now if Caruso has to miss their next ball game that's probably enough to make Patrick Williams a start independent of the other stuff we need Demar out to get down to the sun moon on the filling train but the Bulls are  I'd say they're playing better but also this was the Spurs who are in a dog fight for the worst team in the league otters right now so you know don't give too much credit but  Bulls are playing a little bit better  Spurs decided to try Wendy at the five and it was pretty cool he had a 2020 game Zach Collins came off the bench 23 minutes for Collins he actually had a damn fishing ball game actually so hold on to him  trade Jones got 28 minutes if that happens again you got to add him everywhere  if it doesn't then don't one time is not enough for me to buy that this is like a legit thing  Sohan went back into the starting lineup after one game on the bench Devin vassell starting again keldon Johnson had another one of his efficient games you guys know my feelings on this person and everybody can help me for it can can crush me for it Kelvin Johnson to me basically anytime he has a really good shooting game you try to sell for someone who's ranked near him which has been this year between like 65 and 80 and then vessel is kind of the same story he's down to 85 I just felt like his field goal percent was never gonna stay where it was and it's already starting to come down Spurs are frustrating if they would just turn trade Jones loose he'd be a really fun guy to pick up off most wires  and you know you if you have a dead spot on your team you could pick him up from this ball game and just see what happens I just I think for many of us that need our roster spots I kind of want to see it happen one more time  let's keep tracking here we got a lot to cover Rockets beat the Nuggets not much to talk about from a fantasy standpoint this ball game Dillon Brooks had one of his better games he really seems to be a focused dependent fantasy play  When the Rockets have a big game Dillon Brooks seems like he cares and then the rest of the time he just sort of lets everybody else do it  Freddie Van Fleet still can't get any steals the darndest thing I mean he's having a perfectly fine fantasy season but  you know he's in the 40s  not the end of the world field goal percentage is not gonna come up that much it's all steals for him right now the steals will come around he bounced up into the 20s and 30s  some of them I might just be scheme I guess you know maybe he's not gonna get into the mid to high ones but I can't believe he's under one steal at the end of this season now that would floor me  Jamal Murray got ejected no other notes on the Denver side other than Yoke's in kind of the first shooting Funk of his career could you buy low on Nicola yokich right now I mean possibly  but  we did call the championship hangover no one should be too surprised by this  it's finally hitting  King's beat the zombie sons in a game that they frankly should have won Keegan Murray is the only story there well Malik monks minutes continue to Trend up but we've called him an ad for a few weeks in a row now so that doesn't change Keegan's a Bi-Lo he fouled out in 30 minutes here these very good and he's just gonna keep getting better Sons were without Bradley Beal and Kevin Durant both are getting very close now though there's a hope that Bradley Beal could actually play at some point this week KD it sounded like this is a pretty short-term thing tweaked and Ankle against their IST game against the Lakers and so I think they figured they just give them this one off and  you know give him like five days to recover so I think we see Kevin Durant back pretty soon if he happens to miss another one Eric Gordon is your obvious stream he played 38 minutes that actually led the team more than Booker  Booker's going to do a ton wow Superstars are out he'll do quite a lot even when they start to come back at some point we'll actually see what this team is with all three of their guys but as it been yet Clippers beat the Jazz which has been kind of hard for them historically but it shouldn't be because the Jazz are terrible this year Paul George Kawhi Leonard had bigger games James Harden slowed down a tiny bit but there's really nothing fantacy wise here other than my continued watch list of Norman Powell and this was a bad Norman Powell game so move on to Utah John Collins huge ball game he hadn't had one of these in a while so this was a nice little bit of a John Collins wake up day that pushed him back into the 90 range for the year good good he's a hold Walker Kessler back into the starting five we put him on our Bi-Lo board while he was coming off the bench because we knew people were starting to get frustrated  gonna be frustrated for long now he's gonna Crush from now basically into the end of time  and you guys know how I feel about keyonte George and Jordan Clarkson I don't think Jordan Clarkson has ever come close to being a true nine cat guy so no keonte  he's not that dissimilar from hula Believe In My Eyes where you know maybe it starts to make sense around the All-Star break but just too many fantasy inefficiencies here and I got people yelling at me about this one too oh Dan you're going to regret this call I I don't think that's true I feel like people put way too much stock in what a player does in March  can't take George might be good in March I've said that before I'll say it again  I can't stash him for that long  I'm in competitively I can't have someone who's physically dragging my team down for two and a half months on the hope that he's better at the end of that time line I just can't  it's too much to ask  hopefully Larry Martin's back marking will be back soon because the Jazz need him badly and they are ugly to watch without him  Dallas be poorly on the road Kyrie Irving had kind of a scary foot injury I think I forget it was Dwight Powell fell on it I think so I think it was a teammate I can't remember exactly I had somebody in my Twitter mentions that was like he's for sure it's broken it's a good chance it's fractured I can sell him now like what  breaks their kiddo turns out to be a heel contusion which you know these bruises can take some time to heal we might see him miss a week or two but it doesn't sound like it's super serious they're not gonna Rush him back because the Mavs are in very good position already so expect him to miss a few ball games at least but you know not the end of the world the sky hath not Fallen but  the current missing players for the Mavs have opened up some kind of interesting streaming possibilities Grant Williams missed this one he might be back for the next ball game Josh Green is out for a few weeks yet so first of all Derek Lively is a start regardless of all this other stuff but Derek Jones junior is a start while all these other wings are out  with Kyrie going down Tim Hardaway Jr probably bounces back up into startable because he's just gonna get enough shots to be useful as you saw in this one you had 20 points and four threes he doesn't do anything else but that's enough and he can probably get enough when Kyrie's not there and then we've had a couple games in a row from Dante Exum and look I'll be the first to admit that this feels like a not sustainable thing going on for exam but I mean who the hell knows he's been really hot he's had seven assists in two games in a row maybe that's going to be his role I'm not adding him  he's gonna get picked up in a lot of spots after one big ball game and you know maybe he ends up putting together a little stretch here while Kyrie's out but it just it does not feel like a thing that's gonna last for very long I just can't possibly imagine that Dante Exum magically became a fantastic basketball player overnight after like a decade of not  but we've talked about it before  playing a guy on a heater is not the worst idea in the world I'm just not confident enough to go that direction when you can go after a Derek Jones Junior who steps into bigger roles every time someone goes down and then hard way who they'll need to do some scoring here meanwhile Luca took 20 shots in this game as if his usage wasn't high enough already now it's going to be even crazier  for Portland I think we probably see DeAndre eight and back after their kind of long layoff from this ball game Saturday Sunday that's not that long I guess  maybe he misses another one Brogden Jeremy Grant these guys are all out right now the Blazers are a super weird fantasy team to track when three starters are down because scoot coming off the bench is playing starter's role but he's still sort of NBA terrible he hasn't figured out the game yet Anthony Simons is back thank goodness for that he took 21 shots and he's gonna destroy points leagues while everybody's hurt he'll be good enough in nine cat also but I mean this is a guy who's like I said on our last show I think on Friday he could he could legit average four three-pointers a game this year and he had four in this ball game  so that's fun Shane sharp is gonna do a ton while all these guys are hurt  and then the one that we talked about on Friday show which was like I don't know if Matisse died was gonna get guaranteed 30 minutes but if he does you got to start him and he did in this one and so I think if all three of those starters are out again  you start sharp Simon's and thigh bowl and that's probably as far as I go to Monte Cara it would be the next closest he's a maybe but we don't know that much about his Fantasy game to say yes or no on that one and then reef is a no for me because it doesn't seem like his minutes are guaranteed even in that starter spot you may have to sort of rejigger things if like if they've been his back that Mike my guess would be that actually takes dibal out of the starting five but maybe it bumps Kamara  feel it out a little bit  I think Grant probably misses another one but we can't again know until we get closer ah that was everybody that played over the weekend and I'm not gonna do a Monday night preview on today's show but I am gonna talk a little bit about about the week ahead before we wrap things up no questions on today's either again I gotta make sure that I rest my voice this coming week is a very very heavy games week  I think it's one of the most populated weeks of the sort of non-playoff fantasy season  no one has two games this week like even next week we go back to someone having a two-game week I think this sons have a two game week not this coming week but the following one this week almost everybody has four one two three four five six teams have three games those teams are the Lakers which frankly they earned it by playing in the finals but the Pacers actually before game weeks sorry Indy Grizzlies have three wolves have three Thunder have three the Thunder have the like the craziest schedule so far this year they're lagging way behind a lot of teams in games played don't worry it'll make up or Lando has three and Toronto has three so if you somehow have a team that's like overloaded in those six teams you're going to be at a games disadvantage this week but otherwise the game should be relatively equal which means that streaming is both harder and also at the same time not quite as necessary because you're talking about you know if you had a 13 player league and you know 24 out of the 30 teams that's 80% of the league is going four games this week you can just sort of in your mind say okay on average what's 80% of 4  3.2 so on average every player on your team is going to be going 3.2 times this week you got 13 players 39 30 13 times 3 is 39 13 times 0.2 is 2.6 that's 41.6 games for your team this week  that's a high number  for a given week so you usually 30 high 30s so every you know partial game you add to that doesn't actually change things quite as much you know it's 2% two and a half percent  now you can still try to stream because you have the weekend to prepare and if you didn't use all your moves up from last week you can go for somebody on Sage Chicago Cleveland Dallas Denver the Clippers the Kings they all have a back-to-back Monday Tuesday to start this week so I get you off to a quick start if you want to go back to back Wednesday Thursday that's Brooklyn Miami has a back-to-back Wednesday Thursday Utah and then if you wanted to go back to back Friday Saturday or Saturday Sunday there's a lot of those as well Atlanta has a backpack Friday Saturday Detroit is Friday Saturday Charlotte's Friday Saturday golden state is Saturday Sunday India is Friday Saturday Milwaukee Saturday Sunday the Knicks the Sixers Friday Saturday and Portland is Saturday Sunday so there's a lot of options of back-to-backs but again as you make these moves you might not actually be gaining a game for the rest of the week  because there again there are only 16 that have a three game week  so I want you to be somewhat cautious about how you use your moves I think the best thing to think about here is to treat this a little bit like a playoff week but not as critical as a playoff week meaning you can  you want to make sure that you leave a move or two in case someone on your team gets hurt  because the only thing that's really gonna blow you up is if one of your four Gamers turns into a zero that's where you get really hurt if you use a bunch of your moves at the beginning of the week and you don't have one to cover it if you start to get zeros midweek that's how you end up at A Game's disadvantage so yes I think you can stream this week I think it's smart to actually use whatever moves you have for this coming week today make sure you use all of your moves up for this last week that's ending because like there's no point in taking one into the next week with you but I also don't think that going Mega stream crazy is going to be that helpful this week because whatever you do you're probably it's a short-term thing  because like  half the league goes four times the first six days so instead this week look at what maybe some of the low tide days are and there aren't that many of them mind you again like this is a game's heavy week but there are a couple of days that are a little bit lower tide Monday is a massive games day Tuesday only has five Thursday actually has seven so it's a relatively busy day Friday has eight Saturdays pretty busy Sunday has only five so like I would argue that Tuesday and Sunday are the ones where maybe you can make a little Headway save them over to for the end of the week to try to bulk up that Sunday Monday is an overload day in a big big way Monday is I think 13 12 or 13 games played Wednesday is 9 so again like you can stream and you probably won't hit too many overloads  but just know that you're the at the end of the week your games played in your opponents are probably gonna be relatively tight best strategy without talking in circles too much use moves right now to cover get some Monday Tuesday back-to-backs if you're Monday has already overloaded you could actually aim for a Tuesday through Sunday type of Team somebody that plays Tuesday and has four games from that point on Boston is a team that goes Tuesday through Sunday and has four games try to remember these teams as I list them the Warriors are another one the sons are another one those are the three teams that have four games Tuesday through Sunday so if you're looking at the long streaming plan that's the way to do it the sun's also go back to back Tuesday Wednesday so that makes them interesting in that regards are really good team to grab on that one if you feel like you want to make more moves starting on Thursday and they're Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday I don't know are there any teams that go three times  Thursday through Sunday  Warrior's think might be the only one Warriors and Blazers so if you start with the sun say on Tuesday you take their back-to-back then you switch to Warriors Blazers that's a good way to use one or two moves on each of those days and you can sort of squeeze out an extra two three four streams on the week where your opponents are probably going to do some streaming but what they're not going to realize is that they're not really adding that many games for their whole week because they're gonna switch off a one team to another but then that team might not have a great schedule after that so they'll have to use another move to get back to a better team again  I'll try to put some of this stuff on social maybe later on today people can dig through it but that's the general streaming strategy for this week we're not gonna go through the sort of game time call guys because today is Sunday it's not gonna help you we're not gonna have that information until late Monday afternoon because the game start Indy at Detroit kicks things off tomorrow  and then almost all the games what are five six seven eight nine ten it's a 13 game Monday but 11 of the 13 games are going by 5:00 Pacific time so you'll have a lot of the game time calls before your lineups lock on Monday at 4 for weekly lineups and then the only ones you might not get news on would be Brooklyn Sacramento Portland and the Clippers those the teams that go later on Monday night all right Dan has got to save his voice thank you to anybody that ignored football on a weird Sunday morning to watch this show live I can't believe even a few of you are out there but please do take a moment
