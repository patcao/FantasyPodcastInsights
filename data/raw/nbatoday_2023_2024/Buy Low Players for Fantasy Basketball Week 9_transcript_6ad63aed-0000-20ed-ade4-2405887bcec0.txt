morning  we nine what are we gonna do to cash in ladies and gentlemen what are we going to do to cash in things have been going well on this front lately as far as bios go we'll do a recap as we get into things and then we'll give you three more names one of them perhaps a little bit risky that maybe maybe we'll catch in in the not too distant future I am Dan best person at Dan best person on

YouTube all that good stuff and I think that's the main thing Discord link is in the show gription Twitter Handles in the show description and on your screen if you're watching everything is pretty easy to find these days so let's go ahead and dive right into it  yeah there it says Buy Low week 9 probably should have put that up before because this is repeating myself but it's it kind of incredible that we're already at week nine isn't it  I think that puts us a third of the way through the NBA season  yeah teams have played  about a third of their games just a tiny bit less than that  we're rumbling along man but at the same time I know you hear that in your first thought is oh no I'm running out of time already don't worry that's not the case  third of the Season might be done but that means we still have two thirds or just slightly more than that left  everything is fine  let's take a look at what's been going on on these Buy Low shows because and this was something I wanted to add as we got going I frankly I probably should have done this sooner  the calls that were making on these Buy Low shows we want to see how they're doing our guys still buy Lowe's I have they started to cash in already  let's look at a few of those  Jaron Jackson Jr he's been cashing in he's on a he was the Buy Low guy for a two three four weeks in a row he had fallen out of the top 100 he's now number 39 on the season  you guys can  probably do some simple math on that  lately  he's been dominating  well let's see what is that put him actually top 50 over the last month better than that over the last couple of weeks number 20 over the last two weeks  still I would argue below where you'd expect the blocks total to be for him only a 1.8 blocks over that stretch genre is back for the Grizzlies  JJ is no longer a Buy Low with as well as he's been playing so we've cashed in on that one Julius Randle continues to play extraordinarily well we knew that it like look he's not a guy that I typically Target in drafts but we knew when he was shooting like 30% high volume that just wasn't a number that was gonna stick long term and over the last couple of weeks he's number 40 he's been climbing the board quickly  at some point he's going to sort of  I don't say semi max out on where he gets to but I think it's safe to say that that Buy Low has also cashed in and if you wanted to turn around and start to sell some of these guys I don't know about JJ cuz he's still kind of on the upswing but Randall he said you know two really good shooting weeks in a row when the numbers balance out that's when you want to see if you can go flip a guy like Randall who has these weeks where the bottom falls out  Keegan Murray has completely exploded that was like the easiest Bi-Lo call we've ever had on the show possibly he's a first rounder over the last two weeks at record-breaking 3.9 was the one that sort of pulled the numbers way up the board but Keegan was also a guy who was outside the top 100 and was kind of floating between 80 and 110 for a while while shooting 38 and a half percent and you just knew that wasn't going to stick  the steals have been nice the rebounds have been nice this year he just has more usage so it was all about waiting for the field goal percent to level off and now he's number 54 so again this is another one that's cached in we can't really do anything else with it  Damian Lillard was the Buy Low last week he was more of a narrow window by low because his field goal percentage had been dropping it was down to 41 as soon as someone got into my 200 mentions and was like maybe he's just not going to shoot as well this year I was like okay this is the time to buy on this guy as soon as people are just like maybe this is what it actually is that's when you know the window is there a famous climb from 25 to 18 with two big ball games actually really hard to move slots at the top of the board but he's done it ah you probably kind of missed your chance too good ball games there but again we'll take it because that's another one that worked  I think we had none more that worked pretty well and then we have some guys that are kind of floating around know I guess there's a couple so Jared Allen had a bad ballgame yesterday had some foul trouble he got hurt partway through he had moved up from  97 to 76 his bad ball game yesterday moved him back down to 84 so he's still ahead of where we got a map but it's kind of a small jump I need to do a just this this PowerPoint presentation late last night and I forgot to do it so that's on me but either way Evan Mobley is out for a while as long as Jared Allen stays out of foul trouble which has been a problem for him he said like three of the last five games he's been dealing with some foul issues he's gonna move up he'll probably find his way inside the top 65 at some point here so you could probably still buy low but it's not quite as easy as it was last week Jaylen Brown remember he was in the 90s he was two weeks ago on our by low board he's now into the 60s just quietly things didn't change that much for Jaylen Brown number 68 now I believe it mostly field goal percent up from like 45 and some odd to 47 and some odd free throws are up from 70 and change to 72 that's just these little things that are probably gonna keep moving in that direction for him so there's still room for Jalen Brown to raise up but again once a guy moves 2530 slots because of a good week to week stretch it's just not going to be easy to get that guy anymore and then three guys that we've had on the Bi-Lo board that haven't really moved yet DeMar DeRozan who  like I have no problem with Damar he's actually up like four slots to number 60  but he's still shooting just 44% from the field that's a number that I still thinks up towards 47 I don't know if he gets all the way to 50 but just these little moves and free throws from 82 does that get up to 84 or 85 that moves him inside the top 50 so there's still a little bit of room on DeMar DeRozan cam Johnson was one that we've had on the board a couple of times he's still kind of floating around near 9100 I'm not particularly worried about it I think the field goal percent comes up and I mostly think the steals come up he said sort of a low steals year to this point he's not the only guy that's had a low steals here but I think there's some room for that and then Walker Kessler was a really easy Buy Low yes yesterday and then Utah moved him back into the starting lineup and he had I think a five block ball game if memory serves and he's now back up to number 81 if you can still get him for someone near that marker near the 80s I still think you'd do it because when he's in the starting lineup he's much much better than that  you know 14 and 14 with five blocks was the line yesterday for Kessler in 32 minutes when he starts he's a behemoth  and frankly if he just gets up near 30 minutes he's a behemoth because his elbow is fine now so the rebounds and the blocks are back where they need to be he's bad foul shooter like okay whatever we knew that getting into it but this is a guy that should be inside the top 50 when all things are said and done so I think you can probably get down on it with these three dudes who  were by Lowes and haven't really moved yet  all right let's see who is on the board for this week  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no

drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's dri z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  I left one slide in there that I didn't mean to some of you may have caught it oopsies  Jayson Tatum is our first Bi-Lo for this week and I don't know that even people have fully grasped yet where he's at but Jason Tatum is that number 36 right now actually he was 34 when I built this thing yesterday he's fallen to slots  but  the way we got there is I don't want to say unusual it just feels like it's a pretty easy thing to spot  first of all Tatum's usage is not going to be what it was last year Derek white is doing more stuff he's more comfortable Drew holiday is there instead of Marcus Smart Kristoff porzingis being in town is the largest adjustment the Celtics have had to sort of work their way through  so he's not going to take 21 shots a game he said 19.6  so scoring 30 points of ball game might just not be in the cars for Tatum this year  but that's not the thing I'm worried about because look I mean you could look at Tatum from last year and  he was what like right near the end of the first round on a per game basis very durable 30 points 3.23 pointers 8.8 boards four point six assists  here's the thing that jumps out  okay the assists are a little bit down as well that's as a problematic but it is something that probably like I guess it's about they're almost exactly the same there half an assist that probably doesn't come back again this is just usage related stuff those things probably don't return to where they were he's probably not going to be 30 points he's probably not going to be at 4.6 assists he's still a three three-pointers and said of three point two it's small adjustment but it's there the big thing you're looking at with Tatum this year  two things actually  number one defensive stats he was at 1.8 last year he's at 1.4 this season which I know isn't sound like all that much but 0.4 defensive stats actually makes a really big deal because remember these are low volume high impact stats  two tenths of a steel 2/10 of a block those really do matter  like Freddie Van fleets at one point one steals that makes him a medium-sized positive Tatum is it point nine that makes him basically a net neutral  there's a big deal  and the bigger deal for a guy who's taking and you guys know where I'm going with this six point seven free throws per game last year and basically for the last half decade he's a bit around 85% this year he's at 79  he went from being a pretty large positive impact free throw guy to a small negative  that's a big big swing  but also I have every reason to believe that that's a number that comes back for Tatum  I know maybe you could maybe this is just a year where he doesn't shoot free throws well that's a that's an actual possibility but you know what I'm willing to take that shot and somebody drafted in probably towards the middle end of the first round and I don't know if they're fully aware that these things have been wrong but again he's ranked at the end of the third round because of these weird little adjustments year over year I don't think he gets back to the first round based on what we've seen so far this season because again he was number 11 last year per game and he's taking a usage hit so even if you think all of the peripheral or the efficiency stuff gets back where it was he still will be a little bit lower this year than he was last year meaning from 11 you don't have very far to go before you're a second rounder and a couple of guys in the second round this year are ahead and I don't know that they're moving back Luca I mean maybe we see him tire out as the season goes at certainly been a thing before but he's moved up from second round to first round Kawhi Leonard last year was second round because of his slow start the season he's in the first round you've also got Chet Holmgren in there who's actually moving up the board with 15 blocks and his last two ball games  there's three four guys that weren't in the first round so even if Tatum does what he did last year that's still probably puts him at the beginning of the second round and now with all these other guys moving up the board that actually moves him kind of towards the middle so I think Tatum can get back into that kind of 18 to 20 range what I don't know for sure and this will be the big question on this buy low as can you get him for a second round pick right now because that's what you'd want to do  don't pay a first round price for Jayson Tatum I don't think he's getting back to that spot but you got some guys in the second round like say a Carl Anthony towns whose late second round right now and is probably about maxed out to what he's gonna be doing could you get Jayson Tatum and hope that Tatum passes him if towns I don't know takes a small step backwards at any point this year  it's a possibility that might get it done  but I don't think it's gonna work if you go much deeper than that like maybe an injured lamelo ball might be someone you could flip out there he's a third rounder right now you're not doing Giannis because if you drafted him you did it to punch free throw percent anyway you're probably not doing Damian Lillard because he's been on the way up and met Frank finish ahead of Tatum  would you go LeBron he's been playing way out over his head this season I mean apparently he's a cyborg but that might get it done Paul George is a possibility to get it done but again I don't know that I would do it so there's only a handful of guys that I think I would consider offering up towns being one of them maybe Kyrie Irving but he's hurt right now so that probably doesn't do it lamelo who's hurt I'd probably do it Trey young is a possibility but that kind of blows up your team build so maybe that's not the smartest thing in the world but from just like a strict nine cat standpoint that's probably one that I would do  and then again you move your way up the board and I don't know how high you go do you think how far do we think Devin Booker Falls if Bradley Beal actually ever shows up this year  do we think he falls towards the end of the second round Maybe  so maybe Booker is the answer to this question but with be out and other couple of weeks I don't know that I would do it yet  all right let's see who's next on the Bi-Lo board what special treat  Anthony Edwards  so this is a guy that I very much did not Target on draft night you guys might remember this I think he's I always thought the greatest Advantage he had was seemingly durability but he's been dealing with a hip injury so far this year  and look I love what he does he's an outstanding basketball player the Wolves as a team have been playing terrific Ball but Anthony Edwards just didn't have much more that he could have added onto what he did the second half of last year which basically put him in that 40 range he had a big ball game yesterday so again you know I made this list up last night before the final totals had adjusted for today had a really good efficient game with five defensive stats last night so he moved up from 50 to closer to 40 but that's kind of what I thought Anthony Edwards was  now this screws me up because we kind of needed to do this show yesterday but let's let's do this on more of a hypothetical let's say that at the Edwards has a slower ball game and falls back five or six slots in his next one  because he kind of cashed in this Buy Low recommendation before I could even get the show out to you guys with yesterday's much larger ball game  I think  that Edwards finishes in the mid-30s  which he still not quite there he's around 40  but the issue is I wanted you to be able to go get him for someone near 40 and now that he's back near 40 I don't know you're gonna be able to do that anymore  so last night screwed that up a little bit but let's look at some of the guys around Anthony Edwards and see which of them might get it done demonic bonus might get it done Jaylen Brunson might get it done Deonte Murray might get it done and injured Evan Mobley would not get it done bam out of Bio would probably get it done Freddie Van Vliet would probably get it done all the again I don't know that that's one I would do because Freddie's been on the rise and Freddie Simon's would not get it done for Singas Bane these guys I don't think would would get it done either and then I don't think I'm giving it much more than that  so let's say Edwards has a slower ball game he moves back and you know the mid-40s where he had been prior to yesterday's Gigantor game those are the guys that you're thinking about giving up for  because I think mid-thirties is probably your target point for Edwards  and everything he's doing right now you know the funny thing is about Anthony Edwards is that what he's doing right now is basically what I thought he would be  the issue is that everybody else had him as a first or late first early second round guy because  honest to goodness I don't really know what everybody saw I think there was an expectation that he was going to shoot as well as he did at in the FIBA game's that the field goal percent was going to go from 46 to like 51 I didn't really see that happening he's had a nice upswing in free throw percent so far this year which you know that's one of the things we were like look this is a thing that's probably gonna need to be fixed for him to really climb the board the issue is that there wasn't more usage of available to him on that wolves team they're just weren't more shots for him to take  he had 19 and a half shots a game last year in Karl Anthony towns basically missed the entire season even if we felt like Anthony Edwards was taking control grabbing this team by the horns and making it his team which I think we all agreed he was gonna do that just meant taking more shots from like the little guy  but with towns around he was set to take most of those available shots back for himself because he wasn't there to take him last year  so Edwards is almost the same in almost every category you're over a year Steals and blocks are down a little bit and again that matters we talked about that with Jayson Tatum so that was a reason I thought maybe Edwards could be on the upswing but then yesterday's five defensive stat game sort of messed that up a little bit sister fine rebounds are fine scoring is exactly the same free throw percent might actually come down a tiny bit field goal percent is fine he is who he is right now  but if you see any slow age one or two game's red and shoot the balls well because he's had a couple better shooting games in a row if he goes through a little mini shooting slump of two games or something like that and falls back into the mid 40s go get him for someone in the mid 40s because he's a mid 30s guy and he's a very predictable safe and enjoyable one to have on your fantasy team  and now the rescue one your final Buy Low is the most annoying player to roster in fantasy sports right now and that is Bradley Beal  and before I tell you about Bradley Beal I want to remind everybody once again to please do find me on Twitter at Dan Vespers d a n b e s b r i s come join us in our Discord the link is in the show description  oh I

who I marked as very risky on the slide that's on the screen for YouTube viewers right now because it is extraordinarily  he basically hasn't played yet this year  and every time it looks like he's about to play a ball game  he gets hurt again  what's he played now four games I think so far this year  was it he got he like got back from the first injury played four games re-aggravated it played part of a game is it he's a technically is it sick but  I mean does it even really count because like the first game was he was limited by minutes second and third game he was semi minute Limited I don't believe he's at a single game this year where he hasn't been Limited in some way  which makes him the most annoying player to roster in fantasy Sports  even more than Chris Middleton because yes he's at his minutes Limited in every game other than like one also but at least he's played  at least he's played and Beale hasn't  it cannot get any worse than it is right now for Bradley Beal  I mean a scratch that the only way it could possibly get worse is if he came back from this ankle injury and immediately got hurt again and then was out for the year  I don't even want to say cuz I didn't want to speak it into existence but that's really the only way that things could be worse for Bealls fantasy season so far  I only have him on one of my 10 however many stupid teams I have floating around right now and even just on that one team I'm extraordinarily annoyed by him  he's ranked out side the top 200 but again like he hasn't really been healthy so who cares about that  I still think  that if Bill can get right he can just roll at a 75 clip basically the rest of the way I actually think there's a chance he could go better than that but let's just take that for sort of what it is last year Bradley Beal in Washington was number 54 in nine category leaks he had a lot of decent numbers 23 points for boards five and a half assists one and a half threes 1.6 defensive stats good percentages turnovers were a little bit on the high side and that was part of what was kind of weighing him down because once you get into the 40s and 50s if you're a high turnover guy  you move farther up and down the board based on turnovers there because most of the guys at the top of the board are higher turnover dudes  so being one doesn't really change your fortunes all that much  he moves up into the early 40s last year if you were not really paying attention to his three turnovers a game  I don't think he gets back there that's 17 and a half shots of ball game with Booker and Kevin Durant on the team he probably doesn't get to 17 and a half shots but let's say he gets to like  14 and a half or 15 shots that feels pretty attainable how much down the board does that actually move him if he's more like  say 19 points per game and four and change assist instead of 23 and 5 and and a half and the turnovers were also come down  I still think that puts him you know sort of in the like 65 to 80 range  and right now I don't think Whoever has Beal wants anything to do with him  so  it's extraordinarily risky I want to say that again I wrote it on the page for pokes folks that are watching and I want to repeat it using my words because I've been taught to use my words  if you don't want to do this one that's okay I won't blame you because he's a mess and he's been a mess all year  but I still think he's gonna get a chance to play and frankly more time to rest is ankle means more time to rest his back  try to find a silver lining in this  you can get him right now for literally anyone who has consistent fantasy value on your team  so that means look for guys ranked between 90 and 110 that have some name recognition Austin Reeves  on Yoko Kang woo when he's on a slightly better run  Brandon Ingram who is like a he basically does what Bradley Beal does but with no defensive stats and worst free throw percent Jabari Smith Jr Dennis Schroder  cam Thomas when he's on one of his heaters instead of one of his cold spells Kyle kuzma  nobody wants to part with these guys because they feel like they're doing more than they are but these are literally the guys at the back end of startable 12 team fantasy value Spencer Dinwiddie  Gordon Hayward  if Marcus Smart comes back and does anything Marcus Smart  but like this is the list  you're not gonna get him for nazreen I don't think that's gonna be good enough Chris Paul  a lot of these names I think would get it done  and the thing is you might feel like you're gonna miss him but you're not gonna miss him that much  you need to have a place to stash Beal so that's another little caveat on this one I don't want you trading for him and then  having to take 0 so that's a that's a terrible idea I want you to make sure you guys actually have a place you can put them on your IL  I think he's back in about three weeks that's my guess right now he's going to be reevaluated right around the turn of the year I think they're gonna be like oh yeah it needs about another week to get right so I think we probably see him what the hell is three weeks from today the 20th like around January 7th or 8th something like that  if you could afford a stash for three weeks you can get him for next to nothing  if  again if it feels too risky don't do it this is not one that you have to do I think the other ones or Tatum in particular today is sort of the most obvious one we've got there a lot of them that we go through over these these weeks where the answer is pretty evident this one is not that this one is a scary one I get it  but I also think this is the lowest value he will ever have  because even if he comes back and isn't playing all that great he still gonna be an inside the top 100 guy he's still Bradley Beal and he still has you know 55 to 60 range upside and those are guys that usually can't get for super cheap they don't typically pop up on the wire usually it's going to take you you know a top 75 guy to get someone in that range right now you can get Bill for someone right probably around 1051 10 who's coming off a good ball game I think you can get that done all right again everybody
