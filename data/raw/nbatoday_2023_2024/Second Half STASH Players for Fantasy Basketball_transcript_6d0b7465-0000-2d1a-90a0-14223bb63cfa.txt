welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right time that out pretty well I thought what's happening everybody welcome to your Wednesday Edition February the 21st of fantasy NBA today it is the second half it's not really the second half last third slash silly season stashes episode a literation Gone Wild  I'm Dan vests at Dan best person on social media this is a sports presentation please do find me on Twitter at d a n b e s p r i s that's again at Dan Vespers or just  Google search Dan from hoop ball or Dan from Sports ethos you should be able to find a pretty fast also take a moment here at the front end of the show to please subscribe  whether it's YouTube Spotify iTunes whatever you guys name it please hit the Subscribe button if you're watching on YouTube before or after the fact hello  if you're watching on Twitter hi  follow over there subscribe however you're taking it in it really does matter you guys think I'm just blowing smoke I'm not it's a big deal we're still small least on the video side I guess on the traditional pod side we're sort of like a medium now we've graduated into a medium  YouTube Side Video side were still small so whatever you guys can do over there as much appreciated again if you like what we churn out show it  by doing as such  yesterday this is sort of like a second half of a show and not officially yesterday we did a show on likely shut down candidates and tried to remind all of you that there aren't nearly as many as you think you look at every team you're just like all these guys are gonna shut down and it just doesn't happen that way guys get a game off here a game off there sometimes it's the sort of complicated mishmash of who actually you know there's time I would say time off is more common than full shutdown  at least when we're talking about you know it's you know mid end of February right now we've got the entirety of March and then the first two weeks of April before the season's over  mathematically a lot of these teams are not going to be eliminated until at least mid-march and then many more towards the end of that month or the beginning of April so that's where you'll start to see things Grandpa a little bit although you will see the game off stuff happened by crap some cases there's really as now but also kind of throughout March you see that stuff start to crop up a little bit so on yesterday's show we talked a bit about some of the names that  could get shut down with the the big piece of the puzzle and I don't want to go through the entire show from yesterday you guys can go back and watch it the big piece of the puzzle is kind of isolating the teams that are likely to lean into losing and have players who have been in the league for a handful of years have sort of nothing to gain by getting reps down the stretch so looking at someone like a Kyle kuzma on the Wizards  even tyus Jones on the Wizards if you're looking at  the Hornets their sort of isn't anybody left  raptors have you could argue Yakima portal as someone who probably doesn't deserve or not deserve but doesn't need reps the Blazers have DeAndre Aiden and Jeremy Grant and Malcolm Brogden was already out but you know maybe does he pop up and pop back down again Jaren Jackson Jr on the Grizzlies was another name  I'm not willing to take the full plunge on teams like the Rockets the Jazz the Nets yet who as was astutely pointed out in the chat room yesterday they don't even have their own picks so there's sort of there's really no reason but also the Nets are two and a half games out of a playoff spot the Jazz are two and a half games out of a playoff spot though they are certainly going the wrong direction Rockets are three and a half games out of a playoff spot and they want to be competitive so you take all those things into account you isolate whatever it is I think we had seven six or seven names on the show yesterday of guys that were a dino say severe but a significant shutdown risk or you know time off and then shut down risk  and today we talk more about what that means for what's left over  because yesterday maybe you take that information maybe you lean into some sort of sell packaged do you try to get off of whatever the problem could be for those guys do take a discount coming back from maybe a team that's not as concerned  hopefully your League's End early enough for this stuff is not a massive issue anyway but you know maybe they don't  so a lot of this stuff is more relevant  if your league goes to the end of the regular season which  look I can yell at you guys all day and all night that you got to end your season early but if you're playing in a Yahoo public prize League they don't they go to the end and you don't have any control over that  we can scream at Yahoo but I'm not gonna care what I'm doing here on a podcast nor should they nor should they  and they're probably not going to start and their Seasons early in those public leaks because how do they then pick the date needs to be standardized like they could say we're going to eliminate silly season but like what is Silly Season so they go to the end and it's annoying  Roto it's fine because anything that a player did for you all season long like this concept is less about Roto than it is about head-to-head admittedly you know some of these guys that are gonna get possibly a silly season bounce  they'll work on both formats and you know for Roto you can drop them in when they get if it's a spot start like the guy in front of them  I'd rather use this example as we're actually talking about the players but you know say hypothetically we already mentioned Kyle kuzma here on today say hypothetically Coombs took a day off  for any number of reasons I think he missed the last game where this second last game one of the last games before the break which is only a week but feels like four for illness  no you just shocked anything up to a cold at this point everybody's freaking sick right now so it's not like the leak can be like now I don't have a cold they all have everybody's got a cold either play through you don't  every day on this podcast I'm playing through a cold  Corey kiss Bert we saw big ball game with kuzma out a lot of guys actually had big ball games with coups out because a lot of usage went back into the big bucket but the guy that jumped from not a play to play sort of the like from the 140 range to inside the top 100 was Corey kispert so Rodeo side keep him on your bench if you want it's kind of the Al Horford phenomenon right now he starts anytime a Boston Celtic is out and I'm not saying how Horford is your silly season stash I'm just saying  based on the numbers  all Horford's been a play all season long because of how many times he's been insertable into a lineup  obviously you want to only use them on the game when he's rolling top 50 which is as a starter  but technically you could have used them all season and I think guys like his bird and the other maybe the guys on this list all so possibly fall into that where it's like look if you just rolled them out there even on the head side they'll probably get enough spots starts or spot usage bumps over the next six weeks seven weeks whatever what do we got eight weeks left  come on Dan you can count  to make them playable even on the head side but certainly in the very near term  these are either stashes as was the label on the show or  Rodeo spot place  let's get into it that's enough I think of a preface so you guys get the idea  number one and these are in no particular order this is the order that I found I was going through the shutdown names and I thought all right I'll just throwing these guys on a list do a brief in Portland is player number one on our list because DeAndre Aiden is a possible shutdown candidate if Aiden does not get shut down you do not need to worry about this but that is why it's stash relevant  on the season so far wreath is number 230 in about 17 minutes per ballgame but as we've seen if he can actually stay out of foul trouble and actually start and finish your basketball game he is actually relatively fantasy friendly game  so the key here is and this is sort of the analysis portion of it let's go find the game's let's play the game log game with most of the guys on this list the game log game is fun because we're looking for days where the player in question got what you'd call starter's minutes in my eyes that's like 27 28 minutes or more  that's not necessarily what wreath got when he was starting  there was a little bit about luck he was hurt at the same time as DeAndre Aiden the last time around so he didn't get as many opportunities to go spot play mode and sometimes when he starts the Blazers got blown out so hard that he only played 24 minutes so that all so has to be taken into our calculus because the Blazers are going to be awful down this track but if we look at wreaths numbers this year and we say basically games where he got to 27 minutes  and there's a 26 minute and 53 second game on January 5th that I'm gonna go ahead and round up there was a 26 minute and 20 second game that you have to round down basically anytime that wreath has had 27 minutes or more he's put up a viable fantasy line January 5th 7 Seconds not enough 16 and 7 with two assists seven out of 12 shooting in a three-pointer the following game two days later in Brooklyn 41 minutes 15 and 13 a steal three blocks and three three-pointers that's a big fan of fantasy line  then they got blown out a bunch of times they lost New York by 30 Oklahoma City by 50 650 excuse me they lost to Minnesota by 25 so I think he was actually starting those ball games out looking it up super fast but he only played 21 24 and 24 minutes and his numbers weren't good enough  and more competitive game against Phoenix back at home on January 14th he played 39 minutes went for 17 and six two steals a block two three-pointers  25 minutes in a win over Brooklyn was it enough but he did have 17 and 7 so he sort of slipped through and that's the entirety of it  that's every game for this season where he's hit what I call Starters minutes 27 28 or more somewhere in that neck of the woods he's had more starts than that and that's the downside here that even when he starts there's no guarantee he gets 27 minutes but this is sort of the Al Horford phenomenon if he starts it probably happens often enough specially if this team goes into fully mode where it's like who cares we're getting blown out we can still play hymn 26 27 minutes  that the bad ones will average out with the good ones to still be Fantasy startable on a night tonight basis  it's hard to take his numbers in just extrapolate 17 minutes a game is at half a steal half a block nine and four  it's not that far off I guess I mean one point four three-pointers 74% free throw shooting so he's not gonna hurt you all that much there he's not a good foul shooter  field goal percentage is at 47 and a half and again with all the three pointers that's gonna weigh that down a little bit it's gonna be hard for him to be you know mid by 50 plus guy if half is shots are coming from downtown despite being a big man so a few things have to break in his favor namely we can't have the you know the 21-minute performance in a blowout loss because that's gonna mess up the averages  but he's  their best option there  once Deandre ayton  isn't playing anymore when that happens I don't know and I don't think it's gonna be immediate  I don't think this is a like eight inches is about to shut it down I think this one's still multiple weeks off because they missed a bunch of time earlier this year she's kind of make it up for lost time right now  so do Opera is the first name on your list let's go to name number two I kept this one relatively short just four names on Today Show  Corey kiss for I already mentioned in passing and this one's this one's an exciting one because all of a sudden kiss bird has decided he wants to be heavily involved in his team's office  much like Reef he's outside the top 200 on the season so far that's in 22 ish minutes per ball game  but one thing that I do like about kiss Bert  is that he gets three pointers without ruining your field goal percent  yeah that ain't an easy combo to find he has colossal gaps in his Fantasy game he gets no defensive stats of any kind he's averaging point four Steals and point two blocks in a little under 22 minutes per ballgame last year he played 28 minutes a game and he was at 0.4 Steals and 0.1 blocks it was worse if you can believe that  but also they had Christopher sinkus they had Bradley Beal his usage his involvement in anything that was going on was much much lower you can see just looking at some of his recent lines he is far more involved in what the team's doing lately this year even then early in the season but certainly way more than the last two years where there were legitimate good high usage players on the team now that I usage guys I mean kuzma's fine but I used to guys are not very good on the Wizards right now  and it's look I mean you can say what you want like say oh there's still taking the usage there's a confidence factor for kiss birth that's like look if I take a shot it's really not a step down from our number two usage guy taking a shot which is Jordan Poole most nights  kiss Bert can be out there going it's better for the team if I'm firing away then Jordan Poole that matters for these guys they're human listen NBA players they're all extremely confident by Nature  but there is something that goes on on sort of the team Dynamic front where for kispert last year he's probably out there going like I better make sure that the shot I'm taking is the absolute perfect shot because if it's not I'm taking a shot away from porzingis or Beal  this year it's like I take my shot  if it ain't perfect don't care it's still probably better than whatever Jordan was gonna do  I mean maybe he has to be like maybe I should defer to Coos maybe I should defer to tie his Jones sometimes like it's just it it's just a different set of mental hurdles for him and I'm not saying that he's processing these things in real time I'm just saying like when he's out on the court he can feel free now knowing that if he takes shots it's one of the better looks the team is going to get  and the nice thing about Kissinger is that when we've already seen how it looks when someone is out of the way and he starts going usage mode  and some of it happened when no one was out of the way  but let's play the same game again what is Corey kissper do what he gets 27 208 minutes or more and as an app in that many times this year so it's not like it's gonna be all that hard second game of the year he got 32 minutes I didn't see that one coming and he put up 22 points 3 rebounds and assist and five three-pointers no defensive stats so again other stuff can have to pay her over that mess but 5 threes  that's all right  he didn't he had 26 and a half you get 26 minutes 31 seconds on November 12th so technically I need to round that one up and that game wasn't particularly pretty for him but the next time he actually cleared 27 minutes was November 24th in Milwaukee at 20 and 5 with an assist and 63 pointers  the following day he played 28 minutes went cold had 10 1 and 2 went one for 10 from downtown up Whoopsie Daisy  I know  28 minutes on December 15th 23 points one rebound one assist one steal one block three three-pointers on 64% shooting  so again there are some highs and lows here involved 29 minutes on January 10th that's a month later at this point 15 and 2 with 33 pointers on 6 out of 11 shooting  and then something happened I don't know what the hell happened but something clicked on the very last day of January he just decided you know what I'm a shooter now and he went 27 minutes 16 and 2 with 33s 31 minutes on February 2nd 26 4 and 2 with 63 pointers ah 25 minutes the next day at 15 points missed his 7 threes 33 minutes in a loss to the Cavs he had four three pointers went for 237 and 6  24 6 and 4 the following day and only 24 minutes amazingly and then the last game after he had cooled off for two days kuzma sat and he put up 24 and 6 with 5 3 pointers and 32 minutes against the New Orleans Pelicans this is a guy that when he gets starters minutes he's over 33 pointers a game  you heard how many times I said five four five six threes in that man again that'll average out with the game towards not that high so you can't just look at the game's where heating five three pointers and say oh he's gonna average five threes the rest the way  this simple fact that he has games multiple where he's been four or five six threes tells you that when that averages out with the ones in the twos you get someone that is three or higher  but I firmly believe he does need someone out of his way I know he had a football game in there where he was putting up some decent scoring lines even when the team was largely healthy but he needs one usage guy reliably out of the way because look if he's not running hot which he was for those like four or five games where he was taking 13 14 15 shots even in lower minutes sometimes then then the shots come back down six eight 11 somewhere in that neck of the woods because if he's cold he's not going to go check in the nice thing is if kuzma's out or pools out or whatever  it doesn't matter if he's cold he's gonna keep checking  and he's a good field goal percent guy that all so hits three-pointers that's an interesting combination that does kind of help paper over the fact that he is horrendous in defensive stats  you guys know I like the guys that get defensive stats because it's easier to move yourself up the fantasy board it's harder when you have a fantasy profile like kissper  which is points three's not even that great of a foul shooter I mean he's okay he's 83% uh 78 this year low sample size stuff but you know it doesn't take enough for it to matter  okay feel goal percent like  sort of the prototypical shooting guard line but the nice part is on his current trajectory he said two three-pointers a game in 22 minutes a night if you bump that up to starter's minutes that gets you up near 33 pointers tonight  and that is notable the guys that had three three-pointers a game you start to get up into that upper echelon where frankly it's just easier to have fantasy value  there's only like 18 or 19 guys in the NBA that average three three-pointers a game and only two of those guys are not every day startles Tim Hardaway Jr who again does it because he gets fill in games for Luca and Kyrie and boy on bogdanovich who  sadly profiles a lot like Corey kispert on the fantasy line side of things points in threes  but boy on his had a weirdly down season from the free-throw line and both of the percentages for kiss perpet this year actually better than both percentages for boy on unexpected but that's the case this season  and that's the that's the nice thing about Corey here is that you know if you're head-to-head he's playing every day so he's not ruining you  it's hard to get a good cross-section of his numbers lately like you could look at the last two weeks and you're gonna get a lot of sort of big ones Blended in with little ones he's number 93 small sample again 17 points 33 pointers four boards two and a half assists minimal defensive stats and a 49.89 split that's kind of what you're hoping for if you're dropping them into a lineup right now on the head-to-head side you're hoping that the good and the bad balance out to that like 100.50% of the time that's when you can I think feel more confident on the head-to-head side say okay now he probably pivots inside the top 100 more consistently but that's why he's this again this blend of spot Place slash stash guy on depending on format  this once more with the heart than with the brain but I got to throw him in there named number three is Kelly Olynyk  and we're going to break Kelly Olynyk down after this brief message  from me not from one of our partners the message is from me and the message today is twofold number one now that more of you are watching in

try something we're gonna try something fancy  come with me here  come with me to the sports ethos homepage there it is sports ethos.com we have something that's Sports ethos.com I don't think people realize so if you go to sports ethos.com you hover over the NBA table and you look in the fantasy past subheading over on the right side of the drop-down menu is a button called daily projections I bet you guys didn't know we had this I'm going to click on it see how long it takes to pop up here on the old computers while it's also running a live video stream but as you can see on your screen and this is important for those that are listening after the fact I'm gonna try to describe it to you guys the daily projections which are loading right now or failing to load on my screen again because I've got too many things running the daily projections is something we have at sports ethos that is there they go now they're coming up is updated daily and is an incredible tool if you're making say  on the full season side you're trying to figure out who to spot play because it does incorporate information on who's in and who's out  you can set it to eight cat you can set the day nine cat DFS this is another reason you could sort by whatever category you're hunting for here any of the counting categories which is pretty amazing stuff 8 cat 9 cat but let me show you what this is for DFS look at how cool that is so it takes in the actual prices on DraftKings right now and you can see how that relates to the projected points that they're going to put up on DK  so we actually have daily projections at sports ethos now this is brand new for 2023 to 2024 season they're updated you can see when they were posted this morning at 8:21 a.m. eastern time which is  I think I'll leave exactly three hours ago from this moment they get updated as news breaks it's pretty amazing stuff so you can actually use these to build out your DFS lineups you can use these to build out your full season fantasy lineups if you're daily if you want to think about trying to drop somebody in there and you're looking for a rebound or assist or whatever you can sort by that individual days

burner a great reason to get the all-sport if you're thinking about getting a fantasy pass and get those projections to build out your lineups on the Fly I think that actually went relatively well that was kind of cool I haven't done that thing before  all right let's get Kelly Olynyk back up on the screen here  all right so again  this is one where I'll admit I'm hoping I'm hoping up I don't think the yakka portal shut down is  super likely  but if it's even a little bit likely  this is a player that could change the fortunes of your fantasy team  so this one's different than the other ones we just did  do a brief who's not a super high upside guy but it does feel relatively likely that at some point this year DeAndre Aiden stopped playing basketball because the Blazers are horrendous they're way out of contention Aiden's been playing through a sore knee for parts of the season anyway like what's the point  and then even more so in Washington this team is horrendous and their guys have actually played the whole year who's most been very healthy Ty is Jones Jordan Poole these guys have been super healthy  so they'll get to a point where it's just like you know when I played my full season I did my 65 games I did my 70 games whatever it is and then they just won't need to play anymore so in those instances talking about do a brief and Corey kispert as the guys that step in to value  I think it's more likely that those guys end up with some fantasy value but they're a higher floor lower ceiling type  that's not really fair because Olynyk actually does have a pretty high floor  the way I'm trying to  grade this out in my mind and hopefully the way that I'm expressing it makes some sense to you guys is basically say like what are the odds that wreath  and kispert  have  playable fantasy Value Inn 12 team there's the rest of the way from this moment not that outstanding but what are the odds that they have a nice stretch from some preset date to the end of the season basically the date that the guy in front of them gets out of the way to the end of the season  what are the odds that guy gets out of the way  and then what are the odds that they then step into fantasy value  so for wreath and kiss Bert I think the odds that they people in their way get out of the way is relatively High better than 50/50 call it that ain't on the Blazers eventually pulls the plug on the season and or kuzma slash pool slash Jones at somebody in Washington so combination of them eventually stopped playing for the year I think the odds of those guys shutting her down at some point is pretty high I don't know when mid March late March early April something Toronto here with Turtle I don't think the odds of Jakob shutting down are as high as the other guys which I mean maybe I'm off base but the Raptors are still technically in the mix in a way that the Wizards and the Blazers are not Raptors are five games out of a playoff spot mathematically that should take them I don't know how they're gonna play for the next four weeks but mathematically they shouldn't be eliminated until basically the beginning of April  so like is that a stash that even makes sense to get two weeks out of a backup probably not  but do we see Turtles start to get some games off I don't know  I don't know so I'm less confidence here  that Jacob gets the time off  but  if it happens the upside for his backup is colossal  there's a chance that you see Houston Rockets era Kelly Olynyk  slide into that spot and just sort of be Canada's Hometown hero  it feels like a beautiful story  just be like oh yeah okay Kelly Olynyk you're you know you're not gonna play every second of every game for now but at some point this year we're just gonna let you be you know candidates favorite son this is an expiring contract year for Olynyk  the Raptors would basically be like doing him a solid just say hey go play starters minutes for three or four weeks put up ridiculous numbers go get yourself some more money not the teams don't know what he can do but it would be pretty good I think for him to go out there and go nuts  and this is why in my mind maybe this is the most impressive or most important stash of all because if this one hits  It's a league changer  Kelly Olynyk as a full-time starter is a fourth round or better Corey kissper do Opera is a full-time starter those guys are like eighth rounders or better  that's fine that's playable and useful but it's not different making yeah I mean upward difference making  so yeah I think the odds of this one happening maybe more like 10 to 20% but the odds of it being good if it happens is like a 100  and the last one is one that I keep kicking back and forth and I felt like I wanted to put him on this list just so that we could talk about it and that's Santi aldama who  three weeks ago I thought had a really nice shot to just be a fan of fantasy value but it's been as having been guaranteed in a way that I thought they would be I meant I handicapped that one wrong I thought that when the Grizzlies went into sort of early silly mode that Alamo would just get 33 minutes a night he has not there have been a bunch of games in there where he just played like 22 23 minutes  doesn't really make any sense to me  and you can point to the last three games and say look Dan I'll Thomas averaging 29 minutes a game over the last three weeks and he's outside the top 150 and I'd say yes you're right about that but there's a few things that are at play that we are somewhat confident  very hopeful but also what confident will change  over the last month if you want to extend it a little bit further I'll dhamma is shooting 50% at the free throw line and over the last three weeks because of really one or two really bad games he's shooting 43% at the free throw line  that's a negative that will generally be a small negative he's not a good foul shooter but if we get him back to and I've said this before in the show we need him to get back to last year's percentages  this year's percentages are not acceptable  43% from the field 59.7 from the free throw line no chance he could have fantasy value shooting under 60% at the free throw line last year he was at 47% from the field 75% of the free throw line and yes he was alongside better players around him when he was putting up those better percentages but I just sort of refused to believe that he's a 4360 guy 43% is 60%  the nice thing about aldamas that if he does play 30 minutes he can be one steal and one block and two three-pointers and six plus rebounds  and three plus assists  and 12 to 15 points so like a lot of things that he can do that are really interesting but the question is we know the percentages are going to be ankle weights we just don't know how heavy how heavy are the ankle weights  and I don't know  I can't know  we can guess but he hasn't been in the NBA long enough for us to be like yes we know for sure that this is going to be the case  the reason that I'll Obama's back on this board is that when JJJ is out his minutes seemed much more locked in JJ was in he had a 22 minute game why just one play that great yanked him  which is actually not true he's a plus 11 in that game yanked him anyway JJ was out guaranteed 30 plus minutes  lower usage than expected which is all been a thing that I'm like trying to squinting at like what do we what What's Happening Here  so there's a few things going on with aldama he's not my favorite stash on this board now that we're sort of approaching you know or a couple weeks out from the trade deadline now where we're moving towards Silly Season instead of trade season  which one are we gonna get  it's pretty I'm uneasy about it because every week he just continues to shoot 42% or Worse from the field and every week he continues to not hit any free throws and I'm just like I  are you this guy now  so let's be clear short version is if Obama is just this guy now a 42 or 43% shooter who can't break 75% of the foul line or can't break 65% of the foul line  cast him off into the ocean doesn't matter how many minutes he gets he wouldn't have fantasy value in nine cat can't do it not with those percentages  not unless he suddenly started taking 18 shots a game and you're just like all right whatever grin and bear it because he's now at 206 and 4 guy with one one in the three  sure fine but that ain't happening  but if he dials it back all the way back to 2022 to 2023 all the way back to last year he does then belong on rosters because he shoots 47 and 75 field goal free throw  on a higher usage on 30 some odd minutes with JJJ out at some point  then he would have value  the question is  are you able to sit on it until then  and I'd say eh  it's probably hurting more than he's helping right now when the minutes are bouncing around  I'd rather play Kiss but  I'd rather play a Linux if he's healthy enough
