welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  all right there's the end of the jam I thought about jumping in a little bit early but come on once you get to the earthquake part you gotta just gotta just let that suck a roll  good day everyone this will be the usual 25 ish minute episode of fantasy NBA today this is one of our bonus ones we're doing I'm hoping all season long provided I can find the content for it it's by low time week 7 in the association yeah it's the n Season tournament stuff but our bios are still High shows those are a full seasoned attack it does not have anything to do with streaming this week we are ignoring schedules this is all about isolating player value based off of performance up to this point  against performance going forward  I am Dan best person this is a sports ethos presentation Sports ethos.com eat those fantasy PK on Twitter I am of course over on social at Dan best person please take a moment to like rate subscribe and join our delightful Sports ethos Discord I've mentioned that a number of times here lately there is a very obvious and quite reasonable set of circumstances as to why we're talking about Discord more and the big reason is  um Twitter's probably gonna die in like the next I don't know eight months 12 months two years at some point it's happening and we just want to make sure that you guys all have a place to go so there's the link up on your screen it's in the show description as well come hang out with us there I'm gonna leave that up for the next little bit while I throw the Bi-Lo board in behind me here we are by Lowe's for weeks seven I added a few new features to this one I thought it might be kind of fun for us to do the following which is look back at what happened last week  this is not the full list of those that are watching it's a two-page recap but I thought it might be kind of fun to see how the Bilo Rex went from the previous week and basically what that might mean for us going forward so last week Jaron Jackson Jr remained the biggest Bilo on the board he actually has seen an uptick he went from number 97 last Tuesday afternoon he's now at number 75 on Yahoo that's a nice little bump there's more to come Jaylen Brown was also on our board last week I knew that was going to be a harder one because he scores a lot and those guys are always tougher to get but he also got better went from 98 to 79 DeMar DeRozan was on the board last week I think he was like 65 and now he's at 68 so basically effectively no change week over week Julius Randle was on the board last week not a guy that I ever targeted under almost any circumstances but he also went up with a better week from 215 to 183 OG Anna nobe did nothing last week he was like 106 now he's at 109 no one 11 so again basically no change and then Jalen Williams a slight uptick from about 100 to about 90 not a massive jumper you know JJ and brown saw the bigger leaps but Jalen Williams also did have a couple of good games against the Lakers and then their last one that weird one against the Mavericks he had a bigger scoring output  we still think when I say we I Royale we that's I I still believe that Jalen Williams will see his steals increase  and that's going to be the reason that you can actually go get him or you'd want to go get him as he continues to climb the board these are the repeat names from last week OG is still a buy-low DeMar DeRozan is still a buy-low because those guys really didn't change week over week and then I also thought it'd be worthwhile for me to put this on the list there's still more room to go on Jalen Williams and JJ even though those guys have already started to Trend up and yes it'll be harder to pull off the trade now because they've each had a couple of good ball games the price tag on them is going to get higher I still think the price tag is worth the swing  you know we're last week it was like the most obvious calls on Earth this week it's a little bit less obvious but I still think that there's value on those guys and so they can you can affectively call them repeat by Lowe's but I didn't want to spend a bunch of time on them since we talked about JJ and Jayden Williams last week and then again on the repeat list OG DeRozan those guys didn't really move week over weeks so I still think that there's some built-in value there especially if Chicago blows it up but frankly even if they only get rid of Zach LaVine you'll see tomorrow start to improve and more than anything we just know Demars free throw percent is gonna go up it's very low right now and you're like oh damn it's only like 4% lower yeah that's a big deal for someone whose value is pretty heavily tied up in his free throw shooting his fantasy value is not based entirely on that but that's a big reason why it's in there but let's go ahead and get to one of the first names on this week's board and that first player is Demars teammate  Mr Zach Levine  who is currently ranked number 80 in nine cat he is out with air quotes for a sore foot which I think  is sort of the worst kept secret on Earth that he's actually just out because he's on the trade block and they don't want his sore foot which is probably real but they don't want to get any worse I'm gonna take that Discord link off the board now  so they're just  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you

available in all locations  letting it go  like I don't I do think that he has a sore foot I don't want to say that that's completely made up but I don't think I like I think he could be playing through it if they if they really wanted to but the smart thing The Prudent thing to do is what they're doing right now and that's giving him some time off and at the end of this sort of weak reevaluation which would be coming up like  could he get into their next ball game on Wednesday yeah it's a possibility  do I think he will know I think they probably give him a little bit longer but I think they'll probably let him get out there and play from time to time while he remains on the trade block and  that's all well and good I don't think it's gonna do much to this Buy Low and frankly this is a Bi-Lo on the idea that he's probably going to get moved  by the way I'm going off of Yahoo's numbers today I think basketball monster has Levine in the mid-70s  you can look at the numbers and you can say Zach Levine is not all that far off from usual which is close to accurate but not entirely the big thing with Levine that I personally feel is the reason why he makes the Bilo board in addition to the fact that his return is somewhat nebulous and we don't really know what the this situation is with his foot and blah blah blah blah blah  he's way down in field goal percent from three from the field whatever you want to chalk it up and because of that he's just not doing as much he's not shooting his often  he's hitting less of his shots he's at 44% that's the lowest for him in five years basically since he's been in Chicago he's been much closer to 50 he was at 50 won in the 72 Game season 48 the year after that last season he was at 48 and a half 409 I don't even need him to get back up to 18 shots a game I don't know that that necessarily happens I just need him to get back to where he was in shooting numbers  and it's quite conceivable that the foot could be a part of that  it's also quite conceivable that a couple of bad shooting games for him have kind of artificially depressed the number he came out of the last ball game was a blowout loss he only played 24 minutes  overall he's been above 36 closer to 37 minutes in the game's that aren't blowouts and his numbers are not all that far from his career mark  so I just don't see the reason to be in full panic over Levine and anywhere he gets traded he's going to have a pretty reasonable role somebody that wants him is going to want to deploy him and so I do believe that for Lovin You can expect him to move up the board not like a rocket boost from 80 to 30 or something like that but I do think that 80 to 55 is a pretty reasonable Target for him and if you're looking at basketball monster he's already at 71 so getting to 55 from there is actually very easy that's a couple of decent ball games and frankly once he gets to a new place whatever that might be or if the Bulls somehow end up playing him through this and you see the field goal percent tick up by even 2% points along with that you'll see the scoring uptick you'll see it ever so slight increase in three pointers it all just comes with a few more shots over the span of a week or a month going in but the real reason at like most people are not selling on Levine because of the field goal percent or that he's likely lower than where they expected him to be most people that would be selling on Levine are worried about how long he's going to be shut down and that's reasonable  but I think you have an opportunity to go get a guy who can be a top 60 top 50 five type of player for pretty close to what his current rank is  which is kind of cool because normally you have to overpay for guys that can score and right now I don't think you need to I think you could go get Zach LaVine for most of the guys that are ranked right near him  Yakima turtle is Right nearby you could probably get him for turtle you could probably get him for his teammate which if you wanted to I don't know that I would Kyle kuzma is ranked almost the exact same  it's not that much separating those guys right now but I certainly think that Levine has a better  full season than kuzma does  or if you want to go down the board just to tiny bit look for a bigger name like a brand in Ingram whose fantasy profile is not that different than Levine's the way that the thing that folks don't notice is that Levine hits an extra one to one and a half three pointers a game and it's better free-throw shooter you can kind of slip that under the radar I think there are some guys you could use that have named power that I don't think are headed all that far up the board that might get it done Devin vassell after a good ball game would be one to try killed in Johnson after his next big ball game would be one to try I do think there's a way to get Zach LaVine pretty cheap right now and so he's the first name on the board  and Johnson is the next name on the board and this is a little bit of a dumb one and the reason that this is a little bit of a dumb one is because cam Johnson was actually ranked lower two weeks ago and I think it was on our board two weeks ago but he still there  because I don't think that people and I he wasn't going to go on here except I put that question back out into the social ether on like Wednesday or Thursday of last week and I was like who's been your most frustrating draft pick and someone was like cam Johnson wait a minute  what have I not seen Happening Here  okay I know he missed you know two weeks so he's only at 12 games and a lot of the NBA is at 18 or 19 I get it but like what really is people's problem with Cam Johnson so far on the season he's averaging 15 points 6 rebounds three assists just under a steal only 29 minutes field goal percent is 45 and a half free throw is 83 okay I don't see a whole lot wrong with that but then maybe we could dig a little bit deeper over the last two weeks he's averaging 16 and a half points 2.73 6.8 rebounds four assists he shooting 50 and a half percent from the field still in the low 80s at the free throw line  but I don't know that anybody's even really noticed the difference  because it's pretty subtle  0.8 rebounds one assist one and a half points  and then the better field goal percent which no one ever pays attention to and that was all it took to get him from the season numbers which put him  basketball monster is around 90 Yahoo is at 89  the  the weird thing here I think is that nobody even really noticed that he's been much better than that 90 Rank and is just these little tiny tweaks in a few categories the field goal percent was a little better the rebounds the points they're all just a little bit better but guys moves so fast in this range going from 90 to 505 doesn't take all that much and the beauty part with Cam Johnson is that  there's room to grow  because the Steels haven't even really come around yet and he's typically a guy who gets you one or more steals per ball game and he's not even at that number  also worth noting over the last two weeks is minutes are above 30 not by a lot 30 and change but trending upward as he gets fully recovered from his call It season opening injury but he got hurt pretty early in the year much like last season  so because of all of that I still feel like he's being treated like a top 90 guy even though he's been playing like a top 60 guy for two weeks because nobody's even really noticed the difference so I think your end Target for him is around 60 I think the buy low price range for cam Johnson I would go as high as 75 but you might not even have to go that high and again there's like all this wiggle room and what an actual rank means but guys between 75 and 90 right now that have some name power that might get it done we just mentioned a few of them Devin of a cell I think cam passes him  Kelvin Johnson I think Camp passes him  I think you could actually get more then cam Johnson for Brandon Ingram because he's scoring 24 points of ball game that would probably almost definitely get it done Jaylen Duran at 91 would get it done I know there's a lot of Jalen Duren love I have some as well but I do think that he's sort of come back to earth he probably is a little bit better than 91 all the guys behind Camp Johnson I don't know how many would get it done Jeremy Grant probably not although he's hurt right now so maybe Dennis Schroder is at 100 but people might think of the seven assists per ball game they might give up untrue for cam Drew holiday who I actually think is more of a by low but I think I'd rather have Cam Johnson he's in there Malcolm Brogden who's been great but just doesn't do everything  there are a lot of players you could float for cam Johnson right now buddy hield would be an interesting one because he's been playing well since he moved into the Indy starting lineup but there's no guarantee that that's a thing that sticks long term even though he'll just been you know top 40 since moving into the starting five  if you have fears that he gets pulled out of the starting lineup or traded or whatever now be another one you could try to flip out there anyway still think there's room to grow on cam Johnson so even though from two weeks ago when he was already a Buy Low he's very much a hit from that show I think you could do even more with him  next name on the board is Walker Kessler who I didn't think was gonna be able to make this list because he came back from his injury and he was playing pretty well but so they still haven't moved him into the starting five over Omer yurt 7  and that to me is reason why people are getting a little bit  I don't think God for any reason but a little bit nervous that he's just gonna like permanently be 2425 minute bench guy behind Omer  first of all I don't think that's gonna be the case second of all Kessler's been running top 65 since he came back from his injury and that's in only 25 minutes per ball game  so there's obvious room to improve  he's currently ranked one 15 overall on the year in nine cat despite the recent surge if you want to call it that and I think there's an easy path for him to get to top 50 or better  but the beauty of Walker Kessler's I think you could still get him for someone in the 75 to 100 range so yes obviously he's more expensive now than he was at the beginning of the year when we didn't know what the hell was going on with him but there's a lot of players and we just talked about them for cam Johnson that could almost definitely get you walk or Kessler  now the player that has him this is not a sure bet someone that has him might be smart and might notice that he's been top 65 even while coming off the bench and think there's just no way I'm gonna sell him for anything less than 65 in such a case I think you could still consider going to buy on Kessler with like a Clint capela he's exactly number 65 his fantasy profile is extraordinarily similar but without any upside  Terry Rozier is running hot right now with lamelo ball out he might get it done Yusuf nurkic I think is running at about as good as he's gonna get in Phoenix because his job will get a little bit smaller when Bradley Beal comes back he's not going to change it all that much but he's at 61 Trey Murphy if somebody's super excited about his first couple of ball games that probably won't make it happen  who's much 72 would almost definitely get it done  but if you can do it for cheaper try to do it for cheaper  try to do it for  all those guys I just mentioned Ingram or Kelvin Johnson a cell or  I don't know if I mean Mitchell Robinson is very similar to Kessler but shoots 39% at the free throw line like that's all in a number that could get a little bit better my Conley at 77 probably not exciting enough to get it done Jabari Smith Jr has been playing well lately maybe that gets the job done but maybe you could pair him with someone oh I would not go jaka portal because he's been running top 50 but there's again a lot of names that I think would get this thing done and for Kessler we're already seeing 65 Off the Bench if they flip it and he starts playing 28 29 30 minutes of ball game we saw it at the end of last year he's top 40 or better  if he clears 30 minutes somehow Walker Kessler could easily be a third rounder  and at the end of last season he was a second rounder  so that's not completely out of the question  he's still alive even after this recent stretch of slightly better play because I think there's even more room to improve  and then finally in this dude was the cover art on this particular show is Keegan Murray who in my opinion might be the easiest bible call I see on the board right now he's 106 on basketball monster he's won a one on Yahoo his numbers are being artificially deflated by a game or two where he's left part way last night's game he left went to the locker room actually came back and finished it up I love this steals this year from Murray I love the increase in rebounds this year I love his opportunity this year at 12.3 shots per game the only thing I don't love about Keegan Murray so far is that he shooting 39% which to me feels like a number that's probably not going to be the full-time number  because right now last season he shot 41% from downtown this year he's at 31%  last year 45% from the field as we just mentioned this year 39 his minutes are up from 29 and change to 32 and change I love it steals have moved up with the minutes rebounds of moved up with the minutes assists of moved up with the minutes the only thing that hasn't really gone up is scoring from 12.2 to 12.9 but the reason behind that is because he's making fewer shots per attempt  that's called a lower field goal percent if the field goal percent the three-point the two-point whatever if that inches up even a little bit he goes racing past his current Mark and if he gets all the way back to 45% from the field last year and all the way up near 40 from three like last year you're talking about to do who's now heating close to 33 pointers a game who sees his scoring go up by another probably two-ish points per ball game and now you're talking about 15 six and two with 1.7 defensive stats almost three three-pointers and percentages that aren't really harming you that's a guy that's inside the top 70 but I don't believe he's being valued as a guy inside the top 70 and so I think you can probably get him for someone in the 80 to 105 range which again these are these players I keep talking about  Malcolm Brogdon is ranked very close to Keegan Murray on the year I would rather have Keegan Murray  the Anthony Melton I would rather have Keegan Murray Dennis Schroder I would rather have Keegan Murray  Bruce Brown I'd rather have Keegan Murray  cam Johnson that's close I might rather have Cam Jalen Williams it's close I might rather have Jalen Williams also  uh let's see who else is would get it done keldon Johnson rather have Keegan Murray  even Devon for sale I think I'd rather have Keegan Murray these guys now you're getting up near 80  I don't think you should have to go much past that though he's ranked again outside the top 100 no matter where you're looking  and somebody's going to be getting a little bit annoyed with the back injury and the in and out of the locker room and whatever else is going on with him  but to me he's the guy where we've got at least two and a half to three rounds of value over where he's currently sitting possibly even more than that based on some of what we've seen with his fantasy profile and his increase in usage this year  at the expense of world's most boring fantasy player Harrison Barnes  and that's your board ladies and gentlemen that's your Bi-Lo board for week seven I'm hoping that that was somewhat instructive we don't have and as the season goes you probably will have to be sort of slicing at the edges a little bit more but there were a couple of names on that list for sure that you guys can buy low on some of them as we mentioned the repeat offenders from weeks past some of them like DeMar DeRozan and Ogden and Obi are still relatively affordable some like JJ and Jalen Williams are a little bit more expensive because they're already starting to hit but this is how you find little improvements and the fun thing about Walker Kessler is that you can trade  a center with a similar profile but less upside to probably get him today  I think those last two names I think those were the last two on the list right I think those last two names are probably the ones you want to attack the hardest because I also think that they're have the biggest room for improvement and also might at the same time be the easiest one to do  I'm gonna say one question here Point Blank Mitch says I wish Dan can tackle James Harden on the Bi-Lo as well so here's the thing about James Harden  his number 34 in nine cat already  I don't think you can really Buy Low on him after a couple of decent ball games which is basically what he's done Harden has been doing more pretty much every single game since coming to the Clippers and his last three ball games he has 12 3 points 26/18 and 21 points 67 and 9 assists he has seven steals over those three ballgames he's made 11 out of 12 free throws he's shooting around 50% for those games he's just not a Bi-Lo right now even if you think he ultimately has better season numbers than where he is at this moment which I think is quite reasonable because at 34 you know he's a guy that can easily be better than that but if you're like just looking at the last week he's number nine  he's a first rounder over the last week of basketball  so that's very much not a Buy Low Point Blank mesh I'm sorry to bring you the bad news on that one if anything he's a sell high for when the field goal percent takes a little dip but again you're talking about slim slim margins there oh that's why James Harden isn't on the Bi-Lo board anymore is because he's been playing too well the last week week and a half  and whoever has him is gonna be like this is great I'm just gonna ride this out this dude is more efficient than usual his numbers are not like the assists or not eye-popping right now at like seven and some odd over that stretch but you know 22 points 7 assists for boards four three pointers over two steals a game on 51.92 splits again that's a first rounder even in a small sample size so that's not a guy that somebody's gonna be letting their grip loose on for an affordable price  sorry to be the bearer of bad news on that one but he's not a Buy Low and frankly the only I think guy on the Clippers who write now might be considered to buy low is Paul George who was better in their last ball game but he's seen himself fall from mid first round to mid second round because he's cooled off over the last week week and a half Kawhi Leonard has been pretty solid over that stretch overall and you know opponents have played a role in this but kauai's number 15 over the last week and then Paul George is down at number 79 because he hasn't been able to hit his throw a stone in the ocean basically and he's about one steal over the last week of basketball but again I don't know like say he got off to such a hot start the player that hasn't might not even have noticed that he's cooled off so I don't think there's a Bi-Lo on anyone on the Clippers right now but believe me when it pops up if it pops up  we'll be talking about it  all right that's your Bi-Lo show everybody no questions on this one we reserve those for the the general recap shows which will be firing up about 10 minutes from now so make sure to loop back around subscribe to the YouTube page so you don't miss this show that's coming up after this one we'll have a cell high tomorrow and I'd like to debut if timing works will debut a brand new Dynasty focused episode with Mark Camaro which I'm hoping we can do on Thursday he'll give us sort of like the quick 15 to 20 minute these are the dynasty changes I'm not gonna be talking that much on that show because you all know I don't do a ton of Dynasty but we'll get an expert on we'll pick his brain that'll be a lot of fun I've got all these really fun show ideas that I really want to get going and it just comes down to time all right everybody thanks again like rate subscribe  you guys know the deal we'll see you guys in a few minutes
