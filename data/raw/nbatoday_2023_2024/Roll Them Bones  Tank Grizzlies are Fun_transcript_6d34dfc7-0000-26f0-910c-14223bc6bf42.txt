welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast well we're really coming down the Chute now aren't we  I've had a chance to kind of Catch My Breath today after yesterday was just a harrowing Adventure in children and doctor appointments  and now I kind of like  reopen my eyes and I know that I only felt like my my  physical being here kind of missed one day yeah I wasn't I was there yesterday but I wasn't there yesterday  and now I'm back and  it's crazy to think that we have this short card tonight short medium a shmedium  we've got Mega game tomorrow  off Saturday and mega game again on Sunday and that's it  that's the freaking NBA regular season just done by the way you guys should know I apparently said the word freaking in yesterday's podcast and my kid the one who was home from school yesterday with strep throat a came in from one room over after the show and it was like that you said a bad word on that show I was like I don't think I did I try to keep these shows pretty damn clean he's like you said Fri and I was like did I say freaking  it's like yeah you did it's like well  son that's what growing up say when we don't want to swear but you still can't say it I mean maybe you could no one really cares that much  anyway here's what happened yesterday we got time because we got what a game card to recap yeah we're so close to the offseason now I'm starting a channel offseason Dan offseason Dan for those of you that don't know does not get straight down to business in season Dan gets straight down to business because there's usually so many basketball things that I want to talk about and I don't want to blow for five minutes on some random BS  which then turns like a 45-minute pod into a 50-minute pod offseason time every show is about 22 to 28 minutes sometimes we squeeze up into the 30s so if I want to talk about crap for five minutes I just do it anyway hello everyone this is fantasy NBA Today coming down the Chute Sports ethos.com presentation I'm your host Dan best person thanks as always for tuning in all season long if there is even one new listener or viewer out there I tip my cap to you I say welcome and also I say sorry because you're coming in at a time when I just wax on about whatever I want to talk about and if you're coming in and you're like Dan I want brass tacks right now you're probably not gonna get the brasses of taxes we still got stuff to talk about we still gonna review all the card I'll even throw those on the screen just so you guys know that it's coming but  I feel like I need you guys to know what my yesterday was like  maybe I'll try to remember to do it in the middle of the show let's talk yesterday's card real quick here not that quick regular speed Memphis  losers at Cleveland  but you know who wasn't a loser in this game  Grizzly's replacement player fantasy values  friends were finally there now with the small caveat that Jordan Goodwin sat this one out and I believe from looking at the numbers following all the various Twitter's is out there I believe that Jordan Goodwin has the eligibility to play in the Grizzlies final three two sorry two ballgames which is the Lakers  tomorrow and then the nuggets on the last day of the regular season so assume  for fantasies arguments sake that Jordan Goodwin is back for their last two  he parachutes in he takes Lamar Stevens spot  most likely in that starting lineup maybe takes Jake laravia spot hard to know  but the good news is that the Grizzlies have now eliminated all relevant humans  from their lineup  and so you've got full  replacement player  max minute stuff going on this is what you want to know this is what you want to see  replacement players typically don't have the world's greatest fantasy value by and large they often struggle with it but one thing that we've talked about on this show is that if you get somebody up around 40 minutes of ball game it kind of doesn't matter how good their fantasy value is they're probably still gonna have some  and that's what you saw on this ball game and it's what you've seen in the Grizzlies last two or three ball games in a row now Scotty Pippen Jr for instance he's playing 3536 minutes a night okay maybe he doesn't have the most robust fantasy line on planet Earth but I honestly don't care because with the minutes as high as they are he's doing enough  looking at the last couple of ball games for Scottie Pippen Jr he's a third 20 you know me go back four ball games if you want 29 30 31 and 36 minutes as basically full-time starter now over that span for one he has 12 steals in those four ball games so he's averaging three ball game he does have two blocks so half a block a game he's averaging just under six assists a game about four and change rebounds any scoring 1624 14 18  40 504 72 divided by four is what 18  I think that puts him on 18 points a game and almost two three-pointers and  good field goal or free throw percent  field goals get a fluctuate but I started don't care and the thing is this dude is still very available  across most League types  he's only up to 13% roster right now and it's seems nuts because there's really nobody coming for this job for the final two games and you could have basically gotten in the last three or four games if you know we acted fast enough and I think we did at the beginning of it was this week said yeah get in on him for the back-to-back he shot horribly in the first half of it but who cares he had 14 7 and 5 with 5 defensive stats in that one  he's cruising right now and he's putting up stuff in every statistical category  yeah I wish the turnovers was lower than like three and a half but you know I need to do what you got to do  on top of Scottie Pippen Jr I also mentioned that Jordan Goodwin is someone I would like it I that I do for their last two ball games trade Jameson I mentioned as someone that I thought was gonna be a bit iffy he's not a great fuel goal percent Center he rebounds a bit he did have four blocks in this game which is wholly unrepeatable but you know if you want to sort of flash in the pan it on him for blocks  I still don't think that I would do it  GG Jackson know he's just it's all scoring it's too much tied up in scoring  and Lamar Stevens know because I think Goodwins gonna take his smile spot and then Jake Laurie is the other one who had eight three-pointers  we've kind of seen him get lava hot a couple of times happening against the Lakers whatever was two three weeks ago but in between their kind of hasn't really been enough let's see here let's go to the Jake laravia game log just to make sure that this all makes sense so you set out a couple of ball games with an ankle tweak yeah I mean he was he was brutal before that he'll get you some steals a couple of rebounds free throw percent is okay  but the field goal percent has been awful so no pass on laravia so give me Scotty Pippen Jr and give me Jordan Goodwin and that's probably about as far as I go with the Grizzlies unless you're sort of category hunting and we've talked about that before Jackson GG would give you points Jameson would give you some rebounds but I just I feel like there's a better option for rebounds out there anyway  Cavs had the starting five that they wanted in this ball game Donovan Mitchell Evan Mobley Jared Allen  Darius Garland Max Drews thank you can start all five of those guys and most formats is the only one that's kind of borderline  and he's been his legs are up just a bit more underneath him right now so I would lean towards yes in most formats but if you don't need well that's a thing like with stress okay he's not gonna blow the roof off the building and scoring but he's gonna get you a couple of Threes he's gonna get you if you rebounds usually a couple of assist not as many in this ball game and he just plays enough minutes most nights in you know slightly more competitive ballgames where he'll get a few assists Steals and blocks yeah well Trey young came back for the Hawks we'll start on the lower half of that box score but they lost oops  um  no dejounte Murray I think they probably thought they could win this game with him  and at the same time it kind of doesn't matter  because the Hawks are a game and a half back of the Bulls I mean maybe they could have if they played even anything close to acceptable they probably could have  stolen home court in the first elimination game  problem of course is that the Hawks are terrible  like the 10 seed in the west is 9 games over 500  and the 10 seed in the East is 8 games under 500  that's crazy  what did I just say eight and a half game Separation on the 10 seeds in the two conferences like the West is so ridiculously deep the top 11 are all good teams and The Grizzlies will be good next year because they'll be healthier  you got 12 like legitimately good teams in the Western Conference and you've got 8  in the east  and then even on top of that you just like the whatever we had this remember at the beginning of the Season it was like oh maybe these is gonna be good enough this no  no let's just still thumping them  anyway as far as the Hawks go so Trey young came back he was on a pretty strict minutes Gap he did have a double-double in 21 minutes but you know you can play him because he's trying Young  presumably you can go Trae young you can go dejounte Murray when he's back if Jalen Johnson plays you would go his route all so there was no DeAndre hunter in this game either so beat crunchy had 19 points this is a real mess of a game  dump it dump the Box on the Atlantis side don't dump the Box on the Charlotte side though because they continue to roll with Grant Williams as Center he was in foul trouble in this game 5,026 and a half minutes it still had a pretty good fantasy line  so give me Grant Williams give me Brandon Miller give me miles Bridges as the three guys you can start in basically any format Trey man at a seven steal game which very much floated his value he is more of a rebounds assist steals kind of low end play for the most part and basilia mitsch is as cool substantially he'll still get you probably four to ten assists somewhere in that very wide window but he and Trey man I still don't have full faith are nine cat guys  but again we're talking about you know two three games for most teams at this point just two left for Charlotte so you know really need a full-time nine cat guy as we Rumble along the Mavericks really ending their season strong they've won five games in a row they're up to 50 wins now and just a game back of the clippers for perhaps grabbing the home court in the first round of the playoffs so those teams are basically locked into playing each other right now again  Clippers limping into it  Mavericks  Freight training their way into that first round playoff battle it the basketball monster has Kyrie Irving Luca Dodge listed as doubtful for Dallas is next ball game they've got Detroit  it doesn't matter  as they're two and a half games up on the pals with two games to go so again worst I think the  I guess they could tie I'm supposing Mavericks have the tiebreaker there I admit I don't know that off the top of my head but they locked in where they are and if either of the superstars sits you can get a Tim Hardaway Junior fill in game PJ Washington goes from being kind of borderline to a yes and those are your two changes their  the Heat  apparently need terrorism or more than we realize now they're just not that good  they went through a nice run in kind of the middle of the year but now they've settled back into that just like a little bit better than average kind of team there I mean they'll be fine and you'll see we'll see how if they can crank it up for the playoffs again  regular season just doesn't mean anything to Miami  no I'm not playing Caleb Martin as a filling for Taro zero it's too risky just go hero Butler and Bam call it a day  bam was awful man Mavericks just picked centers apart it's brutal trying to chase Luca and then Kyrie all game long  spread you out and then they wax ya  Toronto lost in a game that was more competitive than it should have been Toronto had a manual quickly and a bunch of guys that you probably just heard of a week ago  I would assume that Toronto has Gary Trent RJ Barrett Kelly Olynyk back for one of their next couple of ball games but I guess we don't really know for sure he played tomorrow they play Sunday it's both games in Miami  nothing really for those guys to prove necessarily so I don't know for a fact that the regulars will be back but might as well mine as well I say  do you like what's it what difference is gonna make Raptors are 25 and 55 they're five games better than the Hornets  and they're you know seven eight games worse than the Raptor so they're not going anywhere in the Eastern Conference and then if you look at the West the Grizzlies are the only team close in terms of like could the Raptors accidentally get better then the Grizzlies Lottery odds unlikely  they can very much play hard for one of those two games and not worry about it so maybe you see the regulars in the first one if they lose it Raptors are locked into whatever I said that was 8th worst record know  six the worst record in the NBA so then they could play their guys not have to worry about it so that's what we hope is going to happen mean time with everybody out they're still wasn't another guy who put up a value and don't get me started on gradey dick 24.63 is fine but he literally did nothing else  Malik Williams at 7:14 but only 240 so basically you win a manual quickly in this game  and then you'll play Trent in a Linux and nine cat if they're back for the next one  and RJ Barrett in points leaks if he's back for the next one  we've been waiting for Brooklyn to shut some people down for a while and it might finally be happening but there's still this sort of like partial shutdown thing that happens because Mikhail Bridges doesn't want to break his consecutive game streak so he still played a half of this one  cam Johnson got 27 benchman it's here and and they're trying some stuff cam Thomas still played 37 minutes Nick slacks and still played 33 minutes that is still played 36  so we're not all the way there and those of you that were trying to Ram these square peg that was trying to watch for through the round hole that was consistent fantasy value got a rude awakening late late  keep an eye on Noah Clowney had a seven block game here which is uh well you can't ignore it that's for damn sure but what I don't know is if the Nets are gonna have any kind of lineup consistency for their next couple of ball games so I don't think I'm racing out to pick him up I think if this is the roster they're trotting out you probably bench Mikhail Bridges because I don't think he's playing full games right now  connect Claxton really not get arrested him here down this time all right I guess you play Dennis Schroder you play Claxton until it looks like they're gonna get any kind of minute shaving and then you know watch Noah Clowney at the very least for the next one  see what they've got  I don't know  Spurs sat when be and then this game ended fast yowza Trey Jones still had a serviceable fantasy games at Collins was decent in his Wembley job and everybody else was absolutely horrendous including friend of the Pod Julie Anne champagne he had five and three with a stealing a block but couldn't shoot I stick with him and I think the game was more competitive all these guys would have had another eight or nine minutes so give me Trey Jones give me Wendy give me champagne and then if we sits another one you can go Collins and you can probably still go champagne and hope that the game is more competitive  there's a little bit of a wing in a prayer there  Josh Getty stuffed it in my face I called his Fantasy game Trash with the team is healthy and he was like screw you Dad I'm gonna get a double-double all right well done Josh well you're still terrible on the whole season and I'm not gonna change the valuation there this team is she it's Jalen Williams and his head homegrown jet played 15 minutes in the game that ended in in less than a half of basketball this is an exhibition  Milwaukee the new look Milwaukee Bucks  took care of the Orlando Magic we can do the magic fast call Anthony had 23 Off the Bench I don't care Mark Hill faults played 22 minutes I don't care Jalen Suggs playing well good keep him going Paulo points League Franz when he comes back if he comes back did he get rolled up for the rest of the regular know I don't think they officially did that yet Jonathan Isaac minutes tipped back down to 13 again though  this is the  I can't think of a clean word to use  my brain keeps wanting to go to one specific word and I don't want to say it this is basically let me just read will rewind the tape and try that sentence again this is why you just can't start Jonathan Isaac because as much as I want to and as much as I do have him on a roto venture too I don't know have the confidence to throw him into a lineup because this could happen 13 minutes or five minutes or whatever it was  if there was some sort of way if we could just like put one question to the magic coaching staff hey guys get 20 minutes tonight but we can't alas a lack  so we sit on our thumbs and we wait  as far as the Bucks go Giannis has been read ruled out for the rest of the regular season we do Middleton was going to miss this one on the back to back  meaning a lot of Bobby Portis no surprise there he took 18 shots and had a very efficient and solid ball game more Brooke Lopez he looked good 1044 a steal and three blocks more Dame this is gonna be more like Portland Dame and Patrick Beverley who has  jumped quickly here  took a while for them to get there but has jumped over Malik Beasley for that last starting spot and we all know that when Patrick Beverley is a healthy which is rarely these days because he's old he puts up some serious fantasy lines from that guard spot he's a rebounding guard who gets Steals and often blocks shoots the three not great but okay  typically doesn't overdo it in the offensive side so the bad percentages don't really impact things all that much  and he's got some juice right now because they got a couple games left in the regular season he sort of improve it mode to keep that he wants that starting job they've got a game at OKC they've got a game at or Lando the rest of the way and I think it's pivot back over here I think the Bucks they've got a shot to lock in that two seed with I think one more win so they're gonna be going for it here with or without Giannis and they're gonna be pretty competitive ballgames coming up because the Knicks would like to stay in front of the Cavaliers if at all possible and or the magic and then Orlando is trying to make sure they don't fall into the play in which is yes still a possibility because everybody's all  hyper bunched in the Eastern Conference  so I'm in on it and you guys saw he was the thumbnail for yesterday's podcast I'm in on Patrick Beverley these last couple of ball games I've been a big Pat Bev nine cat fantasy fan for a long time  mostly as a punt points play but this team so thin from on a game to game basis right now specially with no Giannis that he might not even be punt points you might get double digit scoring 10 points is not a punt number it's not good but it would get it done so have at it pat Bev enjoy your week old Fame  Denver beat Minnesota this is this kind of felt like Denver saying yeah not there yet well wolves  they didn't have to do it  although the Nuggets would love the would love some home court throughout the playoffs the 32 and 18 at home wolves are 37 and 14 at home  Thunder 35 and 16 at home not surprisingly those are the three best home records in the Western Conference the three teams that are battling for the one seed  big difference in the three  uh well for one the wolves are 11 games over 500 on the road so you I guess you could argue maybe they need the least  defense translates as they say it's when you're a team that's built a little bit more on defense you're probably gonna have this lightly better road record and that's the wolves are but not by much  and so the nuggets in the Thunder I think these games really mean a lot to them and and so here Denver was like all right wolves see if you can handle us  I was watching Twitter last night because again I was dealing with the situation at home and there was between that went out that was like man if you make a mistake to Denver in the fourth quarter they'll just pop you right in the mouth every time and if somebody who  you guys know I'm a very pragmatic Laker fan I don't go out of my way to draft Lakers and fantasy or anything like that Anthony Davis was gonna be a nice deal this year and he was I thought LeBron wasn't and he turned out to be a pretty damn good fantasy play this year number 25 and missed a few ball games but not an overwhelming number that's LeBron by the way Anthony Davis's number three and he's missed just less than handful here until Kyle Anderson hit him in the face not the point point is I like I saw that tweet and as a Laker fan my heart was just like we feel you Minnesota people right now we feel you because every game between the Lakers and the Nuggets is the same it's closed closed it's closed and then with four minutes left in the game Lakers missed two shots in a row nuggets hit back-to-back threes or three in a layup or whatever it is and it's just like oh you're 2 point deficit yeah you're down seven now sorry  oh you're up by one now you're down eight in you know three possessions later and that's basically what they did to the Wolves yesterday  nuggets they just hang and they hang and they hang and they make sure that they're neck and neck and then they beat you last four minutes of the game they just beat you  if they're locked in on the ball game which I think we can  safely say they were  not read raw shooting game but he's a start as is Mike Conley Rudy gobert Anthony Edwards easy call on the Minnesota side as I told you guys a few times I did not have full confidence in Kyle Anderson this year and now we've kind of seen  why  Payton had six blocks Off the Bench for the Nuggets he doesn't play enough to start not when the team is healthy  but they do know they have a solid backup waiting in the wings should anything happen to a starter or if they have to do anything financially going forward  meanwhile Nicole yolk is just owned this ball game and nothing ever really changes for the nuggets on the fantasy side but shout out to Peyton Watson for having a nice six block ball game Phoenix took care of these zombie Clippers in this one Royce O'Neill started over Grace Allen you're not I wouldn't make the immediate flip there I know that you know they liked what they were getting in this one I think I I'd like to see this  I'm not overreacting basically is what I'm saying but if you want to bend either both of those guys even but basically you're playing whatever dude is starting in that fifth pocket for this Phoenix team  because the five starters are always having that like they play high scoring games and the 5th Guys open all the time forever  so Neato for the Clippers bones Hyland with everybody resting or hurt Kawhi Leonard hurt Hardin resting PG resting zubats I believe resting so you got Mason Plumlee night which is a little surprising that you didn't see more Daniel theis last time Zulu was out there was no clear winner between those two guys so no don't go down that path and then look if all three starters are cooked oh by the way Norman Powell also sat out because I was looking at that remember we were talking about that game yesterday I was like it's got to be Norman Powell doesn't it well then he said it out too so Clippers went full rest mode in this one meaning  like this is one of those times where you probably could have just tried starting every starter but Terrence Mann got hurt early and didn't come back so I kind of ruined that one  Brandon Boston played 40 bench minutes and didn't see that one coming I mean I'm here Coffee started played 37 I mean again you're rolling the dice with these guys because you don't really know what their Fantasy game is like bones at least you were like this dude's gonna take 20 shots at least and he took 29  I wasn't at my computer when all these information was released to the public but yeah because we saw it a couple weeks ago and remembering what am I fantasy matchups where I picked up bones and think he had like a 20.3 steel pop out game and that was with I think Paul George still playing right what that just with hardened Kauai out  I forget in any event when two stars are down for the Clippers bones tends to play and this one three stars and two feature role players were also out so ended up being a relatively easy call and now I feel like since we've gotten to the end of the recap part I can just my yesterday was nuts my yesterday was crazy so um  this is not me asking for your pity or anything like that I just wanted you guys to know  why my show was such a Sprint like yesterday afternoon  um  so woke up in the morning  if we can even call it that my older son was up from like one to four in the morning the previous night not this most recent night but the one before it saying that he was having trouble swallowing we're like all right well this isn't going to be good and so we gave him some Tylenol in the middle of the night gonna wait until that kicked in he felt a little better but he couldn't fall back asleep and he was worried so that was brutal and we're all exhausted and we're getting up and we're getting him ready for school like maybe some could happen he was like I really want to go because they had a field trip to the Natural History Museum yesterday and couldn't go on it so we took I took my older son to the pediatrician at 8 a.m. basically as soon as they opened and the strep test was rapid it was a rapid strap tested was positive very quickly  and the pediatricians like look at it seems like a lot of pharmacies are out of the antibiotic that I want to put him on so I'm going to give them a sort of a different prescription like a different dose and hopefully that'll get it done so then we drove over to the pharmacy now it's like kind of approaching nine o'clock and they told me they didn't have it and they told me there was another one like seven miles away which for those of you in Los Angeles seven miles in the morning rush hour traffic that's a 40 minute drive  it's like in the car and I'm starting that direction and I called my wife who's a doctor and she checked the pharmacy at her at the hospital where she works is very large one and they didn't have it so now we're calling back to the kids pediatrician to say look nobody has it in Los Angeles we need something different or like can you guys help us with this but it's all set up through an answering service now like well they'll get back to within 24 hours I guess that's not gonna work I can't I'm not gonna make my kids sit with strep throat untreated for 24 hours oh by the way while I'm talking about this Jalen Johnson the report is that he's gonna get reevaluated in three weeks and on Yakko Congo was being re-evaluated in four weeks so the Hawks they're cooked man they're gonna lose one of those two play in games those guys are not playing anymore so you can drop Jalen Johnson you can drop on Yakko Kong with you were still sitting on him for any reason that news from Marc Spears that just popped up on the feed oh sorry that came out about 15 minutes ago first my bad dog that was already out there um  so yeah those guys are done  so then  we started to drive back to the pediatrician was like well if I can't get in my phone we're driving back there we're gonna loop back around and right before we got there we got a message back from the pediatrician I was like I changed it okay it's a different it's a different antibiotic you can go back to the same Pharmacy again so now we loop back for the pediatrician's office to the same Pharmacy we were at some 45 minutes earlier after driving around West Los Angeles and they did finally get us the prescription at that point but now it's like 11:00 this whole process is taking three hours  well I give my kid the dose of antibiotic on the poor on the curb in front of a CVS because we don't want to wait any longer and you can go back to school technically 18 hours after you start your antibiotics for strep and I'm thinking if this stuff works as fast as I remember it working he'll feel better by tomorrow which is now today  well one thing I forgot is that my kid hadn't had any appetite and been able to swallow for like the last nine 10 hours and an antibiotic on an empty stomach isn't a great idea so then we had like an hour or a half of intense stomach cramps for my child  and suddenly now it's like 1 p.m. and I'm just finally looking at my computer for the first time so that's why yesterday show was in the afternoon that's why I was super fast and the other part of it was the Beatrice was like  has his younger brother had any symptoms and we're like no I mean he's been like a little bit snuffly but every kid is forever they're always just leaking boogers when they're that age and she's like that go get him bring him in  okay so now  do my show my older son and I who finally is now in the stomach cramped have stopped and he's had a couple of Ritz crackers we drive to the preschool or my younger son is him up go back to the pediatricians office he tests positive asymptomatic positive  and I'm getting ready to go back to the same freaking Pharmacy when the doc is like look it's the same medicine just here I'll give you a different dose give your younger son some from the first bottle I'll call in a prescription for your younger son you can go get that tomorrow which will basically serve like a refill because they're both taking the same thing  and that is how my day was I went to the same pediatrician's office basically three different times the same Pharmacy almost three different times and I drove around West Los Angeles for probably two to three hours  and it sucked but today they're back at school they're feeling great not the younger one actually never had any symptoms at all he was always feeling great but you know now he's on an antibiotic and I got to do a real normal speed show  Tim I'm not ignoring you I think you had a question for me yesterday so I'm gonna I'll do one question at the end of the show I need field goal percent Timbo says three points and blocks  field goal percent the reason blocks that's gonna be an interesting combo your looking for like  Alex Caruso who do you think I should stream today out of Anna nobe Alex Caruso hey that's one of the choices Javonte green herb Jones or Trey Murphy  so your best combination of those three categories this season has been Alex Caruso  herb Jones is possible to get you some blocks more steals than blocks typically and field goal percent is not great for her but the threes are usually their threes will definitely be there for Trey Murphy but the field goal percentage is very up and down and nobody is like kind of similar in my eye to Caruso on this one where you might get all three so I probably lean Caruso if he's in there because this year he has been the best combination of those three categories  frankly Mike among players in the NBA he's been near the top of the board in those  field goal percent blocks and threes  now you're gonna get field goal percent in blocks from a lot of guys  you know most of the big men out there we're gonna give you field goal percent of blocks but not many you're going to give you threes that's outside of like shed homegrown  is that over 50% High blocks guy who also hits three pointers  for Singas I mean we're talking Superstar level guys Myles Turner  and BJJ  those are the guys Scotty Barnes and says feel good I actually wasn't that great Kevin Durant  but as you started trickled down into the guys that are not blocking all the shots then you get to Caruso was out of block 47% shooting in two three-pointers a game  and that's  kind of why that would roll in that direction I'm trying to think what's what's her bad in field goal percent he's at 50 at 0.8 blocks I guess you could go herb I didn't realize this field goal percent was two and a half points better than Caruso hmm  and an OB forty-nine percent threes are good blocks are a little bit lower  Trey Murphy half a block low field goal percent so only the threes there  yeah I mean herb  herb as the other option there is intriguing  hmm  tells play in Sacramento  high octane  Bulls are in Detroit that game should be over early but also a lot of opportunities for blocks and easy buckets  I think I might go Caruso and hope for the extra block  the best blocked guy of those possibilities  all right well that's mean you got some good choices at the very least  again news that broke Jaylyn Johnson out through the rest of this regular season as is on Yahoo those the only things that broke oh France Vagner questionable that just popped here about 15 seconds ago as well  all right everybody thanks for listening again we are one weekday show until we get to next draft season basically but again what is today Thursday is it

a live video show it won't be live on Twitter either so please hear as we're wrapping up the regular season take a moment to go subscribe on a traditional podcast Channel make sure you're downloading those bad boys and also please I mention this the other day the link is in the show description if I helped you at any point this season any point please hit a like or some kind of engagement on the tweet that I sent out three days ago now is about 500 of you that have done it I'm gonna be reaching out to each one of you individually at some point during this offseason because I do have a small favorite ass so please I do beg of you that would mean a lot because I do need your help continue to grow these things and that's going to be one way that we do it  all right have a great way I said
