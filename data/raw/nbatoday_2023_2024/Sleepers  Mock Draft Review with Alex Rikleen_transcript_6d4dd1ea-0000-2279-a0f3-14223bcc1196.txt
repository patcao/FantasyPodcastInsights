welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast yes indeed yes indeed I'm getting better I think at the at the music Crossfade or maybe I'm diluting myself welcome everybody what's happening  it's another episode of fantasy NBA Today sports ethos presentation kind of churning these bad boys out these days and I know my silly YouTube setup it it persists but I do with it what I can  and today we have one of my favorite guests on this show I always I really do okay so I'm actually gonna throw him on the screen right now I gotta say  Alex you and I  we see eye-to-eye on a lot of things I think maybe even Beyond fantasy basketball I don't know that I typically laugh more on a show then we do just talking about fantasy basketball players I don't I don't know how to make heads or tails of that but Alex Ricky on the show welcome back my good man it's always a pleasure to have you  to be here yeah I for some reason this is one of the first times we've actually done this where I've been in my own home and so my memory of our guests pods is just me and my in-laws house like kind of cracking up and a half hour taking an hour because we were enjoying herself yeah I don't know what the heck we're talking about but I always leave the Pod feeling like that was fun I don't remember what the hell we talked about but that was fun you guys can find Alex on Twitter at rickley that's just the last name r i k l e n go hunt him down on social media special with the season right around the corner I say this so often it's a hellscape but you need it for Fantasy Basketball I am at Dan bass over there d a n b e s b r i s there's just things that happen Alex and Rapid Fire and if you're not on Twitter and you're in any kind of first come first serve League someone's gonna beat you to it so um follow a limited number of accounts don't read the replies but do get your fantasy basketball information and you'll you know get out of this thing with your head still on your shoulders but Alex was as per usual part of the preseason industry mock which I'll now throw up in the background for everybody to take a look at and you had the sixth pick and like usual we're gonna go through your team some thoughts on different spots there I might challenge you on a name or two but generally I like to let the guests have the floor on this show and at the end we'll go over a couple of the names that maybe didn't quite get to you that you were hoping would same format as usual but for anybody that hasn't been a part of it in the past that's what we're going  through here so starting at the top Steph Curry at the sixth slot I think the only question I have for you there is I presume you were debating between Steph and Tatum why go with Steph over Tatum I actually wasn't I think Steph over Tatum is a relatively clear call to me other than durability  steps just got Tatum beat and durability matters like you know but it's also hard to predict you know as Josh always says you're you know you're not injury prone until you are in your injury prone until you're not you know come on Looney Miss how many games in his first two seasons and is now like the second most Iron Man player we've got so but I mean Curry's just per game like by any measure that we have a better fantasy producer than Tatum and I'm kind of surprised to see how much the community at large is viewing Tatum as an equal or better player I just kind of don't see it I don't get me wrong I do have Tatum right there in the seven or eight spot but to me is he's not the sixth guy it's Curry there do you think some of that is the the strong gravitational pull towards Head to Head where everybody is extra concerned about getting the additional games out of their top guys I know for me like a roto player I'm usually looking at per game more so but I know nobody's thinking okay who's gonna be upright in my fantasy playoffs or too much of a coin flip  I mean maybe I  that's not how I'm thinking about it when I'm building a head-to-head League this was you know in theory a head-to-head mom yeah so it's possible that that's impacting people I think it's just more the shiny new object you know Tatum is entering his prime if if one of these players is getting better in the other is getting worse it's clear that Tatum's the one getting better um  but  a slight improvement from Tatum and a slight decline from Curry could still have Curry ahead in the per game ranks  your second round coming back and this is you get everybody's gonna get to enjoy me doing my attempted math on the Fly believe this is picking 19  did I do it I think I got it here yeah Devin Booker who I'm a little bit I'm a little bit worried about I mean he's obviously a super safe play because he's gonna score and he's gonna do all of his stuff and he in KD or I would assume kind of a little bit ahead of Bradley be on that club but what's the thought process behind Booker at 19  I just I like Kade  I just I feel like so you know Cade went to picks later it went Booker towns Cade as much as I like Kade  I do feel like I can't just I can't sort of internally justify  someone who were hoping will get there over someone like Booker and Cat who we've already seen it from so he was someone who sort of passed my mind but  I don't know part of it was sort of there was something kind of fun and I'm using to me about starting the draft with players who had like almost identical stat profiles and just to sort of see how that was also a motive in taking Garland at 3 was like these players are all very simple let's keep it going  how Steph and you know 95% of staff and 85% of staff let's keep going  and I did that as long as I could I ran out after three so there was something I did I do but seriously though Steph is a pretty good all around guy who leaves you with a lot of flexibility in what direction to go in the future and I thought that adding book or two that sort of reinforced that while also giving me a pretty comfortable Advantage at least in threes and probably free throw percentage in and hopefully points in assists although I would still need to do some work there I do believe about back is coming for towns but it that's not a given and you know the the addition of Beale could hurt Booker a little bit but you know I'm it's 19th pick I'm not paying top 15 I'm paying top 20 I thought it was fine value it was more safe than trying to hit a home run is kind of where I'm going with this a lot of words to say it felt like the safest option yeah you answered my my follow-up during your answer which was who were the other guys you were looking at and it was basically the guys right after him there yeah and go ahead I'll admit to having been relieved that you took Bridges I was looking at the board I was looking at the board right there and I wanted Booker like I had towns as a second place but I was I wanted Booker and I was getting a little worried he wasn't going to make it to me yeah I'm not appreciate that I'm not sure that I built the wisest team in this one at some point I'm gonna have to break my own very winged heavy top and down I went Tatum Bridges kawaii for my first three picks here and I yeah a lot of a lot of wing not many rebounds not many assists out of those three guys but you cover like all of the peripheral things but you already told everybody who you got in the third round Darius Garland and it does seem like I can't really fight with you here because there are so many bigs available this season you're able to get your guards early lock them in I do think mentally one of the things that that people need to get over is like you take your guards and you think oh I'm way behind everybody else in a big man cat but  you've done that knowing when you're going to try to make that up so beyond just the Garland pick because I feel like Garland is a very reasonable also very safe what do you say 85% of Steph pick what is it about the guard path here for you that just felt like the right opportunity  um  I mean again part of its the players available I have done a lot of as other people who listen to other pods know I've done a lot of Walker Kessler and the third round but was trying to sort of keep things diverse a little bit and  trying to build something a little bit different here  I generally speaking I think that you're much more likely to find a 12 1 2. 1 0 1  and so I am often willing to go guard heavy early on the assumption that not only am I building whatever I'm building in the mid rounds of the draft but also that's going to be the area where I have the easiest time especially if you're active and attentive early in the season hunting waivers  but also I mean  some of the players I got later like Julius Randle is probably a pretty good value in the six in the 5th round danford's probably a pretty good value in the eighth round like there are some of these bigs who are going later than I think I would have designed if I were the king of things your fourth round you did finally end your early season Steph and bro like well I don't we got to come up with a fun name for the this the Stef and also Steph and also Steph it's like a slightly dirtier mirror every time you're extending down infinite a reference that like 10 of your listeners are gonna get the multiplicity movie oh my God the increasing multiplicity plans I remember that movie vividly because there was a kid in my carpool who's now actually our family dentist who loved to quote the line she touched my pepe Steve and so that's like embedded deep in my brain and that I think that was one of the like later multiplicities multiplicity just I I've like never even seen the whole movie my like my group summer camp we had two kids with the same first name and one very clearly kind of followed the other one and our counselor referred to him as the fourth multiplicity clone for kids the first at least he'll compliment yeah at least you'll never be there never get the like early mid-90s reference that was thrown at them though these young Tikes so you went OG by the way in the fourth round I'm thinking along with you here you have three very good guards none of them really well I guess Garland's okay defensively but your team was lacking in steals in a in a pretty reasonable way considering you had guards and big men were probably not going to be the guys that made up for it so I'm assuming number one you like the value number two he provided a stat that your team could use a little boost in how did I do  um  I the only thing you're kind of meant that you left out you did well the only thing you left out at this point we're four rounds in an area shop block has been sentenced point I'm pretty clearly going to be punting that and so someone who is good on defense but specifically Steals and not blocks I like and also all of these guards I have they're they're good scores but also good Shooters and so to have to be as strong in assists and threes as I am without a real anchor from the field was something that I liked and OG kind of kept that going what did he shoot 46% last year 47% last year 46% last year  yeah he's been above 46% three of his three or four years so I liked that element of it as well was I'm building my sort of a monster in three is I'm a monster in free throws and I am at least competitive and field goal percentage despite not having a big sale was there anybody else near that pick that you were considering in the fourth because you had mentioned you're a big Walker Kessler guy he just didn't fit the build for this one he went actually in this draft I was so sad about how late he went but I just I didn't think he fit the bill here it hurt I think I actually like said in the chat that I was offended I was offended that how far everyone else let him fly folks picture this nightmare scenario you're hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of

attack that's fair  I would have loved to have taken Jamal Murray if he had made it to me he went a couple picks earlier oh you really were going for all staffs yeah yeah really wanted to keep it going I considered Jalen Brown who went a few picks later he was probably the other one I had my eye on and I I mean I definitely I looked at Zion I looked at the Hard pivot to including Walker Kessler I didn't I thought the hard pivot it didn't make sense I thought it was a little too early to go for Zion Jalen Brown I just thought OG was a slightly better fit head-to-head I I'm gonna guess Jalen Brown finishes higher in the sort of traditional z-score rankings but I thought OG fit a little bit better  your fifth and sixth you're you're doing another multiplicity thing here Julius Julius Julius Randle in the 5th Kyle kuzma and the sixth and and you know these are very high usage power forward types who have their issues in the percentages one of them more than the other the you know the the  bad duplicate the bad clone these ones actually surprised me giving your team build not because they don't block shots because that does kind of fit what you're doing but because you do have a guard heavy team that didn't have a field goal issue did you now create that with these two guys and kind of say screw it I'm like basically punting like the traditional big stats besides perhaps rebounds um I was  I mean that's a reasonable critique I think I was more focused on and this is something this is a mistake that I am prone to in drafts  and is I was more focused on like I'm looking at you know the list of ranks and and I'm sorting by big men who don't block and because when you're punting something you know one of the one of the advantages to hunting is it changes the valuation of players players who block shots are boosted up the rankings and I know longer care about that so that's effectively a wasted boost up the rankings and so by focusing on players who don't block shots you can focus on players who according to your specific team build are more valuable but in so doing you can almost get blinded by like hey yes I'm I'm no longer wasting money spending on blocks but I might actually be hurting myself a little bit here by taking two people who are poor field goal Shooters I think I'm a little more you described kuzma and Randall as a little bit worse feel goal percentage Shooters I think then is fair you know they're not 42% they're not they're not 40% guys they're 4445 not good for a forward but but not terrible and both of them both of them I do think are kind of undervalued and drafts right now and both of them can can do some some passing you know with curry and Booker I've got two point guards who do get some decent assist numbers but they're not getting the donshea or Halliburton levels of eight nine plus so I did still need a little bit of help in assists and I liked that Randall was going to help with that you're you might be right that I might perhaps I should have paid a little bit more attention to the damage that he would have that they would have done in in the field goal presented you know I did consider to Marta Rosen  Inn in the Randall spot by the way I was I was grateful there because you I was taking his old but he  was I was very much considering that but I decided I wanted those extra rebounds more than than anything else but my when is a reasonable critique you left me another Wing I couldn't say no my team was my team was four out of five wings at that point but it's fine well we can we can destroy my team some other day before we get to destroy your next day I really oh did I did Tyrese Maxey in round six is I think just incredible that I don't think I actually  I might not have taken him at 6 7th round mid sixth round is way too late for both Maxi and kuzma so I in terms of overall value I'm pretty happy about kuzma there whether or not he fits my team is it as well as I hoped is a different conversation but I think both of those guys should be going at least 10 picks higher yeah I was I was pretty surprised at Maxie was still there I think I I don't remember exactly what was going on at this part of the draft but I am pretty sure that I was looking at some guys like six seven eight slots deeper down the board thinking all right well this guy's not gonna get back to me what do I do instead and then he was there and that made it all hell of a lot easier but before we get to your seventh pick I want to make our faces a little bigger for a second so folks can once again see your Twitter handle at rickley and r i k l e n we're talking to Alex rickley here breaking down his team we'll get you guys some little nuggets at the end of the show as well seventh rounder Wendell Carter Junior um big man who doesn't block I get it I figured this out now after you told me yeah I mean like he does all the other stuff for and get some rebounds get some assists doesn't really block yeah that would make a lot of sense with your team build I don't know that you know and he does help with the field goal percentage yeah actually your next few in a row you went a little more field goalie to kind of cover that up I really like Daniel Gafford actually I just I just did a show earlier this morning where he's on my you know favorites Beyond 100 chunk of the board like every time we've seen him get 27 plus minutes he's been a force he just never got those minutes and for some reason folks kept telling me that he was always injured but he played in he missed four games last year that's not the year before it's pretty good it is pretty good and also every I mean we all know that Gafford is expected to start this year but I almost think we've undersold how much he's expected to start I think we should take a moment to pause and take a gander at the rest of the Wizards depth chart we got Taj Gibson there you go the the excavators are still trying to find his exact birthday but I believe he's the second oldest active player in the league right now behind I think it's brown and then and then Taj and Chris Paul's very much in that top few all right up there yeah so did Iguodala retire officially I think it would dial officially retired and I think has them officially retired know the top of the board there's been a great job the top of the board kind of cleared out a little so we got Taj Gibson that's that's the main backup mic most college who I love 10 minutes of Mike muscala per game not a threat for more than 15 minutes just Xavier Cooks if you know what he looks like and then you are unique amongst the basketball viewing sphere a person by the name of Anthony Gill oh yeah he was there last year yeah he's actually played a little bit we are DFS people are gonna be at least familiar with the name and Melanie as an out of position actually often injured all so very old like Ken sometimes play the Lord if I had if I was good enough with this stuff I would 100% clip the that sequence of if you know what he looks like  no but you're 100% right like if Gafford is upright  he's the big man yeah that's it  there I I honestly I often I often find that one of the issues that I have with other fantasy analysts is that people are too confident in their assertion of so and so is going to play 28 plus 30 plus whatever I honestly don't see the path to less than 28 minutes for Gafford I don't understand how you build this rotation without at least 28 and probably more for Gafford I don't get it I like my mind can't can't imagine it  yeah I mean honestly I can't I can't argue with you I like you I try to sort of temper the way that I talk about players because saying you're certain of something is like almost a guarantee that you're going to screw it up after that but there are situations where guys step into a much bigger role and it's weird that he's not really fully being treated like that he's going in the same neighborhood of as a lot of guys who I think probably have more competition and then he does so well see he's got a good block he's got a good rebound right he's actually not horrendous he's not good at the foul line don't get me wrong but he's not a full tank free throw guy like you make it high 60s low 70s out of it that's Survival in whatever you take only three three or four like yeah he might be three attempts to game from the line which is makes it even less bad so I think I actually lopped off the last round of on the board because I know I was very much not available for it I don't even remember who I got Auto picked in that one so apologies this was actually a 12 round mock your last three I'm gonna group together I do this annually because basically once we hit pick 100 especially in an industry model before we sure lump the rest of them I think we got to talk about JV for a second just because  I you set this up as a two Center mock there is not a chance in that I would have taken JV in the 9th round in a one Center leak there were a bunch of players that I would have been much happier to take but you know I'm trying to do this like a serious Endeavor you know I know you're going to talk about it I'm hopefully someone's gonna learn something from listening to this TVD and and if you're in a multi-center league you  you know being able to have not just two but at least three people who can start at Center is critical not just from the health standpoint but also from the trades standpoint you know I do stand by the point of you're likely to be able to pick up you know a 12:10 and one guy off waivers but a you're still there's still going to be a robust trademarket for functional big men for functional Center eligible big men in a two Center league and so I felt like if I was treating this like a serious draft I had to take Jonas there  where you know if this wasn't a two Center League even if I might have even gone Rob Williams I could have stayed at the position but taking someone with more upside and and but a much lower floor you know Robert Williams gets hurt a lot and he could be just a pure back up to eight and limiting his workload this year but at least we know he's got this massive upside and I'd rather that then JV any one Center league but it was a two Center league so I had to take I had to do that yeah you left me a couple I needed a big man here as well I felt like I was short on blocks because my first big was vooch and he's not blocking a ton of shots anyway so I actually was in a similar mode not because I needed a center because I got Rick Lean and best press Powerhouse Brooke Lopez in the seventh I mean you and I have shared many many a cup of soup over Brooke Lopez over the years but also I was able to pick between capella and Mitchell Robinson there and so I that worked out pretty well for my team I I just sticking on that too Center thing one last point on that is in the seventh round half of the picks were senters you know you you in a two centers League you get to a point where anyone with a pulse who can like be a top 100 Center is gonna go and so you've got a anticipate that you  got to know that that's coming yeah I think there were like five out of five out of 10 picks in a row in round seven and three out of the five picks before that or something I forget oh I guess there was like a mini run in the middle of the sixth but there was a bunch of centers that went real fast so you know if you're someone picking early in round six there  that you know took they took job or grants or miles Bridges probably wouldn't have done that anymore instead of the center of a center  you know they get back to the names got off the board before they got another try yeah it's really it is an interesting when you're able to look at it just as like the colors on the page in front of you here you can see the way it is not many going early because everybody wants to load up on their guards and then just an absolute truckload between  Kessler who by the way we do have a comment that I figured you'd enjoy no Walker Kessler in the fourth a surprise from Ricky so there you go but Kessler in the 50th yeah the brand is strong man well done but yeah four of them went in the 5th three more in the sixth five in the seventh oddly none in the 8th I don't know how that happened but then five more in the 9th and only two more of the rest of the way after that so once Mitchell Robinson was off the board the only two centers that I can show on this screen and there might have been one that got taken in the 12th round we're Al Horford and Evita's um technically Bobby Portis is Center eligible and he went in the 12th round but oh there you go but no no true Center in the yeah okay so that well done thank you for taking that question off the board your 10th and 11th and if you want to talk about your 12th it was not pictured on the YouTube screen shaedon Sharpe in Portland Dan best Bruce fan favorite Mike Conley in the 11th and then I can actually flip over and  boy on boy on bug zdanowicz in the 12th I had it on a browser tab as well tell me a little about those three and then if there was anything else that maybe you were hoping would get to you or guys that you were eyeballing late who are the the Rick Lean specials here potentially besides those guys sure I took a screenshot of my of my cue at the end of the draft because I wanted to like have that available that's incredible prep by the way for a man with two children I don't know how the hell you cut that in your brain so I've got that ready for it for you sharp is I  was gonna he's a mystery box he might be he might not be very good  to be determined but the potential and opportunity are there I don't care that he might not fit my team build I'm I'm taking a home run swing and if he doesn't fit my team then I'll trade him if he hits and in the 10th round it's late enough that if he doesn't hit I can drop them and it's not really a lot of pain you know one of my as much as you and I always talk about not drafting rookies early and she sharp isn't a rookie but he's young and Ron enough that he kind of falls into that bucket  you should absolutely spend at least one late pick on one of these high upside guys you know players who jump from you know outside the top top 100 12130 into the top roughly 60  usually our rookies because the other players  the players have already been in the league have a more gradual bills the problem is we're terrible at predicting which players are going to do that and so that's why I never drafted a rookie early not I haven't drafted Chad anyway and unless scoop Falls a bit I'm not taking him anywhere but someone like sharp or the top name on my cue that went undrafted in our league Derek Lively people like that I'm targeting late because they're home run swings and and if they hit you know late picks are likely going to be getting dropped anyways if they hit then there's a massive payoff Mike Conley I just I mean  what he's got a he's likely the starting point guard he's likely gonna average what six seven assists per game yeah feels like he's gonna do what he did and Utah last year yeah um  and so how many players after pick one hundred do we like think we'll average six point five assists or more is the answer one yeah I think the only other one in this draft might have been Trey Jones who went I think too big before you had sharp it might be the only other one maybe if you're super optimistic and things go right for nem hard maybe but like I don't know yes now it's probably those two I believe is his family that optimistic I I mean it's really probably just just calmly who's gonna be getting that many assists that late so I love getting him late again even if he's just a trade ship I love having him late and bogdanovich I think people are sort of a little too down on him we kind of  you know yes they played last year without Cade and Cade coming back like he's gonna have more of an offensive role I get that but I think we often  as a fan base and a specialist as a community as a fantasy Community we're a little more eager to take touches away from The Proven vets then actual NBA teams are and you know maybe he gets straight and at some point you know maybe he does have a massive drop off I  I think that especially in the 12th round what are we looking at pick one 30 something here this is  just the upside far outweighs the downside for a cost here and you know in the late rounds I like to sort of balance proven veterans who you know  are going later than they should maybe they don't have top 75 upside but they're probably going 20 spots too late with these home runs swings of shaded sharp Derek Lively Jeremy Sohan another name on this cue that I had nem heart was on this cue you gotta be going a little bit deeper to actually draft them hard  you're probably more looking at him as a late pick in a 14 Team league or a 16 Team league but he's a name that I have sort of on my radar in a deep early and the last name on my cue other names on my cue Kevin herder sort of fit my bill but I'm glad I didn't have enough to get their keonte George another rookie I'd rather Lively I'd rather sharp who's a fake rookie but  keonte George is a if you're trying for this late round rookie approach that I advocate he's a reasonable Target wait a minute I need to know more what what constitutes a fake rookie is that a foe of spooky I can't I gotta be careful I pronounce that he's sharp I mean he's he's not a rookie he's but he  I want to I want to make this a thing now experience he is limited game experience he's 20 years old he's kind of raw and fake rookie massive upside is  for the purposes of this exercise I can pretend he's a rookie yeah Fair well that's not and the other thing the other thing that I think key for the fake rookie because I'm also I hadn't realized that I had made this internal classification before this conversation but I actually I have so hand in the same category in my head I'm thinking of sharpen Sohan as because I'm always advocating don't have to rookie early do draft him late but this year I'm  I'm finding that I'm pulling the trigger on the Thompson Twins A little later than most people so I'm not often getting them which means that the only actual rookie that I'm likely to get is Derek Lively in a standard League because otherwise all the rookies are gone  but I still like this strategy I still believe in it so how do I how do I pull it in if I don't have a fake rookie get a fake Rook of course and I have two and it's sharp and Sohan both of whom are young both of like I think they're both 20 and both of them are in new situations where more will be asked of them for Sharp it's the very obvious Lillard no longer there Sohan just they brought them along so slowly and then they gave a ton of minutes kind of late  and now it seems like  they kind of want them to be maybe a start if not a starter like a very core figure there's been talk about maybe him being point guard some of the time who knows what's gonna happen with him but I kind of want to be on board to find out so I yeah fake rookies apparently is a thing that I have been thinking about for months and didn't realize you heard it today ladies and gentlemen a brand new term in fantasy Sports  rickling Pioneers the fake Rose are there others that I am missing that we should be including here I have no idea I have to like I need you to do a baby yeah fake rookie Deep dive this is actually wonderful I'm we I feel like we need a new name for sleepers now we've got fake rookies this is outstanding I I'm over the moon um I think wasn't cough was the last name on my cute oh there you go Kings yeah yeah okay I know I saw a few tweets about yeah an actual  so maybe maybe you'll end up on your team so maybe really you do you forget advocating drafting rookies late maybe it's the fake rookie that's get that part of your brand Walker Kessler and fake rookies that's the move I guess if you're in a deeper League could you argue Dyson Daniels is a fake rookie yeah that's probably fake rookie  a because there's a bunch of injuries there right now  they go it's sort of raw kind of young  hmm  I'm gonna I'm gonna need a list I think at some point because you know me I don't even look at a player until they turn 27 Oh Jovovich Nikola jovic of the heat yeah you believe that he's stepping into a big role that's definitely a fake rookie he  is definitely I see how many minutes did he play last year just you could yeah I was gonna say go for totals forget per game you could probably get a total that's  we may need to establish cut offs here what constitutes how many total minutes can they have because so I might have price himself out by totally yeah he might have yeah 2004 minutes across 15 games oh yeah fake rookie percent fake 100% fake rookie yeah no one can argue with you on that prickling I love you buddy these are always a blast I'm I've been horrible I need everybody to know and I'll say this every time I talk to a
