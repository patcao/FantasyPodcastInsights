welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right guys show two today  streaming time  which means we're gonna move it a pretty good clip  but I can't go too fast because  my voice gets tired after lunch I don't know why  maybe too much salt  I don't know  that's  idiotic guess  salty lunch  screwing up my ability to do a broadcast it's fantasy NBA today this is our streaming half afternoon shows we get a little bit closer to the actual tip on games tonight we tried to do this show early enough that people can make their decisions but it's also got to be late enough so that we have a little bit of the injury info not all of it we've got you know they  early start time games have some stuff out there and then we got some kind of questionable notes for the following day but not a whole lot for tonight which is gonna be important  uh tonight is a pretty big one by all accounts and there wasn't really any game any night this week that's true massive this is a nine game Wednesday  but that means that you know you're like at least approaching a full roster  but typically that means you've got some room for streaming so let's talk about that today is a hard day for streaming and I think I'll say that almost every day this week Monday was a little bit simpler in that you knew which direction you had to go now you've got  kind of a lot hanging in the balance that is to say  you have a couple of moves maybe two moves left and you're trying to decide do I use one today  so let's start this the way we've started the other ones which is let's look at the calendar  let's figure out who the very bad situations are and let's get away from them today of course is Wednesday March the 13th so the first thing you do here is if you're just looking at my grid you're looking for any teams where a new color it's color-coded a new color starts today so just quickly scanning through a couple of names that pop out these are not spots where color starts today but if you're in the midst of a juicy color Charlotte is an interesting one Chicago Dallas Clippers sort of but you're actually kind of in between anything so nothing there you've also got Portland in the mix that's a name that could pop out at you and again like they're just aren't that many today  and then you want to do a quick scan to see where things look particularly light which you know it's hard for me to do that while I'm actively scrolling but I'll give you the name the worst schedule this week belong to Minnesota Milwaukee Oklahoma City Houston and San Antonio starting today the Lakers no longer have one of the worst schools because they played tonight can't have one of the worst schedules if you play tonight because you're not gonna move off of a team where they have a game that's silly because then you're using a roster move before you need to which is part of the equation you want to try to use moves as efficiently as possible but also hold on to them as long as possible so let's start with the worst schedules and then we'll move over into the possible advantageous ones there are a few  not great  but there are a lot of names on the few teams so it's sort of balances out a little bit where yesterday we didn't have we had a you know more teams that had really good schedule spots Tuesday back to Monday but not many players on those teams to pick up now you have fewer teams or the teams that I have better schedules the schedules are not that outstanding they're a little bit better than everybody else's but you have more options  starting with the worst Minnesota is the worst and  they've been bad but as we talked about some folks may have held a timber wolf through yesterday because they had their game in La against the Clippers you figure you know one game out of the first two days of the week is not a really big deal now they go into a span where it's one game over the next five days three days off a game and then another day off before they get into a back-to-back early next week it is very hard to justify holding a fantasy player when they don't play for three games three days in a row in your playoffs so unfortunately if you're on the head-to-head side that means that the only wolves you're really hanging on to through this after yesterday so starting today for the next five days of this week he's probably go bare and Anthony Edwards yes Mike Conley outside looking in Naz Reid probably outside looking in  and it sucks  but it's true because you turn a one game rest of week very easily into a three-game rest of week  there's almost no scenario where a One Gamer beats a 3 gamer unless you're talking about top two rounds battling against like a 200 range pickup otherwise three games beats one almost like you know we're talking about 98% of the time 95% of the time  so we talked about like a my Conley and you're like oh I really don't want to drop that dude or not as read and the thing that hits you in the gut is like I really want to drop that guy think about the names you can pick up here  and I'll give you a few of them in a minute but we'll do a little bit of the math game on this like just pluck one out of the sky Miami S3 games the rest of this week and they play on Monday so they're actually gonna be one of the teams we talked about as a slightly advantageous schedule what if you picked up Caleb Martin  he's been finally it's not like  earth-shattering numbers I think he's had a couple of good ball games mixed in there he's number 206 on the season over the last month he's 153 which is probably a more accurate representation of what Caleb Martin is 11 points four and a half rebounds two assists half a steel one block two three-pointers over that strike so it's actually been kind of an okay stretch what about like take Nas read who had a quieter ball game yesterday but take Nas over the last you know two weeks since he stepped into a bigger role that's top 60 he's been good  16 points three threes six and a half rebounds to assist a half a steal and 1.5 bucks that's what you're getting that's one game of nazreen and we just talked about Caleb Martin  you're talking about 33 points so he doubles him up  in three games versus one you're talking about 13 and a half rebounds doubles him up in those assists triples him up  steals beats him by one steal blocks beats him by one and a half blocks three beats him by three  it's not close  its not close you're talking about a win of three threes and 16 points and seven rebounds and four assists and a steal and a block  and you're getting that from a from a downgrade dropping a top 60 guy for a top 150 guy  heaven forbid you're dropping someone for a player who's slightly closer in rank  this is a gap of 92 120 slots but that lower guys playing three times to the better guys won the guy playing one game almost never wins that  head up fight  and that's why minnesotans got to go  and the only reason you're drawing you're not dropping Rudy gobert because he's dealing with a  chest injury the only reason you're not dropping go bare or Anthony Edwards is because presumably your league continues after this week when Minnesota goes four times and you're really gonna want them for that Monday Tuesday back to back but like you got to get there  you may have to do something nuts preferably not but you never know other bad schedules this week Milwaukee Oklahoma City they go two times over the next week  both of those games  are this week so at least there's that so it's two games over the next five days but they open next week with two days off in a row  so this is a this is a discussion that actually pushes into the next week of fantasy basketball and if you don't have to worry about next week great if your league is ending this week then Milwaukee local city their schedule is just sort of slightly disadvantageous but if your league continues into next week they have really bad schedules they are basically playing a game week over the next seven days meaning you have a few options and a little bit has to do with how the games are spaced out Oklahoma City plays tomorrow and Saturday so they're going every other day meaning if you have a good Thunder player Chet or Shea or Jalen Williams  you probably just ride it out there isn't really anybody bad enough to Warrant to drop at that point if you have any other thunder you can drop them now or you can drop them Sunday but you really shouldn't ride anybody on that team outside of those top dudes after Saturday because they're off for three days in a row and then they're scheduled doesn't really pick up that much they only go three times the last five days of next week  luckily there aren't many Fringe guys on the thunder so you don't have to worry about it all that much Milwaukee schedule a little bit goofier  you got Giannis you got Dame those guys are locked in Brook Lopez has been cold lately but you're not gonna drop him today because they play tomorrow then that's when things get a little bit funkier film Milwaukee because they play one time over a five-day span starting on Friday off off game off off  at that point Dame and yanis are the only bucks that absolutely need to remain on your roster even my the love of my life Brooke Lopez doesn't need to be because he's been pretty cold lately but definitely not Middleton because he's been out for forever and who knows if he's gonna show back definitely not Michael Beasley definitely not Bobby Portis none of those guys over one game in five days  really need to be on a roster so you don't need to make that move today but you definitely need to make that move on Friday and you can make the move today if you really want to get off and if you wanted to move to somebody maybe and and beat someone else in your team to them  and then finally Houston and San Antonio is very similar to the above names San Antonio they go twice the rest of this week and then they played Tuesday of next week so they're actually two games over six days  with two days off right now so if you have any Fringe Spurs today would be the day to get the hell off  and overall they only go three times over nine days which is crappy because they don't one game the first four days of next week so this is an opportunity to abandon ship on any Fringe Spurs  for leagues that extend beyond this week Houston their schedule is a little bit less lopsided they go every other day starting yesterday so they played tomorrow they play Saturday  they don't play Monday they got another sort of three in the middle of next week so it's not as easy to make the call on Houston because they just have one two-day break in there but this schedule is not very good right this second it's worse starting Sunday on Sunday they go two times in six days but you have a two-day break in there  eh I don't think that I would Advantage it on anybody that's like pretty decent on Houston but you could definitely add  you know one or two games over those six days that's they have the least of the unfavorable  so then what do we were talking about before who are the guys that you'd want to pick up on the opposite side of this thing well we mentioned the teams before but I'll mention them again Chicago and Portland  each have a back-to-back today Chicago today tomorrow at Indy home to take on the Clippers Portland's back to back home games Atlanta and the New York Knicks the Knicks are good defensively but the good news for both of those teams is that they each extend into a three and four and they eat extend into a four and six  so you could hold them like Portland for instance they go today tomorrow and then they go Saturday and they go Monday of next week then they go to Wednesday of next week and then they go Friday Saturday of next week so they have a stretch here where they're playing what is a seven games over five eleven days not bad it's not awesome  it's not quite up to that like six and nine  cut off  but it's not terrible Portland is a really good schedule throughout like this is a team where you just hold on to all of your streamers forever and we've talked about these guys a bunch and then Chicago unfortunately doesn't really have any streamers Andre Drummond would be the closest thing to one but they'd be a team that you'd been hopefully riding for a while because they're finishing up a six and nine  tomorrow but then at least they go every other day for a couple of ball games before next Tuesday Wednesday is when they're schedule begins to lighten up  the other good teams Atlanta Detroit and Miami all so go four times in six days but they have less flexibility because the ones we were just talking about start with the back-to-back Atlanta they're back to back is Sunday Monday Detroit same thing they're back to back his Sunday Monday and Miami same deal so those teams go Wednesday Friday Sunday Monday  basically that means that if you're picking up anyone on those three teams Atlanta  Detroit or Miami baseball to hold them through Monday otherwise it's not a good move  there's no reason to make a move to those teams unless you're holding for the full six days  hopefully that makes sense  Charlotte in New Orleans are the third tier down  Charlotte they go three times in four days with the back-to-back on the on the back end so they go today then they go Friday Saturday and New Orleans also goes today and then Friday Saturday but each one of those teams has two days off after that at least Charlotte schedule turns into the one of the worst in the NBA after Saturday of this week they have two games over eight days after that so if you're picking up a hornet you better be ready to move off of them on Sunday it's not quite so severe for the Pelicans they have two days off Sunday Monday but then at least they move into a four game week starting on Tuesday of next week so the Pelicans schedule is a little bit better if you go beyond four days neither one of them is all that great if you go beyond four days Pelicans gets better if you go like six seven days down the line but those are kind of your third tier and basically I mean they are movable just be ready to use another move on Sunday  if you're not planning on using another move on Sunday for Charlotte and New Orleans that opens up a lot of options because 14 teams out of 30 still have three games left this week so basically there's no point in doing Charlotte New Orleans  if you're not going to move off of them on Sunday does that make sense  that's a contingent their schedule is better than the other teams that still have three games this week because most of those other teams finish up on Sunday or you know don't have a back-to-back in there or whatever is like a good example would be Denver they go today Friday Sunday  okay yes you have no flexibility there you're going to have to hold your nugget through Sunday otherwise you're not getting the full three games we talked about Dallas having the back-to-back today tomorrow you'd have to make a move on Friday right unless you're going to hold all the way through to Sunday which is fine it's another three game week but you again you lose your flexibility when you use a move on such a short-term play  yeah they've got a back-to-back Dallas has a back-to-back I can't take that away from them but they go off for two days after that so you're not really adding much to your Ledger it's a three game week through Sunday no matter how you cut that Mavericks schedule up  but that's why we talked about Atlanta they have a three game week but they start next week with the game on Monday so you don't have to worry about making a move until Tuesday of next week you get your three games and you front load okay deep breath we're going to stop sharing that screen and we're gonna bring up  some of the names that I think makes sense on these teams that we were talking about and yes I'm gonna get all the way down to the least exciting among them  um actually  scratch that I guess we're not really getting into the least exciting among them these are going to be the names on the teams that I think have a better chance actually help you particularly if you're going for the full  Six-Day Adventure I really do prefer that and the reason I didn't go deeper is because again if you're just going for three games the rest of this week half the damn league is available for streaming but if you want to go harder than that if you want four games in six days  with some flexibility that's the Blazers Matisse stibel scoot Henderson if he plays the back-to-back I was a little bit iffy but Bible's probably my favorite their Delano Bandon to Monte car Chris Murray our one level down Bulls it's Andre Drummond those are probably your best streamers at all so afford flexibility the ones that don't have as much flexibility might actually be better streams by and large although I do really like dibal a lot for the Hawks DeAndre Hunter if he's still out there he's probably not but Bruno Fernando is intriguing because again this team is very very hurt right now they're almost have no choice but to squeeze guys into extra minutes for the Pistons Simone fontecchio because as our Thompson got ruled out again and fante is gonna do some stuff even when Thompson is back but he's doing a heavier lifting right now Isaiah Stewart would be the other piston that's good enough to stream over four days in six or four games in six nights for the heat Caleb Martin Duncan Robinson Nicole yovich Jaime's Junior all four of those guys are worth streaming with four games in six days and for the Hornets it's Visalia meets Grant Williams Baton those are the guys obviously have Trey Man shows back up again he would jump LeapFrog most of these dudes but he's been out and we haven't seen a whole lot about him playing here in the in the in the near future and again you're hunting Max games played right now so  thy Bulls my favorite because you get the back-to-back at the front end which affords you flexibility after him I probably would lean more towards the guys that don't have as much flexibility but do  our guys you could hold until Monday of next week if you're not as worried about holding through Monday then those teams that don't have the flexibility they don't they don't have an advantage over what you're trying to do  so the reason that this board is up there is these are all guys that take you through an extra day that get your next week started better than a lot of the just random three-game streams out there but there's a bazillion random three game streams out there right now  and that's why I ultimately I don't know if this shows gonna help you very much because you might just look at your board and say okay well who's playing three times the rest of this week  you want the list Atlanta Brooklyn Charlotte Chicago  Dallas that's five Denver Detroit  Clippers  Heat the Pelicans that's 10  or Lando Phoenix Portland Toronto  Washington oh it's 15 I thought it was 14 it's actually 15 so there's like there's probably 30 or 40 options of streamers that are playing three games arrests this week but only the ones I gave you guys today all so play on Monday so if you're lead continues that's the direction you want to try to lean because then you front load next week you don't have to use roster moves typically and then until maybe Tuesday or Wednesday of next week that's really big deal the later you can use your moves the more you can impact your week the more you can tailor your moves towards the categories are also trying to hunt that's really important it's a it's not something it's talked about enough I think in streaming everybody's always just hunt on trying to get game game game game but you might be blowing games on a category that's not worthwhile  and the later you get in the week the more the better job you can do a figuring out which category you actually need to attack  maybe you don't need to start Monday with the game maybe that opens up all these other names like Toronto what if Gary Trent gets ruled in  Bruce Brown just came back from an injury they're interesting names out there that over three games this week probably do better than picking up like a toumani tomorrow I'd rather have three games of Gary Trent than Kamara by a lot  three verses 3  and frankly I would probably take Trent or Bruce Brown over Kamara knowing that I'd still have to make a move on Monday of next week because of what an edge they'd give me this week to guarantee my team advances so don't get too caught up in the I got to get a guy that plays Monday those are just the best options today on a day when streaming frankly is just not very good  if you want every streaming option the NBA just pull up the damn free agent list and sort by how guys are doing in their last seven or 14 days you'll see it click on a name find out if they played three times the rest of this week bingo bango there you go  but if you think you're in a little bit better shape you think you can get your hand on one of the better streamers which on our list we hear would be like  funky Bowl I think our guys like if you're comparing Thai Bowl to Gary Trent yeah I mean Trent's obviously gonna get you more points and threes but the Bible they'll be probably pretty similarly ranked 9 cat over the rest of this week so then you go Bible because you get the extra game to start next week  Gary transversus  Grant Williams  pretty close slightly into Trend but you get that extra game to start next week  but again if it's like Gary Trent against Kris Murray  you got to make sure you win this week first and Murray over three games this week is going to be  fine  but you're probably gonna need that extra bump this went longer than I expected very fast look short chat room today is Aaron Nesmith worth holding after today and head to head leagues the answer is no they go two times over six days and you can find somebody that goes for in that span so two game bump you probably can move on  if Trey man is ruled out today should I switch to Bilal or gradey dick  I mean either way you got three games the rest of the week either way you've got three games that end on Sunday the rest of the week  and I think the decision there actually does come down to whether or not first of all is we're Sean Holmes gonna play for Washington tomorrow I'm thinking probably not but we don't know for sure yet and then for Toronto's side is is manual quickly our Gary Trend are those two guys in because they're out the gradey dick is the play but if those guys are in I would go below  hopefully that helps  all right guys turn the page big one tomorrow do the recap we'll do the streaming show and then Friday we're going to do a special streaming show that'll be a little bit longer because we're gonna look at possible stash type guys when we want to load up next week we got some guys coming back from injury so that's Friday's second show will be a little bit different tweaking just attached okay good luck tonight see you tomorrow
