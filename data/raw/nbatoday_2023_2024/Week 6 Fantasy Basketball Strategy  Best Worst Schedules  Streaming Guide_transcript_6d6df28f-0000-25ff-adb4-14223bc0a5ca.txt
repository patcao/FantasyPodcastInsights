welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I'll feed the jams out the old-fashioned way for this one sometimes I use the mixer sometimes I do it by clicking very slowly down the volume bar on the screen today I'm  opting to click very slowly down the volume bar not that anybody cares nor should you welcome to  the weekly preview week 6 lost track of the numbers for a second there I was gonna look at the graphic in the background and then our faces covered it up I'm Dan Bass Pro I am joined as always on the Monday afternoon look at the week ahead by a d-ball bball the great Derek ball hey Lincoln from The Great White North I I  was contemplating whether or not I wanted to say something because some people are going to be listening to the show after the fact but Derek today is shrouded in a mysterious purple light behind and I feel like if we don't address it people are gonna be like  does he know the light behind him his purple and then I just learned that you guys are like living in a giant Greenhouse there yeah you know what my wife has has a green thumb and as you very rightly pointed out I am in the great white North it is cold as heck outside so we're not growing anything outside and frankly with all the critters in our backyard we weren't really going to do that in the summer anyway so lo and behold every square inch of my apartment is just filled with plants and LED grow lights so this is a this is a nice little preview of what the rest of my apartment looks like I badly wanted to do a d-ball cribs episode of this show someday where we get it on your phone and you can just like take us from room to room was so all right before we get into the weekly preview what what's behind you what are these plants do you know what they are growing behind you yeah you know what my wife is not going to be thrilled that I'm gonna get some of them wrong they're all legal I think there is a yeah and they're all legal yeah 100% there is let me see I've got a dragon scale plant I believe behind me just off camera there is a snake plant what is that a snake plant is  basically really tall fancy grass that requires minimal attention and quite literally it grows straight up just in longer thicker blades that's a wow I gotta say I wish you had said something else because we can't see it you you know what you guys know about aloe vera it's probably in half of the half of the creams and lotions everyone uses well I got a gigantic aloe vera plant just  boom look at that rotates the screen for us I love it I just I had to say something because it reminded me we were talking off air about how it just sort of reminded me of being in like a college apartment except the the black lights there are not for growing things they're just for like comedic effect I don't know what I was doing when I was okay yeah that's right for five they all Vibes room so anyway Derek's in the all Vibes room today but luckily he's in the all streams room as well and we're going to be getting into the weekly planner mode here and this is the beginning of in season tournament scheduling weirdness I feel like we got to open up first of all you can find Derek on social media at d-ball d b a l l b b a l I am at Dan Bass Pros over on so social and as I've been doing on all of our shows lately I want to make sure everybody is getting in on the sports ethos Discord which is a great place to hang out again I don't know that Twitter is going under anytime soon it just seems like things are slowly trending that way and I feel like folks are gonna want to have a place to hang out when if or when that happens this would be it I'm throwing the graphic up on the screen for anybody that's watching on YouTube it is of course in the show description if you're listening on traditional pod channels but Derek before we get into sort of the chronology of the week what do Focus need to know about the tail end of this week because isn't that when the instance in tournament starts to go for up the schedule a little bit 100% so really I think after Tuesday you're going to see a lot of really funny business because that's when the in-season tournament and the NBA cup the qualifiers are all going to be determined and then you're gonna start to see the teams and the players much like they do around the All-Star break start to kind of give themselves maybe a little bit of extra prep time if they're qualified or maybe you know they're just gonna start calling in sick to work like so many of us do and you've got a holiday around the corner so I'm prepared for a lot of funny business in the schedule this week and it seems to me very likely although I can't guarantee or really officially predict it that you're going to see a lot of kind of key rotation players start to go missing as we get closer towards the end of the week games wrap up on Saturday and then from Sunday moving forward into week 8 We're not gonna have any fantasy about because every team you a dog so we're gonna have we're gonna have every every NBA team is either going to be qualified and going to Las Vegas to play or the ones that don't are very likely going to be  going to Vegas to hang out and party so really the league is going to stop stop schedule on Saturday and then we're going to be very bored sitting on our hands for another week yeah um it's pretty I mean I know most of it like is gonna be impacting next week but there has to be something we can do this week to get ourselves ready or like okay so I have a lot of questions about how this new thing because this is new this is the thing we're going to be attacking for a first time from the schedule planning standpoint as well  does this mean that you should be utilizing more moves early in the week does it mean you should be setting yourself up more for the few days with just a couple of games next like what's your what is your general plan because I imagine it can't be the same as what we normally do on these shows which is you're using like water or two Monday Tuesday another couple Thursday Friday and then you're basically done but like everybody plays Saturday and nobody plays for like three days after that so something's got to be a little different this week yeah absolutely so um unlike last week where I basically just said use all your moves and use them as soon as you can and just try to get the best players ASAP this time I think we're really looking at more of a long streaming schedule and I'd be kind of more surprised if I did see the majority of teams actually going through the bulk of their moves because you have one last day to actually play games on and I'm like last week or that day fell in the absolute middle of the schedule and gave us some kind of funky you know funky games that we could exploit with the rest day being on Sunday there's really not that much that's exploitable on this schedule there's no Monday Tuesday back to back so your first shot for two games and in three days comes from the 18th that play Monday to Wednesday so really it's very likely the most teams make one move before before Wednesday night and then our probably looking to make a second move on Thursday if they're just doing kind of like a default streaming play and I kind of like the idea of leaving those other two moves just kind of as spares will call them because as I was kind of indicating earlier I really wouldn't be surprised if I started to see Star players rest or you started to see those kind of precautionary games where oh you know he's got a sore toe and we don't want to push it he's coming up on a long break let's just let them let's just let them rest so I I am kind of preparing for those scenarios and I think having an extra waiver wire move or to be a good way to hedge against them in the what I would say is a likely scenario that you're going to see a star player not playing their Full Slate of games would you do anything towards the end of this week to prep for next week or is next week even weirder in that you've got like what one or two teams playing on like one day and then everybody on the other days I don't even I don't even know how to prepare for something like that yeah I don't think any of us really know how to prepare for it all the games basically fall on the same two days next week and for all intents and purposes I'm treating this as the next week is almost like a wash I it's hard for me to predict what moves could or would be effective whenever one plays on the same days and we're not entirely sure how those games are going to turn out so for me unlike most weeks where I would normally say use your your final moves on the final day to kind of get a jump start on next week I'm very much just I'm focused on this week I'm not trying to predict anything that happens in Vegas or moving forward from Vegas because I think the NBA environment is going to kind of be turned on its head in the coming days and we're gonna start to see some funny business that we can't exactly predict prepare for you yet with the obvious disclaimer just being that you want to have the best players available on the court so whatever move allows you to do that is going to be the gonna be the goal okay so now correct me if I'm getting something on this wrong you are my scheduling Guru and it's possible that I goof something up  this week tomorrow you said is the last in season tournament qualifier games is that a yes or no unless I'm mistaken those are the last games yeah okay so then the rest of this week is just regular basketball games meaning that Friday is not an in-season tournament day but then next week Monday and Tuesday are the four and a quarter final games Thursdays the semi those all do count for fantasy and then next weekend not this weekend but the following weekend is the one quote unquote title game which does not count for Fantasy that's the extra game in the schedule so then those teams that play in the quarters and semis they don't have games on or the ones that play in the quarters and win don't have the game against the rest of the league the sort of rest of the field basically on one of those Wednesday or Fridays and then the ones in the semis would not have that bonus game on the Friday  so I think that means that you're looking at two games Monday 2 Tuesday  and like  12 or 13 on Wednesday and like 14 on Friday does that add upright or am I missing I might be off by one or two I mean your math seemed pretty accurate there I am not I honestly with all the different variables that are still up in the air with the in season tournament it's been kind of hard for me to nail down exactly what's happening when strange but what you did say generally sounded right and I don't think it would be  I don't think it would be right for me to pick at any any individual in their everyone's supposed to go to that's I think that the end results so like if you play my understanding if you played in one of the quarterfinal games you would lose one of the field days and if you play in both the quarters and the semis you lose both of the field game days meaning Wednesday and Friday and if you're in the finals it doesn't matter that's just a bone that's game 83 free game yeah game 83 right and that one does not count towards fantasy I believe that's the way that all of the sites are treating it because it's just not a regular season game it's a next Edition but it counts for the finals again come so to that end if someone was now you guys know where I was going with this very circuitous route Derek if at the end of tomorrow will know who's in the quarter-finals right for next week and so then maybe you could make a move with Monday Tuesday in mind for next week because then every team plays twice but a couple of teams are going to go early in the week at a whole crap loader gonna go Wednesday Friday  but the overload might make that sort of  inconsequential it seems like having the teams that play on the low traffic days next week could end up being a huge advantage  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of

quarterbacking from you guessed it  your armchair  download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's d r i z l y.com today must be 20 on plus not available in all locations uh yeah absolutely so I mean if you are if you are sure that you're going to be able to get a player that's going to be active on those first couple of days and week seven when you're when you're coming down the stretch of week six and you got a leftover move I say go for it it's you are going to have spare moves in a week like this so I there's certainly no harm in doing that but with the way that this schedule rounds out and knowing that on the last three days to start the the two heaviest game days come in the last three days of the weeks get six schedule I'm really gonna be focusing my attention on trying to make maximize my results there if I do have leftover moves with kind of the Monday Tuesday week 7 being a real convenience play for me having said that I am going to be looking if I do have a leftover move on Saturday and my lineup is filled I am definitely not gonna be trying necessarily to  to prioritize anyone team over another the Celtics are looking to me like they're probably gonna offer some good value coming off of two game week looking like they're likely going to qualify for the for the n Season tournament and not being active on the weekend I don't think it's going to be hard to find a good Celtics player on The Wire um and and I think the same could be said of the Knicks as they do get a couple of rest days as well and as far as I know they're not eliminated from the tournament yet either really at the end of the day I think it's just like you're saying you want to get those teams that are active for those two two games if you have the convenience of doing it but I wouldn't go into week six with anything to do with the in season tournament as a goal per se yeah that's this week basically going because we don't know we don't have the the final names for the quarterfinals right now anyway I think we have an idea of it but it's not set in stone the only reason I bring it up is because if most teams in your league are going to be able to start 10 guys on Wednesday and Friday and then like assume everybody has like a player from one of these quarterfinal or whatever like the last what whatever is 18 that make the quarters  for make the semis and again the finals game doesn't matter you're looking at you're looking at a lot of teams that are going to have next week I know I'm looking at week 7 right now I know I'm getting ahead of myself we still have to talk about how to deal with the particularly the front end of this week but if a lot of teams are going to have like 22 games played next week if you can get two or three extra games you are dominating that's a massive percentage Edge in a way where like most weeks you had two or three four games whatever you're adding four games over a 45 week whatever it is like you're talking about less than 10% whereas if you can add four games next week over 20 that's a huge jump that's a double in terms of like against your opponent 24 games beats 20 games almost every single time in a head-to-head 100% And you know what to build on what you're saying there to I'm expecting once we kind of get into the tournament I'm expecting to see more of a playoff atmosphere when you're in the playoffs defense turns up its up to another level and you're going to start to see what I expect to be lower scores to me that actually says that teams that build in high-impact stat areas so like three pointers or blocks or steals they're going to see really really big returns in these games because a small sample size of games and then B I do I just think you're going to see a more locked in targeted defense once the mattress are more consequential will say all right now is I'm going to turn the this the stage over to you basically is my next plan here because I I wanted to get in front of next week because I think it's actually gonna be a sort of a pretty big deal to be aware it be so easy for all of us to just be like I see season tournament I don't really want to pay attention to that stuff but again starting at well Wednesday morning at the end of tomorrow we're gonna have an idea of  who has these extra super low traffic very valuable games for next week and you may need to be sort of ready to take that plunge early especially when you consider the fact that this week ends Saturday's what a 12 12 game day so probably an overload right a very likely you're almost guaranteed to have an overload on that Saturday okay so now sorry I've been sort of burying the lead here I just put it on the screen for YouTubers if you're listening you guys can find it on Twitter at D ball bball this is what Derek puts together on Sunday nights for the week ahead an opportunity to just look through the schedule day by day team by team who fits kind of front to back you also write the week ahead piece which goes way deeper on this stuff that's part of the fantasy Passover at Sports ethos.com and Ethos fantasy BK Derek you want to walk us through how to handle this coming week and frankly I mean you can tell me when to scroll down just get your pretend that I am your PowerPoint clicker and I'll take us through your tweets in real time if you'd like oh you give me the way too much power here Dan that I'm going to let her do my best to be respectful of it so yeah I've already kind of touched on what we're doing Monday Monday there's eight teams of the 10 that are active that are effectively viable streams in that they give you two games and a three-day window of the Monday teams that aren't effective let's just say that we're not looking at the Pacers we're not looking at the Blazers but I do see good value in the nuggets the Pistons the Clippers the Lakers the Pelicans the Sixers the Jazz and the Wizards in most cases for a long stream if not a short stream going into Tuesday you can also accomplish a two and three before the Wednesday night game's wrap up if you are going for one of the three Tuesday Wednesday back to back teams that are going on there's the Houston Rockets in the Sacramento Kings which simply just play a Tuesday Wednesday back to back however I am targeting the Raptors because they actually not only played the Tuesday Wednesday but they all play on Friday which gives you a three games in four days stream very effective especially if you're able to get a player like a Gary Trent Jr who is a potential X Factor in two really really important categories to me personally threes and steals really really great categories to stream from Wednesday night most teams are probably going to be looking to make another move if they are feeling so bold Wednesday is a perfect day to be streaming because 19 offer a three and four opportunity from that period moving forward I've kind of divided them into on the on the tweets that I've put out there or whatever we call them now in elon's New World Suites I guess I don't know um but yeah I've kind of divided them into there because I already touched on the Pistons the Clippers the Lakers and Utah early on as a really viable Monday streams I'm not expecting many of them to be available so on actually really kind of considering Wednesday a day with only five effective streaming teams uh and that the nuggets the Grizzlies the Pelicans the magic and the Suns all offer three and four from that day and are less likely to be snacked snapped up in that they don't have the back-to-back from Wednesday Thursday they're back-to-back actually goes Friday Saturday so I think those options are less likely to be chosen over if you're looking at Thursday there's basically only two teams that I'm looking at because I really do as with every week I'm just going to keep on driving at home you want to move or two games from every single move in a three-day period the only teams that are going to allow you to get two games before you can flip that screen or side and get another one or the Knicks and the Spurs the Spurs are I'm expecting them to be widely available on most Waiver Wires because they're one of your two game teams this week so I think you're going to have pretty pretty easy time on Wednesday night finding the dispersed player of your choice and with kind of the way that they're lineup is probably going to change in the near future I'm I'm expecting there to be some good streaming value there the me so hand experiment is not necessarily working out if you follow any of the media there but that doesn't mean that I'm not going to try to stream him because he's obviously still a very valuable player on the team and still a very important piece for their future and I also really like what this does for Trey Jones but I digress if you're if you're moving on from Thursday your best options on Friday are going to be the back-to-back teams again to two games and a single move so Friday Saturday back-to-backs featured Dallas Mavericks Denver Nuggets Memphis Grizzlies Orleans Pelicans or Orlando Magic and Phoenix Suns and anyone just paying attention realized that I've already said a lot of those teams recently so I would expect if I'm a manager on Friday that I'll probably be ending up looking at the Mavericks crew they do have a lot of really interesting streamers right now and they've got some of their bags that are trying to work their way back from injury so depending on how that works you might have some different streaming options just to split  the difference I put Grant Williams on the list there but there's really there's several other names from the maps that I'm going to be looking at on Friday night and then Saturday it's just like you were saying take the best available if you've got a good idea of what the playoff picture that what the in-season tournament picture looks like at that point then absolutely go for your guy if you know you're going to get a lot of games the early part of the week seven scheduled and I'm absolutely gonna say you target them but I really use this Saturday part of my tweet to kind of highlight some of the other players that I really want to do talk about this week but maybe didn't have a schedule specific reason to bring up earlier on so I just listed a bunch of names here of guys that I'm really kind of into lately and that I'm expecting to see move up on be trending names on the way for wire late so I just gave out some names like Craig Porter Jr Kobe white Dario sorry and famous Smith Isaiah Walker hamate hackage Junior Malik Beasley nazri Obi top and seek now some of those guys aren't going to be available in competitively but I think you're probably gonna find a couple of useful guys on that list that I do expect to get some really good value in the short term  wow that was well done my good man and I I think I was scrolling at the proper speed to be honest I looked away but it looked like you were keeping up with me most of the time I forgot to be a good director and tell you what to do that I heard as you were getting to the different days I was I was bringing it down your last tweet by the way in that threat is one that you probably should have talked about as well because that again is a shout out to what you're doing over at sports ethos with the week ahead piece that is available there now and I'm not gonna put that on the screen because that is behind the paywall but one thing that I will do is take a look at the chat room because I think we do actually have a couple of stream questions here we go got one from Mr Jason start two of these guys this week no streaming so this is a full week lineup block Mitchell Robinson for three games kcp for four or Mac Spruce for three games it's only a six cat Rodeo League which I'm assuming is no turnovers and no percentage it just we don't have confirmation on that so basically like a points League effectively kind of questions so job for three stress for three kcp for four which way do you look on this one for a weekly lock well I'm definitely going to miss Rob right off the bat Mitch Robb was my first very clear you got to pick him because I think he does a lot of work in the in the categories where you're going to feel the most impact I love rebounds I Love Blocks I think those are really productive categories you're going to see really good value and from him I think he's an elite producer both of those areas and you want to get the elite guys in whatever you can and then because it's six cat and we're taking percentages out of the game I think I'm actually gonna give Casey P the bump here I think he's filling up the county stats a little bit more and I trust him to give me more steals than Max Drew's does as much as Max Drews has been a very valuable very impressive and just generally a very fun to roster fantasy player that extra game with kcp plus a little bit more of a rounded line from kcp kind of puts him over the edge for me yeah I'm definitely on with you on Casey P I think between the other ones it's a little bit of a coin flip but there is a nice  thing with the with the Mitchell Robinson side there like you talked about of maybe a little bit less variability in these situations with the weekly lineup block if you've got guys that are even remotely close together you go with the one that has the extra game so that's what in my mind makes kcp sort of the pretty easy choice for one of the two um let's see these other questions are actually not weekly lineup questions but I'll give you one anyway because I think we've got you about 30 more seconds here  how about  how about this one do you think Buddy hield for ogn Adobe is a fair Bi-Lo offer I think you could try I don't think it's gonna get it done but I would give it a shot  listen if I can acquire buddy or OG or no for buddy hield I'm doing that 10 times at 10 if I'm playing in a league where I can throw in draft picks to grease the wheels and try to make that trade happen I'm also doing that I 100% in on OG and who Novi he is exactly what he was and all previous seasons were just seeing a bit of a slump right now is the whole team that he plays on is really struggling and he's working his way back from injury so if you're able to buy low on OG go for it and if it only costs you buddy hield then you should be singing all the way to the bank this one also isn't a weekly choice but I am curious your thoughts on Mark Hill false that's not technically the question it's should I drop Santi aldama to stash markelle fultz but what do you think he's gonna be this year because I was always in the kind of I don't know that he ever really gets like bursting through that top 90 window now I'm a little bit unsure if he even gets quite to there but with the lack of timeline I find it really hard to tell people to stash Falls right now yeah I've been fairly quiet on the folks front for several years now I'm not necessarily against him as a player but I am very much in favor of his two backcourt mates that he sharing that point guard position with I have drafted and held Cole Anthony in a lot of leagues this year I believe in him as the best counting stats Creator on the magic and I did that regardless of whether fultz was healthy or not and then I mean everyone's talking about Jalen Suggs lately I'm personally a believer that he's got the highest healing among that group of three point guards there and I think we're starting to see Suggs really reach for that ceiling so with the combined success of Cole Anthony and Jalen Suggs just kind of feeling in that point guard spot and with Subs doing a really really good job of replicating the defensive value that folks to the table I'm not sure that all is going to have as firm of a hold on to starting spot as he did before he got injured and then you talked about false is kind of more of a connecting piece then more than maybe a do-it-yourself guy I'm kind of more of the mind that you get more of that kind of  alpha Bulldog mentality from Cole Anthony and from Jalen so I think they're more likely to go up and get theirs even if they're in limited minutes so a false is hurting or false is in a reduced role or if he is in any other way trying to round back into shape I just don't think he's gonna be the same sort of fantasy producer that his two back court mates are having said that I'm never post a streaming a guy that's going to be productive in assistance deals so at worst he is a standard League stream if not a whole that you're going to keep me near the bottom of your Oscar uh Mr Jason did clarify it is no percentages no turnovers but how to follow up Russell Westbrook with four games versus Mitch Robb with three this is intriguing because Westbrook's very painful weaknesses are the three categories that aren't on the board for this team I might go Westy here just for the extra ball game what about you  yeah so I mean honestly if you're looking at their stats or the last week Westbrook and Robinson are basically scoring at the same clip since we said rebounds don't matter I'm just gonna go ahead and Skip by that so it's really just a matter of whether you think that Russ is five or six assists are worth more than Mitch Robinson's block and a half per game so if you're talking about a four game period you're looking at somewhere between you know 20 and 24 assists for Westbrook versus let's say seven blocks for Robinson I would rather if I if I knew that I was going to be competitive and assists I think I would rather have him because I wouldn't necessarily rule out that Westbrook could be productive defensively whereas I know that you're really not going to get that much more out of Robin said even if he does have a good game yeah he might do more things in the same categories but Westbrook as we know Mr triple double he is all over the place all over the statue he's not doing great right now but at least he has the ability to produce those numbers I'm not exactly optimistic about either scenario yeah that's fair all right get back to your day thank you and you know you can float back into the Sweet Purple Abyss behind you yeah Dad I got some plants to water so yeah clearly way more than I realized he is Derek ball he's at d-ball b-ball he writes the week ahead piece for sports he's the guy that I get to get educated by here on these Mondays Derek I'm sorry for taking us all the way into weeks seven I just felt like  this is sort of a we needed to get like a two week look ahead here to really knock it all out good luck with your lineups this week  thank you sir it's been a pleasure as always and let's talk more about week seven in the very near future yeah we're gonna probably have to do that on social Derek will see soon yeah he is Derek ball always the man here on our Monday shows I got a couple more things to knock out before we wrap up the show I'll try to hit another question or two that maybe wasn't specifically about the week ahead I wanted to try to save Derek generally for those types of questions but one thing that's a bit of a callback on this show to when it was just called the weekly light up show for those that may remember those old days is  making lineup decisions and actually we just got some breaking news in the middle of our podcast two minutes ago Nicola yokich  was ruled out for the Nuggets ball game tonight which makes me  take a look at them and think where are they now  ah they're in LA taking on the Clippers that line is already jumped up to Clippers by seven it's the second half of a back-to-back and then I get her  you know they've got a pretty good record this year so I don't think that they have any massive fears about where they're going to end up at 11 and 6 and you know you're seeing a little bit of what we kind of imagined would happen which is off a championship run you just can't keep your foot on the gas the whole damn season and so on these slightly tougher scheduling days sometimes you're going to see stuff like this now let's hope that the back injury doesn't linger I'm assuming he'll be back for the next ball game and you know the nuggets have not a fantastic schedule this week but not a bad one it's a four game week they've got a back-to-back towards the end of it is that one where he could potentially see another day off at a phoenix Sacramento back-to-back hard to say but either way you're playing Nicola yokich are you I mean you have to because he's  he's freaking Nicola yokich  other players that are game time decisions that you're making tough calls on Kevin Durant was questionable for their game on Sunday he ended up sitting that out there off today and tomorrow but then their schedules a little bit back loaded this week as you just heard from Derek Phoenix plays on Wednesday Friday Saturday I'm assuming you get Katie for two of those ball games and that would be more than enough so he's all go Lottery marketing is a little bit interesting of an interesting one he is already out with a hamstring strain and that's a little bit concerning because hamstring aren't usually the world's fastest in terms of recovery it's also a couple of home games which is the ones that tend to be a little bit easier for players to  put up numbers in not that that's like easier for him to play through an injury  Utah's a four game week in Memphis they're at Minnesota then they're back home to take on Portland towards the end of the week is a back-to-back in there  feels like two for marketing might be a good ending and that makes him one in my opinion one of the hardest calls of the week I probably roll the dice and hope you get one or two  but man if you have a four gamer that's impossible fill-in that could even get you part of the way to what he do in two ball games which is like 47 points  16 17 rebounds couple steals a couple blocks and and six three pointers that's easier said than done but you know you're talking about a guy that's like 12 points for five boards and you know half a steal half a block and and one and a half threes those types of guys are floating on the wire and that way if marketing and ends up missing the third game and he only plays one you dodged that possible bullet it's a hard call to make I know it but  I think I would probably try to go find a four game or if I could  bam out of Iowa and Duncan Robinson were full participants in the Heat's Monday practice so the expectation is that they'll be back tomorrow so you can fire both of those guys up  CJ McCollum is hoping to make a return later this week I think I would probably still keep him benched we don't know exactly how his minutes are going to look coming back from a lung injury  they might just run him out there for big minutes but my guess is that they'll ease him in a little bit so probably keep him bench for one more week lamelo ball I'm putting on my bench he's doubtful for their next ball game we he has a history of ankle issues I mean maybe he gets back in there for a couple towards the tail end of this week but you're that's really rolling the dice it's only a three-game week and we already know he's almost definitely gonna miss the first one  I'm thinking you're looking at one one and a half games is sort of the way you have to picture it in your head two would be a fantastic scenario for him and I I just I I'm not confident that we get there so I probably keep them all on my bench we're seeing guess I'm keeping benched Nick Clarkson's an interesting one he's dealing with an ankle sprain and he's questionable for their ball game tomorrow and I'll be perfectly honest with you guys I really don't have a good feel for whether or not he's going to go if he sits it out and you're looking at a two game week for a guy who's barely good enough to drop in for a two gamer  I'd probably keep him benched and play it safe but you guys know me I tend to be a little bit more cautious  Jimmy Butler is questionable with ankle tweak I would probably start him this week I think he's gonna give you two games although he did miss practice uh earlier today if I'm not mistaken so we'll see I think they're just trying to give him some extra time off Tyler hero is still on the bench Camp Thomas is still on the bench Jalen Johnson's out a month so he's obviously on the bench Kelly oubre benched Derek white played he's got a cold but I'm gonna assume that he's that he's gonna give it a go Zach LaVine is sort of constantly in and out of the injury report with that foot soreness the tough to  I mean I don't know how you take him out considering he's mostly playing through it but the cam Johnson's go sounds like he can Murray's likely back for the king so he'll be a goal for later this week  and then that's probably about as far down the board as we really need to venture right oh Drew holidays sort of an interesting one he's questionable for the Celtics game tomorrow it's a two game week so probably keep him on your bench  and those are likely the guys you're making the weekly calls on  because anybody ranked farther down the board if they're even so much as questionable you probably keep them aside Jamal Murray may come back at some point this week that would be really nice for them but I don't think that you can start him with the hope that he comes back I think he got to let him back actually show up before you do it and  that I think is probably your weekly calls as by the way  cam reddish just got ruled out for the Lakers tonight  which means that someone like a Tory and Prince probably does retain some kind of value  and that I think is probably your decision-making tree for this evening let's see what questions I can lightning around my way through I don't want this one to go longer than 45 because I've already did an hour and 15 minutes show earlier today  are dunk says should I drop keyonte George for Dyson Daniels or strache treatment stash Trey Murphy now instead ate cat Rodeo your aisle already has Bradley Beal and Tyler hero  I mean over the next few games Tyson Daniels is probably better but CJ McCollum coming back almost definitely obliterates that so probably just hold on to George  unless you unless it's a three ill and then you get trimmer you pick one of these guys back up again  saddiq Bey or Marcus Smart rest of season probably Marcus Smart although you know bay is going to play for the next couple weeks and smart isn't so that's  complicating Factor  if you need to win the next couple weeks saddiq Bey if you're talking about like who to sit on for Roto it's probably smart  someone offered me lamelo ball for kristaps porzingis and Desmond Bane in a 14 team points League that's too much yeah that's it overpay  what are we selling Chet for and a 10 team or due to concerns over injuries I don't know that I have concerns over injuries  he seems pretty tough so far if you can get somebody inside the top 18 to 20 18 to 20 I would do it  otherwise man he's rolling  maybe top 24 top two rounds  that's about it  what are your thoughts on stashing amen Thompson I don't think he's gonna do much this year you're talking about next maybe even the season after because the Rockets are trying to win now  scoot Henderson question mark 10 team points League yeah you probably want to sit on him he'll be a 10 team or in points League's by February but like I mean it's a tough it's gonna be a long road to get there he's gonna be a sub-optimal player for your team for the next however great Dan I have Kauai and Kevin Durant in a 16 team where I'm planning to flip both of them due to historical injuries who can I Target  I mean here's the thing there really was never a plan there because if somebody didn't want those guys they probably didn't draft them  I'm not as worried about it as others um  I think Kevin Durant is a beast so like what are you gonna sell them for another first rounder that you maybe could have drafted anyway  I don't think this is gonna make any sense for you and they Kawaii you can't really flip right now because the Clippers are still trying to figure out how to fit their pieces together  I need to trade Jimmy Butler who and best player to look for uh you should be able to get somebody inside the top 30 I would think back for Butler I know he's number 36 right now but he's been trending up and yeah he misses games here and there that's sort of the magic of Jimmy  I don't really know who you can Target though you kind of need him to to get going before you could do it you might be able to get like a Desmond Bane if you wanted I don't know if that's the direction you'd want to go dejounte Murray you could get James Harden you could probably get Freddie Van Vleet you could get these guys are less banged up but I think I'd rather until Harden's rolling not hard it's because me Butler's rolling and then see if you can aim a little higher at that point uh let's see Jah and DeAndre ayton for Kyrie Irving yeah give me Kyrie and nine cat there  should I pick up Trey Murphy I would drop keyonte George Gogeta or Eric Gordon yeah um  you could probably get away with the dropping either Goga or Gordon  we think Kevin Durant comes back pretty soon then Eric Gordon gets kind of clunky  either one of those two I think I would do it because I think Trey Murphy's gonna have some value when he comes back in a way that right now go and and Gordon these guys are stream level  who did drop to stash and for any Simon's among Austin Reeves cam Johnson Chris Paul or Brook Lopez 10 team points League ah the magic of points formats  so it's hard for me to know exactly what those guys are averaging in your points League I'm guessing that Chris Paul's probably the lowest number but maybe it's Reeves because of his slow start  it's probably gonna end up being either Johnson or Chris Paul but  I don't know they the ESPN points numbers for those dudes off the top of my head  can't a Georgia scoot rest of season I think I'd rather have scoot who do you prefer between shade and sharp or onyeka okongwu ten Man 9 cat okongo and I'm not sure either of those guys is a 10-team team are right this second  does Dyson Daniels value go in the toilet when CJ McCollum returns probably  thoughts on Jabari Smith Jr rest of season well he's inside the top 90 right now I think I'd be happy if he stayed there so but also it feels like maybe his field goal percent could taper off a little bit  somewhere but he's a tough one man high volatility dude somewhere between  75 and 130 and it really is not localized to a particular narrow or window  what is Devon vessels trade value in a points League comparable to so  he's I would venture to say a little better in points because the free throw numbers not great and typically the field goal number is a little lower but he sort of running hot right now  maybe like top 75  top 70 something like that  for sale points League should I stash Kelly oubre for scoot or Brandon Miller I think I'd rather have Aubrey over scoot  I don't know that Mueller has like Miller's had a couple of really hot games in a row and maybe he gets a bunch to do all lamelos out but I just I don't I'm not sure that there's a ton of nine cat upside there in the way that scoot could get cooking in a couple months I think I'd rather a Overcoat over Miller long term obviously the very short term but in Millers the best option because he's playing starting and lamelo's out and you bring is not back yet but  so sort of a flip depending on what part of the year you're looking at  I'm trying to trade in a head-to-head points League who should I Target that's not gonna go great for you because his numbers are quiet just sort of plodding along in that 60 range in nine cat and probably lower than that in points if I'm guessing right here  so I don't know is the answer that question sorry dude I don't actually have the answer to that one  who was your favorite player to watch in the NBA so I get a weird kick at a watching the incredible Defenders of the NBA  and more specifically the ones that get Steals and shot blocking so and that's not that's not my way of saying that I'm about to answer this question with Brooke Lopez because you know hanging back and drop coverage and being incredible at is fun but it's not like super exciting so I love Nicole yokich who's not you know getting a ton of defensive plays but just everything he does is nuts I have no idea how he does these things I love watching Anthony Davis when he's going because he's just blocking everything and then he's also a force on the other end I love watching Kevin Durant who get who does block shots and then is like one of the most efficient scores ever  I mean there's so much awesome this in the NBA right now Lucas pretty cool I don't have the same like heart tingle for Luca he's unbelievable but his game is a little more  sort of fluid and slow in a way that doesn't explode to the eyes he does these step back three point shots that are crazy and he like he's amazing but it doesn't have that sort of like oh kind of moment so guess that's kind of the answer to that question you guys are piling up these questions here late I'm only doing one more minute what do I do with Bradley Beal you gotta sit on him  should I drop RJ Barrett and add someone with four games in a points League know RJ Barrett should be held in points nine cat you can drop him Brogden rest of season would you trade him for Kobe White  hmm  I think if you could do it in like  I don't know  I don't know when this Chicago blow up is gonna happen that's what makes this question so hard  the answer is probably yes  for the second half of the season but I just like  what if Zach LaVine is there until February  yeah  that's a hard question man ah dude good question Ian  mmm  I'm gonna say no right now  who do you thinks gonna win MVP this year  I got love it it's probably gonna be yolk at you again  I just don't I don't see how somebody right now passed like Tyrese Halliburton she'll just Alexander these are the sort of Dark Horse options if you want to call it that at this point Luca  I don't see how those guys get more votes than Joker still  should I stick with JJ Jason's value so low people in my league love him so I might be able to get a top 25 or 30 for him just six cats yeah if you can get top 25 or 30 I'm okay with selling I just like that to me is a target for him but I feel like most people are would sell for way less than that in a lot of League's favorite Cal basketball player where's my cow hat there it is up on the wall over there so some of you guys know I went to Cal Berkeley I had to throw Berkeley in there because a lot of people don't know what it is when you just call it Cal it is a  UC school in Northern California known for its nerds and  hippies  which was a delightful time so I mean you know the best basketball player to play a cow was likely Jason Kidd but that was before I was there I was there during kind of like a weird  I was there in a weird time because Cal football got good briefly in the early 2000s and basketball was kind of like a little mess but yeah Leon Poe was their kind of right at the end I think of my tenure  you always have a little bit of a soft spot for guys that played for the team while you're actually in school there but very few of those dudes made the NBA when I was there like do you guys remember Rod Benson who played I think in the NBA for like a year and then went overseas and then started the ball don't lie  no it was a different one what blog did he start that got bought out that he was always a fun one I like the characters man like the characters of cows that's those are my favorite martian Lynch just turned out to be a character who was so very good at football Jalen Williams or Chris Paul points League who do I end up dropping probably ends up being Chris Paul  in a 10 team or but man that's tough  someone dropped Evan vessel and I added him for Zach Collins in a points League good move yeah I like it and that's what that's where we're done 47 minutes and we're out  I did a lot of questions that I wasn't planning on doing but whatever  we're back from Thanksgiving break I want to make it count  good luck set your lineups everybody you got an hour and 10 minutes to do it
