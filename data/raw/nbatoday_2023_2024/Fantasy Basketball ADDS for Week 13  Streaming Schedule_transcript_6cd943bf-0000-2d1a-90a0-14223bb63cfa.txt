welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  today everybody we're running early on this one it's a weekend review and week 13 preview show I'm your host Dan best price this is a sports ethos.com presentation and you're listening to Fantasy NBA today I know many of you are watching playoff football right now so I do appreciate anybody that's taking a break from that to come join us on the basketball side and unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it there really wasn't another time to do this show I wanted to let most of the games from Sunday and if possible Phoenix Portland hasn't happened yet so we'll just assess each of their previous ball games as we go backwards through the weekend  but with the game's tomorrow Martin Luther King Junior Day Dr King Day game starting at 10 a.m. Pacific time  they're really isn't an opportunity for me to do a show in the morning and even if there was it would only give you like like an hour two hours to try to consume it before the game's actually begin so what we're going to do instead today is we're going to go backwards through the weekend reverse chronological lightning styles  lightning round style and then we'll do a quick preview of the upcoming week because we've got a couple of overflow days opportunities to try to get some you know three and four nights kind of things going on we'll check out play injured players coming into the week if you guys have some weekly decisions and then we'll get you back to business with whatever it is you might be doing with your Sunday evening  first things first come find me on social at Danbury I don't know what happened on Sunday but like a large chunk of people found me usually that means that my name popped up on like a Reddit board somewhere but certainly join The Fray at Dan Bosch burst d a n b e s b r i s  uh what else did I want to remind you guys of ethos the sports ethos news feed is ethos fantasy BK the Discord link is in the show description and please please please take a moment to like rate and subscribe whatever however you're taking in this content that actually does end up meaning quite a bit to us here myself personally in terms of the growth of everything we're doing but we got a lot to get through so let's just jump straight on into some of the stuff that happened over the weekend those uninitiated I try to treat every show like there's at least one new person with us we start with Sunday we just go through the games we go backwards to Saturday anybody that didn't play Saturday or Sunday we try to look at their last game on Friday and kind of reset the board for every team in the NBA figure out who's drop who's an ad who's a hold it's impossible to go through every single name but I'll do my very best to try to hit on basically any player that I see that is notable in any fashion and we can just start and go from there  the early game on Sunday Denver beat Indiana 17109 India is still down Tyreese Halliburton and Aaron neesmith for this ball game so Bruce Brown was very much a start TJ McConnell was slower in this one doesn't concern me he's very good in his philan job he was a plus eight and his 19 minutes I'm actually not all that sure why he didn't play more but he's he's your fill in for Tyreese Halliburton  Andrew Hart basically can get you a few points in a few assists but he doesn't do the other stuff that typically McConnell does that's why we favored him in this battle  Obi topping putting up some decent numbers lately he's a stream while warm kind of guy but he's coming off the bench so he's not a guy you can use against your Roto games cap and with Nesmith out buddy hield slid into the starting lineup but he's a guy you can definitely start when he's starting when he's coming off the bench he's someone that's best left alone Denver there's nothing you start the starters there and you just sort of hope that they all work out for you Michael Porter Jr at a nice ball game which I think for many folks felt like that was a bit overdue I think he's at number 67 on the year now which isn't bad but people are like ah what's wrong with Michael Porter Jr the answer is nothing really he's fine  you know he's been a healthy too which I maybe that's the biggest piece of the puzzle of all for him so don't complain when things are going fine  interestingly Nicole yokich for all of his excellent ball games is still way behind Shae Gill just Alexander and Joel embiid for those top few spots and just head of Anthony Davis who had a couple of kind of whack games here lately that's your top four in fantasy but not what you guys came to hear about you guys want to hear about guys that are either on or off of rosters Miami Beach Charlotte Miami doesn't even matter who's healthy for the heat these days they just keep finding ways to win lamelo ball at least his back for the Hornets he's been you know decent in his return very big popcorn numbers percentages that are going to hurt you Terry Rozier and lamelo ball combined to take 47 of the Hornets 95 shot attempts in the Ballgame that's half friends miles Bridges was a start Nick Richards was bad in this one but generally he's been you know on that 100 110 range fill in for Mark Williams who did get upgraded to questionable for this ball game I believe so maybe getting a little bit closer but let's not know that that's actually not true he's still out he was still doubtful I'm thinking of DeAndre Aiden at some point he'll show up again I actually think this is a time when you could buy low on William's because no one expects him to ever show up and you could probably get him for pennies on the dollar I'm a little surprised that PJ Washington didn't do more in his 28 minutes but he's playing again and just given how many guys are out right now I think you  probably could start PJ you don't have to but you probably could for Miami uh Tyler hero was back for this ball game which was a win for them Jimmy Butler still out not that far away and then Jaime aches got hurt Midway through he was having a very good ballgame at the time and those that are watching you can see the graphic on your screen it says outgrowing injury and those are never super duper fast especially if a player has to leave in the middle of a ball game for it  so hopefully he recovers from it quickly but in the meantime Duncan Robinson who was pushed to the bench with hero coming back probably ends up getting more playing time I know hey what Heisman got the start in the second half but his Fantasy game is a little up and down Duncan Robinson is probably the guy you use as the fill in here if as does have to miss a few basketball games or you could just dodge the heat fill-ins all together because Caleb Martin is also back Kyle Lowry is also back they have a lot of options now and if Duncan Robinson isn't hot  is a chance that he just doesn't get to do all that much I think he probably does enough to Warrant a spot start but  I get it if you don't want to because again you play Charlotte everybody's gonna look kind of good they have a way of of bringing all the pieces together for you  this Sacramento Milwaukee game is almost over they're starting the fourth quarter as I record this show right now no surprises on the heat side Kevin herder back in the starting lineup  doesn't matter you know he was fine in this ball game but fine is not going to get it done so the heat basically no changes khris Middleton sitting out the second half of a back-to-back from Milwaukee and Malik Beasley got warm and that was the question that I posed on social media which was hey  Malik Beasley guy who needs more shots  then he is going to get when Giannis Dame and Middleton are all healthy and upright what is Beasley get to do and one of those guys is down we know that when Dame or Giannis is out Beasley gets plenty of opportunity because those guys are the big big big usage dudes but what about Middleton who sort of like the medium medium usage guy and the answer here was that Beasley did get more usage rebounds assists steals blocks of all dried up after kind of a hot start to the year in those departments so this is still tilting more towards three-point streamer formally but certainly when someone is out he makes a lot of sense as a 3-point streamer as a post to like on a normal day where he's just sort of kind of make sense as a 3-point stream and the other nice thing about this Minnesota and Clippers game which also is starting the fourth quarter at the time of our recording is that we don't really have any questions to answer with the Clippers so you know who cares like Paul George is having a quiet or ball game but who cares and he could still get on in the fourth quarter is been great Harden's been great lately the Clippers are very easy team to handicap visas out for this one but Daniel  theis didn't do even remotely close to enough in his philan role to make much sense at all  we're getting visited by my younger son thank you Theodore that's a lovely sticker sheet can you go back and help mommy cook dinner while daddy does a live show  Minnesota also a team that doesn't have a whole lot in the way of story lines Anthony Edwards having a big ball game Jade McDaniels every once in a while he has a game where you're like why can't he do this more often but for the most part you're not changing much on a day-to-day other than trying to figure out if Nas read is gonna be whole hot on a given night and in that case then you start him  okay well screaming child  out of the way let's go back to Saturday because Phoenix Portland hasn't happened yet Boston blew out Houston Rockets did get Dillon Brooks back so I mean that'll help them  get a win here and there it didn't in this one I'm in Thompson 10 and 10 Off the Bench can Whitmore at 22 and 8 but a lot of that was blowout related  sort of garbage time racking up stuff I think with this Houston team you're pretty much just playing Shane Van Vliet and probably Jabari Smith Jr right now in nine cat Whitmore is very interesting we know he can play we know he's a good basketball player but  it presumably guys will continue to come back for this Houston team and in a game that's tighter the minute it's just won't be as readily available  you know Dillon Brooks getting the start and you know you they're basically at their normal starting five right now tari Eason was a guy coming off the bench that we liked a lot but these are the regular starters  for Boston there no surprises basically ever Jayson Tatum got ejected but that's a big fat who cares so we can keep on moving from there  Wizards blew out the Hawks Wizards involved in a blowout we always say oh hey maybe the Wizards can keep a ball game competitive this is not how I thought this one was gonna go but hey  so be it the usual guys did fine for Washington luckily they were able to get there is because it was a positive distance blowout as a negative one Danny has been hot lately so keep rolling with him as long as that continues Delon Wright had a pretty good line here so it did cool to believe those guys tend to do better in blowouts so you can ignore and move Beyond them  as far as Atlanta goes it does kind of feel like this is a game that says this team needs to be sellers at the trade deadline and we've been hearing Deonte Murray's name involved in lots of trade room rumors so it shouldn't surprise anyone to hear that the Hawks are sellers but this is the kind of game that says look maybe we should just sort of like retool  all of it  which makes someone like Clint capela feel very tradable on Yakko Kangoo would get a massive boost in value if they moved to Shante Murray other guys on the team get a bump you know Jalen Johnson saddiq Bey even a DeAndre Hunter who's not in their right now these guys all could potentially get more to do  and there's also and like I don't think this is gonna happen anytime soon because Trey young would lose his mind if the Hawks went into tank mode they're the 11 seed right now so it's only that far out but you can like the writings on the wall this is not a good basketball team  and like I am wondering if any Trae Young led team can be a deep playoff run kind of basketball team just because of what it creates  but whatever this thing is whatever this build is right now it's not working  Oklahoma City beat Orlando she'll just Alexander is fully unguardable fully unguardable  he's questionable for that next ball game but they've got nothing to worry about because the Thunder tied for the best record in the Western Conference at the moment there are no real fantasy stories for the Thunder but I mean Chey holy crap what a year he's having  as far as the magic goes the Go-Go beta versus Mo Vagner at Center thing continues to flex back and forth  probably best left alone Caleb Houston is a three-point streamer for head-to-head leagues at best Jalen Suggs has been unfortunately kind of on a downward trajectory I think you got to give him longer though  I don't know how long it can't be indefinite but he's been good enough to wear he's earned himself the right to continue holding a roster spot his minutes have just been going the wrong way we know it's about trouble he was feeling under the weather so don't overreact to it he had a few good ball games before this kind of weeks stretch but we really we need to see him get a little bit more consistent here that's the thing that's been bugging me it's not the whether or not he's good it's whether he's consistent  and we've seen Orlando come back to earth a lot they got off to a great start this year but they're three and seven in their last ten they're struggling to win away from home they're the eight seed right now and no one's really breathing down their neck because the the other play in teams are pretty far back so they right now are in pretty good shape to have home court in some sort of play in scenario but remember for a while they were like three four seed but they've come back to earth and a lot of that has to do with consistency some of it has to do with injury stuff  Cole Anthony as someone that also like they need him to run hot he was a little bit better in this ballgame but he's a stream well warm dude so  not really one of those windows right now  and you can see that there's some frustration among the Orlando faithful to where they want to get something a little bit more consistent going on  Warriors rested staff rested hurt rested whatever you want to call it and so a lot of other guys got whole sorts of stuff to do Klay Thompson took 23 shots okay Dario charged got another start which may or may not happen when Draymond Green comes back Brandon Putski got a start and he was all amped up to try to fill in for staff so that was a much better spot for him  Jonathan kaminga is trying to play his way into some trade value he had he had a very nice ball game and I got all these questions that were like oh I pick up kaminga do I run against out there every single ball game do I roll shark  the answer with this Warrior's team is  we don't really know right now I'd love to be able to say oh well this is the way exactly how it's gonna happen in like two days but we don't know because Stef will be back and Dre will be back and everything changes when those dudes are out there  among the Fringe your players but gemski is still the one with the best path to Value question for him is whether or not he's fatiguing  and for a lot of these rookies they hit these walls and then they find a way to come out the other side the question is how long does it take them to get there  how many games of feeling tired and like legs in the mud ankle weight kind of games does it take before they regain their strength and I don't know that this is the game to say always he's back baby I think this was a steps out adrenaline kind of ball game and so there's usually kind of a cost to pay on the other side of that but Chris Paul is still out for another month ish something like that and pods as he's so affectionately known is the point guard type player among these dudes that probably figures to see activity but there's no guarantee of that when Draymond and stuff are in there with clay and probably with Wiggins and maybe it's a looney at Center or Center who comes off the bench and does enough  it's really hard to say you kind of need to wait and see  if you're worried about somebody scooping up someone for gems the guy you probably want to just stick on your bench and say all right well let's just see how this plays out  kaminga his minutes will probably bounce around a little bit  um he might be traded in the next couple of weeks as well  I know they're saying he's off limits but do they meet it  we shall see and Andrew Wiggins continue to be very bad so at least we don't have to worry about that we've already talked about Milwaukee so let's jump over that one to Nix and zombie Grizzly's the next word without Jalen Brunson for this ball game so Miles McBride was like I'll be Jalen Brunson for a day and he had 19 points in four three-pointers on 10 shots if you expect that to happen every ball game I have this lovely Bridge I've just built and it's for sale  oh yes  yeah  let's not get nuts Donte divincenzo is a continued play his permanent production this year is crazy I don't know where it came from but you gotta roll with it and certainly the bigger story in this game is the Memphis Grizzlies because the look you're not gonna get me to start miles McBride even if Justin misses another ball game because yeah sure it could stay hot for one more or the opposite could happen and he could shoot two for ten and get yanked early Knicks are not very deep these days after their recent trade but anyway okay so Memphis  Memphis is a situation  they are currently without  the entire starting five I think  they're down Jaren Jackson Jr they're down John Moran they're down Marcus Smart  they are down Desmond Bane  the fifth starter I think was sort of wish and Mark to start the year so maybe you could say they do have their fifth starter but they're down there four most important players right now  meaning  what we get from this ball game  is interesting but we have to treat every single ball game as a one game sample size right now  we know Jazz out for the year  we know Marcus Smart is out probably another seven weeks  we know Desmond Bane is probably out for at least a couple of weeks  JJ it's not entirely clear probably the soonest among them to find his way back okay  so uh  what does that mean we do here well for one oh Santi aldama is also out and then  Jake Laurie you got art in this ball game as well but that one's not quite as important  so the thing number one is  Luke Kennard has to be rostered right now I know he didn't have the biggest game in this particular one  but they're gonna push him as far as he can go and he's there floor spacer and he's playing 30 minutes at night which I don't know how long his body's gonna handle it but if he's gonna play 30 minutes a night he's gonna probably averaged three or more three-pointers  team is bad enough where I don't know how many of them are going to be open but he's gonna take a bunch  so that's number one number two Xavier Tillman needs to be streamed right now at the very least and I don't know what's gonna happen to him when JJ comes back and I definitely don't know what's gonna happen when JJ and aldama are back but they did drop Bismarck Beyond bow so at least that's one player out of the way  but it's still become kind of a three-person monster JJJ will probably play alongside Tillman for long stretches but they're gonna want to play Jaron at Center for some of the time same story for aldama it'll be three guys fighting for those minutes instead of one  how much does it hurt unclear but it will hurt some  so Tillman to play right now certainly while all of the other centers are out  GG Jackson player none of us had heard of until this ball game basically had 20 points and six boards in 27 bench minutes  I am not picking up GG Jackson he might have another big ball game but this one reeks of guy comes in has opportunity goes nuts  David Roddy we've seen enough of him to know that his Fantasy game is actually kind of weak mostly three-pointers doesn't rebounder passed much the steals come and go he's basically a three-point guy which is what I would have said about Luke Kennard except they're going to need him to actually orchestrate a bit  given everybody else's out we saw it in the previous game for kinnairds him rebounds and he had some assists as well  Vince Williams is a guy who probably needs to be rostered right now I call them a speculative out and that was before Desmond Bane and Jerry and Jackson went down now with two more starters on the Shelf it's Williams is going to basically have no a choice but to try to do a little bit of everything so Vince Williams gets in up  Jacob Gilyard is a man I don't think I'm gonna go the Gaillard path I know he's a starting point guard so he's just gonna sort of blindly stumble into a few assists but it doesn't seem like he wants to have much in the way of usage it seems like he's mostly gonna be orchestrating and just kind of setting things up for other dudes so I'll pass on him for the Roto side of Memphis what is memphis's schedule look like this week we haven't gotten to that part of the show Memphis has a game on MLK day and then they're off until Thursday it's a three game weeks and not a particularly great schedule for the Grizzlies if you're looking at Head to Head side and then you're not worried about zyre Williams or John Khan Shah right now so that was what I I don't know if you guys remembered what I just said going through it quickly now Kennard good to go Tillman good to go Vince Williams good to go right now  the other guys I'm probably passing for the moment and then as soon as anybody comes back for the Grizzlies we have to basically just scrap all of that and start over  the Pelicans went zombie mode and they beat the Mavericks you could pretty much throw out the pals side of this they rested all of their key guys know Zion no Ingram no McCallum I think I'm forgetting somebody but it doesn't really matter so yeah her Jones oh no train Murphy herb Jones had a good ball game because all those guys were out Dice and Daniel said a good game because they were all out Jordan Hawkins had a good game because they were all out you'll understand us was the last man standing and so he was fine I don't worry about this the only thing to remember is that if the Pelicans ever have another time where they're like you know what our schedule sucks right now um how about instead of going from altitude to Dallas we just sit everybody down  scanning scanning scanning there really isn't a time until like  four or five weeks from now where that might come up again they've got a Los Angeles Portland to back to back that maybe you see them dump everybody  and so in that case great pick up Hawkins pick up Dyson Daniels pick up herb Jones but until then we don't really have to worry about it so just kind of file it in the back of your mind for one month from now no Luka doncic on the Dallas side Derek Jones Junior heard his calf in this ball game as well so the Mavs go from thin to thinner Kyrie's gonna do as much as he can until his body breaks down I I don't like when he has to play 40 minutes that's that's bad but you can stream Tim Hardaway Jr  I'm not streaming Dwight Powell I don't know where the eight assists came from in this ball game but that you know that ain't sticking  if Derek Jones has to sit as well  maybe you think about a Josh greenstream I don't think I would on the Roto side so I'm probably just going Kyrie and Tim Hardaway Jr for the maps next ball game unless we get some sort of positive news on one of their other players it took a lot but Chicago did ultimately conquer the Spurs without Victor wembanyama this was like a do we really need to pay attention kind of all game Alex Caruso man  every team should sell every piece they have for Alex Caruso  he's one of the most important players in the NBA right now and he does not get the love he deserves he very much belongs on fantasy teams he's number 86 on the year and right now his body is taking the full game punishment let's hope he can stay upright  you generally starting to starters I would assume I had a better ball game in this one for reasons that are not entirely clear mostly because he got hot and shot out of nine but no you're not gonna roll with him  start the starters for the Chicago Bulls  Zach LaVine apparently still on the trade block even though they're winning if anything changes there then we reassess  no Wendy's so keldon Johnson got a little bit more usage again in this one and if you can sell after one good game you should try but I doubt you can so I don't even know why I brought it up Trey Jones man they finally are letting him run some offense and he's been amazing make sure he's rostered and started everywhere as long as he's in the starting five and the Lakers were without LeBron James they lost cam reddish early in this ballgame as well so they got really hachimura back and you know one comes back to go down  D'Angelo Russell 39 and 8 with 6 3-pointers took 26 shots  I mean I said on when did we do our Bi-Lo show last week Wednesday or Thursday and I said Dilo was your Prime Bilo of the week I didn't think this type of game was happening I'd love to say oh this is exactly why I brought up D'Angelo Russell know this was obviously because LeBron was out but what it does give you is a shimmering example of  what Dlow can do when he is giving some leash to work with  kids still got freaking offensive game he can't guard me buddy and he can't rebound but damn if he can't score and orchestrate  he's excellent on offense  and the Lakers  like they just keep saying they need to get their defense better but the offense has been atrocious they got a guard the three-point line and have consistent offense  and this ball game they needed to not foul people  but so funny man I did that long segment on whatever show was after everybody was like layout oh the NBA is rigged the Lakers got all these foul shots against Toronto nobody said a word after this ball game  Utah I think outshot him like 15 to 2 in the fourth quarter or something like that it was almost equally insane number but nobody cared so guys all of that to say  it happens the only time we talk about it is when it's the Lakers so just  forget about that stupid crap  and then I don't have to talk about it again anyway as far as fantasy goes  I expect LeBron will be back for the next ball game but if he's not  D-Lo obviously gets a big boost Reeves usually gets a big boost but he fouled out in this ball game and and kind of got picked on defensively really struggled at that end of the floor in this game  really hot tomorrow is interesting basically if you need points not much else there Tori and Prince if you need three pointers Christian Woods been on a pretty good kick lately and I think had an opportunity to do a little more with no LeBron all so  but again a lot of this assessment is without LeBron which means Saturday had a lot of key guys out  you had their guys in and we had a John Collins resurgent here gave me he was you know sitting like 140 range for the last two months and then all the sudden he had one gigantic ball game was it because they were playing the Lakers who can't rebound or guard anybody you do the math yes by the way that's the reason why Utah has been awesome lately they've been splitting up the pie every ball game but marketing Sexton and typically Kessler who just got worked by Anthony Davis in this one so that's why Kessler's minutes were low he couldn't he just couldn't hang in this ballgame Kris Dunn is someone that I had looked at as a stream lately but because keyonte George was playing so well in this one Dunn's minutes were lower John Collins minutes being higher also impacted guys like oh Chaya Bocce and Walker Kessler and some funky and Kelly Olynyk Utah's Gonna Roll hot and a little bit so the safe ones continued to be marking in Sex and Kessler don't care about this one being one bad game  the next rung down the sort of like more scheduled type plays our Jordan Clarkson Because look he cool off a lot in this ball game  managed to rescue his day with an 8 for 8 for free throw shooting night but you know how things roll with him when he goes hot cold  John Collins is also kind of a hot cold guy I prefer to use him only for schedule streams right now not against the Rogue games cap Kris Dunn is in that next group as well the minutes haven't been quite as safe  typically lately you could use him against the games cap because of all the defensive stats but again I get it if you're not looking for someone who scores 4 Points a game then that becomes sort of a tougher sell uh who played on Friday that didn't go over the weekend that's the game we always play here on whoops that's the wrong day on fantasy NBA today um Philly is one that played on Friday they were without Joel embiid although they're hoping to have him back for the next ball game DeAnthony Melton sounds like he might miss their next one if he re-aggravated his back that would be a positive for Kelly oubre Jr  if he's back for the next one which they expect him to be but if there's no you can go Paul Reed and if there's no MB to end no Melton then you certainly go Kelly oubre if it's just no Melton  Uber's kind of a coin flip in a spot like that so  try to  all right I got my monitor all tweaked here that's something to keep in mind as you sort of roll forward through that  Detroit is another team that didn't play over the weekend the Pistons  made a trade actually on Sunday morning nobody cares Marvin Bagley got shipped to Washington along with Isaiah livers and they brought back Danilo Gallinari I believe I already forgot it doesn't matter for Fantasy purposes I mean nothing at all  because Jalen Duren is the center the only way that this matters is if Duran gets hurt again because they would have no choice but to play James Wiseman  or go all Isaiah Stewart at Center I guess that's still a possibility if you guys are wondering why I am afraid of Jaden Ivy he had 187 and 8 here which sounds fantastic but killed you at the field goal killed you at the free throw line a couple of turnovers  he's appointed League darling that's the long and short of it  Kevin Knox Got the Feeling starred in this one with boy on bogdanovich out but no I'm not picking up Kevin Knox Alec Burks is probably playable in most formats right now  and I think you just have to like sit and pray that Ivy doesn't destroy you in the percentages if you want to go that path I'm not  that was a talk about a trade that didn't matter at all the Portland Trailblazers who I mentioned we would talk about because we haven't their game on Sunday hasn't happened yet their teams ridiculous right now everybody's out for them on Sunday Jeremy Grant out Matisse diebel out IBEW bhaji out Malcolm Brogdon out DeAndre ayton out shaedon Sharpe Out Time Lord obviously out for the year somehow we have any Simons is alive for this game on Sunday night I don't have the first flying clue how that happened but okay um  maybe he puts up numbers before they get blown out in three quarters  we'll see so here's the thing Portland is another team right now that you kind of have to take on the day-to-day because with all of these guys out Jabari Walker's gonna have no choice but to have a big ball game and timani Kamara is probably gonna have a decent game and do UPS probably gonna have an okay game  even if they're getting blown out they're just aren't really other options for the Blazers right now  because they've got like seven guys out  there's nobody left  even in garbage time they're going to have no choice but to play some of those starters  the one that they'd probably say no way would be Simon's but like scoot would probably play in garbage time do we care probably not but the Blazers are a mess I can't possibly in good faith say oh here's a guy to pick up because I have no idea who's gonna play for them and their next ball game  the nice thing about this is we're getting a look at Silly Season early  they're not gonna be silly season the rest of the way at some point they're gonna play their regulars again probably in the next week week and a half  so whatever you get right now assume it's short term but what we are seeing is like okay look late March rolls around Jabari Walker's probably gonna be a silly season winner kind of guy  and maybe do a brief will be as well and maybe to money tomorrow will be as well and certainly Scout Anderson will probably be in that mix  but for now short-term everything short term because everybody's heard on every damn team  and I think Toronto is the one other club oh Phoenix but actually we talked about their last game which was on Thursday so we don't actually have to cover Phoenix Toronto's the other one there were many things to pay attention to their other than kind of trying to figure out who was going to get the backup center minutes and it looked like it might be that young but he got run off the court in their loss and Utah John tape Porter picked up most of the center's minutes and he had a pretty good fantasy game but unless he gets moved into the starting five I'm not picking him up if we find out that Porter is gonna be the starting center for the Raptors going forward I probably would have him but I feel like the next move for Toronto is siakam starting at Center and Gary Trent moving into the starting five  I guess we'll see I don't know yakka pearl is out at least another week so whatever's happening here we're gonna get a few more games to check it out  and in the meantime he probably don't play any of those fringy guys  I'm not playing Porter unless I find out he's starting I'm not playing that young even if he's starting and I'm not playing Gary Trent even if he's starting because I'd like to see him actually get enough shots for it to matter and that was your review portion of the podcast  what about what's

don't want to say a long way but they go away a medium way so whatever you can do on that front also would be excellent thank you in advance for that and let's get now to the week ahead which is a little bit of a weird one because it's MLK week which is actually maybe the best  uh basketball day of the season because you've got games from first thing in the morning until the end of the night and there's a bunch of them  like Christmas on steroids  what a weird way to frame it but whatever that's what it is  so let's take a quick look at it on your screen here if you're again if you got a visual aid for you can be kind of useful this is the streaming schedule that's available to premium subscribers over at sports eat those calm I'm showing you a very small cross-section of it it's much more useful if you can use it in its entirety basically this is your calendar running lengthwise left to right and every team's game and you can see how they line up  Yahoo has something like this that shows you you know like the next handful of games which you can't see it for all the teams you can see it for all the players which is a pain in the butt to try to navigate  so what about what's coming up here well today the 14th it's too late for you to do anything with it at this point so well already looked towards tomorrow the 15th a lot of teams play is likely an overflow days so in all likelihood you probably don't need to use a move on Monday unless you're not maxed out in which case you could look at Philadelphia because they have a Monday Tuesday back-to-back Oklahoma City also has a Monday Tuesday back to back they are in Los Angeles for those but if you're like most teams and you're overflowing on MLK day you're looking to start using moves on Tuesday of this coming week which is a very very light day and nobody has it Tuesday Wednesday back to back  so if you're making a move on Tuesday and you're like oh Denver looks interesting well the problem there is they don't play again until Friday and Sunday  the Clippers play on Tuesday yeah well they don't play again until Sunday  Oklahoma City as part of this back-to-back Monday Tuesday they at least go Thursday and Saturday Philly also only their off until Friday Phoenix they go Tuesday they're off until Friday and Sunday Sacramento has a two-game week but it's Tuesday Thursday so it's sort of lighter traffic days it's a very very strange week  Thursdays not super light I think they're five games on Thursday if I'm remembering right so it's not like that's a day where you can get a massive Advantage but it's very unlikely to be an overflow day and it's why you could almost game out your week to say you know what if I don't need anybody Monday tomorrow  for this moment but I know some of you are going to watch this first thing Monday morning  I could go Sacramento because there are two games are on two of the best days of the week because Wednesday is a 10 game or you might actually have an overflow on Wednesday  that's questionable like you might be a nine games so getting one extra could still help but it probably helps more to guarantee you get that Tuesday Thursday and then on Friday  let's say you went Sacramento someone like a trade Lyle's or a Harrison Barnes or Kevin herder one of these fringy types you play them in Phoenix and against Indiana and some high scoring games then you pivot the calendar and you're looking at Friday Saturday Sunday as an opportunity to try to set yourself up for the rest of the week  so maybe you go two moves on Tuesday and two moves on Friday and call it that's your week that was your four moves  the nice thing about Friday to Sunday is that a lot of teams played twice those final three days in fact I think you can count on two hands how many teams don't  here the teams that don't play twice Friday through Sunday Chicago Cleveland Dallas Detroit Golden State ah the Clippers the Grizzlies Milwaukee Minnesota Pelicans Knicks Thunder  Sacramento has none and then Toronto Utah so there's like  probably half the NBA to pick from  maybe a little bit more  that has two games over that stretch  and so if you want to get really clever  you could look all the way to the following Monday and say okay well which teams then have three games in four days starting on Friday  well you've actually got an okay number there too Atlanta  has three games in four days from Friday of this week on Monday of next week this is a way to start your next week with a nice full schedule Atlanta Boston Charlotte are all choices there you've got Orlando Philadelphia Phoenix San Antonio  I lost track of how many I said there that's seven or eight teams to pick from starting on Friday  so when you've got like you know unfortunately on Tuesday you really only have one team to pick from but by Friday you've got like seven or eight teams to pick from that can get you all the way to the following week and then you're again looking at potentially not making your moves until Tuesday of next week and that's probably how I would look at streaming this coming this upcoming week the last thing I want to take a look at here are the the basically the tough calls which is effectively  starter sit  because there are a bunch of guys where you're in a little bit of a starter sit hell and  best way to do that I think is for me to just basically look at the top ranked dudes and run through them pretty quick she'll just Alexander has a little bit of a right knee issue going on  they've got a great schedule this week so I feel like you kind of have to go for it Joel embed is also hoping to be back this week so you kind of have to go for it there as well  Tyreese Halliburton is a no Luka doncic is doubtful for their game on Monday Dallas is a three-game week  you know he's gonna try to get back in time for their game in LA on Wednesday  oh that's a tough call man because if he ends up as a one game week you're in real trouble  doubtful for Monday  hmm  it's not a good ankle sprain guy's ah man you're probably starting and open you're getting one and a half out of him but boy that's a tough call  LeBron I would say as a go McCollum is a go just looking at him as a guy who missed their last ball game Desmond Bane is a no because his ankle sprain sounds kind of bad Jalen Brunson is questionable for the Knicks next ball game they have a four game week so I would start him and expect that you get two or three or maybe you get lucky and get all four let's keep moving here through the top 75  Keegan Murray  oh he left part way I didn't even realize that that just happened Keegan Murray left part way with a hip irritation King's with this two game week you got to hold him through at least two I mean not hold you  so two game week  they're on good days  probably sit him probably sit Keegan Murray  Jaron Jackson is dealing with the right knee contusion  I Grizzlies are in our notoriously bad with injury reporting  I believe they have a three game week we said before right  JJ if he only plays two games this week oh man hopefully we get more news on him first thing in the morning I I don't know that we're going to though when is there what time is their game tomorrow oh man it's not till 3:00 in the afternoon yeah that's  I'm guessing he'll just be questionable all day until we get a late call and that's a tough one man  oh I'm stumped on JJJ  starred  start him and hope for two maybe  Jimmy Butler's traveling with the heat um he might be back for their game on MLK day it's I believe a four game week for Miami so I might actually consider starting Jimmy Butler this week  man I'm really sitting on that JJ call I don't know what to do there  France vloggers already been ruled out for the MLK Day game so I think you got to keep him on your weekly bench same with Mark Williams DeAndre ayton was questionable for the Sunday game they're off for a couple of days I don't know how you start him without actually knowing for sure that he's playing so that's probably a no Anthony Melton is out  with the lumbar spine issue we don't know how long that's going to take its part of a back-to-back so maybe they're being a little bit careful there but I wouldn't risk it Jalen Brown dealing with a hyperextension of his knee the Celtics go  four times so I think I'd probably start Jalen Brown and hope you get three  how much farther we need to go on this one  all the pills that set out the last one I think you probably sit them Darius Garland sit him until we get some kind of a go on him  and Aaron niece Smith  I mean if there's really any question there then you probably just leave a dude on the bench Indiana four game week that's sort of back loaded so maybe you could go for it if you don't have any other choices there but I don't know that I would take that risk it feels frankly a little bit unnecessary  and that I think is gonna be our show managed to cram it all into about 45 minutes which I think is pretty good as far as pacing goes don't you  quick check here on the chat room question about the Isaiah Jackson Myles Turner minutes split it does kind of feel like the Pacers have been trying to keep Myles Turner's minutes a bit in check he had foul trouble on Sunday though if you're worried about that one he had 5000.26 minutes as a Jackson has been playing better so he's kind of earned you know 15 16 17 minutes and said of 13 or 14 and miles is minutes on the season have been maybe a little bit lower than we all expected he's at 27 and 3/4 basically is under 28 minutes a game that's why he's not in the top three rounds this year I wouldn't expect this to be more a trend really I you know I foul trouble played a role but I also do think that Jackson getting 16 17 18 minutes feels like a repeatable thing for whatever that's worth makes him deeply play  and then sort of on that same vein Parker here asked would you rather go go batad say Isaiah Jackson or trayce Jackson Davis rest of season  well the Go-Go one is whether or not the magic move Wendell Carter Junior because of he comes back then go good we saw the three-headed monsters there was a disaster  we have no idea what's gonna happen in Golden state with Draymond Green coming back so I probably say a Jackson here in kind of a weird twist but he could also disappear so I don't know that any of these guys is one we were like oh yeah rest of season this is gonna work they all are kind of like could things break their way for a couple of weeks  sure why not  who do you trust more Draymond Green or is Xavier Tillman I don't know that either of them is inside the top 100 the rest of the way but the Grizzlies are going to be shutting people down and the Warriors are not so both of these guys have different paths to value  draymond's just getting old now  so um You probably go Draymond just because of his sort of unique stat set and how we've seen Tillman get on these little bursts and then completely vanish  but I'm I reserve the right to change my opinion and like three weeks if the Grizzlies are not bothering to bring any of their guys back and then you go Tillman  crap maybe even go tell me now and just assume that he's gonna get to play down this stretch  is that a good assumption I don't know  should I trade dear and fox for Keegan Murray or Bradley Beal know you should not and how do we view youngest valentina's value the rest of this season  I mean it's seems like he just keep doing what he's doing  he's falling a little bit he's outside the top 50 now but he's still having a great year and you know the  he's  been solid for them probably loses a couple of touches here and there minutes here and there because Larry Nance being healthy again but how long does that even last  Parker says kids don't get the Brooklyn Bridge reference and what he gonna do  I'm an old man now I'm off to go get my voice back by sucking on some
