welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right folks it's streaming Showtime episode 2 today here on Wednesday March the 20th you've got about an hour and a half or so before games begin  that's more than enough time to listen to this show and make your last second long streaming decisions  and we've got some options today again you can find me over on social media at Danbury d a n b e s b r i s  this is a sports ethos.com presentation you can find all the information you need to know about sports ethos and me and our sponsors and our Discord and our products of in  stupidity the show description  no matter how you're taking in today's pod cast so with that  I bring you  schedule analysis  as always for those that are watching live will do just a quick scroll through the board so you guys can see what this week looks like it's specially starting today on Wednesday and yes you probably saw some bright blue as we scrolled through those are critical spots but before we get to the ads  let's start with the drops  who are the worst teams to have players on right now  well the worst is all by itself  and that's the Charlotte Hornets you might be like Dan doesn't Dallas also have a terrible schedule and I'd be like yes listeners viewers you are correct however Dallas plays tomorrow  so while both the Hornets and the Maverick he's each play only one game over the final five days of this week the Hornets have three days off starting today there is absolutely no reason to hang on to I would argue any Hornet for five games or five days with one ball game but certainly not when you can grab a team with four games left that's a big and easy call to make  their sorry there aren't with three games left get your head in the game Daniel you're getting text messages about your kid at preschool and your distracted  three games left the rest of the week lots of choices to go from one to three games and the Beautiful part about it is a bunch of teams play twice before the Hornets even have another ball game so legitimately you're turning three days of nothing into possibly two games and with a third game you don't lose anything on the tail end of the week either  I can make the argument that the Mavericks fall into a similar category but like you have someone on the maps like a Kyrie or a luka Daniel Gafford would be the only one who's a little bit farther down the board where you're like well  Kyrie and Luca you're trying to hold on to even after their game with the Hornets I don't know that there's anybody that's high enough rank even miles Bridges where you're like do I really hang on for any reason at all here like I want to try to make it last but if  you can get so much more out of these guys on the wire these three gamers that are everywhere compared to one game of a hornet  or one game of basically anybody on the Mavericks outside of Luca and Kyrie but again the nice thing about Dallas is that let's say you do have Daniel Gafford you can play him tomorrow  and you can still pivot off of a Maverick for the last three days of this week play somebody that has two games over that stretch  that way you're still getting the game out of the guy you like the most Italy where with the Hornets if you try to hang on and say play Miles Bridges there's no way to get more than one additional game at the end of the week and you really not gaining much in a long-term either so those are your two terrible schedules the Hornets being much worse there are a couple of schedules that are all so relatively bad comparatively these are pretty bad if they were  kind of like in a vacuum but compared to Charlotte and Dallas they're only kind of bad and that's Minnesota and Orlando  Minnesota is the worst of the two they're off for two days then they have two games and then they're off well over three days and then they're off for two more days so it's like the inversion of a five and seven basically the king's play every day that Minnesota doesn't and the Wolves play every day the Kings dozen  meaning Minnesota has a two-game week starting today  that's bad  Minnesota's had a terrible schedule for a lot of these playoffs  now I get it they have two games left the rest of this week and then they have one game over four days to start next week so if you really love your timber wolf say like Anthony Edwards type then yes it obviously makes sense to hold and see what happens but you've got injured nazri you've got an injured Rudy gobert you've got a bunch of fill in level guys and you've got Mike Conley basically  had to head there really isn't that big of a reason to keep these dudes  over that seven game span  whatever you do when you pick up a player now has to be over that week meaning you could drop a timberwolf for a king  and hold for seven days and you'd actually get a three-game bump over those seven days that's wild  truly outstanding  I don't know if I I think I got that right I think they are inversions of one another and then the other one that we were just talking about was or Lando but that one's a little bit no did I say Orlando  come on Dan get your head in the game yes or Lando is the other one they have games tomorrow and Saturday so it's a little bit easier if you have a magic you really like and there aren't that many Paulo points League Franz for everything else basically and Suggs lately has been a lot better you could have if you wanted to do hang on through Saturday make a move on Sunday before they have three days off basically Sunday Monday Tuesday they don't play  that would be where you could gain a bunch of games because then they slip into their two games over seven days  but the worst of it comes after tomorrow away and they're one game over five days on like two different angles you could also make your move on Sunday and still have a one game in five days band they basically have a schedule coming up where after tomorrow they have the schedule that the Hornets have today if that makes sense  excuse me the Mavericks have today so Orlando schedules not the worst thing in the world yet  but it's about to be  so if you want to get out in front of it you could or you wait and you make your move in a day or two days or three days or whatever it is so that fits in a little bit better  now we look over at the best schedules and I'll just put this picture right on Sacramento because there ain't anybody close the Kings play five games over the next seven days that's the best schedule you'll ever have in a seven game Span in the modern NBA outside of like a crazy makeup scenario that doesn't seem to be happening now that covid is not a big time problem all the time  King's play five times in seven Knights Phoenix and Utah they each have a back-to-back and they could also go if you want to go three games in four nights or four and six so there's some flexibility there meaning they have a back-to-back today then they play Saturday and they play Monday of next week same thing for both of those two teams Monday is close to an overload day for next week it's right on the borderline Wednesday and Friday are the max overload days next week so that's where things get a really a herring Boston Portland and Toronto are three teams that all have a back-to-back but on the tail end of a three-game in four day span meaning they go today then they're off then they have a back-to-back Friday Saturday so that was Boston who we just talked about that was Portland that we just talked about right yes Portland and Toronto those teams all have pretty good schedules over the next four days but minimal flexibility because you'd want to hold until Saturday on those  though Portland Toronto they slide into an every other day valuation for a couple of ball games after that Boston  they fizzle out after Monday Boston schedule gets very light after Monday  and then finally Milwaukee has a back-to-back but this is very short sighted they go back to back then they're off for two days so they have one game over four days the big thing with Milwaukee is that they actually have a really good schedule next week because they play on the non overload days so there's three game week might be like you get three games and you give up zero still I don't know how you pick up Milwaukee right now  if you're not gonna hold all the way through next Saturday it's not the best I think I'd probably look more at the bucks on Sunday because then you get that last game this week and you can hold through the the lighter calendar days  but again if you have you know like a Malik Beasley's floating around because the honest is still out easily will be a little bit better Portis is not going to be on the wire and you're probably not extending any farther than that even though someone like a you know a Content might be a little or Jae Crowder was better in their last ball game those are guys that you just you get nothing if you honest is back so it's a very hard call to make if you're planning on holding through next Saturday  Okay so we've given you the bad schedule the teams that you should be thinking about dropping from  we've given you the good schedule's the teams you should be considering moving on to who are the players on those good schedules that you should be considering that's where we want to try to get into the weeds a little bit what's the pickup what's the move there's always something that we got to do out there  well this is what we saw this morning and you know we'll make adjustments as news continues to come in but for the Kings was the best schedule Harrison Barnes and Keon Ellis are the two names you'd want to look at with Kevin herder injured we know that Alice is going to get pretty good minutes right now and he's an insane defensive player if you watch him he's you know hyper high octane guy hopefully you get a three-pointer you know maybe he takes four or five shots if you get up to six that's a big win for him Barnes is just a guy who's fringy in every sense of the universe but five games in seven Knights out of a fringy players generally pretty good I'm much more excited about Keon Ellis because heaven forbid heard or misses a week or someone else gets hurt and misses any ball game in there also played 30 minutes and you might get 15 defensive stats over this next seven days  like you might legitimately get eight Steals and seven blocks or nine and six or something like that these are  you know people throw around the term this like when you a week is not gonna win you a week but on top of what you're getting out of the rest of your team that's how it may be pushes you over the top in that week maybe you're not competitive in a category you thought you were going to lose maybe a category you thought was going to be closed he could tip you in The Winning Side in both of them  I love key on Ellis for the next five games I think this is a great pick up I think you could use them in Roto if you're hunting Steals and blocks there's just a lot of reasons to lean in his Direction that next tier down we talked about was the sons and the Jazz  Roy O'Neil and Eric Gordon are kind of the only guys you look at on Phoenix I'm not big proponents of them all though O'Neill's last ball game was a little bit better  and then for Utah with guys in and out of the lineup Jordan Clarkson still out we don't know about John Collins still for tonight what's the report there do we get anything back on him yet  still nothing  nope still nothing so hard to know but Taylor Hendricks and Kris Dunn would be the possible plays there because Dunn's probably gonna get about 20 to 24 minutes so get you some Steals and assists Hendrix is a guy that could get you you know eight to 10 points six to eight rebounds maybe a steal maybe a three maybe you squeeze in a block and it's seems like you can do it on decent percentages so again you know you take the three games in four nights or you want to extend it to four games in six nights or whatever that's not terrible Hendrix probably my favorite of that group  and then you moved down one more tier I didn't even go down all the way to Milwaukee because I already said Malik Beasley he's kind of the only one you're looking at the next year down was the Celtics the Blazers the Raptors teams that had the three and four but with the back-to-back flipped so it's on the tail end for the Celtics Payton Pritchard is the guy he's probably only gonna get about 19 minutes in this ball game but then he'll probably get 30 plus in the back-to-back when the Celtics rest a bunch of dudes so again over three games now instead of you started tabulated all up and you say all right well 30 30 and 20 or you know 32 32 and 19 or something like that you're talking about over 80 minutes 81 82 83 something like that which is close to three starters level performances out of a guy that can give you points assists some steals definitely some threes decent free throw percent feel gold percent is a little bit up in the air I like Pritchard a lot for these next three ballgames school on the Blazers would be interesting because Simon's is probably gonna arrest one half of their back-to-back  Jabari Walker is more of a rebound stream to Monte Cara is more of a you prayer and then for the Raptors Bruce Brown if he's on the wire this would be a time to pick him back up gradey dick is intriguing not I don't like his Fantasy game all that much but again three days and four nights and then John take Porter who's played about 20 minutes of a Reserve Center role and getting some defensive stats and you know a couple of rebounds and a couple of points as these teams lean into more of a tank mindset those types of guys get a little bit more appealing but again they're not my favorite who are Dan's favorites on this list Keon Ellis and Barnes because their schedule is the best and then of the tier 2 and tier 3 where the schedules are not all that separate Pritchard and Hendrix are probably kind of my first grouping the next group down would be Bruce Brown possibly by himself in that tier and then the third tier down if none of those guys is available that's where you get a royce O'Neill Gordon done scoot  and then everybody else is kind of below that  that's the way I look at that that segment  click of the chat room a handful of you guys were able to squeeze in here  let's see daily rotol League I'm hunting free throw percent Mobley's on The Wire  I think you got to leave him alone I don't sound like he's back I mean if you want to stash him great I have no idea if he's gonna play again  Jess says in a head-to-head Lee I picked up Gary Trend and Andy George yesterday shared a drop one for Portis or trace or saved my last two pickups right I can drop Trey Murphy and use one pickup  Gary Trent is not someone you should be dropping because he has three games in four nights same with Utah this guy's have really good schedules right now unless we're talking about is this day ahead Maybe  maybe that's the question where I got confused because Golden State goes tomorrow  golden state has two games the rest of the week  after today no I'm all turned around here golden state has three  Utah's three um  Toronto has three yeah I wouldn't use a move if you're not gaining a gameplay that was a bit more clear and then New Orleans they still have three games as well and they have a really good schedule next week so I think I probably stand Pat their  Dan would you drop Aaron neesmith to night to grab Isaiah and Stein I'm hunting defensive categories Indiana still has two games left the Knicks still have two games left I think I'd stand Pat I don't think that there's I mean if this is for head-to-head streaming you didn't really don't want to make a move if you aren't gaining a gameplay  Jimmy Butler is in who do I drop on Yoko Kang woo Aaron neesmith or Amon Thompson  a little bit based on statistical need drop is probably Nesmith  would you pick up Middleton for Milwaukee if you was available I don't think Chris plays the back-to-back here for the bucks but for next week for Sunday through their light days next week then the answer becomes a yes thoughts on Isaac okoro and the Cleveland Cavaliers schedule question from Sammy let's take a look at Cleveland I believe they're every other day the rest of this week  um yeah I got no problem with a coral they are four games in six days but the the back-to-back is at the tail end of that so that would end up being Sunday Monday so not a bad schedule if you're trying to front load next week but then they roll right into the Overflow days so it's possible that if you picked up in a coral  you don't gain all that much here I'm fine with it by the way I think it's gonna have an okay line each of these next four ball or however long john Mitchell's out we think about a week so next four ball games but then you probably don't get to use him Wednesday or Friday or maybe even Sunday of next week and so then this this pick up becomes  probably someone you drop on Tuesday of next week so that's fine I have no problem with it the only downside for a crow and Cleveland is that you if you do pick up a cab you're pretty much locked into holding them through Monday so minimal flexibility  even though not a bad schedule you do still get three games the rest of this week  dropping Caruso for Levert question mark four games for Cleveland only three four Chicago and Caruso's questionable tomorrow Cleveland for game are we talking about next week we must be talking about next week no both teams have four games next week  oh maybe you're saying two games left for Chicago this week versus three for the Cavaliers  um  yeah I mean it's not insane because if Caruso misses that game  then  or you're okay so your front loading you're looking to get through Monday of next week know both those teams actually have a game on Monday so it is fourth versus three if you're holding through Monday of next week  um yeah I mean if you have this is one of those moves you make where like you maybe you have some extra moves left over I'm probably waiting until tomorrow to get a report on Caruso because he's been so freaking good this year that I don't want to abandon ship unless I have to you do have one team tomorrow that goes three times in four days it's the Pelicans aren't that many options mind you but there is one so if Caruso gets ruled out tomorrow you could still turn his now one remaining game into a three game week  yes you miss out on Levert who's like pretty decent here with Donovan Mitchell out so if you have that extra movie if you like if you still have three two or even three moves left today you could probably make that swap but if you're down to like your last move if you're in the one to two ish rain I'd probably hang on and make sure Caruso's not playing before you drop a guy who's healthy hard for me to make the call to drop a healthy player to gain one ball game but if you find out he's not becomes a much easier call to make  all right my little guys about to show up from preschool so I got to get off air before he does thank you guys for watching please follow on Twitter at Dan Bass Pros please like rate subscribe take a second to subscribe I'm gonna keep
