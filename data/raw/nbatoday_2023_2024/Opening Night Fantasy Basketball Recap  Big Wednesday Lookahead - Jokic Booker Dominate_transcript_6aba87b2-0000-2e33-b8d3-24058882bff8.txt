welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  well we got one day a games to recap now don't we  fresh new world out there in season episodes  of fantasy NBA today they are officially upon us  and I don't even know how to feel I like my emotions are all over the map  I'm excited I'm in this weird LOL because the effort level of the ramp up to the season was so unbelievably high that my body's like Dan you gotta take your foot off the gas at the same time this is not the moment to take your foot off the gas  this is when you got to be extra vigilant  to find out if anything is taking shape in a way that either we did or did not expect  first thing is hello everybody this is fantasy NBA today I am your host Dan Bass Pros opening night recap show where all going to Mush it in together and do a big Wednesday preview on this one because well there were only two games on opening night and so if we just did a recap that we'd have a nine-minute show Max  and that's probably not worth my time also um when  possible I am going to try to fit both of those elements the recap and the look ahead into one program there might be days where you have  like a big card and then another big card  where it might be easier to split them up again most of the time we'll try to get them into one show together that would allow for more specialty episodes Buy Low sell High stuff like that we can do kind of you know one off special shows and and move from there  I want to start the recap here  by reminding everybody of something very important about fantasy sports and that is  it's a long long season  good things happen on day one bad things happen on day one good things happen on day two bad things happen on day two  because one good thing or one bad thing happened on the first game of the season for your specific team or your specific player that does not make them true for the whole year so for instance as an example I'm going to be talking I'm going to give an example on both sides of this Chris Paul who you know couldn't throw a stone in the ocean in yesterday's ballgame but ended up with 14.6 boards nine assists two steals six out of seven free throw shooting ended up with a really nice ball game  I loved it because you guys know how many places I end up with Chris Paul I am every time I think I'm out they pull me back in kind of thing with him that doesn't mean it's gonna be this good every night  you'll notice I'm not taking a Chris Paul Victory lap today because one game do it a Victory lap after one game is like guaranteeing that the karmic gods are gonna come down and smite me  on the opposite side Devin Booker had a massive first game  I'm not gonna get off of my position which is I don't think he's that brilliant of a passer  and you guys out there who disagreed with me on that shouldn't be taking a Victory lap either because the karma Gods will slap you down too  this is why we assess things over the entire season let's get into some of the recap stuff I've already got the page ready to go here it is it's shared I want to get up to the first game on the board from yesterday Lakers lost in Denver 119 107 Denver it's the weirdest damn phenomenon despite being the world Champs they still have somehow convinced themselves that they're The Underdogs to the Lakers and so they actually came out with more fight than La did  and the way we know this to be true is because Michael Malone played his starters 36 minutes  yolk got 36 Gordon 35 Jamal 34 kcp 36 Michael Porter Jr a scant 30 minutes  while the Lakers played LeBron 29 and then came out after the Ballgame to say that he used to be on a season-long minutes cap  Anthony Davis played 34 D'Angelo Russell actually led the team in minutes at 36 but Austin Reeves 31 Torrey and Prince 30  this game seemed to me more to the Nuggets than it did to the Lakers which is kind of unusual when you figure the Nuggets swept him out of the playoffs last year but it's actually one of the reasons why I kind of like the nuggets on the spread in this game we didn't get into betting stuff on yesterday's show well touch on that a little bit as we work our way through the season this year it won't be a main focal point but it will come up from time to time uh from a fantasy standpoint the notes on this game are at least the things that I was looking at on the Nuggets side would anybody take up the Bruce Brown mantle or frankly just the Bruce Brown minutes and after day one the answer so far is no  nobody took the Bruce Brown minutes Christian Braun got a couple extra Reggie Jackson actually got a bunch extra they went smaller  Zeke nnaji played 12 Peyton Watson played 11  the bench for Denver was basically a non-factor in yesterday's game I read Jackson did like some stuff but when you figure  like the Lakers went I don't know I mean Max Maxwell Lewis and Max Christie got in there for the last minute 15 and junk time Jalen Pickett did the same over on the Nugget side if you remove that Denver went 90 and I think the Lakers went 10 Deep  because jaxson Hayes played seven minutes  but the Nuggets going 90 like that doesn't even really tell the story because it was 24 minutes 19 minutes then 11 and 12 for their bench guys for the Lakers you had an 18 yet a 22 yet a 16 he had a 16 they were just more of them why am I getting into all that stuff which seems like we're digging way too far into the thick stuff we've left the Fairway here on this discussion to say for Denver you're five starters are your plays right now  we talked a bunch on this show through the draft season about kcp being like a kind of 90 to 100 range quiet plotter not super exciting Fact one of the questions on yesterday's pod was would you start kcp tonight and I think I said yeah if you need the reason steals you started and he got you two threes and three steals  all got 20 points which is not something that's gonna repeat itself but  Tuesday or two threes three steals  that's what you need he's a guy that's gonna get him for you yeah and that'll probably be enough to when you're looking at just fantasy ranks standpoint in nine cat that'll probably get him inside the top 100 if but barely over the course of the year but it's still good enough  meanwhile to do the  superhero voiceover over on the Lakers side Tori and Prince got the start played 30 minutes at small forward Jarred Vanderbilt was out so that was a factor really hachimura didn't get to play very much so that was a factor  did I liked what I saw at a Tory and Prince Yes actually I mean you know got wide open three pointers and hit a bunch of them but he's not gonna shoot six out of eight from the field in every ball game he's not gonna make four threes and every ball game the lack of rebounds assists steals he did sort of fall into a block is a thing that will hold him back I know he had a big ball game yesterday but you have to remove the a basically the things that are anomalous which is 75% shooting  if you assume over the Long Haul he makes between three and four of his eight shots of 6 that pretty dramatically swings his line from yesterday from 18 points for threes to something more like 9 points two to three threes and not a whole lot else  from a streaming standpoint on the head-to-head side I guess I would get it Lakers have a pretty good schedule this week we don't know if Jarred Vanderbilt it's going to be back for those games but I wouldn't spend a road ocaps game on Prince and I certainly am not adding him in any format where I have a roster slot that I want to kind of keep through LeBron was decent but 29 minutes is a problem and this is why throughout the whole damn draft season I don't know if anybody yelled at anyone as much as I yelled at you guys about not drafting LeBron James this year I said if he falls into the 40s I would look at it he never fell into the forties the Lakers want to keep his minutes down and everybody's in a full-blown panic right now on Lakers Twitter oh the Lakers can't win if LeBron James doesn't play 36 minutes of ball game friends the Lakers lost to the Champs they lost to the best team in the frickin NBA don't worry about it this isn't something that they're going to change the plan on after one day yes I do think LeBron eventually works his way into the low 30s but I don't think you're getting that 3536 number from last year you're not getting 22 shots a game from him you're not getting nine or 10 assists per game and if he misses his free throws the upside is pretty severely caped  this is why I said fade  I like the minutes for Anthony Davis I expect to feel goal percent will be fine you know as a game where he just got rolled by yoke itch Austin Reeves same story field goal percent will be fine he got himself to the free throw line didn't hit him in this one but I think actually generally encouraged by his minutes and his production and then maybe my favorite storyline on the Lakers and I know he's getting roasted for like taking an ISO 3 at some point yesterday but that's D'Angelo Russell  who was a plus one plus minus in this ball game so that's good for him he is generally playing harder  and he's gonna run hot and cold he went four for 12 shooting in this game he'll go six for 12 in a future game it'll balance out to somewhere in the low 40s  11 points for boards seven assists a steal in a couple of three pointers on a bad shooting night is a really good outcome for Dlow  because a better shooting night and this game is 17 points  for boards seven assists a steal and a couple of three-pointers or maybe even three of them  and the midpoint on that  if he's getting around 14 points a game and over six assists tonight with threes and steals then this is a guy who was falling into the early one hundreds and fantasy drafts and he has a potential to be a pretty nice hit so I like that  game two on the docket I think probably had both more and less to talk about from yesterday which is weird way to frame it but both Phoenix and Golden State had a critical piece out in their lineup for Phoenix it was Bradley Beal  and that allowed Devin Booker and Kevin Durant and Eric Gordon mind you to do more than they would have done if he was there  because look if Beale is there  he takes basically all of those Aragorn shots sorry Gordon you're not taking 16 shots when Beale is upright because nobody else really wanted to shoot all that much Joshua kogi had a good ball game but he shot 78% that's not repeatable nerc only took eight shots at five fouls I honestly think 28 minutes is probably a pretty good Target for him  but Booker 21 shots Durant 22 if we think Beale is going to come in and try to get up near 20 as well that's probably a recipe for book and KD to come down a little bit  is anybody worried about Kevin Durant having a bad shooting game you shouldn't be he's Kevin Durant  we can pass I think we can gloss right over here the story lines I would think on the Phoenix side are number one Devin Booker 32 points 6 boards 8 assists three threes and a steal on terrific percentage is yes he had six turnovers but that's because he was the only ball handling guard  basically at all on this damn team yesterday Jordan Goodwin played 14 minutes but  that's the closest facsimile they had to a point guard getting out there besides Booker  so  this I think is one of those moments where I want people to try to take a quick step back  not run the Victory lap not throw up the mission accomplished Banner but in fact look at this for what it is which is a perfect opportunity for Devin Booker to get off to a fantastic start  because beel not that he's gonna take a lot away from Booker but he will take some because we heard them talking about how they wanted Beal running some point to get Booker off ball a little bit more Booker as we've seen in games where Chris Paul wasn't there in the past has a very high turnover rate when he's the primary point guard because he is only a decent passer and not a like preeminent point guard level passer  I saw a few folks post on Twitter last night that Booker had an atheist game in their like he's gonna average seven to eight assists guys I'm pretty sure that this is going to be one of the higher assist totals you see this year and it's also worth pointing out he got three of those assists in the final two minutes of the ball game you gotta know context and you also need to kind of understand averages because if this is one of the good ones then they're going to be games where there are four three four assist nights and it's going to average what did I say during the run-up  between five and a half and six and a half was my target for Booker  7 to 8 to 8 plus  like do we really think that this was the midpoint for him  I get it it's a huge ball game and I'm not here to pour a bunch of water on it because if you have Booker yesterday you got to really damn good start and everything other than turnovers he shot the ball well he's basically the only player  or only like  big time player outside of what Nicola yokich  I guess LeBron shot at okay but like most of the big name players and we'll talk about the Warriors in a minute most of the big thing players could not throw a stone in the ocean  Kevin Durant had one of his worst shooting games he'll probably have the entire season here on opening night  Booker hit everything the three threes also a high number for him he doesn't usually hit three three-pointers tonight the six rebounds high for him please I know you want to look at this with rose-colored lenses my job is to try to make sure everybody looks at everything in a pragmatic way and for Booker not that you could like sell high on a second rounder because what are you gonna get a late first round of him and you're not gonna get it after one ball game just make sure you understand that when Beal comes back and things level off this was one of the better all around games  not the best to have some other really good ones mixed in there because he's Devin freaking Booker and even when I was down on him I still thought he was a reasonable late second round kind of grab I used didn't want him near the turn  and I still don't think he's going to be at the turn  after one good ball game it doesn't really change my opinion of that because the shooting was exceptionally High there was no other point guard out there with him  and six turnovers again yeah that matters  and one combined defensive stat that that matters  this is why by the way based on just z-score alone I know you can't go on that Aaron Gordon technically had a better game yesterday than Devin Booker I know technically you'd still rather have a book but I'm just pointing out a couple of things Yusuf nurkic I like it 28 minutes for him is a good sign don't expect big scoring numbers but if he can facilitate a little bit he got his three assists rebound a whole bunch he did that Durant I think is going to be rebounding a lot book or not a block hopefully he can get a block of steel some fraction of a big fraction called like you know 0.7 to 1 of each would be swell  I'm encouraged by this first game in Phoenix for him  I'm encouraged by Drew Eubanks if you're looking at a slightly deeper format three blocks is good but bad shooting bad free throws bad turnovers not good 19 minutes isn't enough let's be honest you Banks we've seen him before he needs to get closer to starters minutes to really be a 12 team her but as a deeper League guy he's interesting Grayson Allen  wet fart of a first game you can throw him in out in the old garbage Giroux  and in terms of the era Gordon stuff no chance I'm picking him up in Roto head to head if we find out that Beale is missing any more time you probably throw Gordon in the mix and just hope that he has a better shooting night kind of the old close your eyes and pray night for him because if this terrible night levels off with a not quite so terrible night 16 shots is enough to get some kind of fantasy value on the board and that's the Phoenix Suns data point without Bradley Beal  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your

be 2021 plus not available in all locations up over on the warrior side and we'll have to do kind of some similar stuff here Steph Curry only one assist in yesterday's ballgame  I would caution folks not to get too down on Steph after one game because I think first of all I was in foul trouble he had five foul so he only played 30 and a half minutes that number will probably be higher in typical competitive ball games again this is just like the trying to make sure that everybody sees things for the one game that it is  Steph  well first of all no dream on green which should preface the Warriors discussion with the lack of Draymond which makes everything go kind of into the toilet for the Warriors that's the way it's always been they've built what they do around Steph and Draymond those two guys need to be on the court for the Warriors to be the Warriors  because Drake is excellent  at facilitating and Steph draws so many Defenders out him and Dre is such a wide body man he sets these screens teams just leave him and so Draymond drives down the middle find somebody whose wide open because you can't just give them an unimpeded path to the rim even Draymond can make a damn layout and that's for the Warriors operate but they didn't have that guy Kevon Looney is not that guy he sets good screens but he's not the the passing threat that Draymond did so someone can just step kind of near him force him to make a tough play going to the rim and Looney's not gonna be able to finish that  so it's just a different monster therefore you saw more actually shuttle into the hands of Chris Paul who while I'd love to throw my own ticker tape parade I am a pragmatic man fully aware that  I don't want to say this is gonna be one of the better games of the year for Chris Paul but from an assist standpoint nine is probably one of the bigger numbers you'll see  he still Chris Paul so he still got to find his way into a sis and his team didn't shoot well so he'll get assists easier than he got last night  and that's sort of The Balancing Act with him where if his teammates could shoot better in this ball game Paul might have had a 11 or 12 assists you yesterday but once Draymond comes back that number is going to come back down again so I would think something between seven and nine is a reasonable Target for CP3 the Steels are going to be there the boards were a little bit high for him I don't think that's gonna stick and then the field goal percent while obviously be better than 27% I don't know that he's gonna get back into that high 40 steady was when he was younger because look Chris Paul was drafted in 2005 I think he's the third oldest player in the NBA behind LeBron and PJ Tucker right now um  and so the 14 points  I mean that seems kind of reasonable I don't know that he gets 15 shots every ball game  efficiency will be better A lot of stuff with CP3 was like well this will happen but then this will also happen so as I look at this ball game for Chris Paul who is someone that I'd love to like jump in front of you guys and yell yay we did it kind of thing  this is probably a better opportunity for him because of Draymond you'll see better games from him when the opportunity isn't as good and so overall it probably levels off to something maybe just a hair below this in the category that you're hunting with him most notably assists and Steals and then the stuff that you're not on Hunting as much which is like points there's a possibility that that could actually improve some games some days as well as three pointers they missed all of those and he did take a few  also of note kind of looping back around to the Steph Curry side because Chris Paul was the guy orchestrating  that took Steph out of his usual role which was the primary with Draymond on this screen and then Steph able to distribute off of all of the attention he draws I would expect that to drift back in career's Direction he'll get to do more when he's not in foul trouble he'll get to do more when Draymond is in there at the big man's spot  I wouldn't worry about that Steph's not gonna average one assist for ball game but with Chris Paul around now kind of in addition to Draymond  yeah I think there's a very real chance that Steph's  assists aren't quite as high as they were last year at 6.3 maybe they dropped down into the high fours low fives  feels like something that could very easily happen  also of note on the Warriors side a brutal brutal performance from Andrew Wiggins I mean that was about as bad as it could have possibly gone  I have zero and Andrew Wiggins is on any of my like 10 11 total fantasy teams this year so this one didn't directly impact me but watching it happen I was sitting there going oh what's going on here  he'll play his way into game shape a little bit better but he did only play 27 minutes and it's possible that Jonathan kaminga getting better my actually hurt Wiggins more than we thought  like the  and by the way Moses Moody played relatively well in his 18 minutes on top of that in Gary Payton the second played 22 minutes off the bench so the thing is right now for the Warriors they have a little bit more depth I think this year than the last two seasons at least that they trust with kaminga getting better a Dario saric being a little bit of a better floor space in back Moody being someone they trust Payton being someone they Trust  Corey Joseph played four minutes and was a minus 12 by the way in yesterday's ballgame so I don't think that he's gonna be a guy they trust regularly  but all of this stuff rolled together do you think that's gonna impact Steph know  Klay Thompson know Dre know  CP3 Maybe  but probably know  and unfortunately the guy left over where you're like well maybe it could eat in a little bit is Wiggins if he's not having a really good game with the laser focus and really like all things locked in you saw it yesterday he just lost out to kaminga and Moody and Peyton as they went to slightly different looks  we can so it's a team worst minus 22 in his 27 minutes basically  every line of he was in was trash and yes yesterday's game do I think he'll be better yes  do I also think that last year was a little bit fluky remember he was like a top 40 guy until he had all the family stuff go down everything was just way over out over his skis last season you're not dropping him  oh I need to say that and then Klay Thompson 15.7 boards three assists a Block 33 pointers the shot wasn't there I liked the general activity and he led the team in minutes played at 36 which is also I think a good sign  one of the fears I saw initial reactions was that he looked slow and I mean yeah see you know two catastrophic injuries I think he plays himself in a pretty good shape this year I'm fairly bullish on Klay Thompson  and again  give me clay get an 18 shots a game and I kind of don't care what else is going on 36 minutes and 18 shots he will have a good fantasy season question for him becomes does he shoot 40% three four five six what's the number there because that's what moves his value around is he alive volume 43 because that's hurting you or is he a high volume 45 and a half because that's only hurting a little bit but three to four threes a game is well within reach he had four threes a game last season the rebounds were kind of high here that's not something that's gonna stick the assists  two to three repeatable you got a block no steals those will probably flip-flop in most games and then obviously you'd love to see him get to the foul line twice I mean you take it is a really good foul shooter but I generally I like what I saw there I think everybody wants to know my thoughts on Jonathan kaminga he played a solid 20 minutes he was in and out of foul trouble early in this ball game so could there have been more last night yes but when Draymond comes back that's going to squeeze him a little bit there so it was another one of these things was like and I don't know how long dreams Gonna Miss hopefully not too many ball games but coming out has this golden opportunity right now with no dream on to step in there and outplay Andrew Wiggins and just soak up a whole bunch of forward minutes and the fouls cooked him yes yesterday  but he's probably streamable on the head to head side while green is out  when Draymond comes back I would I'd like to see how that develops before I make any more suggestions  uh before I pivot into the big Wednesday look ahead I wanted to quickly remind everybody like And subscribe we're in in season mode now people this is a fresh new universe of all  critical time sensitive basketball information all the time  and all so  for most of these shows specially ones who are where we're not mushing them together use the YouTube chat room we'll get to all the best questions and comments at the end of the program try to do that every day if I can time dependent today I think we'll be able to because the recap only took 20 some odd minutes and the look ahead like a lot of it is just things that we're going to be looking for here so it can't possibly take that long for us to do it so I'd love to get some good questions at the end as well throw those in the YouTube chat they'll be part of the Show everybody's gonna get to hear it live viewers after the fact those on the traditional pod channels so again like rate subscribe and find me on Twitter over at Dan best Force we had our first tweet storm of the year last night of already got a thread going today on what to look for tonight so it's basically like hey if you missed this part of the podcast where am I do the look ahead I type of a lot of it up find me over there it's at Dan Vespers d a n b e s b r i s I expect you guys will find me over there right here in the middle of the damn show because there's 50 some other of you watching live I don't know that they're gonna be many 100 at least on YouTube that watch after the fact and thousands that listen after the fact that if you're not finding me on social you're missing out let me make that a little bit bigger for you guys that are watching there's the name at d a n b e s b r i s  let's talk upcoming games I'll try to make this as big as I can for those watching like large size font yes I'm using the basketball monster site because I think it's very short and clean and my computer can load it quickly but let's just go through this piece by piece we'll start at the top and we'll work our way through the Atlanta Hawks I'm curious about the wing minutes and the center minutes so guys like yandere Hunter saddiq Bey Jaylen Johnson Clinton capella on yeco Kang woo that's all on the board for me for the Hornets I'm interested in everybody's role  that's not named lamelo ball which I know is a lot but the Hornets is a team I'm going to be watching so I would suggest you actually take in these that like it's hard on a 12 game night because there's a number of games I'd like to be watching for realsies today and I just you can't because there's too many games as the season goes will be able to sort of laser focus what we're really watching night to night here's a key game here's a key game there's like seven key games out of 12 tonight so we'll do our best but the Hornets are very much at the top of the board I'd love to know what Terry Rozier is gonna look like this year you know miles Bridges being in this legal stuff is is murky but we haven't heard anything about his status for tonight  or if we did it just zipped past me someone in the chat room can be update me if I missed something but that means that between Bridges potentially being back and Brandon Miller being added to the mix and resigning of PJ Washington Mark Williams is the center  what is it mean you know Gordon Hayward is all so still part of this nonsense I want to see what everybody's doing on that team that's not name the Bella ball for the Wizards Daniel Gafford like to see if he gets normal starters minutes and then beyond that it's just sort of how does how did the Jordan Poole Kyle kuzma tyus Jones ball sharing stuff develops so nothing too deep into the weeds there for the Pacers I'd like to see what I'll be topping looks like but he heals job with the team right now with no contract extension so like they're he's on the Block  so does that mean that they showcase him does that mean that they try to keep him healthy neither somewhere in between I'd also like to see if Benedict mathura and showed some growth in his Fantasy game during the off-season but he'll be hard to know that from just one night whereas we might be able to get a little bit of an answer on some of the other stuff there  for the Celtics we actually just got word as I was talking um no actually it was like a half an hour ago Alpha for Ford will be coming off the bench so that answer is one question about Derek white on the on the Celtic side Hartford was someone that I considered with the last round pick in 1415 round drafts in rotol League's I generally left him alone and with him coming off the bench I just don't think there's going to be enough left for him there even though there are a few minutes net front court that are open they'll probably just go smaller the next my main question there is around Josh Hart meaning can he continue to get his high 20s minutes off the bench that he got down the stretch last year does the addition of Donte divincenzo muck that up or does he mostly muck up the Quentin Grimes stuff so it's that shooting guard small forward spot I guess you throw RJ Barrett and that mix as well that for the next I'm thinking what is this about to become the rather spots on the quarter are fairly well intact and then Emmanuel quickly who didn't get a rookie extension does that mean that the Knicks are out on him does it mean that they just couldn't come to a deal that both sides agreed on is this still a guy that they're going to prioritize or is this a guy that they're going to start to  kind of slowly Slough towards the edges if he's not part of the future that they deem at some point this year  for the Rockets everything I want to see if Alpine can lock down full starters minutes or if he loses out to more defensive minded backup center in jock landale  I want to see what Freddie's job is with this team I want to see how many shots Dillon Brooks is going to take and same story for Jalen green I want to know what Jabari Smith Jr looks like I want to see what Atari Easton's out I want to see what I'm in Thompson is doing with this club there's just like it's everything for the Rockets it's everything that's it that's a game if possible try to watch for the rocket side so so far the really interesting ones Charlotte and Houston where we have a crap ton of questions of the seven teams that we've mentioned so far for Orlando I don't have that many fantasy questions about the magic you know I think faults is locked in as the starter you know we're hoping to get some growth out of Franz Wagner and Paolo bunk Cairo and Wendell Carter Junior is still this Center there I don't know that anybody else is really going to emerge on that team obviously if they do want to be on top of it but it's it's not one of my priorities at least at this exact moment  the wolves  I actually think the wolves are going to be better this year then people and I'm sure they're going to lose tonight to make me look like an idiot but whatever it is just one ball game slo-mo is my main question for the Timberwolves does he still have enough minutes to make an impact off the bench because he probably that's nice where he's going to be sitting here and then how does the cat go bare stuff shake out because we didn't get to see that many games of those two guys healthy together last year and now that Anthony Edwards is kind of grabbed the reins on this team what does that mean for the cat and and go bare stuff for the Raptors my main question is revolves around Gary Trent because I know enough about Dennis Schroeder's Fantasy game to know where he tops out Trent is the guy who has fantasy appeal as a 3-point super steals specialist but if he just doesn't have confidence in it or if the team doesn't have confidence in him I don't know how he gets to that Mark  we'll get an answer I hope tonight  for the Pistons this is also kind of an I need to see everybody sort of team but I'm a little bit less intrigued by these guys because as we saw with Detroit last year most of the key players on that team have if efficiency issues that hold their Fantasy game back and that's including Cade Cunningham who hopefully as a better fuel goal percent but there's no guarantee that that happens now he'll be fine cable have fantasy value the question is revolve around everybody else besides arguably Jalen Duren  so as her Thompson can he  beat down his own efficiency issues with counting goodies does Jaden Ivey still have enough to do they have any floor spacing with boy and Bug Donovan shout for a month  I mean I get it there's so many games to try to take into tonight I think you could probably get away with just watching the Pistons box score develop on a quarter by quarter basis but there are a lot of questions on that club and hopefully game one will answer at least a few of them the Heat  who takes Gabe Vincent's minutes  Josh Richardson I think is banged up I can't remember if he's playing in this ball game sorry guys there's just too many players to keep track of so it could eventually be Richardson  but at the beginning of the year I think it's Kyle Lowry  he's going in the 150s and fantasy drafts I think he's worth like that last round pluck or if you wanted to grab him off the wire and just see what happens because  and I say this not with the expectation that anything good is necessarily going to happen with Lowry  but if you recall before the typical Kyle Lowry season long battle with injuries started about seven eight weeks into the season last year he was a top 80 guy  I don't think it's gonna happen again but it could a Cavaliers know Jared Allen so you'll get you know more Evan Mobley at Center that's always a good thing for him but I think the stuff we're watching with the calves on the more long-term basis is do any of the shooters emerge as that sort of extra fantasy play Beyond Donovan Mitchell Beyond Darius Garland and Jared Allen around Mobley so we'll we'll keep one eye on that but again not one that I think we need to laser focus on for the Nets I think the big question is about Ben Simmons I'd like to see what he looks like in a real game so if you can lay eyes on him and see what his stints on the floor look like just from a speed standpoint more than anything else a confidence standpoint I could give us a pretty good idea of whether he's a you know sell guy off of a big ball game or if he's a buy guy if things aren't going his right his way  there could be something there  rest of the Nets I'm not super concerned about I think we have a pretty good idea what they're going to be for the Pelicans I'm interested in the distribution of touches with their big usage guys all on the court Zion Brandon Ingram CJ McCollum being the three big usage guys and then how does anybody else slot in around those dudes if at all and they very well might it might be a three-horse situation here maybe you get something out of  like a herb Jones if he's stealing the crap out of the ball and  can JV give you like 10 rebounds and not much else man  stream Murphy come back in a month and a half and does he become an efficient shooter Maybe  Grizzlies have a bunch of questions who soaks up the sentiments is it going to be all Xavier Tillman or or do they run JJ up there for a bunch  how does Marcus Smart fit in right out of the Chute is Luke Kennard gonna play because he was actually really good the last couple weeks last year and nobody's talking about him at all so I have a bunch of questions on Memphis and I might watch that game  Thunder  and I don't care I'm not that interested in the Pelicans but I do want to see what's going on with the Grizzlies for the Thunder  I think we all just want to know what Jets going to do on opening night I don't know there's a whole lot else that were overly concerned with for the Bulls Kobe white is somebody to keep an eye on also just they know they're trying to run sort of a faster offense so what does that mean for tomorrow for Levine for vouch Bulls are I think a pretty easy one we don't have to be on I think we have to watch that one live either but the king's I don't have that many questions we'll see if Keegan gets an extra shot per game maybe rebounds a little more but that teams healthy and year-over-year Personnel wise there wasn't a whole lot to shake up Jazz have a ton of questions that's that I'd like to like I'd like to watch that game to see what Utah is up to because we don't even really know who's gonna be their point guard we don't know what Colin Sexton is gonna be doing this year we don't know if it's going to be tht what is Jordan Clarkson's role  who's going to get the ball to The Bigs like Walker Kessler is John Collins gonna have a an anger fueled bounce back year Larry Martin does he take a step back with out a point guard does he take a step back because of the guys around him now the Jazz have questions coming out of the you know what  for the maps I think we're mostly interested in it will anybody else make annoys Luca and Kyrie because down the stretch last year the answer was no  could Seth Curry carve out a role or does that make the team too small could Derek Lively carve out a role or is the rookie stuff gonna eat him up does it become I mean they got four guys they can play at Center on that team  does any do any of them emerge Spurs Wendy obviously we want to see what Wendy does here in game one but a lot of the Spurs and this is sort of a Pistons adjacent kind of discussion a lot of the main Spurs guys had big efficiency issues last year Jeremy Sohan bad percentages Calvin Johnson bad percentages uh Trey Jones better percentages but no threes and almost all just assists and Steals and very little else  and they just ran these guys in on a rotation  and none of them could get there in nine cat because of those anchor weight categories  ankle weight I guess would be it'd be an anchor or an ankle weight can't call it anchor wait dan that's you you're butcher in it but this is a chance to see if anybody made some some moves forward  Zach Collins is 50/50 right now he's dealing with a cold you did go through shoot around it's the latest news on him as did Darius Garland by the way that news broke a little bit early this morning as did Luka doncic so good news on that front we do have a James Harden update that I'll throw in here at the very end of our look at even though Philly doesn't play until tomorrow but for this Spurs I mean I said it actually a bunch during the run-up season I'm I'm concerned about investing a whole bunch of my draft and team capital in the Spurs Devin vassell by the way another was free throws were better and I mean he was another guy that had some percentages issues last season so can anybody improve enough in those to really take that Leap Forward Portland you got to watch Portland that's a that to me is a must-watch fantasy team right now because I want to see what Simon Says doing what's good is doing what Grant is doing what eighteen is doing if Brogden gets to play there's a lot shade and sharp there's so much going on with Portland  that we might just need to see what the team looks like playing together as a posted just checking a box score for the Clippers unfortunately the other side of that game I'm not that interested in seeing them on a moment to moment basis because we know the Clippers trade off offense between Kauai and Paul George Russ is the guy they're hoping can help distribute a little bit better and it not always be Kawhi and PG bringing it up and starting the offense blah blah blah blahs are pretty much the same as they were at the end of last season the news on the James Harden front has been its I can't say coming Fast and Furious today because it's basically no news but it is coming Fast and Furious today that he has and whoa Chad a super long tweet about it what I think 13 minutes ago actually here's the Tweet I'll just read it quote while hardened in the Sixers talked further following practice the plan remains as they discussed earlier today sources sell ESPN instead of going on the opening Road Trip the team directed hardened to report to practice facility and work with development and medical staffs to get ready to begin season as soon as possible  presumably while he's on the trade block here I think they're trying to get him moved before the team comes home from their two games on the road  and if he's not moved by I guess that would be Sunday  maybe we see him  I'll believe it when I see it but that's the latest on James Harden and  I don't know if that means anything at all  let's get into the questions from the YouTube chat room because that's what's going on tonight that was again this is a much longer one of those than normal because there's something happening in almost every ball game and I wanted to really highlight a lot of stuff let's see here do do do do do do do  here I'll put this one up there because I want to talk about this I don't think this is zoom balloon says I don't think we booked her owners are going nuts over the first game of the season bro but you seem to be doing the opposite and downplaying it yeah I'm gonna downplay guys that I think overperformed I don't know up play guys that I think underperformed kind of like the way we just talked about like Klay Thompson he had a bad shooting game but he other stuff was there D'Angelo Russell had a bad shooting game but the minutes in the opportunity were there my job here if I can do it right  is to make sure everybody sees the long game  so this this poster here Oompa Loompa you think that I'm hating  but it's not that it's pragmatism in every respect I know I'm a very boring fantasy analysts to follow but I want to be extremely pragmatic about everything so that's the players that over perform I want to make sure we see the long game the players that underperform I want to see make sure we see the long game and  noting certain things that can and cannot happen and when they cannot happen allows people to hopefully see small fluctuations in value that maybe we can capitalize on a little bit as well  thoughts on Dwight Howard's coming out party I don't know what this is about I must have missed something  he says I have hardened Jared Allen Draymond what is start for me yeah that's that's tough we knew Jared Allen was out and we Harden was out  for a little bit the dream on one was a little bit later news so I think that one may be a little bit more of a surprise Dwayne says hey Dan in rodo do you add a valuable player even though you already have a solid roster just to block the league from adding that player on their team for example Xavier Tillman my plan would be to just bench him um  I mean it depends on the drop in this case obviously you'd like to have a guy who you think is gonna be a decent player  you know I'm not gonna pick up a guy just to block someone else from having that dude but particularly in rotol there there's like you can get someone who performs inside the top 100 you generally do it I'm not certain that Tillman is inside the top 100 he was right around that area after the Steven Adams injury last season but we also saw Memphis go to smaller lineup sometimes  there was an opportunity and DFS are probably could pick this out better than I can to really  you could sort of almost localize the game's where you knew Tillman was going to be better when he was going up against Jonas Valen chunis or a Nicole to yoke or some wide body Center on the other club where Memphis didn't want JJ dealing with that player they would instead go to Tillman until Brandon Clark got hurt he was the other option if they wanted to sort of open it up and run a little bit more they don't have as many options now I think Santi aldama is actually out for this first game but he might slide up and be sort of a floor spacing power forward Center and he and JJJ can kind of flip-flop who they're dealing with their  I think Tillman's worth rostering but don't pick him up unless you're dropping someone who's worse than him you know just keep it simple I guess  uh Jay Whiz says first year playing fantasy basketball learning so much thanks to your content dude that's so kind of you my main  my main goal here on this show YouTube pod whatever has always been to simplify fantasy basketball and try to help people see it as a  Arena Bowl game where winning is more fun than losing  but in the hierarchy winning is the most fun having fun players is less fun than that and then losing is the least fun if that makes sense  oh here one more follow-up from Booker average 6.5 and 6.8 the two previous Seasons before CP3 zero Chancey averages eight and no one is even thinking that so you and I agree on the zero chance the average age but you and I disagree on no one is even thinking that because I have seen multiple analysts on Twitter say that he's averaging eight assists the game this year I have seen analysts say that he's a double-double threat this year so if you're not following them that's fine maybe good in this regard because then you didn't see what was kind of a bad take  but people are saying it so you for sure that's out there I I like that we agree on where he's actually gonna end which is like six and a half ish but people are saying eight  which two would you drop for streams Brandon Miller saddiq Bey Paul Reed are the three choices none none none you literally haven't seen those three players go yet don't drop a player to stream the slot if you haven't seen them play yet  seems simple enough but I know it's hard because this first week of the Season we all want to be doing 15 things because we haven't made a fantasy basketball moves since April  you drafted these guys because you like them presumably let him play  Zack accountants says not enough roster spots should I start Harrison Barnes at Utah Patrick Williams versus Oklahoma City uh can you figure out what stats you need more because Barnes will score more and get you better free throws and maybe better rebounds and Patrick Williams had a better shot at Steals and blocks  that's the short version yaakov says Hey made a big trade would love your opinion  nine cat I give Jimmy Butler Jordan Poole Brook Lopez I get Damon Drew holiday  um  Dame Jimmy Butler they're not all that far apart Drew pool they're not all that far apart you know I might have stuck with the first side it's close though I got no big problem with it relatively Fair the fact that I look at it and think well means it's probably relatively Fair  he says what do you think of this trade pool and Middleton for Paul George Paul George side for me I'll take on that one  Alex  dwarfie Pig Rodriguez says what to do with hardened well if you've got him sitting on him  because right now I mean honestly the news on hardened that we're hearing today is in my eyes maybe the best news we could have gotten on hardened which is that he's still and the team is still is like telling him practice for one more week and then maybe you can play I didn't think he was even going to be showing up so this was a positive in my eyes he actually showed up  he's ready to go team told him don't come yet  so if you have them hold on to him if you don't have him and someone's freaking out see if you can trade away your fifth or sixth rounder and get him because at some point hardin's gonna play and he's gonna be a top 20 fantasy play  DJ Andre should I drop Malik Beasley to activate Al Horford from IL Plus  sure I don't think Beasley is going to be very good I know he's starting but I can't imagine that sticks because that's a bad defensive back court in Milwaukee if it's Beasley and Dame trying to keep people out of the paint  oh floor spacing is what they necessarily need their  I'm fine with it I don't think he's I think Beasley is no more than a streamer himself so to that end you say fine drop in activated Horford and then go throw someone else and Ill plus and get another streamer the next day  David says do I start Tillman in Roto do I wait and see I'll tell you what if he gets the starting nod if we officially find out he's starting for Memphis today as they go up against Jonas Fallon chunis and Zion Williamson and the pals I'd say started if he starting you start him if he's not you don't uh let's see what we got here and Wayne T let's make this the last question because we're approaching 55 minutes hey Dan I have an Open Bench slot who's the better add Jalen Johnson desire Williams or Kyle Lowry well  this brings up a question of how badly do you need the stats today versus stats in January because in January Jalen Johnson's probably going to be the best option of those three today it's probably Kyle Lowry  which is just like the grossest feeling to say because Kyle Lowry has for three years now basically been a guy I've said he's actually too old even for the old man squad but if he's truly healthy and upright and he's starting at point guard you know 13 and 6 is well within reach he's always been a good steals Guy he's been a good three-pointers guy good free throw shooter bad field goal guy but he's probably gonna get more opportunity today than either of those other guys Jalen Johnson or desire William's I think Laurie has more opportunity than those guys by like a pretty high factor  friends on the way out today make sure you like rate subscribe no matter where you're taking in the content what's coming up on fantasy NBA Today is nothing  this is gonna be our only show today because time dependent this afternoon I'm gonna put together some tutorial videos on the brand new tools that are a part of the sports ethos fantasy pass the one that I'm really into is the head-to-head breakdown tool where you enter your team and your opponent's team and it will tabulate the scores at the end of the week based on the brewski 150 projections since that's what because these teams haven't played yet as the days and weeks go on the projections will adjust based on things that we're seeing but right now  and it feels in the game's played for you by the way the engine already has the weekly matchup so you just put in the players name and it'll fill in the rest and you can see how you're going to do against your opponent and that helps you make streaming decisions which we all have a streaming chart I don't think anybody needs a tutorial for that but all of a tutorial for some of these hopefully I can get those up on our YouTube page later on today certainly by the end of the week that's a pretty damn cool thing if you have a fantasy pass make sure you're using this stuff and if you don't you
