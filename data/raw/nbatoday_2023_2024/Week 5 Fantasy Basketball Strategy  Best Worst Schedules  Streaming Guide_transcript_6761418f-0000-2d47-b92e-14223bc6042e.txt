welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  week 5 is a pot us ladies and gentlemen we have schedules to analyze best worst  in between almost like the original Kitten Mittens  we've got streaming  we've got injuries we've got it all as we head into another week of the NBA season and we've got it here on fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation I am Dan best person I am joined on our weekly lineup show every week by the week Master himself  I spent all of 0 seconds deciding that that was gonna be your nickname he is at d-ball on all social media platform is a he is Derek ball and he is back what's up dude you ready for week five oh Dan I am I am really looking forward to this week you know it's funny you led with that it will comment about Kitten Mittens there and I was already ready to give you a little line about how I kind of felt like looking at the schedule this week I kind of felt like Charlie day you know the one where he's got the poster oh I know the red strings you've got so many options to go through this week I think I drove myself crazy writing this week's thread you have decidedly few uh pieces of string behind you though so I I assume we're gonna be doing this just out of the Charlie map in your brain then is that we gonna have to rely on the brain well good luck to anyone who's got to keep up with that yeah Heaven Help Us all again he has at d-ball b-ball and social he writes the week ahead piece at sports ethos and he's gonna bring all of you guys a large chunk of the info from that but of course if you want the whole week ahead piece you gotta go sign up for a fantasy pass over its Sports ethos.com starts at just six bucks a month you get all sorts of stuff the week ahead is just one of the awesome piece of content in said fantasy pass so Derek the way we normally go through this stuff is I kind of work my way through your Twitter thread which I folk should definitely check that thing out but I I spent a little bit of time between shows and I thought maybe like trying to attack the chronology of the week does actually make a lot of sense and I wanted to do that at some point but maybe we start with more of the broad overview of this coming week you said it's like a Charlie map does that mean that it is a very good week to stream or a very complicated week to stream or some weird combination of both I mean it's going to be a combination of the both I would say rather than a good or a bad week to stream I would say it's a mandatory week to stream because they're just so many different ways to do it and there are so so many games concentrated right around that Thanksgiving Thursday that you're really able if you're if you're starting the week streaming heavy you're really able to add a lot of games played to your totals and if you're in a head League games play basically translate to wins and a lot of circumstances so I can assure you that your opponent is going to be streaming and if you want to beat your opponent this week there's so many options to do so you just have to choose which one works for your team and it's not like other weeks where I have to tell you on Monday you take this guy and on Tuesday take this guy and if you're lucky you can switch on Wednesday you've got great options every single day with the exception of Thursday how is that there's no options out there today right  Happy Thanksgiving everyone in advance how is it possible that there are so many good options every day well it's just the way that the league has kind of concentrated the schedule around that day they really weighed down the schedule on Wednesday and Friday surrounding that Thanksgiving so effectively teams that are playing on those days are playing a back-to-back and then you think about it they have had a rest day in between so the league was actually able to on both sides of those Wednesday and Friday they were also able to schedule games there so you've got teams that are effectively playing back to back to back this week if their scheduled on Tuesday Wednesday and Friday or Wednesday Friday and Saturday both of those things are possible this week along with the fact that you've got basically half the league on a three and four or four and five at some point this week there's just so many different ways to get through it I mean you're looking at Monday you've got Boston Chicago Denver Golden State Houston Milwaukee Minnesota Sacramento and San Antonio on a three and four or if you want to be really aggressive you can go for the Clippers you can go for the heat you can go for the Pelicans or the Wizards on Monday tons of options to get through and add tons of games played it's just a matter of picking  the best player Friday I know has 10 games which is like borderline overflow for a lot of clubs that one maybe we don't need to dig quite as deep but Wednesday is a Mando de almost the entire league plays on Wednesday what do you do from a weak planning perspective when everybody plays on someday in the middle of the week because basically anything you add on Wednesday is gonna be nullified by the fact that you probably already had a full schedule so is there a way to stream avoiding Wednesday like could you potentially give up on Wednesday game to get a game on a different day or to the schedule is just not even really aligned like that I mean there's really no I mean everyone's playing on on Wednesday so I've been really factor that day into my planning too much I mean you're not going to be streaming Pistons players this week and there's not really a great opportunity to stream any next players until the weekend hits now you said there's 2018 playing on Wednesday I just need the two that aren't so really if you were to avoid Wednesday it wouldn't be beneficial to you in any way so I'm not really factoring that into my plan very much for me it's really about on these first couple of days Monday Tuesday getting the best value there in long screening them if I can because I think that if you're looking to make moves on Wednesday or Friday and I say this in my thread I've just don't think you're going to have a lot of options because I think people are going to be really aggressive early on picking their favorite players and just trying to write the note for the week with such a heavy schedule so you mentioned the Pistons in there who are the who are the teams where you're I mean okay like we talked about teams to avoid sometimes you can't really avoid them you know if you have shea Gill just Alexander in a two-game week he's the number one  player in fantasy it's not like you're gonna avoid him but if you're thinking about streaming who are the teams that you're avoiding right now well I'm specifically avoiding the Pistons there are two other two game teams this week but I did actually give the Pistons the nod as the worst schedule of the week there's just really nothing redeeming about it with a Monday start and then not playing again until Friday there's just too many days in between for me to see any value in streaming them but you would actually mentioned Shay guilder Alexander he's another one of the players that's on a team that's only got two games this week and the Mavs are the others so you got the Thunder the maps and the Pistons that are all playing a fairly Limited schedule however the difference between the Pistons and the other two two game teams is that they have games that are actually only space a day apart so you can for a limited basis if there's a player that is near the top of your waiver wire that you really want to get you can't at least stream them for a little bit having said that with so many different long streaming options in different ways to navigate the week I'll probably just paid the chances of me having a Dallas OKC or Detroit Player unnecessarily all week anybody that was watching on YouTube saw what looked like me shouting at a non-existent producer it was actually my child yelling from outside a locked door and trying to bash bash bash his way in to tell me about some kitty sought the park I told him that he can tell me after the show is over but just in case anybody hears this sound of a child screaming it's probably about a friend that he ran into at the park let's keep talking about the week ahead because my move I want you to tell me I also came up with this idea of something we could talk about before we get into the actual day-to-day my move when I'm planning a week this early in the season is often  because like when I get into the playoffs and I want to try to keep this as short as possible because me monologuing to get to a question is is just bad podcast for him  when I'm in my fantasy playoffs I'm playing nine ten days ahead right now I don't plan that far out because  I want to be ready in case something more lasting pops up like if I have planned out 78 days in advance  I've basically sort of iced out the idea of me pivoting hard on so and so like this week it would have been Santi aldama who you know we saw in the Laker game came off the bench and took a crap ton of shots in like 25 minutes it was that game against the Lakers where we all were like hey wait a minute like this may be the Marcus Smart Guy doesn't make any sense because he's a power forward but this might be the Market's smart guy and then he went nuts over the weekend but if we had sort of planned out every move all the way up to that point that would be one of those spots where maybe we are unable to go get a guy that could help for I don't know until job comes back like we're talking about not even a stream anymore you're talking about an injury replacement for half a month so this time of year I tend to longstream in  more like three or four day chunks is that  should I be less lazy is the way I want to phrase that should I make my plan but then also have contingency in case things come up or you don't know me Derek my job or my my task my goal on fantasy NBA Today is always to simplify things is a way to simplify to shorten the long stream by just a little bit so that you have maybe a little maybe it's a little bit simpler to sort of pivot on a strategy or am I now making it like I've maybe I have eliminated the actual strategy of it that question was terrible did you make any sense of that  yeah I mean I think I know what you're getting at here for me I and I and I tend to advocate for this anyway it's long streaming first and foremost because if I'm long streaming that means I'm relatively confident in that player relative to the rest of the field of waiver wire options I personally I like to use the early part of the season to experiment where possible and try to find the best player that's going to carry me through the rest of the season so I think I think with the thing you're trying to do right now is to try to find the best combination of talent and opportunity if I just difference between the two right now I think I would actually take Talent over opportunity being scheduled as you get closer to the playoffs yes the schedule is going to become that much more important because you're going to want to make sure that every single move counts for the absolute most mathematical you know production you can get but right now I think you're trying to find two in your roster and find the best way possible to add talent that can take you to the finish line now if you take a chance on a player like you say and that three or four day window they don't work out and that's fine cast them aside they were never really a big part of your plan but I think the key is that you're swinging for upside here you want to get that player that's going to do at least as much as what they've been doing to get your attention if not more so I don't tend to advocate for very safe players as as streaming options in the early seasons and I want to get those players that I know or at least I feel very confident are going to give me top 100 or better production if they're not meeting that criteria then I would absolutely plan to move on from them as soon as it's opportunistic okay  let's start working our way through the week and I know we're going to probably do a little bit too much of how the sausage is made but on I don't care I think it's going to be really interesting for people and I still think that there will be value in them getting a fantasy pass and checking out the week ahead but let's say Derek you're walking your own self through a week what do you do each day of the week how does your plant take one of your teams I'm sure you have a whole bunch of them we all do because we're all there you go so let's take one out of your 14 head to heads walk me through what you're doing on a day-to-day and I mean you don't have to monologue the entire week if you don't want but just like if you set up the week the way that you want it to go right now in this league what are you trying to do at the risk of now the other people in your league seeing this podcast and trying to stop you from doing it but like what are you doing on today before lineup slot what are you doing tomorrow how do you go about building your whole week out  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of beer Wine

guessed it your armchair  download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's drizly.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  yeah so the first thing I do is I I look at the schedule and I try to figure out which are the strong days which are the weekdays anything with 10 games or more I would Define as a strong day anything with nine games or less I would Define as a weekday and I'll be a skills up and down from there the closer to 0 you get the weaker of the day is and the more value I'm going to play on those days the next thing I do after I've done that is I split the schedule in half I always want to if I'm streaming I always want to have two games and three days by the time Wednesday night is over that's always my goal for my first move and usually the schedule allows for me to do that that way I know that from the exact moment that I'm able to I'm adding value to my team because you're not so just to jump in because you're not using another move on that streaming slide until at early as Thursday you're saying any combination of Monday Tuesday Monday Wednesday or Tuesday Wednesday is actually okay with you that's right and I have been known to double stream so I wouldn't necessarily dream that I'm just turning over you know one spot there's a guy in my league who actually streams one of my main leaks who streams like five spots at the beginning of the year just so he can cycle through as much talent as possible holy cities crazy for that but you know what it's worked for them so what I like to do is I like to split the schedule in half after I figured out where the weak and the strong days are no matter what I'm doing I'm trying to get my two games in three days by Wednesday if possible I'd like to add in some extra value for a Tuesday Wednesday if I could get it I'm definitely where possible I don't mind using two of my moves by the time that Thursday morning comes around and then the goal would be from Thursday onwards to again try to figure out where my team is going to need to help the most so typically those are the weaker days if I do get the sense that I might have a loaded lineup I might look and see at the exact positions that I might find myself needing and if I might even see any value and adding to those you know something one of my normal players out because it's not always true that your your holes are your best starts every single every single night but but really I think the goal is to make sure that I have used up all my moves by the time that I can no longer get two games out of them so typically that's a Friday for me I use I like to have all my moves moved up I used up by Friday but sometimes the schedule demands that I'm using my last we want to Saturday for a back-to-back and I'm not opposed to doing that especially this week there are some good Saturday back-to-backs that you can exploit so so what yeah what for me it's just I'll just jump in and I'm Piven us yeah take good take us back to tonight what do you doing tonight what do you like for these first three days is part of your your early weeks stream yeah so I mean for me I'm running to the wire in every league and to be honest it might be too late for some some of the most aggressive managers but I'm running to the wire and I'm going for Clippers Heat pelicans and wizards players with a particular preference to the Pelicans because I think they have the best schedule not only this week but I think they're probably going to be heavy contenders for the best schedule next week next week mind you is also a condensed week and unlike this week where most of the league is playing four games there's only a handful of teams playing four games next week Pelicans are one of them and I think they've got a lot of opportunity right now between injuries and kind of prospects that are kind of coming into their own on the team I think there's a really good opportunity for you to get a streamer player guide that's typically on the waiver wire who can actually out produce that value right now as a post to somebody the other teams I need the clippers for example where yes they have a really good schedule but I'm not necessarily as inclined to tell you to stream them because I'm less confident their players right there's just they just don't get on the floor see I mean you have to have if you're gonna stream somebody you need them to actually play a little bit exactly so you're not just scheduled to determine your to determine how you're moving forward but it's definitely very influential in it so yeah I would definitely be looking at those four teams with probably the most preference to the Pelicans the least preference to the Clippers if I happen to strike out on those teams I already named some of the other three and fours for Monday so I'll just ask the people rewind and catch that but I do have some foreign fives to look at for Tuesday four games in five days mine you you could look at Atlanta the Hawks you could look at Cleveland you could look at Orlando you look at Phoenix and you can look at Toronto now not all those games are falling on the same days but effectively those five teams will get you four games in a five-day period if you factor out Thanksgiving right so those are the teams that I'm going to run to the wire for run don't walk get the best player that you can from them that matches your team's needs and just write them out for the rest of the week is that so when you talk about the two when you talk about the Tuesday names Indiana Orlando Phoenix  Toronto is that  is that the direction you go say if you don't get the four game guys that start tonight are those backup options or is that something where you're like hey I actually like some of these streaming options better I might even wait around to Tuesday or does that now put you in a tight spot because if you don't get them now you're stuck with out either of those options so how do you how do you balance that attack method well I would want the I would want to whoever's listening to get the best player available from that group of eight or nineties that I just went through I don't think it actually makes much of a functional difference for streaming purposes whether they do one or the other but one or the other being Monday or Tuesday because no matter what they will still meet my criteria of having two games in three days by Wednesday so effectively as long as they're they're filling needs in their lineup and I think they are doing the right thing now of course you want to get games played on the on the day that you're actually making the move so if that's an available option for you and there's a player that is of comparable value to a Tuesday start then yeah go for them right right away if that player you get on a Monday doesn't work out as well as you hope you do still have the opportunity to flip them on Tuesday for one of those guys that have that for Five schedule so yeah where possible make a move on the on today and tomorrow but if you do think that there is if you're performing to take a best player available approach there's nothing wrong with going for the Tuesday start get your guide and and worry about the rest from there so  um  if you're going the Monday route let's say we go the Monday path on this that takes you all the way to the end of the game's on Saturday right  that's right so you at that point you're almost definitely gonna have a move left on Sunday unless you're streaming three slots and you already said you know one I think you called two a double stream double barrel action there if am I off base there it sounds like I know you said you like to use them up by Friday but it almost seems like you're with the way this week is set up you might just sort of be stuck with a move or two left on Sunday to use setting up Sunday and the following week  yeah that's true I don't like to assume that the teams are going to hold those players all the way through because in in certain circumstances you actually just find that you prefer with the Pacers for example if you look at their Tuesday to Friday schedule they play every day that's possible and the same is true of some of the other teams that are active on Tuesday going into Friday the only difference between the Pacers and some of those other teams is that the other teams finish game on Sunday I'm not necessarily planning to hold passed past that Friday though if by flipping that player on Friday I'm able to add two games I'm always trying to add two games where I have one so there's no functional difference between sorry I'm just playing with my my schedule mixer here yeah there's no functional difference between between the magic and the Pacers if you are trying to make a move after Friday's game wraps up so I actually would plan to be if I have one of those teams that are on a four and five from Tuesday going into going into Sunday I would actually plan to be making a flip after Friday night's games wrap up in the hopes that I can get one of those back-to-backs that happened on Saturday Sunday  let me do a couple of questions entirely possible though that's that's all right let me do a couple of questions from the chat room and then I have a strategy question that I might hear it depending on how timing goes the rest of the way as I mentioned before if you guys Book Questions in the live chat here on YouTube make sure they are focused on weekly strategy or basically just like it's game streaming things like that we're not going to be doing like breaking down your trades or whatever on this but we do have a few questions that are actually more specific to this week this one's kind of open-ended but I'm guessing you're gonna understand what it means better than I do which Henry says when do I play honest this week so I'm assuming what is the Bucs schedule look like Derek is that is it a little bit is it weird are they heavy this week play every other day starting today basically Monday was Friday I mean if you're if you're in a weekly moves leave and you should be starting him anyway and frankly I think if he's if he's healthy you should start him every single game so those games would be Monday they're on a road or a road game at the Wizards then they're going to go visit the Celtics and then they're going to host the Wizards on Friday and then they're going to host the Blazers on on Sunday so as I'm going through that schedule there I'm seeing three relatively on competitive teams so two I guess I should say three relatively on competitive games so it's entirely possible that you might see a game from honest somewhere in there but I'm not in the business of predicting injuries or  rest games so I think until you hear that news from someone who has those sources I think you should plan to start honest and every single one of those games and hope that because he's playing some relatively on competitive teams that he is absolutely going to light it up because they're not going to have anyone to stop um yeah going to be starting him against the Celtics on on the Wednesday because I mean you you want to get the stars in their big matchups you know that Giannis has Jayson Tatum's name circled on his calendar and the reverse is true so those guys are going to be getting up for each other and I always like to bet on All Stars when they're facing each other because you love to see the alphas really try to Duke it out  next question from the chat room this is very much a weekly lineup question Mitchell Robinson with three games or on Yoko Kang woo with four this coming week which I mean  like hair splitting 101 I'm gonna say oh Kang woo but I mean this could really very much go either way both of these guys like where's Robinson had in nine cat right now 97 and then connect and the nine cat right yeah I think you're right it's got to be a Congo if they're comparable producers and frankly they do produce mostly in the same areas I think he just got to take the guy with more games yeah just hope that like and again you're playing the odds it doesn't mean that it always works if Mitchell Robinson add is the one like Mega explosion 12.19 rebound 4 block game that obviously we get this one wrong but you're playing the odds you got one extra chance on okongwu to have a nice ball game and most the time you just assume things kind of level out in stuff like this and I really like oh congress schedule right now too he's playing a bunch of teams that like to play small ball so I think they're going to really need his Mobility to come out there and kind of give capella break so I think he's gonna have a chance to put up some really nice lines especially in that Washington game picking on Washington today sorry that's I mean hey everybody here listening is watched a Wizards game or at least looked at what they seemed to be  there is nothing we can say about the Wizards that is  not that is too mean right now they are a trois Justin asks should I try to squeeze one more game out of Dario charged tonight or just drop him now for Cole Anthony um I guess it would depend on how aggressive the managers in your leg are you think that he's going to be there if he's not one of the top trending ads on your waiver wire right now I do like the risk of letting of letting Stars give you one more game before you move on to Cole Anthony where you can get that back-to-back Tuesday Wednesday I mean really it's a back-to-back-to-back so yes the answer is you should add Cole Anthony if you think you can afford to delay until Tuesday then do so but if you are at all nervous that you might miss out on that player or that you think that Anthony is going to be really productive for you you're in a guard stats build then I can't argue against going for him now three games of him is better than one game of Heartache their rest of season questions floating around Depending on time I might be able to hit those towards the end of the show but I really do want to keep the Derek segment here focused on the week ahead  I had a strategic question that I don't know if I've asked you on the show before and that is as you're building out these streaming calendar attack method whatever you want to call Charlie map  do you do you look at your opponent and like are you hunting categories or are you just hunting like overall production because it feels like if you're going up a team going up against a team where you're like okay this is a club I know is extraordinarily powerful in assists do I stream a different direction or is it too early in the season for that how deep do you dive on the  pairing on the the choice of streamer when they're sort of overall production is somewhat similar but just in different categories  I think you have to be planning to do that especially as the competitiveness of your league goes up I think you do have to know what your opponent's gonna be doing because you know if I'm facing a team that is loaded with all the best shot blockers in the league then it doesn't really make a difference if I've chosen to stream Mitchell Robinson or on Yahoo or you know name another guy because they're just their value is going to be lost in that match up so you do need to know where your metaphorical bread is buttered yummy but but I mean really it's it's not the worst thing to get the best player available if you know that that best player available is at least one order of magnitude greater than the other streamers that might just be categorized as Specialists so it is possible you might get a guy like a Santee Elmo who's just gonna blow it out of the water for one game or one week and then it won't matter what categories you're trying to win because that's just too much value to leave on the wire but in most cases you should know when you make a move I want to win this I want to win Steals and you should be getting a player that does that um you should also know that if you're planning to win assistance deals you should feel relatively confident that you can do that against your team or against your opponent because not every team is going to be able to do that so you need to know and the best way to do that is to look at your opponent's past matchups you're you're not going to have a huge history to look at but look at the results from their past matchups look at the sort of star players maybe we'll say their top five picks and you're gonna have a really strong idea of what that team's gonna be good at even if you're just a casual basketball fan you're going to know that the scores are going to be good at points you're going to recognize that a point guard's gonna produce a lot of assist you're going to recognize that a traditional big is going to produce a lot of rebounds blocks and have good field goal percentage there are things you're going to intuitively know and if you get that sense about a team you're going to move in the other direction  he is Derek Paul that was it I didn't have another one  you cleared the deck man you clear the deck he is Derek ball he is at d-ball b-ball on social media and I was looking at the clock I was like I generally try to get you out of here after about 25 minutes I don't want it chew up your whole afternoon Derek as always thank you my good man Dan it's been a pleasure we'll talk to you again same time next week you well roughly the same time I do my best thank you Derek we'll see you soon he is Derek ball big thank you to add d-ball b-ball over on social media amazing Charlie matte brain on the week ahead hopefully you guys were able to get a lot of good stuff out of this on what direction to be streaming and on which days I like that he attacks it from a long streaming standpoint as well which you guys know that I'm a big proponent of because it allows you to stream multiple slots it allows you to save moves if you need to for some of those rest of season guys that we talked about a little bit earlier in the show I want to do before I get into the next segment please do take a moment everybody to like subscribe I'm Gonna Keep leaning into that subscription thing I'm gonna keep putting my elbow into it because I just I know it's not that hard to click that button so please just take a second while you're hanging out with us here pause the show navigate over to the button there subscribe like it's super fast you'll get sports updates you'll get a little notifications when we go live on all of our shows these days I'm trying to do I think it's about eight ish shows a week I don't know that I'm ever gonna have time to do more than that until my kids are in college yay don't want to wait that long but either way we'll get a lot of good stuff going and the faster that are YouTube channel grows the faster that our podcast channels grow the more that I can lean into all of this stuff sort of justifying the time the resources spent on it and maybe somebody  I'll learn how to do a video that's not so low Tech  some day let's talk about the weekly lineup decisions that are at the top of everybody's mind we'll start at the highest ranked players and just kind of work our way through the board so stick with me here this will be kind of a lightning round deal Donovan Mitchell dealing with a hamstring strain he's already been ruled out for tomorrow that is not a good sign you guys know this we've all been around the block long enough to know when a player is ruled out I full day in advance that generally means that they're not all that close to coming back that said the Cavs do have a four game week because they go back to back Tuesday Wednesday and back to back Saturday Sunday meaning what if you could maybe still get two games out of him  I just don't think you can take that risk one game zero game's out of a roster slot in a weekly lineup situation is a mess  if you're in a deeper League maybe you have to take a shot on it because the guy you'd be putting in is like a top 250 player but if you're in a 12 team or and you have like a top 100 and 205 guy off the bench it's giving you four games that guy would get you relatively close to a one one and a half game Donovan Mitchell weak so that to me is the safer route to take on that one  every Simon CJ McCollum still out long term you know have to worry about that same with Tyler hero Cam Thomas we have an added update in the last five or six days so I think we can assume that he's all so not super close to coming back either the Alpine shengwen popped up on the injury report he is questionable for tonight's matchup against golden state with a lower back contusion that's called dealing with a multiple day stretch in Los Angeles and then dealing with LeBron at the tear at the end of it  doesn't sound all that serious that said Houston only a three-game week and front-loaded Monday Wednesday Friday you will likely have an update on him at some point later on this evening but it might not come before lineups fully lock in certain weekly leagues  I don't know how you play him if he's still questionable at like 3:55 Pacific time about an hour from now and I don't know that we're gonna get another update on it if you're playing him your praying you get two games because he's right on the cusp and now I get it heads which is the way most of these are what we're talking about a weekly line up to decision two games out of shen is pretty good that's 40 points at 17 rebounds at 12 116 a couple of steals at a block  are there guys you could play that would give you that in a Four game week you're talking 10  four and some odd three and some odd like those guys actually don't really grow on trees and that's why the cut off for two game week tends to be guys ranked around the top 50 or better but I feel like shengwen is guaranteed two games this week so I would call it like a 2.3 since we don't know how likely he is to play tonight is it 50/50 is it slightly less than that so I probably lean towards playing him but that one is a really tight call and a very hard one  Derek white ruled out for Boston it's the second half of a back-to-back and they're calling it personal reasons but I it's hard to know how legitimate that is they still have three more games the rest of the week so I think I'm probably a go on Derek white kelly oubre still out for a while I think Alex Caruso is a game time call or maybe he got upgraded a probable so I think I would probably go with an okay on him Kevin hertzer is a weird one he is dealing with a finger issue sprained it on his non-shooting hand missed their game on Sunday night but they play again tonight in New Orleans as part of a two game gamer down in the by you today and Wednesday  he's questionable  so here's the thing three game week for the Kings herders but on a pretty significant heater prior to that game before I think we'll probably get an update on him before lineup's lock because that game is about five o'clock Pacific time so only about an hour after the full lineup block takes place if he's in you just assume he's good for the rest of the week and then he's probably a go in a lot of formats if he's out herders not good enough to justify a two-game week even with this hot as he's been leading up to that one slower ball game  Jalen Duren just got ruled out so in the best case scenario he's a one game week so he should remain on your bench Karis Levert was one I was out all day and then I like I got home and I saw that he had actually missed the last one with  I guess it's just being listed as left knee soreness right now  we talked about it with Donovan Mitchell it's a four game or for the Cavs so Levert is probably a goal in a lot of formats the only issue there is like we're not only talking about a guy that's just inside the top 100 anything less than three games at a very bad decision to throw him out there  so these are guys when you get back into the Levert's and basically anybody we talked about that's beyond him if you're not getting a full four game week you can probably get more out of some dude ranked not that far away that's on the waiver wire that does have a safe healthy for game week a deeper leaks he's probably a go but 12 I mean like a 12 team where you should be able to find somebody who's ranked near 115 120 on the waiver wire and just drop them in there for a four-game week and then you don't have to worry about it all that much  I don't know that there's anybody else that's good enough to really warrant this whole like should I or should I should I not start them to this point everybody else is pretty far down the board and so I think those are most of your weekly lineup decisions all rolled into one little pocket let's do a few questions that are not necessarily weekly lineup related you guys got to see my flannel pants there about just trying to stretch my lower back during this part of the show Handy Manny says is there point at which we can drop Jordan Poole for someone like Derek Lively who fits my team better I'm currently two and two in the standings I don't know how you drop Jordan Poole I mean  so  I I did say that I didn't want to draft him I made that very clear leading up to the season he was one of the guys that I thought had a bottom that could just totally fall out like a big time bust risk guy  but if you didn't listen to that and you drafted him you kind of have to just stick with it because you know that at some point he's just gonna start chucking up 18 19 shots of ball game I don't know what that point when when that point might be but it's got to happen at some point  he's not going to just coast along like this all year without going and trying to blow the roof off the building a few times so no I don't know how you dropped Jordan Poole you spent so much draft capital on him and if you drop him somebody will pick him up almost immediately to hope that this thing gets turned around and that's one of the other factors you have to think about when you drop a player will that player be there for me on in the waiver wild pool if I ever change my mind and with pool know  would you drop a manual quickly for dream on green and nine cat Roto yes  Chris Paul for Kelvin Johnson NY I'd rather have Chris Paul by the way depending on what site you're using to look for rankings these guys have very different numbers but Chris Paul's number 70 right now  because first of all his field goal percentage is up to now 39 instead of 36 these little these little tweaks they go along way and his sister still high in a Steels are still high it is free throw percentage high and like legitimately he can go higher because the field goal percent should probably continue to tick in the right direction Kelvin Johnson is just a nightly  fear Zone on what he's gonna do to your percentages oh I should have given this question to Derek oopsies should I drop Dyson Daniels after today and add Skylar Mays for Tuesday then back-to-back drop maze for a Bilal I don't know man points League by the way  um well let's see let me go to the schedules here for a second New Orleans is a four game week we know Jose Alvarado is coming back so that could mess things up a little bit the Blazers are a three game week  I mean at that like what you're not adding any games by moving  um Dyson Daniels for Skylar Mays on Tuesday they each have three games the rest of the week  although I guess one of them is on and overflow day so you don't semi overflow day Pelicans are Friday Saturday Blazers are just Sunday  so Friday's overflow day then maybe you can't use Dyson Daniels there I don't really like Bilal all that much I don't think his Fantasy game is rounded out yet I think I might just stick with Dyson Daniels for a bit  no need to make the move this early should I get the jump and drop Gordon Hayward for Santi aldama it's a 10 team her  yeah I'm fine with that I don't know the Gordon hayward's gonna be a 10 team guy when that team gets fully healthy and we don't all dhamma is knocking a value for that long because eventually Jaws gonna be back and  Marcus Smart will be back at some point and so guys are gonna get pushed out but  I mean I don't I don't think that you're gonna feel all that bad Gordon Hayward will have some good games here and there because the that team is not fully healthy yet but at some point he's gonna get squeezed too so you might as well just get the guys playing hotter right now  in a 12 team or I don't think I would have said that by the way  Maxi or Darren Fox  I'll go Tyrese Maxey I think Fox his three-point numbers are gonna come down a lot he's way out in front of anything he's ever done in his career by like a factor of 200% or something  so that's gonna that's gonna taper and I don't Max he's gonna taper too which just like  foxes also taking like four shots more than any other year in his career and it's like the players around him got magically worse he's just been really really really really really really really really really hot and so you sort of  You Go With It Cole Anthony or study Bay  if we're talking about this week  or late I just got the four games Tuesday through Sunday Atlanta's got four games Tuesday through Sunday  if you're talking rest of season I think I probably go Bae answer to both questions  jaymon green is available in a head-to-head category league would you dropped even chenzo for him after tonight yes fellas what do you think about stashing Andre Drummond  he already pulls down so many boards in 15 minutes I don't think the Bulls are shooting everybody out of there for a little bit yet you sit on drumming for a long time and he is bad in a lot of other categories  Trey Jones are tyus Jones rest of season I'll go tius I hate the Wizards right now but  he just has more opportunity at the moment  come on lunar goggle buttons I'll go Looney just while Draymond is out and then I don't really want either of them all that much  hey Dan was three and oh and lost last week to it oh and three team after beating mid team close enough weak before how much should I panic getting it next week I'm going to Dynasty league and didn't make many changes I mean this crap happens sometimes a good team or a bad team as a good week sometimes a good team as a bad week sometimes the schedule God's just don't align  part of what I think makes head-to-head kind of stupid but  you certainly can't Panic after one week  would you drop Gordon Hayward for Trey Murphy I am not dropping a healthy player for a player that is currently not playing so no  Alex Caruso or Derek Lively ah I don't know if this is this week or rest of season Chicago if it's this week it's Caruso because Chicago has two games in Dallas or Chicago's four games in Dallas only has two  if it's a rest of season it's probably Lively because we know Caruso is either going to get hurt or traded or both  and Lively probably maybe neither  so Lively rest of season Caruso this week  do you see it getting any better for Jayden McDaniels no no I don't um I mean he'll do a little bit more than he's doing right now he's typically been a one-one-one guy so the Steals and blocks will probably get up closer to one each  but he's gonna probably be right around what he did last year which was like between 100 and 125 and he just slowly bounced around in there because there aren't  any rebounds for him there aren't any assists for him to get there aren't enough shots for him to take  so all that's left is a steal a block in a three-pointer  and hopefully good percentage is  but they're just isn't he he's a shining example of a player who was way better in real life than they are in fantasy and that is where we'll pull the plug because you guys have exactly one hour to get your lineup set thanks
