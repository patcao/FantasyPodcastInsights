welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  all right so  you know I get it  I'm a loose cannon here sometimes you forget to put your backdrop up and everybody gets to see your disheveled bedroom in the background I'm surprised honestly that's the first time that's happened  this season  on the YouTube  it'll happen again make no mistake I'll do it again  uh I am moving fast today which may not be obvious by the fact that I'm speaking very slowly but I am trying to move fast today the quick version is my younger son my preschool age child has his class Hanukkah party coming up in about one hour and I got to get there like 10 minutes early to bring best for his family's in charge of the apple sauce and sour cream ladies and gentlemen  I got big responsibilities today so anyway we got a plow through this bad boy  but I don't think that should be a big problem they're only five games yesterday and like two of the five games had almost no fantasy ramifications whatsoever so we'll be able to laser focus on the ones that did quick Wednesday preview just a few things to keep an eye on for this evening  also that should hopefully save us some time as we look towards the afternoon if possible  I'd like to get our cell High show going later on today that's been a big hit specifically on the YouTube side I think the  I think the traditional pod channel that one's doing about the same as everything else but you YouTubers you love the bylaws and the sell highs and I have other ideas that I want to try out I know we did our  what did we do we did a dynasty show late last week that was cool but I have some other ones that I want to try to work in I don't want to be able to do it but I'm gonna try and you guys are gonna be here for this wild ride that we call the podcasting life welcome everyone one and all to Fantasy NBA today I am Dan Vasquez and this is a sports ethos presentation take a moment to find me on social at Dan Bass Pros or just Google search or being searched or whatever there's search engines are out there Dan from Sports ethos or Dan from hoop ball should pop up pretty quickly that way  best news feed in business eat those fantasy BK it's got sources it's got analysis and it is faster than any other one that has those things  also Discord come hang with us link is in the show description you guys can find it you're competent fully functioning adults I know it so go find that now let's just talk about fantasy stuff I want to get right into it because again I got to move at a pretty good clip today  Lakers Mavericks this is a pretty fun ball game actually Mavericks were just simply too good from three point land it's funny because yesterday I was talking on on the show I was like look I think we were talking about the Kings game and I said look if a team makes you know 20 plus 3 pointers and shoots like 50% on him that team's gonna win almost every single time  Lakers kept pace because they also shot the three relatively well in this game they had 15 of them but more than anything Anthony Davis was just destroying people around the room despite playing through a little tweak on his hip injury he came up kind of lame a couple of times in the first half I don't think that's why the Lakers were down 10 in the first half they looked like they were a bit hungover from the in-season tournament Vegas trip but they came back in the second made it a good ball game back and forth down the stretch Luca was just  incredible with his passing in this ball game I know the 33 points is cool but it took him 28 shots to get there and I think typically the Lakers would actually feel fine about 33 points for Luka on 28 shots I think that burned the Lakers was that Dante Exum went insane from 3-point land and he's been really hot lately this is a bit of an indictment I think on the Lakers game plan which they basically said after the ball game was we needed to Sag off someone so we chose to Sag off Dante Exum  and I get it  he'd been playing well but he hadn't been shooting the three ball like this you know he had whatever it was three three pointers and his previous two games where he was playing well but then to have seven in this one pretty much blew up the Lakers plans I think he had 17 points in the fourth quarter alone pretty incredible stuff and he was the reason the Mavs won this ball game Dante Exum  I know you could say Tim Hardaway Jr at 32 but he did a lot of that damage early and then cool off Grant Williams had five three-pointers as well on seven out of nine shooting Maverick simply got too many threes from their role players and that put him over the top in a fun basketball game that from a fantasy standpoint did have a couple of notes lakers' side Brawn and add are both dealing with some stuff  for LeBron apparently there's a calf thing that maybe he tweaked a little bit we know he's been dealing with the just all the lower leg stuff he might sit out this back-to-back in San Antonio Anthony Davis would probably be wise to sit out the back to back but I don't know maybe he wants to go up against women Yamaha and see how that goes we'll see but obviously if either of those guys sits that opens things up  it's better for streamers if LeBron sits because that means just more ball handling is Anthony Davis is the finisher and there isn't an obvious Center that just steps in and can do anything remotely close to what ad does  but if LeBron's go it takes a day off you're gonna get a big game out of the Angela Russell you'll get more out of Austin Reeves who's been playing well lately anyway you'll probably get enough out of someone like a really hot tomorrow because they'll need more scoring Tori and Prince is has been heating up from three I don't know that that helps him all that much because frankly he is better when LeBron can get him open but just keep an eye on the status report for tonight if anybody sitting for the Lakers will try to you know pluck over the carcass and see what sort of streamers we can flip in there the map side is a little bit more clear not super clear but a little bit more clear because Derek Jones Junior went out and then in the middle of this ballgame Seth Curry actually got hurt also so Derek Jones is out Kyrie's out and is still in a walking boot so he presumably is at least a few games away maybe more than that even now Seth as well Josh Green is out for a while yet Maxi kleeba is still out for a while so you have this group now that includes Tim Hardaway Jr by the way that might not normally get enough usage to be fantasy relevant but certainly is right now so Dante Exum while he's this hot you play him well Tim Hardaway Jr is going to get 21's is the one that's kind of teetering on the borderline simply because he just not doing as many things  but sides trying to hit Corner threes at a super high clip and so he's the one  you could play him if you just needed threes on the head to head Side Road oh I think the rest of these guys are probably a goal so but I don't know that Grant Williams necessarily is for your games cap format folks out there  Cavaliers were once again without Evan Mobley and they are to know one surprise not as good without Evan Mobley I know shocking isn't it absolutely shocking that they're not as good without their best defensive player cast fell to 13 and 11 which in a an Eastern Conference where parody is nuts right now actually West 2 top 10 teams in the west are all two games above 500 or better top nine teams in the East or two games above 500 or better and then there's a three-game drop off after that in the west there's a two and a half game drop off after the top 10 spots I think this is what the NBA wants a lot of teams that can just all beat each other on any given night and that's pretty cool  what the hell was I talking about why were we talking oh the Cavaliers yes they need Mobly back because they're just not going to be a good team like Boston without their Premiere defensive guy  just not gonna happen Donovan Mitchell was better Darius Garland was decent again solid Jared Allen finally busting out after a few foul trouble League games with five defensive stats he was a Buy Low on yesterday's show and I know he missed some free throws here but already you see sort of the the fruits of those laborers Max Drew's came back with 179 and 3 and 5 3 pointers knew he would bounce back after a terrible shooting game the previous one and then for Cleveland the only real fantasy footnote here is that Charis vert came back from injury played 23 minutes he's not Rodeo relevant when both Garland and Donovan Mitchell are healthy he's a schedule level play for head-to-head Leaguers when the team is healthy but even that's kind of iffy points Leaguers I think could probably scoop him because he's sort of like  basement level when the teams healthy and then is quite good when the team is missing anybody because his issues are efficiency stuff  I do not have a single note on the Boston Celtics other than I guess it's probably worth mentioning how high the brewski 150 was on Derek white and he's number 36 in nine cat right now  that dude is freaking good  Drew holidays kind of bounced back a little bit for whatever that's worth and then everything else is is the same so let's keep tracking along Nicole Scott ejected and you know Denver's being Coy then first kind of a little weird these days I gotta say  just as an organization they've they've changed you've changed man that's like the feeling of got with Denver and I  the team has has gotten extremely defensive  which is super weird because you just want the title but everything is just like we're still disrespected  or and there's this weird like  non-responsibility thing going on and maybe it's an act I don't know maybe I'm not maybe I'm not getting the joke but Michael Malone came out and was like yeah I mean I heard what Nicole said to the ref and in my house that growing up that was a term of endearment which I know was sort of like tongue in cheek but also like just say you shouldn't have said it like don't  don't try to twist that around make your make your guy take responsibility I know you're in Championship hangover mode but we're all counting on yokich to actually finish some damn ball games these days and honestly I think he's tired  I think you'll get just pooped  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no

like a little mug fart Reggie Jackson filling in here I'm sure he would have been fine with just Jamal Murray but certainly once you get joint down then it was all right Reggie you gotta like orchestrate get everybody set up your you're running things now Casey P got hurt mid ballgame I'm gonna forget exactly yeah I took a shot to the head I kind of forgot exactly what it was and my hope  and this is sort of gonna be careful I freeze this because I don't want anybody to get hurt and I like actually playing Casey P for Steals and threes My Hope was that someone like Christian Braun would step up and take all of that stuff but he's kind of fighting with Justin holiday and Peyton Watson Julian strawther and all these guys are in sort of scooping up the excess in a game the Denver somehow managed to win with the second half and then without Casey p and all so without your mom Murray and  oh Chicago and this is the thing Chicago is deluding themselves these days and we're fully aware of it anybody that watches basketball is fully aware of it they beat some bad teams and then there was like oh yeah you know we're gonna we're we're buyers now again it's like dude like look at your schedule man  you beat the Spurs you beat the Hornets you had a decent win against the Pelicans I'll give you that  but  like  most of the Bulls wins this year have come against  kind of bad teams  Kobe white is on in a serious heater right now  I'd say probably write it out because I don't think you're gonna be able to trade him for proper value at the moment because people are going to be worried that exactly might come back and it is a reasonable worry I still feel like leaving gets traded before he's healthy from the foot injury but we don't know for sure  and there's only kind of only one way to go for white from right now because he's sitting like five three pointers a game over the last couple of weeks these are just unsustainable numbers we know that for anybody in the NBA Steph Curry's the only guy that hits five three-pointers a game and Colby white he's made some strides but he's not Steph Curry  I am very disappointed in Patrick Williams who without Alex Caruso and Zach LaVine out felt like he was Prime to have at least a serviceable basketball game he was quite bad in this one I think he probably still belongs on rosters lately but it's not a guarantee his Fantasy game is okay but not great because this percentages are both kind of bad but he gets three Steals and blocks and sometimes rebounds and it's a fun combination and one that I want to be positive about  but it just hasn't put it together and and so he sort of more stash than play  certainly on the roadside he's more stash than play on the head-to-head side you could probably make the argument that he can just sort of drop into a lineup and it's not gonna kill you but there are better short-term options available  right now  Draymond Green is up to his old Antics again and that's probably the story of the night is that Draymond was in his words trying to sell a foul he felt use of Turkish was grabbing his hip and so he was sort of like tried to flail out of the hip grab and in his flailing in this big spinning uppercut he caught in Turkish in the face with his  sort of like the wrist area I mean it was extremely uncoordinated series of moves from Dream On he'll probably be suspended he was  weirdly apologetic  which is unusual for him and his post-game he was like look I was trying to flail I was trying to sell a foul I definitely did not mean to hit an arch in the face and I'm sure he's trying to mitigate whatever punishment is coming but it's not like he came out and apologized for choking Rudy gobert because he meant to do it so there is a certain  I think  genuine level to this with him because Draymond has like basically never apologized for anything and his career and this one was like I this was dumb I didn't mean to do that  there will be some suspension coming I actually think the apology May mitigate the length of it a little bit basketball monster for those that are watching you can see the box score they they're thinking it'll be 10 games I think it might be less than that I know he's this whole repeat offenders stuff but him coming out and saying like look I that was a screw up I didn't mean to do that they may go a little easier on him either way last time he was out Chris Paul went huge and he immediately had a big ball game here with 15 points 11 assists so CP3s gonna be cooking Brandon Putski had a really good ball game here there's no guarantee so I like him as I think more of a speculative add and I saw a lot of folks on Twitter that were like it's go time for pods and I feel like I need to remind everybody that  it's not a guarantee  and you can go back and you can look at the last few games when Draymond was out and  pajami had a few good ones in there but they were all great like it was made November he had a 23.7 rebound 5 assist game he had a 13 and 8 in there but he also had like an eight and a three a three and a five I think we're mixed in there again like a 10 and 4 so it wasn't a guarantee now  the upshot here is that the old goats for the Warriors and the starting lineup namely clay and Wiggins mostly Wiggins clay sort of like a slightly lower degree they've been rented us and they got benched down the stretch yesterday because they sucked and Clay was like look I trust Steve Kerr I don't like being benched but like I was terrible so at least there's a self-awareness there I have no idea what's going through and Wiggins head and on any given moment but he's not engaged in whatever's happening during this basketball season so I do think you can pick up a gemski I think there's at least a shot that he has value consistently through whatever happens here to Draymond because he's been playing well and the Warriors see more inclined to look at other options like Jonathan kaminga like pods like a Moses Moody from time to time like a Dario saric the problem again for me is when I'm thinking about using these guys against the games cap  I need to feel super confident that you're gonna get we whoever I will get a good ball game on that specific night  and I don't think that we know that's going to be true because if baje is having an offshoot game or feeling tired or whatever they could pivot back in another direction or let's say clay and Wiggins are playing a little bit better on a given night  so again I feel like this is more of a head-to-head Direction where you're like all right I'm gonna get something out of him because his minutes are gonna be in the 20s seemingly at the very worst okay great play that your 20 minutes guy if it's Punjabi okay if it's coming up okay all that stuff seems fine but Rodeo honestly I feel like I probably don't have the stone to play them Joshua left for the sons Midway through so they got thinner but they're supposed to get Kevin Durant back on Wednesday and Bradley Beal did finally make his return from back injury in this ballgame played 28 minutes he was fine unspectacular I would assume he'll still be on some kind of minute cap on Wednesday but if it's going to be up in the high 20s that's probably enough to play him  don't have to worry about May 2 because Cadiz coming back Jordan Goodwin had a big game but you don't have to worry about that because again Katie's coming back Eric Gordon is a very much a drop if Kevin Durant is back and I think for this team you're playing the three Superstars and nurk and that would be it at that point and that's nice that means we don't really have to focus too hard on it  and the last ball game of the night was a Clippers blowout over the Kings King's have been weirdly terrible on back to back so far this year I watching their the media or their their fan base on Twitter look at it like can we just not have any more backs it's super weird because they're not an old team  but whatever here we are Clippers continue to play better but  all right we'll get to Clippers in a sec first thing's first Keegan Murray another good ball game like he's been on our Bi-Lo board forever he's up to number 83 on the season now I still think there's room to climb oh I know I just think as farther to go  everybody else in the Kings was awful basically you know consider yourself lucky if the only King you had Was Keegan Murray because he's the only one that dodged the bullet  um  this ball game really hurt Darren Fox it dropped him all the way to number 40 in nine cat which I know sounds nuts right a guy averaging 30 points a game being ranked 40th but now he's a negative in field goal free throw and turnover  and that just becomes a little bit harder to overcome now there's a bunch of things he's doing well points threes steals a sister pretty good not spectacular but pretty good so and this is why Fox is always been a guy who profiled more as either a punt free throw guy or had to head you know punch some other stuff kind of build but this is all so why when he was number eight we said sell get anyone inside the top 25 you can  because now he's outside of that  oh well he's still gonna be fun and he's still gonna put up gigantic numbers but I mean this is the thing it's easy to overlook certain categories when other ones I popping and some of them are for him Clipper side however is the more interesting one Paul George left this ball game with a sore groin thigh Lou said he might have been able to play through it if the game wasn't a blowout victory at the time I'm skeptical of that  but I am happy that that's the quote that came out as opposed to something like oh you know we'll test it before the next ball game which in my mind is like yeah PG's resting a few this one it sounds like maybe he could play in their next game if I'm the Clippers I give them a day off because he's Paul George and you just really don't want him reactivating a growing or a hamstring that's where all of his stuff tends to happen they'll be fine a loss you know if they take a loss maybe they get a win who they all the Clippers play next Who's Next on their schedule the Warriors they can't beat anybody right now it's tomorrow give Paul George a day off let's see what happens  what's happening right now is that Kawhi Leonard is destroying everybody he's up to number 10 per game  and he's played in all 23 Clippers game so far this year he's number seven by totals ladies and gentlemen right now he and everybody wants to talk about Scotty Barnes and that's fine because he got drafted later and Tyrese Maxey all so incredible pick these guys got drafted later than Kawaii I would  posit  that Kawhi Leonard is also one of the best picks and fantasy to this point nobody expected him to play in all their games we all figured he was going to be a great per game guy but it was like okay can he get there if he's missing 25 to 30% of the team's games well so far he's missing zero percent knock on wood  so he's right up there at the top of the board and he's been even better lately after kind of a semi slow start to the year  Kawaii has top six over the last three weeks  kauai's top four over the last two weeks  yeah he's dominating  he's dunking on everyone's head  nobody's catching Shea don't worry about that but Kawaii has been incredible Harden's Trucking along these days too  hard and trucking along  number 25 I think over the last week  it's right in that like late second round range over the last week  last two weeks hardened his number 13 per game  they're off and running question I guess here is do we pick up Norman Powell because we don't have any idea of Paul George's playing in their next ball game if he sits I'd probably stream Powell because you know you're gonna get some points in threes and free throw percent and maybe a steal out of it but it's hard for me to recommend an ad right now because he's not playing today and  I kind of don't want to  blow a weekly ad for head-to-head on a guy who may end up still as a backup and  yeah I mean I guess that's sort of where I land on that one just  Rodeo I guess you could you could pick up Norm because you're not working against any sort of moves limit and if Paul George plays then you just don't play him you move on to somebody else  what do we got coming up tonight a medium sized Wednesday nothing crazy just a nine gamer Philly is at Detroit Phil Philadelphia we're watching Kelly oubre's minutes Detroit we're watching a whole bunch of stuff basically you know what happens with Thompson who's been now moved back into the starting lineup with multiple injuries in the front Court same for Isaiah Stewart is there any reason for us to really believe in Killian's or Hayden Ivy this year  Pelicans you're watching Trey Murphy Wizards it's the whole damn team basically can they keep the game even remotely close  Charlotte  Mark Williams I think it's still doubtful so you got the Nick Richards thing Miami is streamer City these days do you guys need me to go through all of them all right or later Robinson probably still a go Josh Richardson just got downgraded a questionable with headaches I believe I think he deals with migraines so that may be what's going on there boo Kayla Martin's been really good lately Kyle Lowry's cooled off but I think he's a go and then Duncan Robinson as well for the heat who somehow keep finding ways to win without half of their damn guys  they're 13 and 10 and they are not remotely close to Healthy Hawks are open to have their pieces back in order no real notes on them same deal for Toronto Lakers you gotta find out who's actually playing in the back-to-back Spurs  I mean  if Anthony Davis is in would they really let Wendy guard him  maybe might be kind of a fun task feels like they might throw Zach Collins at him but you never know Spurs starting lineup is a big red hovering question mark these days  in Indy we got a big game out of Benedict Catherine last time around can you do it again or is it back to obey top in time  Milwaukee Chris Middleton's minutes into the 30s question mark  Memphis nothing  Houston tari Eason got nice in the last game can that repeat itself Nicks you know I'm always watching Josh Hart I'd say washing watching I'm definitely not not always washing Josh Hart that's a very weird podcast  although viewership would be nuts  you guys would watch I know it  and then you got Isaiah hardenstein time I don't care that Jericho Sims is starting give me hartenstein let's do it  Utah Jazz we got Jordan Clarkson ruled out for a couple of weeks so you know fantasy wise nobody really cares but reality wise it just means that they are without anyone on the team that has actual gravity  John Collins has been missing time Walker Kessler's been missing time Utah's  in a perhaps a little bit of a pre tank right now there's seven and 16  and I don't think anybody's catching the Spurs the Pistons in the Wizards for the three worst records so now it becomes much more important to like basically have the fourth worst record and they're close they're half game back of the Grizzlies and Trailblazers for that I think we might be seeing the Jazz doing a little bit of you know what guys that sometimes win games Clarkson marketing and Kessler Collins  you guys just take it easy we'll get you back in there when you're 100% not 97% we want to get you all the way to 100 in the meantime everybody sucks everything sucks  but if everybody's out again and Kelly Olynyk is playing I know he wasn't good in the last one but damn right I'd be firing him up  keyonte George might be forced to take so many shots that he could potentially have value you just hope that he doesn't shoot like three for 19 which is a real possibility with this bad as his shots been lately  free throws feel goals turnovers crazy crazy high right now and then fontecchio hasn't been all that great and Colin Sexton can probably get you some points but like we need to find out if all four of those decent players or out again  feels like they probably will be Utah wants to keep racking up some easy losses  Brooklyn Phoenix is this the Everybody Plays game for the Suns I certainly like to see it  Brooklyn only a two-point Underdog some of that Phoenix on the back-to-back some of that is this weird feeling you get in your belly of whiz Bradley Beal gonna play in the back to back I think they'd like to see all three of their guys together but  oh by the way Desmond bane just got down rated to questionable he's all so sick for the Grizzlies so there might be a reason to consider some sort of grab their like a Santi aldama might take enough shots in this whatever iteration if Bane has to sit one out  hell are we talking about Brooklyn I called cam Thomas a by low mostly because of the sort of big ups and downs for him he's in a cold snap  you want to buy during the Cold Snap hit the hot one and then resell he's a guy that like you can probably buy him super low and then sell them super high because very few players fluctuate as a hard as cam Thomas does because his value is all tied up in his scoring and so if he's shooting terribly everything just off the edge of a cliff  but if it all starts going in and everything just like a pogo stick right back up onto the cliff  not much else with Brooklyn it's coming up tonight I know we've been sort of hauling we're hustling our way through today's podcast like I said I've got to turn right around and go to my kids preschool Hanukkah party I do want to do the quick scan quick scan of the YouTube chat room to see if anybody in the chat room has something that we can apply to everybody so I know this isn't the world's greatest part of the podcast but while I'm looking here please take a second to go click that like button you know there's like hundreds sometimes thousands of you that are checking this out on YouTube please go do that and if you're listening on old pod channels please take a second to subscribe actually everybody please subscribe  seriously please dear Lord please subscribe probably should have said that at beginning of the show but I'm an idiot and I forgot so do it now and drop a five star review if you feel sort of moved by the Pod spirits  um let's see here flame says I love you Dan but I hate you and Otani now because you're a Dodger fan and I'm a blue jays fan oh yeah I did wear the Dodgers hat today oh Tommy press conference today baby  just wait you think he ate the Dodgers now just wait to see what they do next  hmm let's see here um yeah these are all pretty team-specific stuff  oh Trey Murphy can he be top 90 rest of season um yeah I think it could be top 90 I don't think that's out of the question I just don't think we're gonna get that like top 50 60 run he went on last year  you guys remember this okay now I'm pissed off  I got mad because I just got reminded of this this conversation I had on social media last season and it was just so irritating because I I put Trey Murphy on my injury replacement board every day for the whole season and people were like you're being cruel to him and I was like being on the injury replacement board  is not an insult  it's merely  it's merely an acknowledgment  that we never got to see a player do it when it team was healthy  that's what the injury replacement board meant for Trey Murphy last year and people kept yelling at me he's better than an injury replacement he's better than an injury replacement and I'm like maybe but we haven't seen it because remember last year the Pelicans were healthy for count them  four  four games  they had their big dogs all together in November last year then Ingram went down then Zion went down Zion never came back  they were healthy for four games  the trailer if he did a lot of his damage when both Ingram and Zion were out he continued to do some damage even after Ingram came back  not quite as much but still a decent enough amount to stay relevant but we haven't seen him Trey Murphy that is  put up big numbers when all three of Zion Ingram and McCallum are healthy at the same time  this is that time now  I personally still think that Trey Murphy is good enough he's an incredible floor space for them good enough to defend her  super efficient  I think he's good enough basketball player where they're going to find opportunities for him to do stuff and shoot and get minutes  but I don't know if the usage is going to be anywhere near what it was last season and so that's why I think we just have to be ready for the possibility that he's outside the top 100 I think he's probably gonna sneak inside because hitting threes efficiently with a few defensive stats is good enough to be a nine cat play in Fantasy but there is no guarantee of it  and this is not going to be like I'm not gonna celebrate if he doesn't make it because I have him stash in a couple of teams because I think he's gonna be inside the top 100 but  it will be somewhat of a Vindication for what I was talking about last year which is to say we never really saw it  we never really saw a train Murphy have consistent nine cat value last season not talking about this year last season when the three main guys for the Pelicans were healthy that was all that that injury board met which admittedly I've been doing a bad job of keeping up on the injury board on social but luckily you guys listen to the Pod so you know the players that were looking at anyway  all right what else we got that could apply to everyone here um  remember this is your time to go find me on Twitter and like that's why I'm looking things up  Anthony Edwards says Draymond Gotti spended rest of season yeah that's not gonna happen he's not getting suspended for the whole season for a flailing uh face SPAC spank he basically spanked nerc itch on the face he was not trying to attack him this was different I mean you can see what you want to see  and it was beyond idiotic and Draymond is a clown these days I'm not gonna argue any of that stuff but the league is gonna watch it and they're gonna go yeah this video it was like flailing because he was not getting a foul call it was not even he wasn't even annoyed with nurk he was annoyed with an official  it's a very different situation than the last one where he was like physically assaulting a player on purpose  here's a good question what's a good trade to get Kyrie right now with Darius garland work oh  yeah I actually like that a lot Garland's been hot the last call it week and a half  and Kyrie is Kyrie he's you know end of the second round right now in kind of like almost a worst case scenario for him so far this year because lots of stuff can still get a higher and guys in front of him are probably still gonna fall back like Anthony Simon's much as I love him Brooke Lopez CJ McCollum Desmond Bane  if Kyrie comes back and just keeps doing the same thing he's doing he'll move up five to six slots just because people are going to drop behind him and then he gets any better at all then he moves farther up the board there's no chance that Darius Garland even on his best full season is going to get inside the top 25 it's just not it's not meant to be because Donovan Mitchell's their Donna Mitchell wasn't there I would change my tune but Garland is more of a 40 range kind of guy so yeah that's an intriguing one I think if you could handle Kyrie being out for a week or two whatever this ends up being  that's a that's a pretty good idea  I think the other names in that range are probably not going to get it done if you were trying to get Kyrie  you could almost definitely get him for Darren Fox right now which on Rodeo actually makes sense Believe It or Not head-to-head you might prefer to have Fox cuz he's healthy and taking 0 sucks mikal Bridges might get it done right now because he's healthy and Kyrie's not deje Marie might get it done  I don't think I would do Jimmy Butler because I think he's actually a guy probably improves the steals is the big thing with Butler right now  Evan Mobley I don't would really twist the build of your team but he'd be an interesting one Myles Turner probably not enough to get it done Ah that's probably about as high as I'd go rest these guys I don't want to give away a healthy dude right behind Kyrie for a hurt Kyrie that just the even if you end up sort of winning on a per game basis the games you miss here a week two weeks whatever it is that actually probably is enough to swing it back in the direction of the guy ranked ever so slightly lower  once someone's asking about Desmond Bane is that an interesting one um  yeah you know what I think I'm actually okay with that with jaw coming back if Bane could get you Kyrie I think I would do it that's a good that's a good suggestion  this one says do you think no suspension at all no I think it'll be a short one I just like basketball monster thinks 10 games  this poster was saying for the full season I just  I think it might be I think we might be looking at another two to five I just 10 feels like a lot when he wasn't actually going after a player  and I might be wrong maybe they go high just to again make a big example but I I just like I feel like it sends almost the wrong message of like the message here has to be come on dude watch your freaking arms you can flail around and be a gesticulating lunatic which we know you are but like there's a dude behind you watch your arms  you're gonna take a week off and think about it  he knows he's getting suspended I just don't think it's gonna be as much as everybody else thinks  what would be a good Anfernee Simons sell High great question FSF we'll call this dude so I don't have to curse on air  I'll tell you what we'll cover that on the cell High episode that'll hopefully come later today because right now Anthony is ranked number 21 but that is the insanely small sample size hard at work  I think the issue here and the reason that he might not get a feature spot on the sell high is that he's only done it for four games and I just I don't think people believe that it's real yet so you're probably not going to get anything better than like 50 range  and there's actually a chance that Simon's is 50 range or better so I don't know that I would take that  that's a weird route so cute as answer to actually a very very good question who should I sell Devin Booker for he's been on our sell High board a few times um and this is your moment with everybody coming back  I think if you can get anybody inside the top 20 you do it  because his usage is going to come down there's just like  it can't possibly stay where it was  he was alone for a few games no Superstars next to him this game yesterday was almost like not having a superstar next to him  Katie Beal together Booker will come down how much unclear  top 20 still feels like at achievable Mark for him  someone like a Dame actually feels like a really good Target if you can get Steph I doubt you can get stuff for Booker but I would try  Dame I bet you could get because he's been in a little shooting slump and I have this I have a pretty strong feeling those two guys sort of  not like fully swap places but Booker probably goes down towards 20 and Dame probably works his way up towards like 15 or 16 so  opportunity to maybe catch one dude on the up and one on the down not a bad idea anyway we'll talk more about this on the cell show that'll be coming up later today we're gonna pull the the plug on this front one because I gotta pack up and get back to my kids preschool as I was saying
