welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  good morning everybody my voice is almost back not all the way  but in no small part due to the fact that I had four basketball games to do play-by-play of and then all so yesterday it was my older son's seventh birthday party which I say we don't have a family party and people like oh nice so Queen  but that's not how it works in the best Bruce household because  then anybody really needs to know this my grandmother may she rest in peace and her sister  each started families in Southern California some  80 odd years ago at this point now and then their multiple children each started families in Southern California some 40 odd years ago and now their children which gets to My Generation all started families in Southern California like literally nobody left Southern California So a family party for us is like 35 people minimum up so we're trying to get the pipes warmed up today pipes have been a little bit abused over the last three and some odd days my kid also had this wonderful little league game but I get a little carried away cause I'm also an assistant coach so I'm yelling at the other dozen kids in The Dugout all that to say we'll see how the voice holds up today we'll see how the coughing fits hold up today you guys are just tracking the best brisk off at some point it'll probably get better but in any event welcome to Fantasy NBA today this is a sports ethos presentation it's Monday it's a start a week four hope your fantasy team is doing great so far my roto teams not surprisingly are better than my head teams but actually if you were everything's kind of hanging in there I've had to head team that's stinks one that just absolutely stinks  it's because it's it's more of a points League one I took a few shots in that League which is kind of unlike me and so far they've been terrible  oops that's what I get for going against my own advice but I wrote a teams are are cooking I'm feeling great I'm feeling spry I got 1100 in a lot of those things and it's just again a testament to how easy we can make fantasy basketball when we just follow the principles of simplifying the game  but I don't want to get too far into that I do want to celebrate my 30 deep team at some point during today's show that went eight and one and seven and two and it's two matchups last week so a robust 15 and 3 that vaults team Dan best press into second place by a game and a half in the 30s standings second best record out of all 30 clubs  let's go baby need this team to stay healthy though that's gonna be that's always the thing in those those deals  what's on tap for today is the question that you guys are probably asking why is Dan wandering off into his thoughts here at the beginning of the show well because we have a lot of things to cover we're going back through the weekend Sunday was a wild 11 gamer we'll do our reverse chronological trip through Sunday Saturday and then you know the usual game of did anybody not play on Sunday or Saturday the life of me I can't  ever bother myself to prep that part of the show beforehand it's fine Dan says to himself he'll figure it out on the Fly and we do but it's always a little bit embarrassing along the way we also have a short four game Monday preview I want to get you guys started situated on what to expect from this show over the rest of the week as well and I'm sure there's some promo mixed in there but we'll weave that in part way through as we are want to do because you know very classy show around here  so let's get going we'll start at the top and for those that are hanging out with us on YouTube the chat room is open  we'll see if we have time to get to questions at the end I'll try to get to the ones that were posted first so again good reason to get your questions in there ahead of time  but I figured this is going to be a relatively long show so again time will be of the essence and we have another show coming up later on today around 2:00 Pacific time so there isn't that much of a gap in between there  Charlotte Hornets lost Brandon Miller partway through this ball game turned ankle about 10 minutes in lamelo ball has finally started to play better but it hasn't mattered all that much because the team is still not all that good ball is number 32 and 9 cat largely because his field goal percent has been a pretty significant drag but everything else is about where you'd expect  maybe the hope that this scoring comes up a little bit farther than it is  but again this is like  not that far off from what you had to expect you were getting when you drafted him you drafted him knowing that with his field goal percent there was almost no chance he could get to be an actual first rounder in nine cat it had to be with a build in mind  and that build is fine  because if you knock out field goal percent and I guess you could knock out turnovers if you feel like doing that as well then he becomes relatively useful which is sort of a fun way of saying he's a mid-second rounder in that spot which is not all that far off from where he was being drafted  but you know damn if you're actually trying to win field goal percent he is going to make that much more difficult when you take a guy like that with your first round pick  the other news on Charlotte and  I'll mention it again mostly in passing I know Gordon here with PJ Washington they had these terrible games I don't think PJ's actually a  12 team rested season guy and I sort of haven't since the beginning of the season  but Gordon Hayward still could be what we don't really know about him is what is jobs gonna look like when miles Bridges comes back which is now imminent  and the report is that Bridges is just gonna get dropped right into the mix and he's gonna be cooking right out of the Chute which  nah  and I've said that before I  I get it and I will not pass judgment on if you want to pick him up and have miles bridges on your fantasy team I just personally don't that's not to say that I think it's like a morally reprehensible decision to put him on your fantasy team because you're not in charge of his punishment you're not in charge of how the Hornets you utilize him  I just think I can win my legs without him  he might be probably ends up being a value if you pick him up and play them because a lot of these guys are not very good based on some of the other numbers we're seeing from the Hornets and the fact that Brandon Miller's out and Terry Rozier is out there's obviously opportunity sitting there waiting for him I just think I can win without him and that way I don't have to root for him so just making my life easier that way  as far as the Knicks go another blowout victory for the Knicks they've had a couple of those in a row if memory serves and it's made it kind of hard to get a good feel for Josh Hart  because he filled in for RJ Barrett and he saw a big minute when he was a starter and he was a solid performer in this ball game even if the fantasy stats didn't really reflect that with only 6 points for boards in a couple of assists  I'm going to basically give him  the opportunity to play 30 minutes in a closer ball game so if the next can find themselves in a competitive basketball game because the last two they've won by 21 and 22 points and then they manhandled the Clippers who are flailing right now with James Harden but the next haven't really had like a true close ball game since November 3rd against the Bucks and I don't think RJ Barrett was even in for that ball game so what I'd like to see and I'm expecting the game tonight will be a good one there in Boston to take on the Celtics they're in Atlanta take on the Hawks on Wednesday one of those two damn ball games is gonna be a close one  how many minutes does Josh Hart yet  if it's 30 I'm keeping him if it's not I mean if it's close if it's like 29 I'm probably keeping him too but if it's like 25 26 like this ball game was that I'm probably moving on  RJ Barrett is one of the easiest sell High recommendations I've ever given out in my life he's number 55 and 9 cat right now and he's shooting way over his head in both field goal and free throw percent  he didn't just magically fix those  I wish he did but he did  the whole like  you know cat showing it Stripes kind of thing RJ Barrett's been in the league for a while now and he's never come anywhere near these percentages it's not like he's doing a bunch of other really good stuff is defensive stats are low his rebounds and assists are relatively low he's floating his numbers right now on good percentages which is never been his calling card  I don't know what you can get for him  he's ranked 55 there it is like I mentioned you're not gonna get someone else ranked around 55 but you can probably get someone else ranked around 80 or 85 right now  and if you think that someone has staying power in that ring and like Brooke Lopez is at 85 and he's a Buy Low John Collins is at 86 and he's probably basically that  Terry Rozier is hurt maybe you could buy on him  I don't think you can get Jalen Williams for him but I certainly try  that's your target range guys that you think are in that 80 some odd that are either stuck there or maybe even moving up  do it do it do it now before the wheels come off  and they could come off tonight Wizards oh the Wizards all right so this is one of the teams we probably have to spend an extra minute or two on and we'll zip through some clubs where there isn't a whole lot happening but the Wizards there's stuff happening Daniel Gafford went to the locker room for a thumb injury he did end up coming back to the Ballgame but he again this whole like in and out of the lineup thing for him has been annoying it's probably the easiest way to phrase it he's number one 15 and 9 cat and he really hasn't had a chance to play yet which is sort of the story for a different reasons because Gafford it's because he's been hurt on and off but it's all so kind of the story for tyus Jones and it's kind of the story for Jordan Poole  although pool actually played normal starters in the ball game and then fouled out in 32 minutes  and then for Kyle kuzma who's been one of the few guys on the Wizards that has mostly seen minutes  he's we finally saw a little bit of the cooldown for him yes yesterday so let's start with kuzma because he's the easy one he was a cell High coming into this ball game yesterday I've been yelling about that for a week  he's still a little bit of a cell High because he's still above his career marks and percentages it even if I think the usage stays relatively constant at this higher mark  he's still liable to fall a little bit farther  so I mean he's kind of in that same range with who the hell were we just talking about a second ago  RJ Barrett  because they're scoring a bunch you can probably get some stuff I think I'd rather have kuzma than Barrett so maybe that's a guy you could exchange him for but almost all the other guys around kuzma the Border guys that I would rather have Keegan Murray is a great still a low he's still only shooting 36% from the field  ogn and obese in there and D'Angelo Russell Draymond Green who's playing pretty well so far this year shout out to Dream on I know he's missed some games but clink apella I doubt you could get him but  nurk probably won't be enough Brook Lopez same thing like we just talked about  so kuzma's a cell High which is intriguing because everybody else in the team is either a Buy Low or a stay the hell away  Jordan Poole has been a wreck in every sense he's number one hundred and seventy-five and he was drafted in your 40  one of the  biggest busts of the first three weeks of the NBA season I feel very good about the fact that I drafted him in 09 category League's because this was the fear not necessarily that the Wizards Wizards were gonna get blown out every single ball game but just that the bottom wasn't going to actually be there for him he was the high variability fourth round pick on the board where I mean maybe things clicked and maybe he took 23 shots a game and shot 45% like it was two years ago  or maybe he didn't get as many shots as we thought and maybe he didn't get the open looks he got in Golden State and maybe you get this cow pie of a start  I think it's pretty fair to say that he'll be better than this going forward dude shooting 77% of the foul line that's not a number that's going to stick Steals and blocks of started to come down closer to where you'd expect them to be remember he started the year with a really high number there and still feel like 14's exceedingly low for him I know he only took 12 in this last ball game Danny was actually the guy out there kind of going chucking  I got to think that pool at some point says F this and starts taking 15 to 20 shots again but I guess we don't really know for sure  so that it's the other half of the question which is  if I'm buying low on Jordan Poole what am I even willing to give up  cuz I never thought he was gonna get to 40 and someone spent a fourth round pick on this dude so they're not going to sell them for pennies after three weeks  could you get him  for Kyle kuzma probably but do you want to  I don't even know I'm actually leaning towards just not dealing with the Jordan Poole thing at all in fact if you buy on Jordan Poole it's probably just to try to catch a heater in a bucket  or between your two hands you want to just like snap it up like a lightning bug  and then as soon as Jordan Poole gets hot send him off trade him for someone else  Ty is Jones said one of the worst games of the year he pulled himself a Kyle Lowry in this one and that's real bad he has now fallen to 147 and his minutes are down to 26  and they're just I mean he was bad in this ball game not only that they're just like he's not heavily involved in the things that are happening probably because he's out there with kuzma and Jordan Poole and now Daddy has taken a more prominent ball handling role  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game-winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery

locations  I'm willing to admit that tyus Jones probably doesn't get to where you drafted him around 75 or 80  I thought he'd be relatively safe in that zone actually so right now I feel like I'm wrong on him now things could come around for tires he liked pool hasn't really been able to get normal starters minute to this point and that could still change uh but as we saw yesterday if he's not playing well he got replaced and as we saw it like two or three games back he got replaced that was Delon Wright a few games back dalan got hurt and so now was Bilal who replaced him  and below a really good ball game 20 points 7 boards three assists four Steals and four three pointers I know he's shot eight out of 12 from the field which is not a sustainable number  and played 34 minutes off the bench largely because tyus Jones was looking terrible in this ball game the starters for the Wizards as a team were God awful  so no I don't think that belongs to get 34 minutes every single ball game I think he's probably worth a speculative add in case the Wizards just like you know what  boom set the TNT and this thing early  but I think you'll see the veterans get at least another month or two because again we're only three weeks into the season so don't expect this this club I believe thing to stick for now but if you want to get out in front of it I'm okay with that just understand that you probably will end up casting him off to the way for wire at some point and then for Denny object yeah just kind of hanging out inside the top 100 and I'm thinking more and more that might just be where he ends up all right that was our Wizards break for the show let's try to speed through some stuff Brooklyn got Nick Claxton back and he was great 10 points 13 boards four blocks I mentioned a possible by low while he was hurt because someone probably got frustrated it's not gonna happen anymore Spencer Dinwiddie is not a 12 team her even with Cam Thomas out I don't think he gets there he's never really had a great translatable fantasy stat set and here he's just too far down the pecking order McHale Bridges went kind of crazy in this game he took 29 shots and missed most of them and this is sort of like the Michael you were hoping you wouldn't get it ruined his percentages it dropped him like 12 slots in ranks but whatever you like he's fine you're not gonna do anything with him cam Johnson 16 shots actually really like that number I'd love for him to stay in that range I know cam Thomas will come back at some point in that old screw up this shot distribution but I got to think that a lot of them would come from McHale and this ball game the thing we were wondering on the  Nets was with Simmons out and Claxton back would any of the Wings sort of the reservee reservi would any of the reservee Wings still be good and Royce O'Neill was pretty good Off the Bench Dorian finney-smith got the start it feels very much like those guys will flip-flop because Dorian had foul issues and Royce was just playing better  I think they'll mix and match and I would be inclined to say both of those guys now fall more into the schedule Play Zone as opposed to when Claxton was out Dorian Finney Smith was very much above the cut line for that whatever that was two weeks  Clippers lost to the Grizzlies that's when you know things have gotten bad this year Memphis finally gets their second win of the Season Clippers are now three and six they've lost all five games has it been five with hardened or four  how many games is James Harden played  Four they lost the game before him as well they've lost all four games with hardened interestingly James Harden has been pretty efficient so far for the clippers but he hasn't really exerted himself  and  I mean it  boy I knew the learning curve was gonna be rough I didn't think it was gonna be this where I Paul George is tumbled out of the first round  Kawhi Leonard has tumbled into the fourth round Harden is also in the fourth round in his sort of limited minutes so far a limited usage so far Russell Westbrook is tumbled down to the end of the sixth throughout after a hot start he's numbers being floated by two steals per ball game this is as I mentioned and there was pushback which I thought was kind of insane there were like how do you  how do you call it a Buy Low on all of these Superstars I'm like because I know what's gonna happen  because the moment we heard that James Harden was back it was a sell High  because people were like thank the good whatever he's back  but then you knew there was going to be this adjustment period with all of these guys and so that was when you sort of dug in and said all right how can I acquire these dudes on the cheap when am I going to be pulling the trigger on that trade  I think you could probably get kawaii for pretty cheap right now Paul George would still cost you a little bit at seven turnovers yesterday but his other numbers were pretty good in the lost to Memphis I don't know that you want Russell Westbrook necessarily because at some point I feel like they probably split Westbrook and harden up but who knows maybe they don't go that route  but you'll probably be able to get most of these guys for pretty cheap either now or in the very near future and that's the way I would look  but Memphis gotta win which they very much needed Desmond Bane has been really really good so far this year no no issues there where is he at middle of the second round number 19 Marcus Smart was a little better in this ball game JJJ had a rough one and they won anyway  I've been keeping one eye on Luke Kennard it feels like this is probably where they're gonna let him sit though 24 minutes and if you knock down a few three pointers so we can probably move on from that got a few Jacob Gilyard questions he played 24 minutes as the starting point guard had three assists and three steals but like  if he's just gonna stand out there and hope to get some steals that's not going to be enough for me to make a move on it and then the bismack biyombo experience has been good so far but then he did the thing that I was worried he would do which is at some point during the biyombo adventure he's gonna go out there and he's going to take a wet dump on a percentage or both  and he went three for seven at the free throw line in this game which didn't come completely ruin his night because he still had 12 boards and three defensive stats and five of six from the field  but this type of stuff happens with him and typically the field goal percent which is usually decent like as soon as he tries to do too much that comes off the rails all so  all that to say I'm fine if you want to stream Beyond bow I'm also fine if you want to just not deal with it that's all okay Philadelphia Indiana this is a fun one teams combined for about 270 points  to 63 all right fair enough whatever I rounded up Tyreese Halliburton 25 and 17  miles Turner 22 points 5 Boards of Steel and three blocks I mean everybody was piling up numbers Turner by the way is into the 20s in nine cat now but ain't nobody touching Tyrese maxey's line who is now the number two player in all of fantasy sports some of that is because he's at one point one turnovers per game but you know what that matters in nine cat  50 points 7 boards five assists three blocks seven three-pointers 20 out of 32 shooting in three for three at the foul line wow  so look  I thought Max was gonna be good this year said this on Friday  no idea he was going to be this good  kids turned himself into a superstar  I got that we'd be able to get him in the 40s and he'd be in like the 20s maybe 30s in a bad whatever  number two  behind only Anthony Davis  it's pretty insane  Brittany insane I think so you know some of this stuff probably isn't sustainable for him the high block number probably comes down  the 50 and a half percent shooting on 20 shots per game I mean maybe you know he's been pretty efficient in the past  five boards seven assists 38 minutes A Night That doesn't feel like a number that should stick all year but it's a Nick nurse team so  he plays his guys  I think if you could sell Maxie and get someone in the top 15 you probably do it but I don't know that I sell for anything behind that right now he really looks like he's someone that could just stick and be awesome  now as much as I want to stop and continue to talk about Tyrese we gotta talk about the stuff that's more fringy because that's where you can get an edge at this point and that is  again nobody's minutes are secure in Indiana I had a few of you guys on Twitter yelling at me that I was too low on Benedict mathura and I don't believe that to be the case because again he wasn't quite as good at this ball game and so it immediately his minutes got yanked around by Carlisle like the second he wasn't good  that's just the way things are in Indy  there are three guys on that team they get to play Halliburton Turner and Bruce Brown those are the only guys in my mind that are really safe on rosters and then buddy hield is kind of your stash and hope that he gets moved guy but that's it as far as Philly goes we had some really sad news over the weekend or I mean I guess it could have been worse but pretty crummy news over the weekend about Kelly oubre Jr who was hit by a car while walking in Philly and ended up in the hospital luckily he was released pretty quickly but a number of broken ribs hip injury like pretty significant stuff that's gonna keep him out for a while that's the word is that it's you know the extended time I think is what both whoya and Shams referred to  which means we gotta try to capitalize on that as much as it sucks that it happened  Phillies gonna try to figure out how to fill in the around the edge is and day one without Kelly oubre it was a little more Dean Anthony Melton and a lot of more Nick Patton  who I'll admit I don't think Stacey healthy for all that long but this is the bottom we saw with the Clippers also when he reliably got 30 minutes he was a top 60 fantasy play  it's just that it didn't happen for more than two weeks at a time because he ended up with some sort of knee or hip or back thing cuz he's old as a mofo and it'll probably happen again here but you know what I don't care because until that time I want them on my fantasy team  someone was like what's the upside with bitum I'm like the upside is that he freaking does everything besides score all that much  he gets threes at a high percentage which is great won't hurt your percentages we'll give you three pointers he can rebound I find it actually freaking amazing he didn't get an assistant yesterday's ball game because he does pass well he gets deals he gets blocks he doesn't turn the ball over  he gets you eight out of nine category is it just the one he doesn't do is the one that everybody pays attention to which is points  forget the fact that he's a punt points darling he's good enough even if you're not punting points  so I think but two needs to be added everywhere as the Kelly oubre Fill in and it's possible that there are days where maybe he's not as good and and someone like a Rob Covington or Pat Beverley or Fork on cork Moses additional playing time but it does sure look like and that's the thing with tomb once he also finds his guy he tends to stick with it  we are moving slowly today I don't like four or five games into this thing I got a long way to go my voice is already tired so we got to pick up the pace a little bit  Chicago beat Detroit 119 108 Kevin Knox had a nice scoring game and he shot Seven for eight you can basically ignore that Alec Burks is someone I would pay attention to he was actually doing a lot before he got hurt  and immediately Marcus sasser's minutes got slashed  and this is why I said when Jade and Ivy and Alec Burks come back you're gonna see guys minutes get chewed up a little bit so Kelly and he's only got 25 minutes he fell on his face Marcus Sasser 20 minutes that's not enough Kate obviously playing a ton know Jalen Duren so then you have this do I bother with Marvin Bagley and I Isaiah Stewart thing the answer is Maybe  I think I'd probably trust Stewart more than Bagley right now and then I think I'm and I remember probably picking up Alec Burks just to see because before he got hurt he had basically carved out that like 26 to 28 minute bench role and in that he was being asked to score a lot because there's no boy on bug zdanowicz and someone else besides Kate has got to figure out a way to put the ball in the hoop I start Thompson only had one defensive stat he did have 16 rebounds which is freaking nuts again some of that because Jalen Duren is not there we know that us are is going to come down he wasn't going to stay as a top 40 asset the whole year because keeping up three and a half defensive stats was going to be incredibly difficult he's gonna be fun so don't panic on it but again this is another thing where I bunch of people yelling at me that like I was way too low on the Detroit guards but it's so easy to forget who's healthy and who's not on these teams  Kobe white has been a little better lately he fouled out in 32 minutes of this ball game I'm not willing to adjust my bifocals on him yet he's still typically a bad field goal percent guy who doesn't do much besides get some points and assists and I get it everybody wants to hunt assists but I need more  simple as that  Zach is a by low he's sitting still near the edge of the top 100 you know that'll work its way up tomorrow in voucher have kind of worked their way back to where they belong basically so that's sort of the short version on Chicago let's keep rumbling well Kyrie Irving has sorted out his season after kind of a slow start carries up to number 18 he's still only shooting 46% overall on the season so that's a number that continues to rise but yeah you got no issues there Luka doncic in shape always at the beginning of the season dude gets off to a hot start every year but Dallas looks pretty good so far this season  Derek Lively is probably the only guy you're really wondering about and he played 26 minutes and it was okay  so I think my take on lively is that at the beginning of the year I wanted to make sure we didn't get passed by with this one but now I think I've seen enough to say that when the whole front court is healthy and Max Lee was actually back out for this ball game when the whole front court is healthy he's probably not a top 100 guy because it's free throws two poor and he's just not gonna have enough consistent minutes to get the other stuff he's gonna need reminds me a lot of like Nic Claxton before he developed and figured out how to stay on the floor for a full starters minutes  so maybe he gets there but I don't think it'll be this season I think you can treat Derek Lively more as a schedule stream play but if you wanted to stash it's still okay I just don't think you have to Tim Hardaway Jr still hanging out just inside the top 100 so keep rolling with him until the wheels come off which I do think they will eventually but they haven't totally yet Wheels have come off for Grant Williams he's back to being just a schedule play as well  for the Pelicans it would appear that the lack of CJ McCollum has been a bigger deal than we expected  there is a  sharing issue that we're seeing come across Pelicans Twitter and I admit I haven't watched a ton of pelicans basketball live so far this year so I don't want to jump in and and throw a bunch of opinions around so let's just say this notice Valentina whenever he puts up a good ball game he's a cell High because it's minutes are not that high so when you get the good one you want to try to cash in on it  in the short term here Matt Ryan is a streamable threes guy Dyson Daniels is a really nice feeling for herb Jones when he slotted in here as a starter getting starter's minutes we know his Fantasy game can translate so that's good  Jordan Hawkins is the kind of up and down fill in for CJ McCollum I'm inclined to say we probably don't need to be sitting on Hawkins the percentages or field goal percent in particular has been very bad the assists are not where we need them to be the defensive stats are not where we need them to be I don't think that he's going to be good enough for nine cat I'd much prefer to roll dice and Daniels but of course if herb Jones comes back then that's then he probably blows that up and and then you'd want to get her back into your lineup and that's basically where I'm at with the pelly's right now  Denver lost at Houston boy the Rockets are running right now they lost their first three games of the year now they've won six in a row now admittedly it's been pretty heavily at home so far so we'll see if they can keep the Good Vibes going on the road but  man they are defending and they are fighting their butts off  top to bottom that roster is fighting  but in terms of fantasy stuff the only two things we were keeping an eye on here Reggie Jackson was okay  probably deserves a roster Spot while Jamal Murray is out I don't think he's gonna blow the roof off the building but I think generally he'll be good enough to start and then with Houston I was kind of hoping that Tara eason's minutes would work their way up from 15 over his first three games back but he still stuck between 15 and 20 if you're sitting on Eason I'd say give him  three more games and if it's minutes don't get reliably into the low 20s by that point then you can probably move on because there's really like  the ramp up doesn't need to be that long for him and we've already seen three games in there has been basically no ramp up yet so  row meanwhile Jeff Green is seeing a crap ton of playing time right now I don't think you need to do anything with it but he's getting a lot of trust against well now his old team here  one of his old teams but boy kudos to the Rockets man they are they're beating teams they're beating good teams  Miami took care of San Antonio on the roads Spurs were a little bit better in this ball game efficiency wise killed in Johnson had one of his better shooting games which you guys know as soon as he has one of those  I say you need to sell he's outside the top 100 even right after this super efficient shooting game sell on keldon Johnson I don't think you're going to be able to get anything on Jeremy Sohan because he's outside the top one 60  he also had a better ball game here sell if you can we Zach Collins those guys you hang on to Devin Michelle you hang on to Miami Side Kyle Lowry sat this one out because I believe it was a back-to-back for the Heat  he was the initial big winner with Tyler hero out and Jimmy Butler out in the previous ballgame Butler was back for this one Heroes will be out for a little bit longer  so Duncan Robinson actually was the guy who stepped in and had the better ball game here  Duncan to me is more of a 3-point streamer when the heat are with everybody other than Tyler hero Jaime Hawkins is  if you could guarantee he was playing 30 minutes I'd say go ahead and add and start him because I love the defensive stats he has that sort of a cross the board fantasy stuff it's hard to know that he's going to get 30 minutes every game  presumably Lowry's back for the next one and that's what makes a little bit more complicated so I think I would start Butler at a bio and probably Lowry  if the heat are if those three guys are all playing in the Heat's next ball game if Lowry's out again you probably couldn't go Robbinson and Hawkins and it's possible that you can even go hawk as if Lowery's back but I don't think that I'd roll the dice on it in against a games cap well Lou Dort still getting defensive stats I don't know how he's doing it he's got four in this one but he's on a defensive stats role and that's keeping his value inside the top 40 so far with 2.6 defensive stats a game and he still shooting 50% from the field he is also a very intense so high promise that I don't think you're going to be able to get much for him but I mean if you can get anything inside the top 80 I think I would do it  Phoenix Bradley Beal this is like the you got the adrenaline games then you have the sort of like low games but he'll be fine Kevin Durant's ago nirk is typically a go I don't think that you do much else with Phoenix and then we'll see what the hell they look like if Devin Booker ever gets back  book are still only played two games so far this year that's bummer  Minnesota they are good ladies and gentlemen Timberwolves are seven and two they've all won six games in a row they have all so one five and oh at home  guys home court is back in a big way this year  in any event I think we have enough to say that Kyle Anderson is a streamer only this season I think we have enough to say that Nas Reed is a go he's healthy my Conley's ago and there really no other questions on the Timberwolves side people keep asking me what I think about Jade McDaniels I think he's much much better in real life than he is in fantasy he's probably gonna end up somewhere between 100 and 140 on a per game basis and that's fine I mean that's probably startable in 14 teams I don't know about 12  the Warriors are looking old this year Chris Paul was bad in this one after a good game the previous one draymond's been playing okay but Clay's looked really old  I like that clay got 16 shots at least in this ball game that's what I need I need the usage at him the shooting was in there but I the shots are enough for me to hang on to him Chris Paul's a hole  think we might be able to drop Andrew Wiggins I don't know what the hell's wrong with him I'll say it on every show there's obviously something broken with Wiggins  but I don't know what it is I don't know if it's physical or mental or both but he's broken and you can try to wait it out but when you don't know what's wrong then you also don't know how long it's going to take to fix itself  and he is sinking fantasy teams  all right and that's probably all we need to say about the Warriors Portland in La we talked about Skylar maze a few days ago because the Blazers were off for like three days before this ball game he's very much a stream because they just have no one else at point guard now he doesn't Shoot Many three-pointers he doesn't get many defensive stats but he gets you a whole lot of assists and dude got 12 you almost don't care what else he does as long as he doesn't ruin your percentages 12 assists is enough to start a damn guy  otherwise no huge surprises DeAndre ayton struggled with Anthony Davis that is not a surprise at all I think Davis is a behemoth sorry Dominate and you're not at that level yet Jeremy Grant is going to get a lot of shots while everybody's hurt so it's shade and sharp I know he had a tougher game with the seven turnovers but everything else stays basically the same but he's stable was playing relatively well I thought but he only got 20 minutes here for whatever reason and you can leave him alone  Lakers side is somewhat interesting though it's worth pointing out the LeBron took this game off probably figured he was at like you know 75 80% played the long game assumed that his Lakers could beat the Blazers without him and they did just barely do so  but barely still counts  and what we've gotten out of the Lakers here lately is a couple good games in a row from Cameron reddish  and some of those have been with LeBron number cam hit the big shot in the previous ball game or a few big shots in the previous game in Phoenix to get the Lakers their first road win of the year it's 17 points and three steals in that one he's actually had three steals in three consecutive ballgames and the Lakers are starting to trust cam reddish up that said  the Lakers are still without Jarred Vanderbilt  and Gabe Vincent and in this one LeBron James and those are three guys that are likely to play pretty significant minutes  and also guys that are going to give the Lakers more flexibility in whether they go big or small whether they go defense whether they go offense  camera playing 30 minutes a game when all those guys come back so I if you wanted to stream them when LeBron was out that's fine I feel safer frankly streaming really hot tomorrow when LeBron is out because he's more inclined to go take shots I know they both took ten in this ball game but you catch my meaning  as far as like rest of season long term outlook for those guys  and ain't much  you can drop Christian Wood by the way the Lakers of figured out that they can go cam reddish and that's big enough  as opposed to the Twin Towers which was actually a little bit too big because Cam and really have actually been doing an okay job of rebounding like his finally want to rebounding battle in this game and that's kind of what they've been fighting with over these last few contests is figuring out how to not get completely smashed on the glass we're already 42 minutes into this thing and we haven't even gotten back to Saturday but at least we've covered 22 of the 30 teams I want to remind everybody very quickly that you

manscape.com  Saturday  Saturday Jae Crowder strained a groin I had to hover over that one because I forgot what he heard himself with  and that probably means a little bit more Pat connaughton in the long run not that it matters at all really Dame was out campaign is nothing more than a schedule play because it's Fantasy game has holes in it Brooke Lopez is a really big Bi-Lo for me he's been played off the floor a couple of times by teams that are able to attack the drop coverage but he's also shooting 40% so I have all the faith in the world that broke will be better than he is right now in the beauty part is that he's basically right where you drafted him and he's been terrible don't you love a guy who's floor is where you drafted them  I do  I do Orlando my Jalen Suggs love continues I did not expect to be into Jalen Suggs or freaking careless Levert this year but here we are Suggs is number 67 he didn't do a whole bunch of the across the board stuff for this game he's like you know what today I'm gonna go just score a bunch and he did and that was cool also  I told you guys the Go-Go Mo Wagner thing was gonna be a battle for minutes they almost played the exact same number like down to within 11 seconds of each other  Vagner is better at permits so if you're gonna play either of them you go mow you don't have to I thought Cole Anthony would be better while markelle fultz and Gary Harris are out but he didn't really get a chance to do all that much so Cole Anthony schedule stream level guy sucks is it go  Wagner's a a roll of the dice play and then Jonathan Isaac who looks really good actually and 17 minutes at this ball game I'm not doing anything with Jonathan Isaac until he clears 20 minutes one game like Orleans to prove to me that he can play 20 minutes and his limbs won't physically fall to the floor and then I would add him like on the spot if he plays 20 minutes and one second in their next ball game I will add him up 19 minutes and 59 seconds  maybe not  Toronto OG is questionable with a finger cut doesn't sound like a long-term thing so I wouldn't worry too much about it they also got destroyed in this game so you saw kind of the drop off here Scotty Barnes fell down a little bit he still number 11 in nine cat though so it wasn't that big of a drop Dennis Schroder everybody it was a blowout loss so everybody was kind of bad  the guy I'm watching is is Yakima portal who was actually kind of okay in this game  six out of 10 shooting but precious shoe is back and so I'm a little bit worried on that front but it's like you're gonna drop pedal you just  just hope he's like he's not spot where you just sort of hoping  Celtics nothing really I mean Sam Houser looks like a 3-point streamer these days but nothing else really  does somebody sits out then we can play all for  there's the heat again  Kyle Lowry had a big ball game that's why we were talking about him when we discussed their game on Sunday at Atlanta  Atlanta Bogdan bogdanovich no defensive stats in this one and don't be surprised if that happens like five or six games in a row because his steel rate is out of this world so far this year and there's just no chance it stays anywhere near where it was Bogdan in a best case scenario is right around top 100 which is perfectly good reason to hang on to him if you want to but there's no chance he finishes near 60 where he's at right now if you can get a top 80 85 range guy for him I think I would do it  saddiq Bey schedule play at this point I know Jalen Johnson had sort of a rare off game but he's the he's the guy who starting for them right now and Bae has moved almost seemingly to a permanent bench role I think you can drop him again or schedule stream him when Atlanta has a good spot Jaylen Johnson you're in a nice firm hold posture that's a pretty easy call to make  Cavalier is another good one for Max Drew seeing around top 65 value on the year so keep rolling their his field goal percent has now finally started to come up where we kind of knew it would after a very slow start loving the rebounds I did not expect that out of spruce it's why I didn't draft him anywhere but it's also why I picked him up every single place early in the year and they've sorted up to this point  but cares delivered is honestly the new Man On Campus here we've been watching him and he's been looking good and I just kept wondering like is there a way we could get that field goal percent up into the low 40s and of the high 30s could we get the free throw up into the low to mid 70s and stead of the high 60s and you know this ball game gives confidence that maybe that's a possibility so I think Levert needs to be on rosters he's number 90 in nine cat right now despite the bad percentages that's how good he's been in other stuff and he's a great handcuffed in case Darius Garland or Donovan Mitchell takes a game off ever  so  stardom  meanwhile Jared Allen is still on a minute's cap we heard so there's I guess a little bit of a Bi-Lo window there if you want  I don't know how long the minutes Cap's gonna be they called it sort of undetermined length meaning  like if you buy low you might be dealing with this for a while we just don't really know  and now let's play the did we forget about any teams that didn't play Saturday or Sunday part of the proceedings Charlotte we talked about Washington we talked about Philly Detroit Brooklyn Boston Minnesota San Antonio New Orleans Houston Utah that's one of them so we got to talk about Utah and we got to talk about Sacramento those are the two teams all right let's scroll down to Utah so you guys can see the Jazz numbers there they are Jordan Clarkson had one of his better games but you know like people are more than willing to forget that terrible ones when he puts up the good one he's not inside the top 200 boo oh try abaji is kind of interesting right now I don't know what the Jazz are going to do when Walker Kessler gets back from his elbow thing my guess is that he comes back into the starting lineup and a bhaji probably goes to the bench that pushes Market into power forward or Colin's power forward and marketing to small forward  so the Obagi thing is probably shorter term the longer term thing here still seems to be keyonte George Wright a terrible shooting game two for 12 but at 11:00 and that's basically his job right now just distribute do your best impression of Mike Conley from last year without the ability to space the floor quite so well and this is why George probably belongs on rosters because if you can get a full-term point guard that just goes out there and collects assist and tries not to screw things up too bad that's a guy that we need to see what happens  now if the percentage is stink and if he doesn't get enough steals or threes or whatever then maybe he'd done something doesn't end up getting inside the top one 30 but I mean 11 assists is hard to ignore so get on him Rodeo sit on him head-to-head play him see what happens that's my take on Utah and then Sacramento was the other one we were talking about the Kings Kevin herder had a big ball game here  Keegan Murray exploded and there are more of those coming  Darren Fox is currently listed as doubtful but he did participate in five on five so he's getting close meaning this Malik monk point guard thing is probably not gonna last that much longer it is kind of what he does off the bench anyway but 29 minutes is much higher than what he was seeing would Fox was healthy and for monk that probably drops him from a must play guy more to like a schedule stream level guy still good enough to play some of the time but not quite all of the time  I think the biggest note on the heat of the king's is that if you can still buy on Keegan Murray I would do it even after this big ball game I still think he goes higher than that this year  and that is your look back now let's look forward a short four game Monday before we see if we have any time to answer a question or two uh  maybe maybe not with another show coming up later today we might just do a couple of questions and then kind of call it for New York and again the thing was we talked about all these teams already so I guess this part we can do pretty quick for the next just a reminder Josh Hart and RJ Barrett are the two guys that we've been talking about for Boston nothing Washington the whole damn roster kuzma's sell hi gaffords always hurt so maybe a little bit of a Buy Low tyus Jones maybe a small Bi-Lo Jordan Poole I don't know that I want anything to do with it avda feels like kind of this consistent middling guy that's fine Toronto we just talked about Turtle Chicago  kind of nobody unless you want to call Levine a little bit of a Bi-Lo I guess Kobe white someone you could watch I just I still don't believe that his stripes are going to change Milwaukee Brooke Lopez is probably the guy you're paying attention to their Cleveland Levert Strauss Jared Allen and then the Kings we just talked about if Fox is still out guess you could talk about herder doing more stuff but mostly Malik Monk and Ken Sacramento get a couple wins in a row they did actually have two in a row can they get a third without their fearless leader  all right that leaves us about six minutes for questions or so so let's scroll all the way to the top and there were a lot of them and I'll try to do just the first handful  before I take a break from talking for a minute Brian says who's the better for the week Kobe White Horse Skylar maze I'm probably going Skylar Mays on that one it's just a belief in Kobe white thing although I admit I haven't looked at schedule yet uh  let's see what do we got  make sure I've got the same number of games for these two teams how many games do these clubs have Blazers have four bulls have four yeah I'll go I'll go Schuyler maze  is Derek Lively 10 team roster bowl no I don't think so  is it tyus Jones drop season not yet not yet  hey Brandon Marcos what's up dude how close are we to Clay being a drop in 10 team Head to Head very close 12 I think you got sort of hang on forever 10 you know he was in the 60s in ranked last year and in ten teamers you're sort of looking to start anybody that's inside like the top 80  85 maybe 90 at sort of the deepest you know there's a chance he doesn't get back to 60 so I would say close but not yet there  Troy asks does my Gordon Hayward for Jordan Poole make sense um yeah that's not a terrible idea I mean it's a trade where you're hoping you're selling high and buying low at the same time is there a chance that pool is terrible all year yes is there a chance that Gordon Hayward continues to be you know top 80 to 100 range even after miles Bridges comes back yeah there's a chance that Hayward  doesn't completely fall off the map that's very true but he's at 56 right now you know 2.4 defensive stats is not going to hold for Hayward so that number is coming down  Bridges is going to take a little bit away best case scenario for Hayward is that he stays inside the top 80  and it all likelihood he probably Falls a little farther than that so  if you can afford to lose a guy who's in the 80s and take a shot on pool who maybe if things go crazy he can get into that 5660 range  it's not a terrible idea I'm afraid of Jordan Poole I admit that personally I have trouble pulling this off but I think this is actually a relatively  like well thought out by low sell High combo  Trey Jones are keyonte George I'll go Trey Jones on that one I still think that at some point the Spurs are gonna let him play more and maybe even start  I think it's possible that the Spurs are like low-key tanking by playing goofball lineups and saying this is something we're doing just saying like that way at the end of the year they don't have to force one banana into fighting for a play in spot people went crazy when the Spurs won like one game middle two weeks ago they've lost five in a row they're not gonna be good yet guys it's gonna take time  Mo vogner Skylar maze or Jordan Hawkins all holds through this week  depends on who else is out there doesn't it because Wagner is a dice roll Hawkins is a dice roll maze if anybody comes back would be a dice roll I think Skyler Mays is your one truly safe guy in that group  Dan how do you view Austin Reeves rest of season radishes on The Wire yeah I don't want Kim reddish for Austin Reeves Austin got off to a terrible start he's been sort of leveling off here I still expect his field goal percent to come up from 43 and a half to probably high forties and that should get him inside the top one hundred so know your your definitely sticking with Austin Reeves  Duncan Robinson Emmanuel quickly or cares Levert to stream this week and I got to go back and look at schedules again you guys are hurting me here with the schedule thing where did I just lose that  page to  Cavaliers have four ah Nicks and heat were the other two teams that were being asked about the Knicks have four the Heat have three so he's out so comes down to quickly or Levert I think I'll go Levert  do you think wreath will see an uptick in minutes I don't  you know me and young players also he's not even available in a lot of leaks like Yahoo and ESPN haven't even added to the board so my answer to that is a fairly resounding no  he played 14 minutes players are missing everybody and  like I don't know what like how does that get to 30  it doesn't  a couple more questions would you trade Zion to get on Yucca and either subs or Jalen green  I mean I don't want Zion on my team so if you're not hunting free throws this is an easy yes if you're punting free throws then you probably stick with Zion  should I trade Maxi for Larry marking and no I'll keep Tyrese Maxey there Market has been great  uh but  I don't know I mean like  Maxi could fall behind him but I don't think that it's guaranteed so I think I'd rather just take more maxi  no that's the same question written a different way do you have the email Melton Killian Hayes Kobe white Denny avya which would you say is a must roster and a 10 team Roto League  none  of the Melton would be the closest of those four  Brian says dope shirt where did you get it oh my shirt says fantasy nerds shout out to Robin marks who actually sent me this shirt as a thank you for coming on his podcast which is like the kindest thing ever  what's his handle I think it's believed in fantasy he's the host of the believe in fantasy basketball podcast  yeah b l e a v i n fantasy Robin Mark sent me this shirt you can probably give you the link and you can probably go buy one  it's sweet there's like five or six cool designs they've got over there this is just the one that I thought was the best kind of because this dude could be me  to those listening there is a nerd on the shirt and the nerd somewhat resembles yours truly  I one field goal percent by 0.3 despite lamelo pool and giddy congratulations your opponent was awful  would you trade SGA for Joel embiid no I would not I was drafting I was drafting SGA over and bead and a lot of formats because I decided I wanted to go a little bit safer on the health early and they'll both those guys are gonna be at the top of the board so  whatever  morality stuff aside what do you think Bridges rank is going forward  um hard to say I mean you know they said they're going to use them a lot but he also hasn't played basketball in forever so it's hard to see him getting all the way back to you know a couple years ago remember he was like a top 40 guy a few years ago  I think you could see him pretty easily get inside the top 80 though  would you trade klaxon and Austin Reeves to get Dairy as Garland and Zach Collins that's a fair trade Den that's a fair trade Claxton and Garland people value somewhat similarly claxton's going to be probably better ranked in nine CAD garlic gives you more of the Guard stats and then Reeves and Collins are somewhat similarly link I think I probably prefer the Claxton Reef side because I'm lower on Darius Garland than most people are but Darius is gonna get up into the 50 range and Claxton will probably where the hell is Nick now he's only played two games so it's hard to see what he's gonna be he's number 22 but it's limited sample he's probably gonna be inside the top 40 Reeves and Zach Collins are probably gonna be around 100 fair trade take the stats you like  is Mitchell Robinson a Buy Low he's starting the season with minimal stocks please don't use the term stocks it's silly  is blocks come up but more than anything for Mitchell Robinson he's shooting 52% so yes he is a Bilo because that 52% shooting probably gets up to like 65 low 60s at the very least he's taking more free throws than he did last year which is bad for him so that number may also come down but everything else is basically where we needed to be so yes bye on Mitchell Robinson  and now because we just hit the one hour mark I'm going to see if I can find one or two questions that I like a lot and we'll we'll do that can Mi bridge is be top 50 um I don't think so but I do think he'll be nine cat 12 team play I just again I don't want to root for him so I'm not picking them up  let's see  what we got here do do do do do I know  someone said it's not cool liberally it's cool to Bali okay fair enough that's why I call him Bilal almost to the time you know what's funny is I actually Googled how to pronounce Kula Bali and the thing said cool Eboli  like Googled it  and it was wrong  son of a bee so what I get for watching a YouTube on how to pronounce a players named can't trust anybody these days  as a broadcaster that was actually really important to me I Google how to pronounce anytime I get to a name I don't know and I count on the universe helping me but the universe stunk so thanks Brooks um do you think the uptick now well yeah sure all right well let's do this one on bam out of Bio because we haven't talked that much about bam he's just so consistent question on whether is blocks uptick sticks he's at 1.4 blocks this year usually he's a little bit under one it could is the answer like sometimes guys just have an uptick some year and we can't really explain why if I had to guess I would say it probably Peter's out a tad but it's not a guarantee because he did have he had a season the covid season where he was at one point three so it's not completely insane to think that he could block 1.4 even if comes down in my only come down to like 1.21.3 so it could stick and right now he's scoring a crap ton  because his shots are higher than ever because the heat basically lost guys and didn't get anybody back also Jimmy Buffett's been taking fewer shots than usual so far this year he's been kind of deferring a tad so this this could just be a slightly better bam season where he's more like a 20s ranked player instead of 30s  enjoy it I don't think you need to like sell higher or anything there and sorry I know there's like 900 other questions but that's where I gotta pull the plug  an hour and four minutes is about what I can handle and we'll wrap things up thanks everybody for tuning in we got another show later today with the great Derek ball we'll be
