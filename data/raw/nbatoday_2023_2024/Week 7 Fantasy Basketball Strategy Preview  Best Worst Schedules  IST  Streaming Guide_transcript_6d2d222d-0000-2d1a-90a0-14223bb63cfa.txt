welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  so  this week's got a little bit of a different feel to it  it's effectively a five-day week and  really only three of them matter  so we got a little bit of a different plate this is like the top of weak compared to the normal entree welcome to  week seven weird week weird week seven we gotta I need some sort of alliterative name for it and for now we're going with weird week seven I am Dan bass and I am joined as always by the week analyzer the stream Master the great ball at D B all be ball on Twitter I'm at Dan Bass Pros Derek good day to you sir and all so welcome to the first ever in season tournament in the middle of an NBA fantasy season we yeah Dan and listeners it's really good to be with you again you know what I think you're on to something with the toughest tournament or you know what even wild week seven because I think just from a marketing perspective it sounds a lot better than in-season tournament we do really need a name for this yeah I've tried to roll with the whole NBA cup thing but yeah I mean I like we all know that the first thing that pops into any adults mind when you hear the word cup in relation to athletes is a jockstrap so we got to go another way I like wild 7 I like I like that you rolled it into Tapas tournament that was sweet I didn't intend for that when I called it topless but it is we're like getting a little entrees over the next well three of the next four days effectively and so let's just dive straight on in here first of all again you can find us on social I just gave those a minute ago it's fantasy NBA today this is our week ahead episode but this is gonna be this strangest and maybe the shortest one we've done because  Derek and I don't mean to steal your thunder here but there aren't that many days this week that matter  yeah absolutely I mean there's specifically there's three days that matter really only there's really only five games of actual basketball that's going to count for Fantasy purposes and I mean we've already dealt with a couple of six game weeks but this is even more restricted so I mean really your options are limited if you don't get bug eyes so what do you do then because my move was  because last weekend on Saturday and we talked about this last week we tried to kind of look ahead a little I did a bit of what we discussed on last week's weekly preview which was  I had a move or two across my various head-to-head leagues on Sunday yesterday  and I used them to grab guys that we knew were playing either today or tomorrow more specifically today though  so I feel like the best way for us to go through this as a post from me just saying like Derek tell us the whole week is for me to say  is there any  I mean is the very obvious answer to this question and I short which means you know we might get out of here in like three and a half minutes today it's dead at 25  ships yeah it's right is  try to stream somebody today that you think is not only interesting but also is on a team that could win and then if that doesn't pan out  rinse and repeat tomorrow yeah I mean I think generally you got it right I might kind of tweak it a little bit here just maximize the amount of games you can get since you don't really need to be conservative but your streams I am completely doing away with my two and three Rule and I'm actually not really that worried about picking the winner on Monday because I still have to dispense with the Tuesday games before I'm actually at a point where I could actually lose games on the schedule so what I might do is pick a Monday winner if they win that's great and if they play well in that game I might hold on to them but I'm gonna be looking at the Tuesday guys because there's just as many games on Tuesday just as many meaning to to meeting that there's a lot of value added streaming to be going on there I wouldn't be a posed to to flip in that Monday pick up win or lose for her Tuesday guy then the trade-off though would be that I want to pick the winner on Tuesday because I need that second game from that guy I don't want to take the chance are you streaming having one go back to the wire are you streaming one or two slots for this week I mean I think you only need to stream one spot this week it's certainly possible to stream too you're going to have a ton of options because there's no differentiators on the schedule but  you should be happy with your rosters if you're not I mean you're filling injuries that's where I'm that so that's where I'm getting stuck right now is if I'm streaming I think your answering the question that I asked originally as if you're streaming one which is like look there's only three days that we can even really bother to make moves this week obviously and then I've got four weekly moves so I might as well just basically use one a day hell you could use one today Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday if you wanted to try to wedge someone in on Wednesday I mean you probably have a full schedule but maybe you don't maybe you have a team that has is Laden with Celtics or Pacers or Lakers or any of these teams that are playing over the next two days maybe you aren't an overflow team on Wednesday you will be almost definitely on Friday but you could end up using a move one move every single day Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday what about if you're trying to stream too because you know you're a long streamer we still haven't gotten this word fully into the Lexicon but we're gonna get there  then it feels like there is an advantage to trying to find someone on a team that might win over the next two days right because then you can get them for both Monday slash Tuesday and Thursday on one move instead of two or three 100% yeah if you're a long streamer you definitely want to be picking out the winners there so the you know I'm not going to give you advice on which team is going to win every game but I think there's some pretty good indication if you look at the Vegas betting odds you probably want to be picking streamers from the teams that are leading the odds in Vegas right now because you want to make sure that you are actually able to be economical at those moves absolutely now the only thing that I would be concerned with in that scenario is that you as the manager that's making these moves you might end up prioritizing that winning Play Over the quality production there are some scenarios here we're just adding the player that you think is going to be on the winning team isn't necessarily the better move  having said that two games is very often better than one and almost any context when you're talking about streamer level players so managers are going to have to be really aware of you know what those averages are and if one game of a player doesn't look as good as two games then you have to be you know I mean it's a big jump yeah but I mean really I mean really if you got you know the top bench player maybe a Sixth Man of the Year candidate versus the 10th Man Off the Bench if that tenth man is still going to mathematically have more production over a two-game period versus the one you still have to go with them it might not as good in paper I mean you know it's probably not ideal to say that we'll say a Payton Pritchard might be a better stream than a TJ McConnell but you know the honest got truth is I think that pritchard's going to be on the team that wins yeah Gonna Make a Difference at the end of the day yeah with Tyrese Halliburton still dealing with this illness and again I said on my other show if these guys and it sounds like this is what's going through the teams is anything like the illness that I had for the entire month of November they tend to miss more than one game with it and everybody's like all their babies play through it but like it was I was coughing up some serious mess and you can't like I could barely function in my day today and I'm just broadcast the games you can't run up and down and guard NBA players and play this level of basketball if you are just stopping to cough every 25 seconds and if that's what these guys have they're in a real bad spot I mean we'll see obviously I think the Vegas line if we're talking about lines has the Celtics as something like five five and a half Point Road favorite which basically is screaming they don't think Halliburton is playing but obviously anything can happen in the next couple I guess it's like hour and a half or something like that so let's do let's do this now that we've kind of set things up as as where everybody's looking you do have your two things wanna give a shout out to number one the week ahead piece at sports ethos that's part of the fantasy pass if folks have the fantasy pass they need to be taking advantage of this using your article among the millions of other things you get with the upgraded premium but also as Dan also the producer flexes it up onto the screen  this is your thread to get folks ready for the week coming up it doesn't have the detail of the week ahead article but this is a good place to get folks started and what we did last year last week Derek was that you just kind of rolled through what folks should be looking for do you mind doing that again for us here since we have some time yeah absolutely ready to roll when you are so I mean Monday it's pretty obvious you already got it up on the screen you take the guys that are available that are that are going to be playing a game usually if you're talking about streaming you want to get that production in as soon as possible so that Monday production getting a streamer from a Boston Indian New Orleans or Sacramento is going to be very important to your chances if there's only four teams playing on a day then every single game you can add from Monday is going to be a different maker especially if you're in a head-to-head leak I already kind of touched on what I would be doing moving forward from Monday I'm not exactly trying to plan who wins on Monday because I know there's another set of equally valuable gains happening on the Tuesday where you're going to see the Lakers the Bucks the Nicks and the Suns all face off now from that point moving forward it is going to be a lot more important to know who wins and who loses because from there only the remaining teams in the NBA Cup being season tournament the top is tournament the week 7 tournament only the remaining teams  are going to have value added streaming opportunities from Tuesday those teams are going to qualify for the games on Thursday which will lead to the Saturday finals that don't count for Fantasy purposes but for all intents and purposes you want to have the guys playing on the lowest volume game days now anyone who's listening obviously has already noted that I've skipped over Wednesday and Friday the long story short with Wednesday and Friday is everyone else is playing if they're not in the tournament if they've been eliminated everyone else is playing so you're not really going to be looking to me for very valuable advice on these days because I'm the screening guy and you're probably not streaming on those days unless you are like me and one of my big money leaks right now with the roster that's kind of loaded with those those 18 teams that are in the finals you're probably not going to have a lot of a lot of room to to play with on Wednesday in specially Friday because the teams eliminated from our Monday Tuesday games are added on to the Friday schedule and we'll Face Off With Their fellow losers from their side of the bracket I'll come over it's just best player available on those two days how much of an edge do you think teams get by having but I just sort of looking into the teams that are in this tournament it feels like it's a it's  a it's a substantial Edge if you have I don't know you know 13 player roster 10 starting spots and you have like six guys just already playing today and tomorrow that's a that's a massive lift even if you're even if you're short one guy on Wednesday you could stream it in everybody else has got you know 11 12 they're wasting games on Wednesday they only have two three maybe four guys going the next two days I mean just a little Edge like that and I so irritated at the waist schedules work right now or like try to solve all the problems of head to head and this week I feel like this week just makes them so much worse am I right to be this frustrated I  I don't know man calm me down I guess is my my answer to that one you call me I mean the typical complain against head-to-head is that matchups are very often and balanced between games played I think this is one of the only weeks where you can kind of expect every team to be within let's say  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of beer Wine and Spirits

your armchair  download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's drizly.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  three or four games each other though three or four days on YouTube  now it would it would depend on what those teams are trying to win of course anyone who's heard me on any of these shows before is going to know that I'm gonna start talking about high impact stats and efficiency right now because those are the things that are more controllable even if you're at a deficit in games played so if you do look at this schedule and you do think that you're one of those teams that's going to have a deficit or have him for made your playing against a team that is stacked within season tournament Players then then yeah you probably are going to be targeting those high impact categories and trying to claw back away even if you're at a you know a statistical disadvantage in terms of counting stats points assists rebounds so I mean that's typically where I would look if I'm in that scenario I do all always tend to build my team so that they can be prepared for me to take that shift not everyone does build a team that way or just simply have that convenience of choice  but where possible I would advise people to do that if not and you are the sort of team that is both at A Game's play disadvantage and trying to win kind of let's say low impact categories or counting stats then yeah you're just going to want to try to add as many games as possible you are streaming as aggressively as possible you're not really looking into week 8 if you're trying to win this matchup you need to make those aggressive moves you need to make those tough choices on who to cut you need to lean on your sports ethos Pros with your roster and try to figure out exactly who we should be trimming from that team so that you can recover those games because if you are a squad that has historically one let's say two of three of those counting stats categories whether it's points in assists points and rebounds rebounds and assists whatever combination is you you're going to have to make sure that you are making a concerted effort to add Specialists and those areas because frankly you're probably gonna have some trouble finding the best possible producers on the waiver wire  this that I'm scrolling in the background for those that are watching this is Derek's thread we were talking about on Twitter slash X you can find Derek again over there at d-ball got a couple of questions actually that are related to the week ahead so I'm going to take this down and I'll pivot over to that one this is from midsole in a daily Roto league with no Ill Spot actually this one's not really a weekly question the next one was I got them flip flop but we'll answer both are you holding on to Jalen Johnson thinking of holding due to week seven being so weird my answer to this is I'm holding everywhere I possibly can because he was rolling top 50 before he got hurt and top 50 guys are dudes that I think you stash basically up to almost two months he's kind of the like going rate on those I'm assuming you're holding on him as well 100% I would kind of phase it a similar way I would say stash until it hurts you're going to have to probably you're gonna have to really feel that that spot being missing from your lineup before it's even worth looking at moving on from him at worst I would say float a minute trade but yeah you can't just give up on that court that kind of value because you know as soon as a player like that goes to the wire another team is gonna pick him up  this is the one that I meant to click on the first time around but I got there Roto lineups that lock for the week at 7 p.m. so it's weekly Roto would you start Patrick Williams  Casey P Eric Gordon or Russell Westbrook this week but at least we don't have to look up how many games they have ah  that's true yeah 100% a little bit less work so you know what that one's actually it's tougher one that I might have originally thought because my instinct is historically to be you know to say that you should go with Eric Gordon here I know that he's been dealing with some health issues he was day-to-day over the weekend so I'm gonna have to check his status to make sure before I commit to this but right now I'm looking at Eric Gordon or Patrick Williams Patrick Williams has been pretty bad to start the season I'll be completely honest with you I haven't hesitated to take shots at him where possible especially knowing that he's playing for a big raise coming up soon or at least he expects a big race up until very recently his play has not substantiated that but very recently his game has really really elevated and again knowing that I'm that high impact stats guy I love a player that can get me good production and steals blocks rebounds in threes Halliburton is in by the way just got that Albert is it in Great yeah  that's gonna soften my my recommendation for a TJ McConnell stream but let's just swap in Aaron Nesmith instead because he's been playing really well for them as well and with top and kind of potentially on the Shelf I think that's a good sub but I digress I think Patrick Williams is going to be my choice just because right now I know that he's healthy and I'm not quite clear on Gordon yet Casey's more of a streamer for me despite his overall good numbers for the season and Westbrook I just don't like the inefficiency know  Skeeter asks does Dan answer questions during this stream well so far he just did yeah that's right let's see best stashes for week seven for a points League I'm thinking Obi toppin Aaron Nesmith Obi by the way was also ruled in just a moment ago okay not sure if there are any any other great minute bumps with Tyler hero coming back did we get a hero is definitely back thing I thought it was just a he's hoping to be back this week I thought it was more just an optimism thing but like I said I missed some of the earlier or some of the more recent news so no nothing in the last couple minutes other than the Pacers stuff yeah I mean toppings the one that I I think it's I agree with David here in this question he's been getting more minutes Jalen Smith is out that's been part of the reason why he's also been very hot and we know Rick Carlo likes to roll hot hand out there I don't know what you could call a stash though for this week  maybe I missed interpreting the question are you interpreting in a different way than I am  no I think you I think you kind of got it there I think they're just kind of wondering maybe if there might be some players that are maybe in a Bi-Lo position that you could kind of hold on to with all things being equal wow that be the only other way I could interpret it maybe we can get them to answer us again in the chat yeah David if you're there you can maybe clear up some of our questions here's one from Earnest thoughts on stashing this week versus streaming like crazy this is a good forget the rest of this question sorry Ernest I'm actually wiping the other part of your question out because Ernest is saying he only has Zion of the teams playing in the quarterfinals and his opponent has Jalen Brunson Giannis out of Cooper LeBron and Brandon Ingram ouch dude four to one is a rough  is a rough disadvantage to be at their  I mean it's hard to like you're obviously gonna be behind when Wednesday comes around you could probably make the call well no it's too late because once you get to their you've missed two days of streaming  I guess the question is who oh here wait a minute I got more currently stashing scoot Anderson and Pat Williams I think I'm okay with streaming those spots but also maybe I'm not as excited about them like scoot me still feels like he's at least two months away from doing stuff and then Patrick Williams you need you almost definitely need Levine God and then you probably need either Caruso or Demar gone as well  I would say try to compete I mean if you've been stream two spots you can catch up to the other dude you could even pass him if he doesn't stream anybody  well I mean in that that means that we're also assuming that he's gonna have a full lineup on Wednesday I'm one of those teams that has a lot of players at least in a couple of my leeks good point that are active on Monday Tuesday and now I'm trying to figure out who I am gonna roster on those Wednesdays so yeah I mean it's entirely possible to win those matchups yeah you are going to be at a disadvantage but no I don't think you should ever just throw in the towel on any matchup especially if you're in a head-to-head League where every single category counts you can't be in a position where you're sacrificing any categories playoffs matter you're you're overall standing is matter and you got a cloth for everything you can get if you're going to lose you're going to lose but at least you're going to do it the right way there is a way to get valuable players that are going to serve you be on this week without completely throwing at the towel I like it let me see if anything else has a weekly bent to it here most of these seem to be more overall type questions so I'll perhaps all scoot through those rapid fire towards the end of the show  what do you do with I got one more question for you Derek this is from my own brains ease what do you do with oh wait we got clarification from David Lee oh it feels pretty good about winning this week so he's looking to maybe stash towards the future my only my feeling there is just Bulls basically I don't know that  I mean how many other guys are really floating like the only team where it feels like it's almost a guarantee that somebody steps into value is Chicago  is there someone else  no question mark feel free to step in and step on me here if there's a team I mean yeah I mean you're looking at Lottery teams now some of those Lottery teams it's less clear exactly where the advantage might be like I'm struggling to think about who might be someone to Stash from the Spurs but I'm thinking about the Hornets for example as another team where there might be some you know some potential boosts happening now that lamelo ball is out I think last time I checked Brandon Miller's roster rate was about 50% so he's available half of all League's and he's probably gonna end up being one of the better scores and they're rookie class so if you're looking for a points at 3 Street where I think you know there's some value there I'll be you've said the Bulls I love Kobe white I love Patrick Williams there's a lot of talent there so yeah absolutely you know players like that are available to stash and you're not concerned about winning go for it I was able to pick up Kelly oubre Jr on Saturday of this week and one of my League's I seen in some other league that you know for some reason is available I've heard lay that apparently Trey Trey Murphy is critically under rostered on ESPN thanks to my my Twitter slash X follower that pointed that out for me because that I just thought was absolutely insane so really I'd have to see the wire in your league but if they're in the starting lineup for any team then they should be on a standard league roster I think yeah for a short term period what are you doing about Christopher sinkus because now he's saying he's hopeful to be back at some point later this week but like if the if the Celtics this is a weekly decision I guess the Celtics have to win today for that to really be all that useful for somebody because like  you could bench him in a weekly league and you could still very easily fill out the other day this is a confusing one to me and then I guess Howard is sort of the flip side of that like is that a guy you started a weekly League I probably would because at least you know how far is getting this sort of game that's not on the overload day what do you do in a situation like that where you have like one player maybe coming back and how much it impacts the one that's filling in for him  you know if I'm being honest I'm actually not really that into percentage right now I saw the news about him coming out kind of live when it happened and I saw a couple of Boston beat writers that I followed just kind of going please don't do the stupid thing you know a lot of people that follow this team they're very aware that this team is in a really good position to win a championship this year and they need to sacrifice anything at the altar of winning the NBA Championship even if that means maybe losing some maybe decreasing their odds for the NBA cup they I think no matter what happened here's plays or not um I think Horford's in a really good position to be still soaking up a lot of minutes because even if porzingis does plays he's not playing at 100% so a reliable Veteran Center like Horford who is not worrying about back-to-backs or an overloaded schedule I think he's going to be a really reliable option whether ports Angus is there or not the truth is that if a player like porzingis who has top 25% potential is active he kind of just have to put him in your in your lineup yeah yeah if you're in a weekly you got different mess to deal with all right Derek I stretch this one out as long as I could but that's the week ahead man there's it's a it's effectively a four-day week for most folks because Friday everybody's play and except for two teams before actually because the ones up  it's a four or two it's two know  it's four  two teams got a limit there's 14 games on Fridays what you're trying to say yeah so Derek will do one next week and it'll be less weird yeah  yeah they don't all right I got for you follow Derek on Twitter I did all be balling great ass Twitter handle he's also in our Discord at the ball b ball which I will make sure to throw that link up on the board at some point in here DB we DBS we gotta

whole the whole meal is freaking awesome over there it's manscape.com promo code again is ethos 20 let's go through some of the tough weekly decisions this I try to Blitz through here  after Derek signs off for the show Tyreese Halliburton is in so that makes that one a whole hell of a lot easier Lowry marketing e we got ruled out on Saturday so we have no update on him for Wednesday he was ruled out a day in advance for the Saturday game so I didn't feel like he was all that close so I would be inclined to keep him on my bench interestingly here Anfernee Simons went through most of the Blazers practice on Monday I have no idea if that means he's gonna be going on Wednesday I would certainly are on the side of caution even though Jeremy Grant is out which means Simon comes back he's immediately stepping into 20 shots of ballgame but you just can't roll the dice like that especially on a week where every game is like five four or five percent of your weekly production that's way too much to leave on the table if you take a 0  lamelo balls out a while longer so you don't have to worry about that bam out of Bio was already ruled out for the heat Road game in Toronto on Wednesday  two days ago so that's I mean that's terrible diagnosis that means that the hip is actually really starting to work up on him a little bit so you got to keep on your bench this week again anytime there's a question mark somebody is on your bench  Kyrie Irving Tim Hardaway Jr were back at practice for the Mavericks so I assume that means Kyrie's good to go for Wednesday and Friday go ahead and get him in your lineup Anthony Edwards we don't really know he practiced a bit on Monday he's still considered day-to-day which makes him questionable for their games on Wednesday and probably Friday Anthony Edwards is a very tough dude um  questionable right now and practicing today with the game two days from now I'm inclined to say he's probably startable it feels like the game on Friday would be kind of a worst case scenario for him but you probably have to grade it out is about one and a half ball games and that's probably enough unless you have some magical option but again you're not you're not subbing in somebody who has four games for somebody who has one and a half you're still being in somebody who has two so they have to be sort of kind of almost decent for that to make any sense this week  Tyler hero was ruled out for at least one more no that's not true one was that report he could be back this week that's where we're at with Tyler hero again they play Wednesday Friday because the heater not in the in season tournament  I think you have to keep on your bench even if we end up getting that one wrong which would stink obviously you could show up and play two ball games but I have to believe they're all going to not go super heavy on him in his first game back  Chris Paul keep him on your bench again we're not going to get an update on him for a couple of days here Alex Caruso he left their last ball game it didn't come back you probably have to keep pin on your bench even if he ends up these guys could all end up starting on Wednesday but we just don't know same story for Zach LaVine you got to keep him on your bench because we just don't know  Eric Gordon missed the Suns game on Saturday with some nice soreness and they play tomorrow which makes me think he's probably not going to be a part of that he might I don't think there's enough reason to start him  most of the damage the Gordon's done this year has been with multiple Superstars out Jeremy Grant is in concussion protocol he is a bench guy this week do not start him because you might get a 0 and that's basically as far as you go with the kind of weekly question mark So since we just got a report that will be topping is in  Jamal Murray I guess would be one you probably want to leave on your bench it just feels like they're gonna have to Baby him a little bit and then nobody else I don't think is really all that close to coming back and if they are they weren't that good anyway because I'm already down into the 15th at this point and you're like if somebody in the 150s is not that close to going then you ain't gonna start them let's Blitz through some questions here we did a few of them let's see King says hey Dan what range which should we buy low on Keegan Murray well because his minutes have been sort of artificially deflated lately and he's shooting 38 and a half percent from the field he's ranked 104 I would happily give anybody up to about number 80 for him right now in terms of a buy so you can overpay a tiny bit because that field goal percentage is not gonna stay at 38 and a half I love the rebounds I love the steals I love the threes I like the fact these actually getting half a block this year I like the free-throw percent feel go present ten Trends up and everything's gonna float with it  so  I think you can do it for that  what do we do with us our Thompson in a points League I want to activate and I picked up Trey Murphy so spots are tight  you might be stuck parting with Trey Murphy who's going to be better in nine cat than he is in points League's  and I don't know how you move on from us our Thompson it was eventually gonna get playing time again but  yeah it's a tight spot if you drop us or someone's gonna pick him up  so Thompson I mean everybody's gonna be looking at him and if you drop Trey Murphy people are gonna pick him up I think boy on the only one that you absolutely positively must roster in points League out of the names that you just threw up on my board here um you might be stuck dropping either Murphy or Thompson  is Trey Murphy a pickup at a points League guys questions go back to back that's funny along with boy on Derek Lively and Andrew Wiggins  based on your wire I'm going to say no because if we can get his finger healthy he could be a points lie he's been a points League guy for a long time blowing McDonald's is definitely someone I'd rather have over Trey Murphy and then Derek Lively is a little bit less interesting in points league but he's also pretty decent basketball player too right now  is I'm here cuz Junior too good to be dropped in nine cat even though Tyler Heroes coming back soon know I think when hero comes back we're gonna see this sort of shift  Josh Richardson being out might give hot as a little bit of a window but he probably ends up being a drop after hero gets back in there but again we don't know if that's gonna happen Wednesday Friday next week it hasn't been settled yet  should I drop us our Thompson and stash Marcus Smart instead in a points League  I don't know that I would drop somebody whose  healthy for somebody who's not mmm nah  is Jalen Suggs a 10 team hold yes  coola believe is available on waivers how much would you spend none I don't actually think he's a must roster guy  he's shown me almost nothing to say that he is other than these rare games where he shoots like six for seven he just doesn't have much usage  who's the better pickup Ben Simmons and Anthony Simons Simons buy a lot and I want to be very clear since these dudes have extraordinarily similar last names I'm talking about the fellow with the first name and for me  I don't know that Ben Simmons plays again this year got it injection in his back they're gonna reevaluate him in two weeks my guess is they get to that re-evaluation it's like oh that's gonna be another two weeks it's gonna be this whole thing and on and on and on and on and on its punting more viable on 12 team or more I mean attend Team league and feels like there's an abundance of stats on the ways  yeah I mean you know it  it's easier to build well rounded team in attend Teamwork because you get more great players  ultimately you're probably gonna have to punch something because everybody's going to have a bunch of really good players I think you kind of have to punch  in most formats ability the shallower the league is so your question is accurate you don't it's not as necessary in a 10 team but I think ultimately you're probably gonna have to give up on something  but maybe it's easier to just pick say one category to be kind of not great at  Let's see we already answered a question about jacquez hey Dan do you think Duncan is still relevant for another game or two  I'm assuming that means Duncan Robinson I again I still haven't seen that Heroes definitely back on Wednesday I know he wants to be but we're not there yet so I'm gonna say yes on Duncan Robinson but  well no more on Wednesday  hi of mine question for weekly changes or likely so weekly league is the number of games still King I guess there's really no streaming in a weekly format the answer is sort of it's all a math game  you don't always start the four game guy over the three game guy you basically just do your home math what is the four game guy average multiply that by four and assume that his four game output is gonna be ballpark near what you get with that simple math same story for the three game guys so you know got a three game or who's like a top 60 versus a four gamer who's like top 90 you probably go with the four gamer in that spot but if it's like a three gamer who's number 25 and the four Gamers number nine you probably stick with the three gamer because you just adding it up it's just a summation you're just summing game Productions points leak should I stash Jalen Johnson um  yeah I think I would try to  what would a Derek Lively sell High be you're not gonna get that much form right now because some people are still not sold on him just enjoy it  should I trade away Jaylen Brown for Jaren Jackson in a points League uh nah I think I'd stick with Jalen Brown just safer in points like nine cat I might  but yeah you can get him for cheaper than that  should I trade my Freddy van Fleet for Deonte Murray I need a Steals and points boost sure why not that's relatively Fair  Marcus smarter Trey Murphy in a points League probably Marcus Smart  for the assistance steals  guess we'll see what that team looks like when John comes back with lean Marcus Smart  category League it might actually be Trey Murphy  I just traded Cade Chad and D-Low for Halliburton and Chris out for singing this  did I win or lose  well let's see chat  is probably your best yeah you won  you won that one  that's somebody says should I take JJ for Jalen Brown are you guys trading with each other already answered that one should I drop scoot Henderson to stream Obi toppin probably  Zach LaVine or Paulo bunk Carroll points League's its Paulo category leagues it's Levine  hey Dan a couple of rest of season questions Trey Murphy cam Johnson Keegan Murray out of those three let's see I'll go cam over Keegan over tray and then the second grouping Derek Lively on Yakko Congo Mitchell Robinson I'll go Mitchell Robinson over Lively over a Kong  unless something happens to click capella and then I reserve the right to go back and change that one around is an asterisk on that second question  and I just got a trade of my DeRozan and Kyle kuzma for Levine Garland and Keegan Murray  yeah I mean I shouldn't mind that at all Garland is a Bi-Lo Keegan's a Bilo Levine is a Bilo's is a sell high and DeRozan is just sort of is who he is I'm okay with that some of those baillos are going to pan out  what makes someone a dramatically better category player versus points League well points leaks typically now ESPN I know has instituted some sort of penalties for being inefficient but typically a lot of points don't care that much about field goal for free throw percent or turnovers so someone like a Kyle kuzma or Russell Westbrook these guys that stink at turnovers and percentages those guys have a lot of value in points leaks now kuzma this year has been good enough to have value in nine cat as well but nine cat players are often guys who can do stuff in the six categories that matter the most important points leaks but also tend to be a little more efficient not turning them all over all the time not missing a ton of shots not missing a ton of free throw free throws and that's what kind of separates the two  rest of season thoughts on Trey Murphy  I'm assume that's Jalen Johnson and Malcolm Brogden in a points League Jalen Johnson feels like the winner there Brogden in the short term is your winner there and then train Murphy is probably my lowest in a points League of those three and I need to drop one oh Mary you're at 7:00 biyombo or Golgi beta it's it's beyond Bowl I don't I don't like his Fantasy game to be begin with so you gave me an opportunity to drop him and I shall take it  40 minutes and out you guys have 50 minutes I think an hour to set your lineup so let's go make sure we got everybody where we want them make those dreaming decisions now again just like Derek was telling you earlier you can use some moves today and tomorrow if you want I do think there's value in trying to pick players on the teams that could win because if you do today you could choose a different slot on your roster to stream tomorrow you could actually get two even three streaming slots if you can choose right basically pick the winner is picked streaming level players on the winning teams and those guys will roll you right through Thursday now you might want to get rid of one of those dudes on Friday as well this is a point of reference because maybe you don't actually have a full roster if you have this many guys that are going today and tomorrow but if you can get a big games advantage today tomorrow that can carry you through the week because again just a five-day week and Friday everybody's playing so it's almost like a four-day week let's go get them Anthony Edwards really a pleasure to host you Minnesota Timberwolves Superstar Anthony Edwards Dilo has been on a hot streak what would they sell High win look like top 50 or 60 I don't think you're gonna get top 50 or 60 for Dilo he's around 60 right now in fact I think he's exactly 60 on basketball monster that's like the highest range you could probably get back unless you went for somebody who has a small name guy in there like a Max strus  but I don't know that that's the thing you should really be hunting for anyway  maybe look for someone who's ranked a little bit behind the Angelo Russell that you think moves up the board like maybe a DeMar DeRozan  Zach LaVine Nico vujevich these Bulls guys are all by Lowe's right now  might be at Target so would you drop DeAndre Hunter for PJ Washington yeah I got no problem with that and what about a trade Target for Anthony Davis meaning like what would it take to get him or what do you want to get back for him  because No One's Gonna trust him if you're trying to trade him away everybody else in your league likely was like nah I don't really want that because they were terrified of how many games he was gonna miss so you're not gonna get anything other than like a late first round or basically where he was drafted and even though he's outperforming that right now if you're trying to get Anthony Davis the team that has him probably isn't gonna trade him you should probably just assume Anthony Davis ain't getting traded in fantasy right now  Draymond Green or Austin Reeves ah go Austin Reeves  and I will also go out of here oh Twitter made a Boop in the background before I could get out thanks for watching our two shows today everybody I got to go rest my voice for a little bit because I've been yelling a bunch thanks to Derek at the ball b ball I'm at Dan best Bruce will see you guys over on social set those lineups and we'll see you tomorrow hopefully a two for Tuesday will see might have some by Lowe's to go over  so weird week though so not much in the way of recap anyway we'll figure it out see you later everybody
