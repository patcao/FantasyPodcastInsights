welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast by low time on fantasy NBA Today welcome to this jam-packed 25 ish minutes of fantasy basketball goodness I am your host Dan Bass Pros at Dan Bass Pros on social media this is a sports eat those presentation Sports ethos is the website I don't know why I only put half the name on the screen for you guys to see it's sports ethos.com or ethos fantasy BK for all your NBA news I want to take just a second before we dive into the by lows to quickly mention that there was some breaking news right before I came on air with this show and that is that lamelo Ball's ankle injury which we did guess on earlier show was much worse than they were letting on is indeed not good Shams tweeting just two minutes ago that it is a serious sprain in his right ankle and is expected to miss extended time yuck not a whole lot you can do about that if you've got lamelo ball you just have to hope that you can stash him for as long as you need to but we are right back into ankle stuff after pretty much missing all of last season that is brutal and we'll definitely have some thoughts on that over on social media again that's over at Dan best price I'll see you guys over there for more on the Hornets as far as this show goes we're gonna give you let me see here what do we got we got one two three brand new guys on the Bilal list one very important repeat by on the list  and two other quieter repeat guys on the list so all told it will be what did I say six names four of them that I want to highlight with a very large bright shimmering light and then to that will just touch on very close to the end with out further Ado your week six by Lowes here on fantasy NBA today in the first name on the board is none other than once again Sharon Jackson Jr he's been on the Bi-Lo board for a couple of weeks now and so far it has not yet cashed in which is fine because a lot of the other ones have Jared Allen his way up the board Brooke Lopez has vaulted himself to the almost very top of the board Freddie Van Vleet moved up already about five or so slots because we know he's been a guy that's just kind of inching his way up the list still by the way with more room to go on Van Vleet  but JJ's gone the wrong direction remember he was ranked in the late 60s early 70s when we first put him on the board and he's now in the 90s  that's not what we were trying to do but the reason is not the one you would have thought he still doing a lot frankly too much at times  but his field goal percent has tapered off it was already low two weeks ago and now it's gone lower  which makes this Buy Low and even easier call  it is  the reason that this particular Bilo is such a doable one is that people have now stopped believing  in what they saw from JJ over the bulk of his young career he's not an old guy yet guys Jerry Jackson Jr was born in 1999 he's only 24 right now make sure his birthday had already passed  its only drafted five years ago it was a kid when he came into the NBA so it's not like he's falling off a cliff his skills haven't just magically eroded  it is worth pointing out that he has had a season before where he shot 41% it was one the one it was the season where he was coming off of a massive injury  and I think you could pretty safely argue that some of the shooting stuff was related to just a general body slow down but you could also point to that season and say look even if his body was slowed down he was still blocking 2.3 shots a game that year  it only 27 minutes  this season he's averaging a career best in scoring and 19.4 points which is about a point better than last year despite shooting 9% worse overall five to six percent worse from 3-point land than last season which mine you was higher than usual but not by that much because career wise he's at 35  and the other stuff with him is about where you'd expect until you get to the defensive stats which are also painfully low  in fact in one of the most astounding twists Jaren Jackson Jr did not have a multi-block basket ball game until two days ago between November 3rd and November 26th  a span of nine games or he got either 0 or 1 block  were people panicking about JJJ after the first six games this year not really  because he blocked five three one two one and three shots in those games  those six ball games he had 15 blocks which is still not the three he had last year but it was two and a half basically yeah exactly two and a half  and since then over the now I guess it would be 10 games if we said it was nine before 10 games since then one two three four five six seven ten one block a game over his last 10 and prior to that it was 0.8 blocks over the previous nine  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game-winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with

locations  here's the thing guys he didn't just magically forget how to block shots  he did  and if you're looking back at last year and wondering is this the kind of thing that happened to him it didn't all of last year he didn't have a stretch where he wasn't blocking shots  so why should you believe that it's going to magically get better well because it's never been this bad he's never had a shot blocking  dry run dry spell like he has right now  so the blocks are gonna come back  the steals probably gonna come back it's not a guarantee the field goal percent likely Trends up when John Moran gets back in there and JJ can actually get a few open looks at the bucket which it's not really getting many of those right now  so then the question becomes all right Dan if you're saying this is a buy low how low are you buying well I still think maybe setting the target inside the top 20 is no longer a reasonable one considering he'll have to climb from 97 which is doable by the way because Brooke Lopez got there in a week and a half  let's say 35 or higher because right now if he gets even to that marker I think people are going to be pretty thrilled and the beauty part is and guys you can try to call me out on this but I ran polls on Twitter you can get him for a guy in the 50 to 60 range right now  because in the poll I ran on Twitter where I asked where do you guys think Jared Jackson Jr finishes this year and nine cat ranking the vast majority of folks said between 20 and 70  47% said 20 to 40 and another 35% said between 40 and 70 and 10 percent said outside the top 70 meaning 45% of respondents thought outside the top 40 meaning 45% of the time you might be able to make a trade to get JJJ for somebody outside the top 40  you should try to do that  I know it hasn't paid off yet  but at some point it will  next name on the Buy Low board is Jalen Brown and this one's a little bit of a cockeyed one because he's ranked basically the same as Jaren Jackson but they're getting there in pretty different ways Jalen Brown is two points higher in points per game they're actually right next to each other and overall rank  JJ's at 19 and a half Jaylyn Browns at 21 and a half points Jalen Brown has an extra three-pointer extra assist in a half extra half a steal one block less  both guys have had trouble with field goal percent Jaylen Browns had a very poor free throw percent  so what are we doing here  well  some of the issue with the Jaylen Brown Buy Low and I'll try to work through this as we talk is that  in all likelihood he's probably not going to have the same usage that he had last year because Marcus Smart is gone yes but Drew holiday and Kristoff we're seeing us are in  so they're just simply going to be more games where he doesn't need to take 20 and a half shots per ball game still that said two years ago he took 18 shots per game which is where you at right now shot 47 and a half percent this year is at 44 and a half percent that Yuri shot 76% of the free-throw line which is basically where he's been for three seasons in a row this year he's at 71 his rebounds are down from 7 to 5 and I don't know that I mean some of that maybe you could blame on line up adjustments but not really because Robert Williams is gone and he was one of the better rebounders yeah I guess I'll Horford's not great and of course I guess it's better than that but I would expect the rebounds to actually Trend up a little bit for Jalen Brown a sister fine turnovers are fine steals are fine blocks are fine so what you're looking at here is a guy whose 3% under his career Mark and field goal percent  I don't even want to use career Mark for free throw because generally it's been better the last three to four years as opposed to earlier and his NBA career so he's about five call it three to five percent two low in free throw percent compared to recent history  he's low on rebounds for reasons we can't fully explain and then all that other stuff Auto adjusting will fix the points as well  and if you like Dan is some of this because his shot profile is changed and the answer is not really only a little bit his three-part percent is actually 2% percentage points below his career Mark same as last year mind you so a lot of it is just that he's not in his two pointers right now he's not in his free throws right now  but in terms of a buy-low that does make things a little bit complicated because he's still scoring and in points leaks people are totally fine with it because you're over year there isn't that big of a change for him  so the question is what can he get to  I always felt like Jalen Brown was going to be a little bit overdrafted because he was a better points League player than a category League player and that also makes him kind of a tougher guy to buy low on last year he was number 46 he's probably not getting back that high because I don't think he's taking 20 shots of ballgame but I think you can safely say he gets back to around 60 at 18 and some odd shots per game  therefore if you can get him for someone really at all behind 60 you do it  for those of you watching live you saw I put 65 to 70 range on your screen  I think if you pulled that off that probably works maybe you start slightly lower in that group and work your way up the board Jeremy Grant's been very hot lately but he's gonna level off so our Thompson is someone you could potentially try to part with I don't know if that gets it done you may need a little bit more name power to get you there  does vouch get it done Maybe  these are names that I would consider throwing out there they might just quite not be there because of Jalen Brown's name power and how much he scores but it's worth a try  player number three on our Bi-Lo board this week is DeMar DeRozan and you guys are gonna yell at me about this one and I'm okay with that I'm totally fine being yelled at Demars number 64 in nine category leagues right now he's sitting on 21 and a half points per game a 3-point or three point two boards 4.5 assists 1.1 steals 0.9 blocks 44.8% from the field and 80.3% at the free throw line and there's a reason that I spent more time on that very final number  and it's because it'd be the worst free throw shooting season for tomorrow to Rose and since  2009  is that sinking in yet  2009  half the NBA was barely born back there  okay they were born but whatever you guys got my meeting we're talking about 14 years ago was the last time he shot lower than 81% at the free throw line and for the bulk of his career he's been between 82 and 88% career 84 he's at 80 and you're like damn that's only 4% yeah before a dude taking seven free throws a game which is the number he's been at for the better part of the last seven years  that's actually a really big deal  also notable his field goal percent is the lowest it's been since 2015  his shots aren't falling as free throw isn't falling  his rebounds are down for again just like Jalen Brown reasons that we can't fully enumerate because it's not like the Bulls of dramatically changed what they're doing his turnovers are better than in Seasons past so I guess you could say oh maybe that goes up and that counterbalances some of this other stuff  but for tomorrow the nice thing about it is at some point he's gonna go on a free throw shooting run we're not even really gonna notice it but as other guys taper off in fantasy value and he slowly inches forward it's gonna be like oh Demar got a little bit better in like three or four categories that alone would only move him into the 50s but as everybody else levels off slowly they fall behind and suddenly Demar is in the late 40s and everything seems normal but the nice part is most people think Demar is what he's doing right now  most people think that Damar is going to be between a 50 and 70 ranked player this year some people think he's actually gonna be outside the top 70  in the poll that I ran that got over 600 votes  58% of respondents thought he was going to be worse than 50 this year  and you can probably get him for 60  very few people think he's going to be inside the top 30 and I'm okay with that he probably doesn't get back all the way that high but there's a pretty clear and easy path for tomorrow to get inside the top 50 and you can probably get him for a player about a round round and a half deeper than that which I get it it's not a massive leap  but you could probably exchange him for someone who is similarly ranked  but doesn't seem as likely to go up Michael Porter Jr is an interesting one someone like a Derek white is an interesting one  yeah not gonna get him for Max Drew's as much as I love Max Drew see inking to get to Marta Rose and for him  you're probably not gonna get him for your own as Fallen shootis even though he's ranked ahead of him  probably not gonna get him for Tobias Harris but you could try  a lot of names jump out as possibilities here though here's one that's going to surprise the crap out of all of you Julius Randle a guy that I said to avoid like the plague on draft day but now you can get him on a discount the likes of which we would have never imagined  because he's gotten off to one of the worst shooting starts  in the history of mankind  Julius Randle is shooting under 40% game right now  on ultra high volume he's outside the top 200 largely because of that he's at 38.7% on 17 and a half shots per game yowza he's also shooting under 70% at the free throw line on six and a half attempts per game  and look I don't like Julius Randle as a fantasy player he's a points boards assists guy that really doesn't help you and other statistical categories but he is way too low right now  last year Randall had a  decent season he shot 46% from the field 76% at the free throw line and that got him around top 70 markers he's a 46% shooter from the field in his career  it's also worth noting he did that last year while taking eight plus three pointers a game  this season the three-point volume is down he's not making them but he's also not making any two pointers  he just can't hit anything  also free throw Marker way down  even 73% or better for the last five years and he's at 69 right now in fact one season in there he was at 81% from the line  I don't think any of us expect him to replicate that type of performance but getting back into the mid-40s from the field getting back into the low 70s even that at the free throw line making some of his three-pointers all of that actually pushes him where you kind of need him to be  admittedly there are problems with the Julius Randle by low because  some people are punting the things that he's bad at  but if you're in a league where the guy who drafted Julius Randle is  completely fed up with the fact that he's tanking all of the percentages you could probably get him on the pretty cheap  because again according to polls 45 to 46% of all managers think he finishes outside the top 80  you know they might be right by the way he might not get inside the top 80  but if you can get him for someone in the 90 to 100%  because that's not going to cost you very much the team that has him is likely trying to just abandon ship at this point and so maybe you've got someone like a John Collins in Utah who's not destroying your percentage is just very quietly plotting along and not ruining your basketball team doesn't cost you all that much to lose him  but if Randall hits he gives you boosts in categories that are at least from guys that you can get on the cheap or trade away a late rounder for those categories are hard to find  usually can't use a guy you drafted at 105 to go get you a whole bunch of points and assists but this is kind of a rare opportunity to do so  the problem of course is that we don't know what the percentages are going to turn around the best indicator we have is a couple Seasons back for Randall 2021 to 2022 season where he got off to a similarly unbelievably bad shooting start and then had a pretty good second half of the season it feels like forever ago I know and honestly every year feels like about 15 years right now but that season was the season that I accidentally drafted Julius Randle in one league and I just I couldn't handle it  and the first half of the year he shot 41% from the field and he was number 158  or he was at 40 and a half percent from the field I think before that oh that was the second sorry guys that was the second half of that season where things actually got a little bit better for him believe it or not the first half of that season I believe that he was even worse  I might be getting my years mixed up I'm fairly certain that there was a year in the last two or three or Randall was shooting like 39% for the first couple of months then he got high  the question was what I'm not remembering is exactly what had happened was it the last second half of the year was a little bit later than that  I don't recall in any event yeah he ended up staying outside the top 100 because he was basically a punt field goal Play That season but if he can turn this thing around and start to get the field goal percentage up then he becomes an interesting positive and one that again you can probably get for next to nothing and if you want to just stash them on your Roto bench I'm fine with that until he gets going and for head-to-head you know you have good weeks and you have bad weeks and he's not gonna lose you a category by himself in a given week so I think you roll with it and so again just to reiterate I can't stand Julius randle's Fantasy game but right now you can get him for an unbelievably affordable price 30 to 40 slots deeper I think than where he was drafted and that's probably worth exploring  all right so those are the four guys that I really wanted to highlight here are a couple of what I'm calling repeat offenders on the show guys that we had on last week  or basically nothing has changed oh those guys are OG and a nobby whose rank has remained almost exactly what it was you still sitting between 90 and 100 nothing shifted for him I still think that it's almost a given that his steals are going to Trend up and his free-throw percent is gonna come back and he'll work his way towards that 60 range and also Jalen Williams who is still out with his hip injury he's number 89 I don't think he's moved at all because of the the hip thing he's eighteen point eight Steals on the year that's a number that's obviously gonna get higher I believe he's back for the Thunder game which is that tonight or is that tomorrow  doesn't matter he's coming back we believe in their next ball game this is your opportunity to perhaps grab him if he can and I would strongly suggest doing so because a jump by 30 to 40 slots is not at completely out of the question and those are your buy Lowes  for this week  let me take a quick check of the chat room to see if anybody has an ease buy or sell related questions if you don't then we're probably going to call it a day and yep as per usual so uh sorry guys We're not gonna do standard questions on these Bilo and sell High shows if anybody has like a player that popped up that maybe I forgot that's the type of thing that I might throw in there we had a number of questions earlier today on Jared Jackson Jr and what he would potentially cost you to trade for him I'm hoping that the poll I ran on Twitter which you know and I can probably throw that up on the screen here  we go let's get that up on the board just for the last couple seconds of today's show this is the JJJ poll I ran earlier today you can see it on your board top 20 was about 8% 20 to 40 is 47% 40 to 70 it's 36% and 70 plus higher than 70 is about 10% as well so that is your JJJ results with about 900 votes in  yea votes are continued to trickle so that'll change a little bit but again if you're thinking you know what am I gonna have to give up to get Jared Jackson there's a lot of leagues right now where managers are getting beyond frustrated with every bad game that piles up and every single time it happens you can get him a little bit cheaper so you know try that 50 to 60 range yeah hell if you want to try 60s and see if it works have at it and then you could even maybe work your way back up the board just a little bit but either way really good opportunity right now to get your hands on JJJ and that hopefully answers the questions from earlier today as well this is your Bi-Lo episode for
