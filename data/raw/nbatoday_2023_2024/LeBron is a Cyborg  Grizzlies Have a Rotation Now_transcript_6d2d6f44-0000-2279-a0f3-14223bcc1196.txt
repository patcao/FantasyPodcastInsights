welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast good day everyone just getting rolling here I know  shake off the cobwebs today I feel sleepy  but you guys feel sleepy too you know who's not sleepy  actually he's probably sleepy today and that's LeBron James my God  my God how is this possible  someone please inform me  it's crazy man we're gonna talk a lot about that ball game  because damn it was just fun  it was just fun it didn't have a whole lot going on in the fantasy side but I don't care it was fun that's the important part  oh  I guess not if you're a Clippers fan wasn't all that fun meltdown city as a basket ball someone who just wanted to watch basketball yesterday that was crazy just seeing with LeBron is still able to do is absolutely nuts  I I switched something up today for whatever it's worth and I did not go live on Twitter and  I kind of want to just see how that's different so the thing is and you know my goal here is not to badmouth Twitter in any way but ultimately that's probably what's gonna happen is besides the fact you can actually find me over there at Dan bachelors and we do a lot of stuff on it  one of the issues is you know  with YouTube we can build subscribers by having the show going live or after the fact or whatever it happens to be I'm not it's really not clear that having the show on Twitter does anything besides like a few people see it as it's flashing by and then it disappears so it feels  kind of like there isn't a huge purpose in it  and maybe I'm wrong like you know it's a good way to have  viewers quickly on a show because it's just out there whereas like with YouTube it takes five ten minutes for people to sort of realize that it's happening and then they join in and blah blah but  just the upside of you know the after the fact podcast is great because that's how we generate ad revenue and then YouTube is fun because there's a little bit of bad stuff but it's mostly just about kind of growing the YouTube page and I just don't understand why I have it on Twitter all the time I don't know that that's we'll see we'll see  from your enjoyment standpoint basically all this means is that if you had caught any of them live on Twitter that might be going away just be aware so then you definitely have to like And subscribe on whatever other format is the easiest for you to take it in whether it's YouTube with the video element whether it's over on Spotify or iTunes or something like that someone was telling me that we should try to simulcast this on Twitch I don't actually know how to do that but it's something that I can look into so crowdsourcing this one here at the front end of the show I don't know if any of you guys use twitch or understand it but is that something that I should be looking into  because I think it's as easy as just like clicking one button and streamyard I just I don't even know what my twitch do I have a twitch log in  we'll find out won't we I am Dan bass boost this is fantasy NBA Today welcome to your Thursday Edition will be mostly recapping the Wednesday smedium card it was a six games yesterday something like that they were fun ones though specifically the Grizzlies right in the middle of the card and we'll work our way up to that don't worry we'll get there in a few minutes we'll we'll push our way through tomorrow I would argue is maybe the well I don't I still have to figure out how I want to format this well have our weekend review show tomorrow which I know everybody enjoys that one we'll probably do a separate show tomorrow on playoffs in streaming and my hope is that I can do just like a 15-minute quick hitter every day  on head to head strategy and streaming every day from now basically until  I mean I ended the season it's not gonna be on weekends all the time but anytime we can get that done even on a weekend I'll try to squeeze one in there and then I would just sort of need you guys to watch him and like him and subscribe and all that stuff and then that would sort of power the locomotive to keep it going  New Orleans lost at Indiana I was finally it took me forever for whatever reason to find the beginning of the year season win totals numbers uh those of you that had started listening to this podcast in the middle of the Season you probably haven't heard my rant yet my hard drive died just like on a moment nothing weird happened just one moment I was using it in the next moment it was fully dead in the middle of July I had already written up my season win totals preview piece which had a breakdown of all 30 teams and it had a few of my top plays on the board and it died before I could load it onto our website and I hadn't loaded it onto our website yet because I was waiting on a trade to go down so a few things that were sort of influx I thought all right it's fine I'll just wait for this news to break I'll make my little tweaks and then we'll post this on Sports ethos and then Cuba down it went so I didn't have that meaning I I'd sort of lost to the ages what the beginning of the year season went totals were numbers four  the teams where I didn't have live betting tickets because now that most of the websites have sort of an updated you can bet on the Fly season win total that's insane to bet it right now but some people do and any way that a book can try to take a couple of dollars they're gonna do it and I was relieved to find out that if you have the ones that I was kind of worried that I had gotten way off base on were we're not all that crazy like the Pacers over 39 and a half that was the biggest one of all the sort of recommendations of the year and as they've been kind of up and down a bit lately I thought oh God is this gonna turn into a into a turn but there are 34 right now after yesterday's win they got to get six wins over their final 22 ball games I feel all right about that  come on Indy make me look smart  as far as this particular ball game goes Indy did make me look smart New Orleans got all their guys back CJ McCollum was back bringing Ingram was back  when someone else for no zyde was questionable but he played and they lost anyway  mostly because India is so freaking fast that the pelly's had to go to kind of a different look and then they couldn't guard anybody  not to take anything away from herb Jones who is an outstanding defensive player but if New Orleans goes small it kind of takes away a lot of what they can do which is having either a big man that can dominate near the rim like Yoda and junious or a big man that can switch everything and be that sort of defensive presence in Larry Nance and he said they went to Zion at Center for long stretches in this ball game a lot of Nance there as well but a lot of its Center and Indie just cooked them just cooked them Pacers got 102 shots up they out rebounded them by 10  only at eight turnovers so like the pal just couldn't really Force any misses on defense  anyway fantasy standpoint the news here Jonas Valanciunas played seven minutes he just got run right off the floor in this ball game but don't expect that to continue this is if your league still has a trade deadline this is very much a buy opportunity on JV should you feel so inclined I actually sort of accidentally did that  yesterday or the day before someone proposed to me in one League at trade where I give away Klay Thompson and I got JV  it's pretty fair deal but I needed the big man in that format so that one actually worked out for me okay herb you're playing CJ Brandon Zion obviously you're playing those guys train Murphy's sort of the question mark he got a lot of extra minutes because the Pelicans went smaller in this ball game 11 points seven assists on usual little tweak there a steal couple three-pointers  look I mean you know the deal with Trey if he's gonna get up around 30 minutes he's very much a fantasy play  but with all of the main guys back I don't think this is a number that sticks and he probably drops back into the mid-20s and in the mid-20s he was more like a 100 to 150 range fantasy guy which is fine but generally you know if you're playing against the games cap probably not quite good enough um  and I mean you could it's sort of that doesn't matter group we've talked about  guys like back streus  Gary Trent Jr  Hunter to 150 is I think basically a group I'm just gonna call that doesn't matter guys  the guys that are just reliably in that zone at the end of every two weeks  and Trey Murphy's basically those guys  when this team is healthy if any single person is out  Trey moves above that line  but if they're all there we've seen enough of it I think this year to finally say definitively that's where he lands  do with that as you so choose as far as the Pacers side goes you guys kind of know where I said on most of these guys Aaron Smith by the way was a game time call he ended up sitting this ball game out but my guess would be that he's back for the next one that's in San Antonio on Sunday should be a nice high scoring game he's missing get his legs back underneath him on Sunday that's gonna render bennedict mathurin fairly useless again you guys remember what he was doing when he Smith was healthy and the answer was not much  and that's kind of the only thing that's that's sitting in flux with this team Myles Turner had some foul issues but you know by and large he's been sort of a disappointment but overall kind of fine you guys know I'm not into and now hard is it Nine Cats a little he did have a nice ball game here not interested in oh we topping all those he also had a nice ball game here we move along  Dallas was down one Center which is really all I can ask in life  is for Dallas to be down one Center is that so much to want  in this simple existence no Maxi kleeba for this ball game so not surprisingly Derek Lively and Daniel Gafford split the center minutes right down the pipe  a perfect break okay not perfect Gafford 24 and a half minutes Lively 23 and a half minutes that's pretty damn close though  Lively had seven defensive stats so awesome performance in 24 minutes there Gafford had a more mild 24 minute performance is for turnovers kind of artificially sagging what was otherwise a pretty decent pretty decent is probably the best way to describe this Fantasy game  and that's like  it's hard for me to say you got a hold on all these guys when we know that if Lee plays then they all split up the minutes and it gets ugly in a hurry but look at how interesting it is for both of them when clebud doesn't play  honestly friends I'm a little bit I'm a little bit lost I don't say lost but like I don't know that there's a right answer here if you can hold on to Gafford I would try to do it same general story for lively if you can I would try to gaffer obviously has the higher sort of permit it upside between the two guys in general I know Lively in this ball game had the better permanent upside but when all three centers are healthy it doesn't really look like anybody has the leg up on a given night  it's mix-and-match time and actually chleba had the most minutes of them in the two games before he missed this one  so try to hang on if you can Gafford would be my favorite Lively would be number two and then Cleo would be number three on that list PJ Washington had a good shooting game we know enough about his fantasy stuff to know that he will settle back outside the everyday playable Mark I am trying to as you've heard many times I've said this season I'm trying to be kinder  Kinder Soul towards those who want to just stream a guy who's warm  that's kind of what PJ Washington could be now if you just gets warm and you want to play him  be my guest  I am personally not  playing PJ Washington even when he gets a little bit warm I just I don't care but I get it if you really insist on doing it yourself I'm not gonna yell at you Josh Green cooled off no surprises there  uh Toronto so you know I have this I'm in a funny spot with Toronto right now I'm in a funny spot because I like yakka portal I was pretty high on him during draft season you guys know that I had him I remember he was on the old man squad or he was just a guy that I thought oh this is an interesting value I can go look that up at some point and by and large he's had a sort of fine season not special he's number 81 which I think is pretty damn close to where you was being drafted and so I don't mind when yaakov has a good ball game which he did here 16 and 6 for steals two blocks great game for turtle  but you guys also know that I really want to see Kelly Olynyk get 22 minutes or more and it just ain't happening well turtle is upright  Hertel power jakub went down in the previous game with ankle tweak he played through it here  and if you're thinking about shut down which I did a show on possible shutdowns I think eventually you probably see Turtle pull the plug on the season but we're still many weeks away from that you know we're talking about probably the last two-ish which most deadhead Seasons should be over by then  should be you know if you're in a Yahoo public you're not so you get screwed a bit with Silly Season crap but  yeah those are horrible I don't know how you could do a Yahoo head-to-head publicly going to the end of the season absolutely atrocious  it ain't even Raptors only four and a half games back of the Hawks so not mathematically eliminated and won't be for quite some time so you're gonna get basically you know if guys are healthy for the wraps they're gonna play  because they're still kind of having fun and they lost this ball game but they feel like they could do anything they could make a run you never know it's not gonna happen but they feel like it  and so you get stuck with me sitting dreaming whistling of Kelly Olynyk getting starter's minutes I also saw a report yesterday that it's like the Raptors and olenek are approaching and extension we'll see if that comes down the pike could be interesting if you're thinking about like would they ever bump him up to more prominent role they gave Pirtle a new contract this season but is that someone that they want to build a round or is that someone that ends up becoming a trade ship things that's kind of think about for the future but not really for this moment also Gary Trent Jr  very much a member of the doesn't matter Club  Chicago Cleveland bulls have had to play a lot of minutes of basketball lately I'm surprised nobody on that team got hurt in this one you know Caruso went down in the last ball game tried to play through it and you know took a day off and probably a wise decision because this one required Kobe white to play 50 minutes  yeah double OT let's start with the Cleveland side you're always gonna get sort of weirdly large lines and double overtime games Carousel Levert had 14 points and 15 assists  he's a points League kind of guy but I'm not touching him at 9 cat we know enough about what goes on with Levert to know that I mean this will be the best game he has very much between yesterday and the end of the season and I don't feel  the slightest bit of remorse saying that out loud Darius Garland was a little bit better with shot the ball poorly and Donovan Mitchell was off  at 5 fouls all so he only got to play sorry no yeah 5000 he did get up to 44 minutes it didn't really impact things but he just he didn't have the shot going turnovers were high just a sort of a weird off night for Donovan Mitchell but you know who cares he's number seven and nine cat and at this point in the year there's very little he can do to kind of move off of that mid first round you need to be very bad the rest of the way Chicago side was a little more interesting uh but not as interesting as it might look so obviously the big story here Andre Drummond started played 36 minutes and had a ridiculous 1726 performance which I mean look if you're going to give that dude starters minute he's gonna post insane rebounding numbers that's just the Andre Drummond way he's one of the best rebounders we've seen frankly an NBA history but very much one of the best over the last couple of decades  but I'm here to tell you why and this is you know Captain buzzkill  first of all we were on this one from weeks ago  I don't know if you guys remember talking well we talked about it on yesterday's podcast all so but remember we talked about looking at the Bulls schedule and saying okay well if you want to grade out where you're going to get the Andre Drummond game's just look for way they played the Cavs  which one was on Valentine's Day and we were like oh they got another one coming up in a couple of weeks look where they play the Wolves that's another team that kind of runs two Center lineups and then if any other team pops up along the way that tends to play large you might see them run big against that club as well I'm not sure who that would be there aren't many other teams if any frankly in the NBA that go that gigantic like maybe if they could have sort of gotten away with it against the Knicks when they were playing a hartenstein Randall front court but yeah I don't know that the Bulls play any teams the rest of the way besides the Knicks who they play three times in the final two weeks of the Season where  they can look at anything like yeah we can stick vouch on your power forward  oh they do have the Timberwolves on March 31st so if you're looking for the next time that Drummond's almost definitely gonna get something to do it would be March 31st now let me add a brief caveat there he was going to get minutes today regardless yet today this ball game yesterday regardless of the opponent because Alex Caruso was down  so two things actually worked  sharply in Drummond's favor for this ball game yesterday one it was all righty a team that Chicago was going to go to the goal line package and two  they don't really trust any of their reserves on this team  like legitimately don't trust them at all so it was gonna be Drummond because of Caruso and we saw that in the last ball game Chicago's on a back-to-back here the previous ball game Caruso was in and out and in and out it kind of deal it was trying to figure out if he could play through the hamstring thing Drummond picked up those minutes  so even if it wasn't the Cavs Drummond was gonna get to play more the fact that it was the Cavs meant he got even more and it was just like a better matchup for him  now the most play the Bucs tomorrow by the way happy leap day everyone the Bulls played the Box tomorrow on March 1st  as we turn the calendar over to the penultimate month of the NBA campaign the Bucks are pretty big  Brook Lopez at Center Giannis at Power for me what chance does vu have a Sting with Janis thing is if Caruso's not there they might not have a choice they might just have to go to the big package again  so if you picked up Drummond does stream him for this ball game against the Cavs like we talked about a few weeks ago hold on for one more day  hold on to Drummond for one more day because if Caruso is out again drum and probably gets another start  but I will also add that once Caruso's back you're probably not getting another drum and start and based on the schedule we just looked at I guess I don't know for sure like maybe they go big against  look at these teams nobody's big out there none of them they play Clippers  that's one Center  Warriors they're small very small Mavericks pretty small  Pacers small Wizards small  Blazers microscopic  Rockets where I mean basically I'm just looking to see if any of these teams has a power forward that's kind of a lumbering ox and the answer is  no  not until you get to the Wolves of March 31st I so again Drummond right now is in my eyes is tied to Caruso until you get to basically 30 one days from now and then you'll get a drum and game regardless  speaking of the very large Timberwolves just quickly on the Wolves side nasri to stream while Kyle Anderson is out I know he's still coming off the bench but they had to redistribute slow Mohs mid-20s and minutes and if Nas even gets like four or five of those that's enough to push him up and over the play line which he did all so no not worried about my Conley Monte Morris has been playing sort of fine in that like boat captain role and so they're just giving Conley a little more free time to roam to rest they want to make sure the old guys fresh so don't worry about that keep playing him it'll be fine the bigger story in this one from the streaming standpoint is make sure you've got NOS Reid because again you might get another good one out of him if Kyle Anderson is out  what about the Memphis side is the Memphis side is  like a lot of interesting  but we don't know if anything we're seeing with the Grizzlies from yesterday is repeatable  so the thing that jumped out to me is that five Grizzlies played over 30 minutes in this game and yes the fact that the game was competitive probably helped in that regard  and yes the fact that you know conchar was still out and Kennard was out like all these things yes they slide minutes to other players and so it's likely to get more complicated if I had to put an ODS on it  that this type of normal person minute distribution happens again I would say the odds are so much low  but it is interesting to note  that when a couple guys were out and the game was competitive  you got starter's minutes from Santi aldama you got starter's minutes from Jordan Goodwin you got starters from Zion Williams and then obviously Vince Williams and Jaren Jackson Jr those guys have been getting starters minutes kind of regardless but the two forgets Ayer Williams for a second because fantasy wise I don't I don't think that the profile is there the two that continued to Intrigue me are aldama and Goodwin  I've mentioned Lamar Stevens but I don't think it's minutes are going to be consistent enough and we saw yesterday only played nine and a half  Jordan Goodwin filling in as sort of the point guard here only had five points but eight boards 8 assists two Steals and a three-pointer  and we've seen over the last couple of Seasons that when he gets full  point guardi run Jordan Goodwin can actually put up some pretty good fantasy lines  they're not gonna break the bank or anything but sort of better than friends when he gets opportunity now he's not like that amazing of a basketball player and that's why the opportunity has been  a bit few and far between  and he hadn't played a game since February 15th it was on a 10 day and then they converted him to a two-way and so that's stuff is always going to creep into the mix but basically you can play the game log game with Goodwin he's a great up he's a great player to play the game log game with how many times this year is he played starters minutes I think the answer is like four or five and I would say 80% of the time in those he's put up better than serviceable fantasy lines  most of them are with Phoenix way back in the second game of the year he played 30 minutes I think they were down I know they were down Beale where they don't Booker in that game too maybe he paid 14 six and two with a couple of steals in three pointer cool November 12th I don't know who was healthy and not for Phoenix and that ball game but he played 29 minutes he had 11 5 and 3 with a steel block and three three-pointers great  November 26th 29 minutes 14 7 and 5 a steal a block in two three-pointers love it  December 12th 2940 16 5 and 62 steals a block at three and five for five at the free throw line on top of the other stuff so you guys get the gist here and then the last two games he's been involved in he's played starters minutes he had 11 7 and 3 with two Steals and a three and one and then the one we just talked about five eight and eight with two steals in a three-pointer despite shooting just one of eight from the field and you can do this game with Goodwin from last year the year before whatever basically anytime he gets 27 28 29 minutes or more he's posting nice rebound nicest nice steel numbers  and he's done it in a way that we sort of been able to watch it and say okay this is a consistent thing 24 minutes is not enough 25 minutes is not enough 26 minutes is borderline 27 you're basically there and 28 minutes you're gold anything over that you just sort of crawl your way up the board but like you can look at last year and a few games in the middle of the Season where he played 33/38 and 36 minutes any posted nice numbers  insane steals numbers in those games by the way at 13 steals over at three games span and then he just goes back to not playing it all but this Grizzlies team they got nothing to lose like maybe this is a guy they feel they can use as a backup point guard for following Seasons or something to that effect  don't expect colossal scoring numbers but again he's in a good situation here because there really isn't anybody other than Jaren Jackson that the team has to defer to on a night tonight basis  and I said it in my tweetstorm last night that I was basically gonna look around and see how many places I could pick up Jordan Goodwin and the answer is almost everywhere he's only 2% roster for good reason because due to his contract situation there's no telling whether he's actually gonna play in any given ball game  the guys have and I forget the exact number guys have like a month or two of actual playing eligibility when they signed those two-way deals so I think the Grizzlies could pretty much use him in their games the rest of the way with some sort of Slash days for practice or something like that  so on the Roto side I feel like there's almost no downside to picking up Jordan Goodwin because again in starters minutes he's 100% a play like top 80 range kind of guy head-to-head I get it you want to be a little bit more cautious here because you don't want to use a roster move on a guy who then just sits out the next two ball games that would be a huge disaster for your head-to-head Club I get it so if you want to hold off on the head head side that's fine Roto I think you go get him  there's some built-in upside there and  you know again do certain guys have to be out we'll figure that out as we go it's not all that clear is this a situation where now because they signed him to the two-way he's playing or did he get to play because conchar and Kennard were out  I think it's worth putting him at the end of your roster and seeing if we can figure out sort of the tempo for Goodwin going forward  Sacramento Denver this game was over early you can toss the Box the fact that Chris Duarte had maybe the best line of the night for the king's tells you all you need to know about that how that ball game went Kevin heard was a disaster hang on for one more games even get those minutes back up near 30 Malik monk as I keep saying safer and had the Roto Keegan Murray was kind of the only regular King to be okay in this one Darren fox sat it out and when he sits they suck Denver just toyed with them  when Joe gets doesn't have to shoot at all that's when you know Denver's just kind of playing around this is a play around game this shot 54% this game was over early keep on keepin' on and then the craziest game of the night one of the crazier games of the Season frankly the Lakers erasing a 21 point  fourth quarter  deficit  to beat the Clippers 116 112  and it was LeBron  and he got a little bit of help in the fourth quarter make no mistake he went on he was sort of the surge guy in that LeBron hit some three-pointers Lakers were down  I think it was 18 or so I was 18 and LeBron like three threes in a row to cut it to nine I can't remember the exact present progression of the whole thing but he had 15 points going into the fourth quarter and he finished with 34 so yeah pretty good pretty big quarter believe the outscored the Clippers in the frame without looking it up and then another guy's got involved ads had some offensive rebounds off LeBron misses dealer hit this ridiculous it was sort of Nick bottom like where it wasn't a caching shoot three it was the ball that like LeBron put right into his shooting hand on the left side and he just flicked it forward and as a 3/0 and really had some big shots and all that I mean it was it was a wild wild situation but from a fantasy standpoint and this is sort of the downer of it all we didn't change anything camera reddish came back and made it to the max Christy only played five seconds in yesterday's ballgame and  you know I sort of get it but at the same time I'm not sure why Christy doesn't get a minute or two over someone like a Tory and Prince  the Lakers need consistent help rebounding and they finally did a better job of it late in yesterday's ballgame the Clippers missed everything and Lakers made everything so that sort of tip the rebounding scales  but Tori and Prince is  well I guess he only played 17 minutes all so um  really hot tomorrow doesn't have a robust in a fantasy game to get him onto rosters so you know for the Lakers is LeBron ad revenues Russell  Lakers are on a back-to-back now so  the thing to keep in touch in sort of in touch with on the Lakers side is our other guy's gonna play and it's against the Wizards so you know they're gonna try to find a way to rest someone and that someone is probably gonna be LeBron if anybody now maybe he tries to play because like this is the kind of game where the Lakers 100% absolutely positively cannot blow it this is supposed to be your freebie in what's otherwise a ridiculous Gauntlet of opponents here end of February beginning of March like the Lakers played Suns Clippers then the Wizards then nuggets Thunder King's bucks wolves Kings again Warrior's before they finally get to the the Hawks zombie Sixers and then the Pacers are also pretty good but this is this is a brutal stretch for the Lakers before things kind of lightening up from about like you know mid late March to the end of the year  so they can't afford to screw this game up so you might see LeBron try to play Maybe kind of go light on the minutes I wouldn't rule him out yet cam reddish they don't expect him to go on the back to back yet so I not that that changes all that much mostly what you're looking at is if LeBron sits hachimura is the guy that takes the jump from not playable to playable and then the other main guys Davis Reeves Russell they just sort of push farther into the awesome category and as far as the Clippers go they were out without even Bots and without Paul George for this ball game and it's still looked like they were gonna run away with it because the center position was sort of a placeholder and then that switched late so you're not picking up Daniel Tyson I don't care that he played 31 minutes here just absolutely no reason for that to happen  uh you're not picking up for us to Westbrook you don't have to worry about that Norman Powell is the guy you're sort of often looking at as that fill in role they went bigger here and started a mere coffee but you're not adding him either so basically Kauai James Harden and then zubats and obviously Paul George when they're in there but I don't worry too much about the filling stuff and I know what you're thinking Dan what about a thought on Terrence Mann and my thought on Terence man is  he does this you know twice a year every year where he goes on these like one or two weeks little mini surges and then it vanishes again and we don't hear from him for like two months so don't read too much into that and that that is your recap on yesterday's card we can move on from that and we can try to keep this show someone on the brief side I don't know if there was any difference here doing this live or not live on Twitter but what I will say on the way out is once again please take a moment to like rate subscribe all that stuff obviously does impact I guess the live
