welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast apologies everyone I'm running about 15 minutes late today I accidentally deleted a graphic  and I was trying to just hide it and so then I needed 20 minutes to remake the graphic  and here we are a little bit late but no worse for the wear it's fantasy NBA today it's your Thursday morning show  where two weeks from the start of the baseball season  I don't know matters for  any of you guys playing fantasy basketball but I'm guessing some of you out there are also playing Fantasy Baseball hey baba boo boo boo boo so you can go get our  Fantasy Baseball draft guide that's available at sports ethos.com including this insane insane live draft tracker tool again that's it Sports ethos.com get the MLB pass or get the all-sport passed so you get basketball in it and football as well I am at Danbury so over on Twitter hope you guys can come find me over there I'd love to see you it's at d a n b e s b r i s and please take a moment to like rate and subscribe as we dive in on the news du jour  news of the morning or Sean Holmes is already out  so that's a thing which by the way I mean it's annoying because he was looked like he might actually get a week or two of legitimate fantasy value  the  this is more relevant for our afternoon shows this week where we talk about streaming in excruciatingly painful detail and we'll do that again this afternoon well after show probably around two-ish Pacific time if I had to guess about four hours from right now so make sure to subscribe so you get that that'll be the weather we focus on the head-to-head stuff these shows where we do the recap where we kind of get everything sized up for Fantasy purposes  this is not about scheduling quirks  okay if you guys like oh but this guy is a terrible schedule not what I'm curious about this morning  okay this show is about isolating the guys that can impact your fantasy team and then you can take that and look at schedules if you like or don't I don't care do it either way  let's start looking at yesterday's card or a lot of games to break down so let's just get chugging I'm gonna try to keep these shows closer to a half an hour going forward because I don't I think with the afternoon show unless there's like something really big that's going on that we need to take a an extra six seven minutes on  I think we should be able to move through these games at you know two to three minutes per ball game but let's see how it goes  Brooklyn at Orlando Mikhail Bridges did not hit a shot until very late in the game he was extremely lucky to get up to 17 points but you know I'm the big thing here for Brooklyn is that cam Johnson came back and immediately played 29 minutes  cam Thomas did have some fouls but it didn't matter he still played a team I 39 minutes in the ball game  so that didn't have any impact on cam Johnson  and  Dorian Finney Smith it's trended down to 25  now the Nets were bad in this game until pretty late I mean they had a nice little late sort of almost borderline garbage time push  so I don't want to put too much stock in that the game was farther apart than the final score would indicate and it's why most of the other starters for Brooklyn didn't get into the 30s and minutes played but what I do want to focus on is now with Cam Thomas and cam Johnson both back in there what does that mean for the guys around them because Bridges he's gonna play every day and so does that mean there's enough left for Dennis Schroder is there enough left for Dorian Finney Smith I think on Finney Smith the answer is no this game was pretty quiet one we really do need him as one of those like 30 minute plus guys if we're gonna get fantasy value out of Benny Smith and I don't know that he's getting I mean he might get to 30 but you know 32 33 34 that's where he starts to hit better than top 90 and so I think he probably have anything Falls kind of in the Dozen matter group right now  Schroeder is the one I'm not 100% sure on  he 13 points three has assist he did have a steal in a three-pointer and he made six free throws but overall we know that he needs a lot of usage to be fantasy relative and a cam Thomas coming back already put a little bit of a dent into him and now Johnson coming back is going to put another little Dent into him I expect the Nets overall to be better against teams that are not as good defensively as are the magic so let's give Schroeder one or two more ball games before we make a final call on him either way if he turns out to be kind of bad over both of those then maybe we move on but I don't think we can dump quite this fast let's be a little bit more patient on truder if you wanted to dump any Smith and I wouldn't stop you the magic I have had no fantasy thoughts on Orlando in like two and a half months I don't even know why we continue to talk about them every day  if you have questions about the magic you gotta go back and read any of my tweet storms or watch any of our shows  it's the same stuff over and over again Wendell Carter Junior splits his time with Mo Vagner and golgappa todze and sometimes they go small on Carol is very efficient ball game better in points leagues then nine cat front Foggers a nine cat guy Jonathan Isaac is  like kind of pushing borderline nine cat but you know he's gonna drop as soon as you start to trust him Gary Harris know and Jalen Suggs done shoot the ball well enough so there you go it was really nobody else besides Bronson 9 cat Paulo and points league and that's it you might have some schedule play guys but we'll talk about that on the second half of our show I actually really like splitting the show up into two  I don't like having to do a show where it's like oh this guy's a schedule play and let's look at his schedule and then we come back and we go to the next ball game it's  it's too much  so this show we don't focus on schedule and the afternoon show we focus exclusively on schedule it's a beautiful thing I can't do that all season long but we're doing it now because you're in the playoffs and that's where those two things become much more relevant  all right let's keep working along here  chat room is lighting up with vuckovich  playoff news  yeah yeah  uh yeah yeah um I mean we might  apparently he's coming over to the Wizards that's the news  I mean you can't add him you can't add him in  a head-to-head League because you have no idea when he's actually gonna play I mean really want Adam and Rodeo  then  guess the Wizards have no Sinners right now he's pretty big dude seven footer  floor spacer all that stuff  it's a two-year deal you know woe tweeted about it yesterday and I kind of zip ties because that's like yeah I mean okay fine but then you look in the Wizards are down all these bodies I just I can't imagine he's gonna come in and play a ton right out of the Chute the Wizards still have a bunch of usage guys so I think probably passed uh or at least maybe let's see first okay back to the card at hand Toronto lost at Detroit Raptors are in hard tank mode right now which for those of us who picked up Kelly Olynyk in way too many places is glorious news he had six turnovers but I can't bring myself to care because Kelly also had 19.6 boards eight assists two steals two blocks two three pointers  it's gonna be fun  it's gonna be fun  I've been on the not yet for gradey dick  freight train and it looks like we got it right for this ball game it just I think he needs one more usage guy out of the way which I know is asking a lot because Scotty Barnes is gone and they traded half of their other usage dudes and Yakima Turtles still out and Gary Trent is still out and amazingly that's not enough still for gradey dick who you know 13 shots is fine but he's not the point guard he's not even close he's sort of the fourth ball handler on this team right now he's not the premier scorer on the team all though he will attempt to do that and he doesn't get all that much other stuff in his Fantasy game so I  I'm not there yet and that's not to say that he won't become fantasy playable down the stretch if quickly gets shut down or Bruce Brown gets shut down or whatever and then they're like all right great you get to run the offense a little bit but right now you've got a Linux Bruce Brown Emmanuel quickly are all basically point guard types are head of gradey dick so I don't I'm not there yet with him and I don't think you should be either  but Bruce Brown is an ad 174 and 5/2 steals in a block he shot the ball well but I mean 33 minutes is the key the 12 shots is the key he's gonna be a facilitator  when Gary tried comes back I might I reserve the right to change my opinion on Bruce brown but for now quickly Brown and olenek are the three guys you're playing jaunty Porter is going to play the backup center minutes behind Kelly for the most part he had a huge ball game yesterday but like we've seen enough of his games to know that six assists and five defensive stats and two three-pointers is not something that's particularly repeatable for him especially not in 21 minutes so quickly Brown and Olynyk  no zero every day's for Detroit the everyday is our Jalen Duren who had another 2020 game I freaking love Jalen's rebounding  remember I said that before the season started that one of my favorite things to watch in the NBA is Jalen Duren on the glass  only could have stayed fully healthy this year  you guys may have all remembered that one of my hot takes of the season was Jalen Duren could lead the league in rebounding and he's not going to do that but he's with the Hyper Elite guys he's with sabonis gobert ADD yokich and bead Giannis  during the head of two of those guys  half a rebound behind add and yokich I mean this is a this man is a rebounder  he's a beast  love it  so Duran Cade  are the only two Pistons you can start right now in all formats  when I saw Thompson comes back from the flu he would be the third  Isaiah Stewart got three blocks and three three pointers shot five for six this again you know this is like the good iteration but we know Stewart really doesn't block that many shots if you can catch lightning in a bottle you know good for you it's more of a schedule Place stuff but as far as you know full season which I can full season on this show schedule play will talk in the afternoon I'll repeat that 1,000 times if I have to really get it to sink in during Cade and then Thompson when he comes back  and you like Dan what about ivy  yeah I love him off on purpose points League's only  funky always close with Thompson album I mean 38 minutes is hard to look at and say and do anything there he's been scoring a decent amount funko's gonna get you some points in threes every once in a while he'll tumble into his steel or two call him borderline for you know games capping format or you know holding format kind of stuff  he's above schedule play but he's more of a 50/50 kind of guy call it a doesn't matter type of group  when Michael Porter Jr is hitting shots the nuggets are not beatable  simple as that because Jamal Murray wasn't even good in this ball game and they still  they just pushed Miami back by 10:15 points and it and it really didn't change the whole damn ball game  there's no I have no fantasy thoughts on the Nuggets they're just  they remain A Cut Above in my opinion everybody else in the NBA with maybe the exception of the Celtics but I'm not even sure about that  I just I don't know how anybody stops the Nuggets when they're focused when they're really doing stuff  they're Unstoppable yoke which wasn't even good in this ball game he was fine  you sort of coasting he was like all right I'm gonna fight with bam out of Bio all not I just let these other guys win this one  Speaking of Bam Bam Duncan Robinson Terry was your Jimmy Butler those are your four Miami Heat that's an easy call Kobe white couldn't quite make it through overtime he left at the end of regulation basically in the Chicago overtime win over Indiana Tori Craig picked up the minutes in the short term don't be surprised if when the Bulls play a team that's not trying to run run run run run run run run run run like the Indiana Pacers that you don't get a little bit more Andre Drummond and we've talked on this show before about the Bulls schedule being a big factor in when Drummond actually gets to play basketball games but if Kobe white has to miss a game or two they may not have a choice  like yeah they might see more Tori Craig but they a team they've sort of real accepted the fact that they tend to be better when they go a little big  the opponents are not great for it they've got the Clippers who don't play all that fast you could probably run drum in there the Wizards who don't really run anything so I if you mean you could drum and if you want to done matter Wizards aren't gonna go big so who controls the size of that ball game  then you've got the Blazers  the question really then becomes can vouch hang with a power forward  and  for the Blazers power forward if it's Jeremy Grant he has his know if it's some random young dude the answer is of course yeah those guys are not very good a rockets and so I don't know I don't I would not pre-adjustment  man how good is Alex Caruso I know Chicago still wants to dilute themselves into making a playoff run I just I'm so sad that they didn't trade him for all the assets because it'd be so much fun to see him on a true Contender and also see the bulls actually do a little bit of a proper rebuild it anyway DeMar DeRozan  gotta pause on dmar  Demar is inside the top 30 now people on a per game basis he's also played in 64 basketball games this year a pillar of durability you know what that puts tomorrow on a totals basis  first round  number 12 ladies and gentlemen DeMar DeRozan by totals this year number 12  is that nuts or is that nuts  old man forever  Indiana TJ McConnell continues to put up nice numbers even in only 20 minutes of ball game he had one bad one mixed in there but like the other six or seven have been very good we're talking almost three weeks now  he's been a top 75 play in limited minutes so  you guys know I don't typically like to say oh yeah you play the guy well they're hot well the thing is you know I wouldn't even argue that he's that hot  it's just that the Pacers need his max energy style for those 20 minutes he was part of the unit for the Pacers that played really well in this ball game ended up losing but  McConnell was a plus 15 his bench units were dominating the Bulls bench dominating  he doesn't fit against everybody  and you know their times where he just sort of has to come out because the matchup dictates it but 20 minutes right now is enough for him so go ahead and play TJ McConnell he's in every day or right now  Aries Smith soft hold he's a hold but he's a soft hole he said three three pointers no defensive stats that's the thing that little bit of a letdown but usually you'll get a steal and you get a stealing makes one more shot in this game and you're like us pretty good ball game so hold on Eastman Cleveland got Donovan Mitchell back and now magically they're good again by the way it's not Magic  the funny thing is he didn't even play all that well it's just having Donovan Mitchell around makes the Cavs 9,000 times better  Georges niang still filling in for Max Drew 16 and 6 with 4 3-pointers you can I would say probably play nyang while streus is out  Sam Merrill had five threes and nine assists I don't know where that came from but you're not picking him up Carousel versus likely a drop as Isaac Aurora with Donovan Mitchell back those guys are just not gonna have enough to do on a night the night basis and then for a coral it's about sort of rolling up stats he'll stay closer Levert is all about the points League stuff so the volume isn't there he's not going to be closed because the percentage is all always going to be a mess  on the other side no real big adjustments Pelicans outside of Zion pretty much got smoked in this ball game whereas CJ McCollum ranked these days I haven't looked in a while I know his by totals he's not all that high but remember he was in like the the late teens early 20s for a while  47 the great leveling ladies and gentlemen  kind of happened while nobody was watching  you notice Valentina got run off the floor that's happened a few times lately which is annoying but you're gonna hang on they tried on its Center  tried maybe going small against the giant opponent didn't work  whoopsies  oh well on to the next one  herb Jones you're holding Trey Murphy you're holding he's been super duper hot I know he wasn't great in this ball game but you got to give these guys a little bit more time  Charlotte beat Memphis in a battle of the zombie teams if vasilia mitsch continue to stream him for Cody Martin hem excuse me train man was bad did not have a particularly impressive ball game but you can start him in most formats and hope for that top 100 range  Grant Williams is a coin flip he's been pretty good lately I'll give him that better as a starter better as a center  so I'm gonna say doesn't matter put him in the doesn't matter group you can start him you could not start him  against your games I don't think it's gonna matter all that much so Treman soft yes  Brandon Miller miles Bridges obviously mitts yes right now until Cody Martin shows back up again which still sounds like it's at least a week away  Nick Richards and low-end Center so he's kind of a doesn't matter also and then Alexi polka chefski played 26 and a half minutes  if he suddenly starts to play like legitimate minutes on this team then he would be an ad because there are very few guys in the NBA that can do what he can do the problem is he's still built like  Jack Skellington  and  the only way he's gonna have success against is against other teams that have no idea what they're doing which is basically Memphis right now  so I'm hesitant to call him anything other than a watch list and Davos as expected not a 12 team guy  schedule play sure if you want but yeah  for Memphis so here's the thing like we could spend 10 minutes now  talking about who to start and who not to start on the Grizzlies I could do a whole frickin' show on it but you want to know why it's not really worth our time I'll tell you why  because we have no idea  who's playing for Memphis until two hours before the ball game starts  in most rotol leagues  the moves are made a day before  so talking about the Grizzlies isn't helpful  there's nothing we can do with it information an hour and a half before the ball game starts when you find out oh okay so JJ's out and John contrast in and Luke Kennard is in but might set out the next one and Jordan Goodwin we used up another if his games but he came off the bench for this one because Scotty Pippen Jr needed to start who by the way keep an eye on Scotty Pippen Jr also  and let's see Vince Williams is still out but  santel damaso out Trey Jamison remains in and playing 32 minutes tonight so here's the thing  I can't possibly tell you today who to play in the Grizzlies next ball game  there's just no way because I don't know if John Contra is going to play  and  I don't know if JJJ is gonna play and I don't know if santiel Dom is gonna play and I don't know if Luke Kennard is gonna play  so  how could I possibly tell you which of these filling guys is useful  Jacob ravia has been a steals Menace lately  but otherwise he was quite bad in this ball game but he got 30 minutes  so hmm  he's close the Avi is closed  GG Jackson actually shot the ball a little bit better but like to thank you  on the sort of a day-to-day with him now he's nice scoring number but he didn't get any defensive stats and typically shoots the ball worst than this can I find new he was gonna play starters minutes I'd be able to say go but we don't know  do you want to put Kennard on your bench and Rodeo and spot play him I guess I'm okay with that  Jordan Goodwin is probably good enough in a spot play Vince Williams and JJ are definitely good enough when they're starting  John conchar took eight shots if we knew he was gonna take eight shots he'd be in every day's guy easy but I have no idea  so I'd love to tell you to go out and pick up four of these guys but also they might not even play in their next ball game which I think is still a day or two away Memphis doesn't play today  or tomorrow they play Saturday against the Thunder  so we don't even get more information where I'm like we're not gonna know who's in and who's out for roughly two days at games against Oklahoma City at home for lovely two days and six hours from now then we'll know who to play from Memphis  I really like John contrast Nyan Cat game Trey Jamison's 9 cat game is okay I really like Jordan Goodwin's nine cat game I kind of like Luke Cage 9 cat game I don't like Gigi Jackson's Scottie Pippen Junior as I kind of like Jake laravia as I kind of like obviously I like Vince Williams and JJ but like  these guys can all coexist so we just have to wait and find out which five or six are in on a given night and then make our call from there it sucks that that's the way we have to do it I'd love to be able to say hey go do a thing  can't do it thing  by shout out for to Denver's in the chat room for basically telling me Dan go look at your news feed Luka doncic out ruled out all ready early in the morning which I hate to say but kind of augers poorly for is game against Denver on Sunday but at least he's got two days off before that won Mavericks schedule gets extremely light  and if you wanted to I don't know that I would unless you're on a team with only one game left this week you could move to like a Tim Hardaway Junior because he'll have a big role here today and maybe Sunday I don't think I'd recommend it though but this is  I mean this is a brutal blow if you're a team that's been relying on Luke all season long for me personally this is like the greatest news I could have broken on the show today and I tweeted about it last night look at you incredible one of the best players in the world  a wizard I like you watch him play and you're like how can you do this he's not moving all that fast but he just like a little bit bigger than you realize and so smooth and creates space and he's so brilliant with angles and he's and like everything about it it's just a joy but I'm also playing against him and both of my cash head-to-head leagues right now both of them have Luca on the other side and if he doesn't play these two ball games my chances of winning the weeks go from like  30% in one League where I don't think I'm gonna win but like Lucas out better than 50/50 and the other one which is probably like a 60% chance even if Luca plays probably goes up to like 80 or 85 I guess it's a big deal for me that he just got ruled out you guys don't care nor should you but I do about my League's  I'm trying to get into laptop over here man I got to win some head-to-head leaks because Roto they split the money a little bit smaller  you know Roto take a second place that's a big drop off from first I love being in the money but it's hard when you're playing at a bunch of Rodeo's to really rack up the big bucks head to head you can rack up the big bucks you throw a couple of first places in there and  it's a windfall  I'm gonna say the following and you guys are gonna think that it's a cop out but it's not a cop out Steph Curry is expected back for the Warriors in their weekend game against the Lakers so pretty much ignore this ball game pretty much ignore the last two frankly for the wars anything you did related to Golden State streamer level guys was a pretty well localized to a two-game sample  so Brandon pajam ski a couple of good ball games but Steph's coming back so he's liable to Trend down  trayce Jackson Davis getting bonus playing time because they wanted him in there alongside Chris Paul so that CP3 had a rim Runner  a lob threat basically because part of what makes Chris Paul as good as he is as a point guard is having guys that can get towards the bucket  because if he's looking for a short roll on Draymond Green which is a lot a lot of what happens with Steph and then he's cutting and he's moving back out Chris Paul's not a not a distance threat the way step isn't frankly he's not a threat near the rim the way the way step is so  that scheme didn't really work dream on Sat this ball game out by the way so that meant even safer role for a trace Jackson Davis but I expect Dre and Steph back over the weekend so expect Jackson Davis to tape her off I think put gemski tapers off clay you hold on to he's very up and down this year but you're holding on to him because he's been just barely good enough and then Andrew Wiggins seems like he's playing enough now to where he can stick around on your team and we just talked about the Dallas Mavericks a minute ago no Luca for their ballgame tonight which means Kyrie Irving is going to get a lot of stuff to do Daniel Gafford this might blow up what the and I don't know how many people are aware of this but Daniel Gafford has made 33 consecutive buckets  can you believe that  that's wild  I mean I love me some Daniel Gafford but that is exceptional he's now shooting 71% from the field on the year and he hasn't missed a shot since March 3rd  7475 for five seven for seven nine for nine five for five again  ridiculous ridiculous run for Daniel Gafford over that stretch  and of course it's catapulted him back up where he belonged which is number 34 per game 9 cat in 24  and 45 seconds minutes per game  third round in under 25 minutes a game  Daniel Gafford one of the best per minute producers in all of fantasy  he is one of the hugest old man squad wins of the year and why I yelled and yelled and yelled and pleaded and pleaded with you all to just please hang onto post trade as long as humanly possible I know it was getting hard but I mean like he only needed 20 minutes to be fantasy playable but no Luca now  can Kyrie get him open enough to break the record which I think is 35  a Wilt Chamberlain record 35 consecutive shots made and Daniel Gafford has a chance to break it in the Mavericks ballgame tonight  he makes his first three in a row  amazing  love it Derek Lively Maxi kleber by the way is doubtful for the Mavs ball game dude with toe situation so that means Derek Lively would probably also be playable if you want to go sort of one night stand on Derek Lively PJ Washington's been a hot and you guys know I tend not to ride the hot hand although again with Luca out that probably means I mean Lucas typically taking you know between 20 and 25 shots of ball game and you know six to nine free throws a game  you put that usage back in the main pool there's only so much Kyrie can take from that even if you gave Kyrie 7 or 8 of those 22 shots that still leaves 15 left  so PJ watching is going to get some Timothy Jr is gonna get at least a half dozen I would think he's probably streamable for one game and I mean this is what happens when one of the stars goes down you look at Tim Hardaway you look at Dante Exum his back and starting to play better again he might be playable tonight but you know me I don't dabble in the mites against the games cap so Kyrie yes Gafford yes Tim Hardaway I'll say yes even if he's not starting there he's gonna take a bunch of shots and then yes also to PJ Washington but I'm not gonna trust the other guys it's it's a bit of a role of the dice  got a few really hot and more questions he's been very good for the Lakers but he really doesn't do anything besides score mostly from the mid-range which is like  the least useful place to score from in fantasy you're not getting the three-pointer is and you know to Ruiz credit he's hitting all of his mid-range shots but you're not getting the the Boost of a lot of dunks to your field goal percent he did boost the field goal percent but he's just not is not good enough on the road oh side so schedule play for hatchimal in the Lakers have a terrible schedule so move along Keon Ellis filled in for Keegan Murray the previous ball game he filled in for Kevin herder in this ball game and he's been great he was awesome on Dame he was awesome on D-Low and he was a big-time Difference Maker shot five for eight including three three pointers which is a big deal because the Lakers were kind of Daring him to hit from the outside and the king is just went bananas from three-point land  and frankly there's just you're not gonna win that ball game if  like if the kings are eating 19 threes and shooting 52% you're not gonna beat him done matter how well you play on the other side and everybody's like all the Lakers were horrible actually don't think the Lakers has a team where all that bad Austin Reeves played well um really played very well LeBron was actually not very good in this ball game he rebounded well but he didn't shoot it all D Lowe was bad and then add has so much trouble with demonic sabonis I really don't know why the Lakers don't go big  and just try to get Anthony Davis off of so bonus as much as humanly possible not have to fight with him for rebounds it exhausts add and the Lakers just keep pushing the same button and expecting a different result it ain't happening guys he's too strong  they're like three guys in the NBA that Anthony Davis cannot deal with  so bonus yolk itch  and those two guys have a lot of similarities and then Joel embiid who's also gigantic  the other big dudes are too slow  add goes around them so even if he gets beat up a little bit he can go kind of around and over  but those guys are these guys were talking about are too big and quick enough  to stay in 80s way and sort of like push him out too far  you can't quite go around him the way he can around someone like say a Jonas Valen Tunis  who's Giant and gives him a little trouble at the other end of the floor but add and the whole Lakers team we just play that dude off the court  I don't know why the Lakers don't try something different but in any event good news for the Kings because you know they were hot Harrison Barnes it's 73 pointers  if you had him going congratulations he had two pretty good games in a row he is gonna play more I'll say this to for Barnes he's gonna play more because Trails is out and he did more because Kevin herder was out so there were a couple of extra things that came his way but I still don't want to play him against the game's cap Keon Ellis I'm not playing against the game's cap also Kevin hurt her might be back the Kings go into a pretty clunky scheduling stretch here they got one game the rest of this week and two games over six days before a five and seven that starts Wednesday of next week which again only relevant if you're lead continues Beyond next week otherwise you only get three of those five games but if you have a king the rest of this like if you were thinking about picking up key on Ellis  like what's your hurry because her might be back and then key on goes back to playing 1920 minutes and said of close to 30  and finally the Atlanta Hawks who  stink sorry Hawks that's okay you Hawks fans know there's seven games under 500 they still somehow have the 10 seed because the teams below them in the East are even worse  and we were wondering would anybody pick up slack for the combination of saddiq Bey and Jane Lin Johnson and the answer is no  no nobody did  vit crunchy had seven points in 31 minutes took four a grand total of four shots so he didn't do anything Devonte Murray took 29 shots he had a field day but nobody else could do anything you're playing Murray you're playing Bogdan bogdanovich you're playing DeAndre Hunter who I know wasn't good in this ballgame but there's just enough for him to do and you're playing Clint capela for the Hawks right now you are not dabbling in Garrison Mathews or Bruno Fernando or crunchy or Trent Forrest or Wesley Matthews who played 14 minutes before I assume he left the Ballgame because a leg fell off  no I'm being told no his limbs are all okay good  Portland  so how many raise your hand if you thought that the Blazers veterans would be like mostly playing at this point of March  any of you  two  yeah this is kind of surprising but here's the thing  Simon's missed a bunch of time earlier in the year  8 and Mr bunch of time early in the year  so these are guys that are like screw it man like  we already had our rest  we don't want to be shut down because  we already sort of pre shut things down now you know for Simons these number 95 because all he does is score hit three pointers for the most part he's a good free throw shooter as well but there's a lot of holes in his nine cat game still obviously he's a start because a bunch of guys are out and he's gonna take a bazillion shots and then DeAndre ayton who had a great start to the year and then went through a prolonged slow stretch back up to number 41 on a per game basis in nine CAD but he only played 43 games so far this year  and time this is a 42  so if rest  quote unquote rest is what you're looking for I mean  these guys already got it even if they play all of their games down the stretch right now we're still only talking how many games the Blazers have left there it's 65 I got 17 games left like they can play all of them and they'd get to around 60  you think these guys need more rest than that  Jeremy Grant's by the way in the low 50s so if you think he might play a little more down the stretch yet maybe you get another 78 games out of him like half games  I think Grant is going half-time  and I think eight and Simon's are probably going like three quarter to four fifths time  cool beans man the other Blazer you can play every day as Matisse diebold who is head-to-head wrote All I don't care schedule I don't care he's too valuable right now for what he does on the defensive side good news of course is that Portland has a very good schedule starting like basically at the the whole month of March  they are hyper loaded through the month of month of March the Blazers are one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen Seventeen games between March 1st and March  29th and then they're off for two days at the very end of the month that's the only time in the entire month they have back-to-back days off  and they have one two three four back-to-backs in there I mean that's that is as loaded as schedules you can get and it's why guys are getting some days off all so but like  Batista diebel  in that run  Herculean defensive stats  you don't really think about the kind of damage he can do in 25 to 35 minutes playing with like very few usage guys around him  it's extraordinary  he's been great  and then anybody else on this team is a schedule play right now  don't say but what about no schedule play they're all scheduled place Jeremy Grant obviously you play him when he's in there  so  that's your recap quick check in the chat room before we wrap this thing up we already talked about Tristan vuckovich  any chance Gary Trent Jr comes back this week yeah there's a chance he was questionable until about two hours before their last ball game and they got downgraded a doubtful so  to that end I'd be a little surprised if he played tomorrow  but I don't think you can rule Sunday out yet  James Wiseman versus Jaime jacquez Junior in a points League um  actually think I'd probably go Hawks  I don't wiseman's been a little bit better lately not like a total dumpster fire but he still a super low minted back up to Jalen Duren and not queso was gonna play mid-20s and minutes so you just like in my eyes you go with the guy who probably plays the tiny bit more  do I drop Draymond Green or Kelly Olynyk to bring Kawaii off the injured list is Kawaii playing  and I didn't see anything about him in you might not have to worry about that friends I think Kauai probably misses a game or two so you probably don't have to worry about it but if you did  the guy you'd be bringing the guy you'd be dropping is Draymond Green you're definitely not dropping Kelly Olynyk he's he's a monster right now  Brook Lopez was dropped by a playoff team that's hurting do I pick him up  yeah the Milwaukee schedule sucks  they played today they play Sunday they only have three next week including a Sunday game so you know starting today they have four games over eight days but starting tomorrow they have only three over seven  and they have one over five starting tomorrow  I'm gonna say no actually  because after today there's schedule is sort of untenable  surprise surprise you didn't think I was gonna say that  you think's gonna be worse with Luca out yeah a little bit a little bit  it's porting us a drop  no if you're in a head-to-head league and you can't stash him is he really the worst injured player because he should be ill eligible by now surely you have someone worse than porzingis you can drop instead that's all so hurt  but yeah you can't take zeros if you're in the playoffs right now so  should I drop Spencer Dinwiddie for someone from the YMCA yes  which Mitchell Robin with Mitchell Robinson coming back I dropped Isaiah hardenstein for gradey dick was it the right choice well I don't know about gradey dick is the pickup but yeah hardest time you can drop he just he hasn't been good because of the Achilles in the minutes cap and I think I said it on yesterday's show or the day before  it sucks because his upside is insane but hard to not gonna play enough  isn't Gary Trent just a three cat guy with Point threes and steals with nothing else so here's the thing guys the answer that question is sorta yeah  also in general he's a decent free throw shooter I know he's not doing all that well there this year but typically yes but the thing is  there's a difference between being a three cat guy who is a disaster in other stuff and a three cat guy who only just kind of doesn't hurt you all that much in other stuff and that's where the math weighs out so over the last three weeks basically since Gary Trent started getting starters level minutes he's number 80 in Nyan Cat  and you're like Dan there are other guys that are three cat guys who you talk about being ranked in the 150 range yeah it has to do with how good or bad they are in the other categories also how good or bad they are in the ones where they are good  and Gary Trent is good in points very good in threes and very good and steals typically okay great you got three like medium sized positives he doesn't turn the ball over which is good for nine cat field goal percentage is going to be a medium sized negative and not obviously you're not getting any blocks but like he's gonna get you two to three assists per game most of the time which isn't good but it's not destroy your team bad and he's going to get you three to four rebounds per game which isn't good but it's sort of like in that shooting guard window  and the math and that's the beauty of you know basketball monster rank page or a Yahoo rank page or we're going to have one coming at sports before next season these rank Pages do the math for you they'll tell you if the good outweighs the bad and for Trent  it does  it's good question  is Vince Williams a drop or do I hope he plays next week I just  I don't know man I think probably  I mean if you have to make the call like if you're in a buy or something you can wait because Memphis has a game in a couple of days  otherwise yeah I mean if you're in a playoff battle right now that's a drop  thoughts on Marvin Bagley coming back I have no idea I would think next week or the week after maybe but it also possibly doesn't play at all I I really don't know because that team is in a weird spot  gradey dick or I'm in Thompson points League give me Thompson  I'm also playing Luca in my head to head and I have Kyrie so yay finals next week well we got a two game are next week so this is rut row  Duncan Robinson or below for a Sunday stream probably Duncan he's been reliably good and safe and his  the holes in Duncan Robinson's Fantasy game are smaller than the holes in Kula Belize Fantasy game  or Johnathan Isaac well  Jonathan Isaac if you blocks otherwise not Jonathan Isaac  funny story here I actually did pick up Johnathan Isaac in one League because I the only prayer I have of winning that playoff matchup which is again against one of these teams with Luca is to win threes or to come back in threes and hold on to blocks on a team that has wimpy and Chet  Heaven Help Me  we'll see  you're the best Dan thank you Dan the man hey thank you guys  yeah you know I went to a my wife took me to a James Taylor concert before I think it was my 30th birthday so that's a long time ago now it was at the Hollywood Bowl maybe he was like 30 to I don't remember we didn't have a kid yet and in the middle of the concert we were we were halfway up because you know  we're regular people and we could hear this woman yell  well I forget the exact oh what was the exact phrasing  yo I think it was you  I think to hear somebody scream at a James Taylor concert because James Taylor's what seen a 70s now  and right in the middle of getting ready to play his next song he turns looks at her tips his little braids and says no Madam you rule so to
