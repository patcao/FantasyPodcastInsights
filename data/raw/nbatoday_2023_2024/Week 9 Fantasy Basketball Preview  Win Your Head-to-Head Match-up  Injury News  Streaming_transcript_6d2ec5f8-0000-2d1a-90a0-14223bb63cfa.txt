welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  all right friends it's the second episode of the day this one's the short one  and I seem to have forgotten my glass of water so that means it's gonna be even shorter this is the weekly preview show special edition of fantasy NBA today on this Monday afternoon hopefully we've got a little bit of injury news in the tank all the  look let's be honest weed we'd all like a little bit more but we're gonna be making a bunch of calls as we head into the week lots of guys key guys with questionable tags tonight guys that are coming back part way through the week there's all kinds of stuff but let's get right to it I am Dan best person this again is fantasy NBA today a sports presentation please do take a moment to like rate subscribe all of the stuff all

towards the end of the week and folks will win if you don't have a basketball sub you could get that if you want to try wager pass or DFS or baseball it's coming up here football is winding out we got a lot of things you guys can pick from depending on whether you are a winner or not  all right so here's the thing quick weekly overview suggests and when I say suggests I mean is the Phoenix Suns are kind of the only team that really needs to be talked about by themselves this week because they are the only team with a two-day game schedule  as it goes this is a weekly lineup type of decision as it goes weekly line up style basically if you have a top 50 player or better that's a guy you start in a two game week if it's somebody outside the top 50 typically that's someone that gets the punch to your bench up because there's usually someone with four games out of the wire that could do more now thing is about the Suns there are three main guys right now and I'm not talking about Bradley Beal because he's never playing apparently Kevin Durant  Kevin Booker and Yusef nurkic all three of these guys are actually inside the top 50 nerc with some better percentages lately as pushed himself up to number 43 so for Phoenix you just start them all it's a really easy one super simple calculation on that and otherwise you don't have to worry too much about it  one thing I did want to do this week that's a little bit different is share with you guys a streaming grid which this is a great reason for those that are listening to the Pod to come join us over on the actual YouTube side going forward this is the streaming calendar it's one that I made up a long time ago and the great Andre Lemos has been updating it over the last couple of seasons  basically and you can see as we've been filling in some of the sort of color coding on this this is every team schedule lined up horizontally so you can see what it looks like on any given week I've shaded in very light yellow beige all back-to-backs over the course of this week and this is such a wonderful tool we have for Fantasy pastors over at sports ethos you can play with that around with it because again Accel super easy or you can just use it as is you're not going to be able to use it for the rest of the year from this show because I zoomed in specifically on this we add a little bit of next week let's be honest you're getting a little bit of both  but this is just such an unbelievable tool and if you ever wondering when I've done these shows in the past I'm often looking at this very calendar as I'm going through the show so for instance  you're coming into this week you're trying to get off to a quick start a very fast zip zip up and down the calendar of boom right there Memphis starts the week with the back to back in Oklahoma City in New Orleans there are few options on the Grizzlies team that makes sense on back-to-backs with the course the caveat that John Morant is actually set to make his season debut tomorrow in the second half of that back to back but guys like David Roddy have been doing more lately they've played in back-to-backs Vince Williams been playing in back to backs on TL dama these guys are all dudes that you're not using in a one you know they play one out of every two or three days but two games in a row that's a terrific way to get your week off to a game's heavy start and work it out from there if that's not enough for you there's other ways you can analyze it so let's go through some of that  long streaming for instance you want to do four games in six days Atlanta Brooklyn Chicago Cleveland Dallas Denver Houston I'm scrolling and I'm reading Indiana the Clippers the Lakers the Grizzlies  the Timberwolves it goes on like this the Sacramento Kings Toronto Utah all of those teams go four times the first six days this week so maybe you want to pare it down a little bit more and look for teams that are going three games the first four days this week well great I can do that for you as well  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you your Force to go on a last second drink run at end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of beer Wine and Spirits then get them delivered right to your watch party compare prices across multiple stores in your area find the best deals on Game Day drinks and get back to armchair quarterbacking from you guessed it  your armchair  download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's dri z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  front door was open just found that out from my nanny I think that my  I think that my kid when he went to his my his grandmas house they may have just left the door open on their way kids things that are going three times the first four days Chicago Cleveland goes for three and four Indiana Clippers Lakers Memphis Minnesota so you guys in Utah there's so many options if you want to get your week out the right way so here's what we're going to do on today's show if you are streaming one roster slot this week your decision is relatively straightforward you can go Monday Tuesday with Memphis then you're looking for a Wednesday Thursday there you have them on your screen Chicago Cleveland Indiana Clippers Lakers Timberwolves magic Jazz all go Wednesday Thursday if you want to go Friday Saturday after that you've got a bunch of choices again Atlanta Brooklyn Dallas Denver Golden State  Houston Sacramento Toronto and then if you want to use your fourth and final move on Sunday well that's silly because nobody plays on Sunday if you're using your move out that point you're using it for a team that's playing on Christmas on Monday of next week which of course Lakers and Celtics are going head-to-head Mavs and Sons Warriors and Nuggets Philly and Miami Sixers and heat and then the Milwaukee Bucks and the New York Knicks those are your games on Christmas day so that would be if you were doing it for a Sunday move towards next week  if you want to up the difficulty setting on your weekly stream you think about what you do if you had two players to stream so in that case now you're looking for a couple of teams that go three games in four days to start the week meaning Monday and Wednesday Thursday or Monday Tuesday and then Tuesday which I guess only makes sense if Memphis fits that mold they do but you have a lot of choices there as well but you can pick up two players use two moves today of any team that goes three in four so basically what I'll do here on your screen is I'll highlight the first four days of the week you look for any team that has three games listed in their Chicago Cleveland Indiana Clippers Lakers I've lost count already Grizzlies Timberwolves  and Jazz are your choices there then you look for teams that are going twice the rest of the week which is basically means then a Friday Saturday back-to-back you can use two of your moves there we've already talked about which teams are Friday Saturday back-to-backs then you're out of moves for the week and you just kind of have to hope that you have a good start to next week or you save it and you use a moves on Christmas day next week but that would be sort of the one setting up difficulty if you're streaming to roster slots instead of Jack's just one  so this is what I use when I stream this document that you guys are able to see or that you're hearing me talk about if you're listening to the Pod after the fact  is known as our streaming Grid it's available to all fantasy pass subscribers you guys can access have access to the entire season on here as a just me zooming in on the one little chunk of time as far as what players to look at on those teams well it changes day to day you know with Memphis it's the same kind of thing like you're looking at a Grizzlies team that's going to get John Morant back next week or tomorrow rather not next week next game but that if you're looking at like Wednesday Thursday Chicago we don't know if Alex Caruso's gonna be in for those games or Tori Craig Cleveland I guess you have a pretty good idea who's in for them Indiana  do we get more on Tyreese Halliburton before tonight Lakers is another team that's got guys questionable tags pretty much all the time  so for me to like point out ahead and say oh Minnesota they play Wednesday Thursday a guy you should be looking to stream there is Michaela Walker Troy Brown Junior I like what if Anthony Edwards is back then that team isn't super interesting or Lando do you want to stream Goga when they start their back to back on Wednesday Thursday we didn't real talk about them because they don't have a game earlier in the week but this is the type of stuff you're going to want to do on more of a day-to-day basis just stay on top of it look for where the players that are fringy but a little bit more successful and then put those pieces together and you are good to go  I want to take a moment here in the middle is show to give a quick shout out to Derek ball who is busy until a little bit later on today he was unable to join us for this weeks episode should be able to get something going next week hopefully on Sunday because there are no games on Sunday and then Monday is Christmas and how many you guys really gonna want to watch it weekly preview show on Christmas morning remember the game start first thing in the freaking am Derek of course is on Twitter at dbal he writes the week ahead for sports ethos and he has his awesome weekly thread that you guys can all get access to that's on Twitter that part is very much free so make sure to go check out d-ball bball and we will have him back on the Pod here shortly let's stop sharing that screen that's the streaming grid and that's basically how you're doing it this week if you're trying to stream either one or two players the other thing I wanted to talk about this week just for a moment are some of your decision Matrix stuff on good players  column top 100 125 range or higher that are questionable going into the week  Joel embiid  came out this morning he's dealing with some hamstring tightness which is only surprising because he hasn't had to play in a fourth quarter since December the 8th they've beaten up on some truly awful teams over the last four ball games so he's had like you know basically a 10-day break from having to play in any competitive basketball and overall frankly the Sixers are on one of the very very easy scheduling runs of all time where it went Wizards Hawks Wizards pistons pistons a hornets and now Bulls all so pretty damn easy before they finally have Minnesota on the 20th um  very there was a game for him be just to rest it would have been any one of the last four so this one presumably as a real injury if it's coming up now when they're actually playing a slightly more competent team if he's out your role in Paul Reed for one ball game but in terms of like the week what do you do with the week if MB is out well that's a little bit of a different monster because Philly is only a three game week  do we think that this is something that lingers I don't know  Minnesota Toronto the only other two games then of course they're back on Christmas Day  you're probably starting indeed regardless questionable with hamstring tightness feels like you're going to get two games out of him and he's a top player in the entire league Anthony Davis similar story but the Lakers are a four game week so even if he misses their game tonight against the Knicks you're probably getting two to three games out of him  same story for Tyreese Halliburton four game week for for Indiana so I think worst case scenario you're getting two more than likely you're getting three maybe even all four Luka doncic apparently is under the weather Ms shoot around with an illness he's been so beat up lately and this game up in altitude is going to be kind of a tough one so honest the goodness I don't know he might take it off they still have three games left the rest of the week so Lucas a start pretty easy calls there at the top of the board  LeBron is questionable for game week send them into your lineup Kyrie Irving out bench him we have no idea when he's coming back lamelo ball same story Bogdan book zdanowicz was He's listed as questionable for the Hawks with a tweaked ankle he's been unbelievably healthy so far this year  four game week for Atlanta means you're probably getting three so go ahead and keep him in your lineup he's been incredible  Terry Rozier probable him the Aaron Fox a barely did participate in shoot around he's still listen as questionable for their ballgame tonight and the reason you have to worry about this a little bit is that  you know it's a late ball game so we might not get the update on Fox before they the early games tip but that's a four game week also so you're probably getting three out of him or maybe even all four go ahead and start him Evan Mobley he's out a while bench him for all so while Charlotte Hornets just a three game week and Miles Bridges was not allowed into Canada so you're getting two games out of bridges this week and he's right on that like 50 top 50 border so you kind of just have to ask yourself all right miles bridges in two games he's averaging about 20 and 7 can I find someone on The Wire who's going to give me 10 and 4 basically  because if the answer is yes on decent percentages then you have a better option on the wire and that's why that rule kind of comes into play basically right around that top 50 Mark is where you can sometimes find a four-game guy who can do better in four games then if top 50 guy can do in two  but again as you work your way up the ladder to someone like Aaron Fox you're probably not finding somebody on the wire who's gonna give you 60 points and 18 rebounds and 26 assists even in four ball games  sorry and 13 assists what am I talking about here nine boards 13 is 6 probably not getting that in four ball games out of somebody  so that again is the calculus  Jalen Johnson out Myles Turner I didn't even realize he was questionable at dealing with a some hamstring soreness both apparently  think he might miss two games which makes me a little bit nervous but two out of him would still be just barely enough to get it done  Anthony Edwards also its kind of after effects of this hit pointer that hasn't really gone away I think you're probably getting at least three out of him so he's a start Mark Williams I think you've got a bench he's doubtful for their game today just a three-game week so down to two games most likely so that's a no Clint capela dealing with a left knee bone Brews that could actually sideline him for a little bit they're playing an early game today so hopefully we'll get an update on him before their start in about two and a half hours my guess is that he's going to be ruled out I would probably bench him I know that Hawks do have a four game week but Capella's not good enough to roll the dice that it's only one or two ball games you can probably find somebody better  if he plays in three then yeah you probably end up losing out on that that play but what if he gives you a 0 that's the other side  you don't want to lose the week  you can sacrifice a couple of rebounds and a block shot to make sure you don't take a goose egg you do it  Jamal Murray is probable for the Nuggets that means he's a go so go ahead and drop him in your lineup he's number 75 and 9 Cal right now yes the championship hangover is real Malik Beasley was ruled out of their ballgame yesterday he's been out for a couple in a row with this nasty respiratory thing that a lot of folks are getting myself included bucks I believe are what it is say they have three game or a four I already forgot there are three gamer so I think you probably have to bench him if your lineup's locked today I like Beasley but if there's any chance he misses one of the three games this week then he's just simply not gonna be good enough  Kyle Lowry is already been ruled out and guys are coming back for the heat meaning his job is about to drink so go ahead and get him on your bench D'Angelo Russell probable get him in there for a four gamer Derek Lively this instincts he was in a walking boot I think he got a bench him I know the Mavs have a pretty good schedule this week  with a four gamer including back-to-back there's a San Antonio in there that'll be a high scoring game I think you we may be down to two from Lively and that simply won't be enough so unfortunately he's a weekly bench Zach LaVine bench Mitch Robinson bench Darius Garland bench what else we got I'm just going through Yahoo's bored to see who's in and who's out Alex Caruso dude just cannot last he keeps playing these five 12 13 minute games and then leaving with injury he went through shoot around so you know he might be in there and the Bulls have a good schedule this week with the back-to-back middle of the week against his old team in LA or at home to La they've all got the Spurs their defenses lackluster  I love it if we got a good report on Caruso before the game in Philly tonight because if so I'm starting him in a Four game her but if he gets ruled out for this one no  John Collins and you saw questionable and that ball game is not until 6:00 Pacific time tonight so we might not get a report on Collins before we got a lock our lineups so may end up hurting if we bench him and they play cuz you does got a good schedule but I just don't know how you take a shot on that considering he's been dealing with an illness for freaking 10 days all ready you got to believe he'll be back for at least three games this week but I don't know that three of Collins is enough he's right around the edge of the top one hundred you might be able to find somebody with four that can match him basically maybe it's close but again I think if you can avoid taking the shot you avoid it  Gordon Hayward in a three gamer is also pretty close to a bench  um  with Miles Bridges out for one of them that's that's probably a good sign for him but he's also questionable for their game in Toronto with an illness so probably try to bench Gordon Hayward in a weekly league if you have someone anyone at all with a four game week and you can sub in Forum Jalen Duren you're leaving out Casey P you're leaving out the Andre Hunter  I don't know that you were starting to anyway but he's questionable so probably leave him out even if he's playing you can probably leave him out and Marcus Smart you leave it out  tari Eason you are putting in he's been awesome lately Houston as a four game week and I like everything that I'm seeing there  and that is your lightning round edition of our weekly preview show we didn't want to go too deep I want to make sure everybody has enough time to get their lineup set let's see if there's anything anybody have any weekly lineup decisions yet  hmm what do we got here  no nope nope nope nope  should I drop Bradley Beal to stream his spot know try to hang on I think he's gonna try to get back in in about two and a half three weeks which should be you know for someone who's probably gonna end up in the like 60 to 75 range that's not and I know it's been just this total season from hell but at some point  like try to separate the rest of the season from this injury and I know that's impossible but if you really back into an after three weeks that's the link that's very much a link of time you should be willing to stash someone of his ability so I would probably stick with it there  should I drop Kelly Olynyk or Azar Thompson for Onkyo Kang woo  it's amazingly I'm probably dropping I'm probably dropping Thompson  but I'm not sure that either one of those guys sticks in the starting lineup as their teams get healthy so that's why it's kind of like a  either way and lately on Linux has been putting up better numbers so that's probably just the way I go  see if there's anything here  Pratt says I'll watch on Christmas day yeah man you know for me more on we're doing the old order Chinese food and watch some movies  old joke about Jewish families on Christmas day um I don't know that any of these other questions are actually  weekly lineup questions so again if you got questions that are not weekly lineup stuff throw them in the comments after the show  and everything else that looks like is trade stuff maybe one day I'll do a trade show I'll just come on here and you guys can yell trades at me and all I analyze them would you guys want to see his show like that  make sure to drop a few likes on this thing posted in the comments if you'd like to see a show where I basically just come on as your like your trade Oracle I'm not gonna have any graphics wish I can have like  burden oh burn a cauldron of sage in Kyrie Irving's honor and just let the  let the smoke fill the room and then I'll give you my my Oracle on trades that seems like a fun idea actually I kind of want to write that down before it falls out of my head ideas for future shows where is this we'll call it the  trade Raiders show that'd be fun  here's a good question should we bench herb for the week weekly lineup show um  that's a very good question he's been cold as ice and it's just a three-game week  yeah I mean I think if you can find a four gamer who's been hotter I think I would do it in a weekly in a weekly deal you know traditional head-to-head you play them daily head you play them Roto  you probably do leave them on your bench for now until you start to see some good signs any thoughts on Markel faults yeah if you've come this far holding him you probably just want to let it go a little bit longer cuz it sounds like he's starting to inch closer to come back but I said it about 15 times on the pod  I don't think he's any better than top 90 this year I feel like that's kind of where he maxes out and so that's you know you're thinking about whether or not that's worth it for your team  for streaming should I drop Dante Exum or Josh Hart to pick up someone up on the back to back Tuesday Wednesday  I think I would drop Josh Hart I know Josh Hart has better rest of season appeal than eggs but eggs have been hotter right now guys in that range you're just gonna go with hotter and that I think is where we're going to pull the plug on the start sit type stuff again I want to keep this show very start sit focused if you've got questions put them in the comments and we'll just wrap this one up
