welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast come on up kiddo oh all right everybody oh my goodness okay then hey everybody this is my younger son Theodore  I did it again very good and he's been listening to Britney Spears  he will be turning four in three days  that's nonsense we're gonna talk streaming here in just a second okay can you lock us can you lock that in the room  is that okay  no  all right lock me in okay oh  yep there you go  that make you think about the covid days when kids are just running on every show what's Happening everybody I'm sorry I'm a little bit late today on this one we wanted to go about an hour ago we got Big Stuff in in the works here at sports ethos and sometimes you got to get those big things knocked out before we can do a little streaming chatter welcome to Fantasy NBA Today shout out to Theodore I am Dan bass this is a sports ethos.com presentation and we're gonna Dive Right In because we all got to get our lineup set and then the next like 55 minutes so there is really no time to screw around today  here's a streaming board for those that are watching with us live you can see this week next week the week after that I got a three weeks sample size it's probably not all not as easy to see when I go this wide on it but this is where you can see kind of how the color coding all seeps in what I wanted to do today was talk a little bit about today but all so through the weekend and into next week if you guys if your legs are not over on Sunday which I know summer over on Sunday I have two actually that are over on Sunday I got a couple that are still kicking along on the head-to-head side and then with Roto goes to the end of the regular season but that sort of inconsequential here on a head-to-head streaming show start with the bad schedules and we'll work out way from those and then we'll get into a few questions at the end I know a number of you guys put questions in our morning show and I said hey take them to the afternoon show and now I'm gonna try to abandon ship too quickly so I promise I'll do better we're schedules right now Dallas is the worst schedule the rest of this week they don't have any games the rest of this week Dallas finished up their calendar yesterday they're off for three days now before they have a back-to-back to start next week  but remember next week is also an overload Monday so it's nice that they get a Tuesday game in there but it's not the end of the world obviously the problem here is that Dallas has two extraordinary fantasy assets and one very good one in Daniel Gafford so it's hard to drop anybody Gafford is the one you drop if you're in a tight battle that goes on through next week and then obviously if you're leak is over on Sunday you can drop any of them that's pretty easy call  or Lando is the other kind of clunky schedule here coming up this really the only two today that I would classify as bad or Lando place tomorrow but they're off for three days after that so technically magic right now are in a one game in five days span and because no one plays a back-to-back this weekend which will become sort of more relevant we talk about what's coming up here in a second if you don't make a move off in Orlando Magic player today there's no way to to Really maximize things if you really like your magic player you could hold them through tomorrow but then you're kind of loading into next week  and you pretty much at that point need to make a move on Sunday and that's fine and all the thing is of course a lot of teams have two games left this week and a couple even sort of pivot into a decent front end of next week and that's why Orlando Creeps in is a team you might want to consider moving off of today but certainly on Sunday  your good schedules starting today are pretty level  almost across the board  there are one two three four five six seven eight teams that all play three times in the next four days three of them start that with a back-to-back today tomorrow that's Portland San Antonio and Toronto  those teams also go for in six and addition to the three and four Boston has a back-to-back and a three and four but they don't go for in sick they played today tomorrow and Monday but they don't play Wednesday of next week and then  the teams that also play three and four but sort of we call like an inverted three and four where they play today and then they're back to back is Sunday Monday those teams are Cleveland Indiana the Los Angeles Clippers and the Philadelphia 76ers so those are all your teams and again you know the only difference between the Portland San Antonio Toronto Boston grouping and that second half is the flexibility side where if you want to go the back to back side first Portland San Antonio Toronto Boston you could conceivably get off of those teams on Sunday if you really wanted to if you want to if you had a move left over somehow and you were trying to squeeze out one extra game  typically you're not gonna have a ton of moves left over on Sunday to to utilize you've probably used them specially with the number of injuries that have happened this week you've probably used all your moves up on injured players anyway and if you haven't  Lord Knows by the end of tonight you will so there isn't that big of a difference between all of these one two three what did I what did I say there was nine  there's really no difference because you probably don't have the moves to make another swap on Sunday so the list of players you could go with you know 19 teams you got a pretty good option here is significant the favorites would be Payton Pritchard and Sam Houser who's back for the Celtics because we already know they're resting half their starters in each of those two games so those guys are gonna get a lot of extra run Carousel vert obviously in Cleveland George nyang is not a bad decision option there neesmith McConnell on the Pacers are a good fit among these teams Indiana of course in that sort of inverted one same with Cleveland  OH try abaji is an interesting one for Toronto because Gary Trent just got ruled out about 45 minutes ago or something like that so bhaji might be okay and then if you want to get a little bit of the sort of a deeper dive scoot on Portland Luke kornet in Boston Terence Mann for the Clippers campaign and Philadelphia because you figure Kyle Lowry probably gets one of the back-to-backs off and if you want to go real deep Amir Coffey Mo Bamba you know Jalen Smith if he's upright for Indiana Chris Murray Walker gradey dick Daniel Tyson Merrill these are all you know guys that barely qualify but you know if you're in a deeper League or if it's a hyper competitive one and you're just trying to squeeze out an extra game or two those are the names that are way down in the Deep part of the barrel  but what if you're looking Beyond just the worst schedules uh today  and then sort of early in the next week what if you're looking  I don't want to say tomorrow necessarily and here's the thing you know I know that the the graphic for this show talks about how we're going to be discussing streaming throughout the weekend streaming tomorrow and Sunday is crap  you should be using your moves up today because there are no weekend back-to-backs  scheduling starting tomorrow is a bleep show there's really almost nobody in the NBA that has a good schedule starting tomorrow Sacramento would be I would argue maybe the only one but they were already a team that we discussed two days  three  two days ago when they started their five and seven so why you'd wait until tomorrow to pick up a Sacramento King I Have to clue when you could have gotten on Wednesday  so there's almost no one that you should look at tomorrow and go oh yeah this is this is a move I got to make  and it's kind of similar on Sunday not exactly similar it's only kind of similar in that the teams you're looking at on Sunday are largely the teams we just talked about as playing three games in four nights did I say Detroit they're in their all so but they're streaming options are crap  but yeah we talked about Indiana we talked about the Clippers all the inverted back-to-backs on Sunday where then they now have a back-to-back Sunday Monday and a bunch of those teams roll into a game on Wednesday  but of course next week is a little bit confusing because you probably want teams that play on the non overload days so yeah Sunday Monday you might be able to squeeze that game in on Monday but it doesn't really matter if the guy you're streaming plays Wednesday Friday because you're probably not going to be able to use them  so like if you're picking up a Pacer on Sunday  that's a little goofy probably should have just picked him up today if you were going to go that route so you get today Sunday Monday and then if you want to move off of them for somebody that has a light schedule or like days quality days schedule like Milwaukie or  New Orleans are the two teams that go Tuesday Thursday Saturday that's when you abandon ship so the overarching thought here  before I get started talking too fast is that  there isn't a whole lot to be gained by picking up a team  that plays on Sunday unless it's Milwaukee or New Orleans  but New Orleans is of people like you could do it today if you want to do and frankly we talked about doing it yesterday when they still had three games in four nights the rest of the week so that one was already off the table Milwaukee is off for two days today so that would be one where if you had to move left over on Sunday go to Milwaukee you've already done the New Orleans thing so that shouldn't really be an issue and then no one else is really all that exciting I mean Oklahoma City they roll into a four game week next week but it's Tuesday Wednesday Friday Sunday so you get that one light day but then you roll right into the heavy days  they're just really isn't a great schedule for next week that involves doing something tomorrow or Sunday  other than teams that you probably should have already been streaming anyway like Sacramento like New Orleans  if you're picking up those guys to on Sunday you've sort of missed a lot of the joy  you're getting them for part of the okay schedule but then I mean look even beyond that with Sacramento then they're off they play one game over four days after Tuesday next week and it's on a Friday  which you probably wouldn't be able to use that dude anyway  so the actual answer to that question it was Dan what do you do if you have some  if you have a move left use it now  use it today  today is the move if you are streaming for next week as we've already mentioned Milwaukee New Orleans are the teams to go for Monday Tuesday Thursday Saturday Sunday are the five more relevant days because Monday and Sunday you might not be an overload Wednesday and Friday you almost definitely are so great out your team now find out guys that play on Wednesday and Friday that you can abandon ship on and consider doing that immediately so don't just look at the guys that play the least amount or the most because you might be in a bit of a bind and it's better to plan ahead so like for instance I'm in a league I'm in Yahoo League where I get to buy this week because their playoffs just started and then you've got next week in the week after is the actual  I'm actually gonna be in true battles  I picked up Malik Beasley this week I mean I don't think he's gonna be all that good next week but he going Tuesday Thursday Saturday and I know I can use all three of those games  and I'm praying that the opponent I'm going up against is not going to be the guy who has dudes that already go on those days that's gonna make my life a whole lot tougher those Yahoo League suck by the way Fab overnight for head-to-head daily moves is just like Beyond an atrocious way to have to play Fantasy Basketball but anyway that is what it is ah you game plan out in front on that try to get somebody that you know you go Sacramento for Monday Tuesday if you were just looking at next week so say You Gotta Buy Sacramento goes Monday Tuesday if you wanted to just get a bunch of guys that went Monday and Abandon Ship Dallas goes Monday Tuesday and then you flip off of those dudes for you know Thursdays and Saturdays because Boston goes Thursday and Saturday  Monday Thursday Saturday so they're not a terrible schedule for next week if Monday's not an overload day for you  so if you wanted to do like a Monday Tuesday back to back for Dallas Sacramento and then assuming you were maxed out on Wednesday go Boston or Milwaukee or a New Orleans look at Lana plays one of those down days all so  right they go Monday Wednesday Thursday Saturday so you could switch off to Atlanta at that point  and that's how you do it if you have a buy this week you use a bunch of moves to max out your Monday Tuesday and then on Wednesday you can you can use probably two to three moves if you really wanted to to load up on  Thursdays and Saturdays dodging Wednesday and Friday and then you use up the rest of your moves either on you know Saturday or Sunday or whatever it is to try to finish out the week strong and then roll into the following week but it's also worth pointing out nobody again next week for the second weekend in a row has a weekend back to back all right hopefully we were able to jam that out in 15 minutes quick question check now from the chat room thank you everybody for hanging out with with my younger son on today's show um sorry about the late start should we drop Gafford if it's a tight matchup or is he too good to hold its time matchup you gotta drop  I'd love to hold but maybe you can't  12 Team rotal league here we go I need to make up a ground in three-pointers free throw and field goal percent for a chance at first place would you drop Nic Claxton to pick up on Norman Powell or someone like that I won't drop in categories clocks and provides it sounds like you know that you could get away with it I don't know if you have any other centers that you could drop  because field goal I mean field goal percent  right that unless that you're talking about fuel  if you're not feeling field goal percent all socks and it's very powerful in that so I don't know if there's maybe a different option you can take but  anyway  please rank for next week Alvarado Jordan Hawkins Pac content in Jae Crowder Patrick Beverley it's probably  these are some bad ones probably Crowder uh Alvarado  maybe Alvarado first then Crowder connaughton Beverly Hawkins then Beverly is probably last there  drop Drummond for a two-for-one is that because Chicago only has one game left sure yeah I mean he's not very good so you're not losing much  is Westbrook an immediate add of your championship week starts April 1st ah no  I mean it depends are you competitive in either of the percentages  nah  oh let's see here best stream for field goal percent free throw percent in no turnovers yikes oh here's some options one game of Hong Kong or two of kornet O'Connor who just got downgraded to doubtful due to injury management so you probably got to go Cornett there  should I drop taeler Hendrix on Ella's to activate someone in the IR I would probably drop Hendricks because of the  Sacramento schedule is excellent right now Utah only has one game left this week and then they go all overload days next week so I'll take the guy where I can actually utilize the game he's playing thank you for the birthday wishes for my kiddo  would you rather have one game of key on our two games of Nesmith hmm  yeah I mean I guess that you two of Nesmith I'm almost always gonna go two over one and I'll Sacramento's got the nice back-to-back to start next week but if you're in a tight battle you gotta go with the guy having uh you gotta get the extra game  best pickup for a back-to-back today and tomorrow that would be one of the Celtics Pritchard or Hauser in my mind  prefer them over anybody on Portland San Antonio or Toronto because I don't know if anybody's gonna be playing on Toronto  best Portland player to pick up and hold for next week probably School  maybe Jabari Walker of all these fringy dudes maybe do all breath sounds like and my get arrested in there  with Larry Dunn for the week and it's my finals  whoops I just lost the thread there should I drop him for Uber or McConnell mmm  I'm gonna go well I mean a little bit it's about what that's your attacking um if you need assists and Steals on better field goal percentage McConnell if you don't care about your field goal percent and you want scoring in threes and maybe some blocks and probably a few extra rebounds then it's a break they're very different oh it's points League  oh go over a man shoot the Moon  shoot the Moon  homie I got Nancy and I hope things turn around for your sake  I told you man I don't know  I don't know  he did play though we haven't heard him being ruled out you asked me if he was gonna play in the back-to-back and I said I thought he would he was awful but he you know played in the front end so  hopefully I get that right is Marvin Bagley a start all right like to see one game first  trayce Jackson Davis Sam Houser Jayden Ivy or Delano Banton tonight or should I risk adding Nas Reed I'm gonna go points League I'd probably go  I've I think houses are going to have a nice ball game man alive that's a tough one I probably go Ivy but this may be a better question for a DFS or  points leagues  not all heroes wear capes I'm assuming that's for me thank you  should I add Santi aldama or herb Jones for the next week or so her because they've got that great Tuesday Thursday Saturday schedule  Tobias Harris or trayce Jackson Davis or Ochi abaji or Sam Houser for the rest of this week two games I think for everybody there  oh boy  honestly goodness I don't know isn't to buy a Sarah's questionable if he's playing I'm probably going to buy us I hate nazre back so they go that's good news  he just got ruled in about a minute ago  fun fun for a dun dun dun dun dun dun  good news on the nas read front  if demise playing I probably just got to go to I know he's been awful lately but I probably go to bias  I've seen if you need field goal percent in blocks you go Jackson Davis you need three go houses if you need like the safe floor but no upside to go abaji and then Harris is the guy you're sort of like praying he gets pulls himself out of his little Funk probably to buy us if he's in but yeesh is Caleb Martin a drop for Payton Pritchard well you're only getting  you're not adding any games there so I don't like this move because you're going from two games this week to two games this week  if you can find somebody to drop that only has one game the rest of this week or none that would be the way to go  oh nerdy nerd I know you know I know you're messing with me  all thousand points League should I risk getting Nas yeah grab Nas man you just got ruled in let's go hot damn it's not it's time  no show tomorrow  celebrating my kids birthday tomorrow  two days early and actually that's not true we might have a show in the morning if my older kids little league game gets rained out so that might have a makeshift show like this one
