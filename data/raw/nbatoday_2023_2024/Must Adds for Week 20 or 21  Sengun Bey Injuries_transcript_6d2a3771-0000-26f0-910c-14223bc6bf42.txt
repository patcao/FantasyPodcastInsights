welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast yellow  what up  it's a new week I hope you guys are all surviving your fantasy teams are okay  made it to the next one I have three head-to-head leagues that are in the playoffs right now and all three teams survived I got a little lucky mind you  sometimes it's better to be lucky than good  one of them I think I would have won two out of the three even without profound luck the third one I don't think I would have made it I got very fortunate in that one my opponent lost Tyrese Maxey  and Wendy who didn't play what much last week and he played like one out of their three games or something  I probably would have lost that week if that dude didn't lose  two of his top three players but you know what  so it goes with head-to-head playoffs it's pretty much comes down to which team can stay healthy and maximize games played so we skirt through we moved to the next one and we'll do two shows today to address that type of stuff this is the weekend review show so we're gonna be going through all the ads for this coming week based on longer-term needs so someone that you'll have for this two weeks whatever it is you're looking for that bang for your buck kind of guy that's what this first show is about and then we'll have our quick afternoon weekly preview because it's Monday but basically a streamer show that gets you situated for how to attack whatever you want to call this week  some websites call it weak 20 technically it is actually the 21st week of the regular season because the All-Star break  even if fantasy sights Call it one period it's actually two weeks of real life I'm fairly certain they were 14 days in there so it's technically weak 21  whatever  playoffs not playoffs Roto whatever format you're in we're gonna try to break down all 30 teams on today's show and get you situated for basically what's going on with them this is this is a reset before we dive in because these longer shows these are an opportunity to do a little bit of promo want to again welcome everybody to Fantasy NBA today this is a sports ethos presentation I'm Dan best price you can find me over on Twitter at Danvers d a n b e s b r i s many of you are watching with us live over on Twitter right now so make sure to like and follow if you're over there like And subscribe if you're on YouTube and rate and subscribe if you're checking us out after the fact on a more traditional podcast Channel  also shout out to our baseball draft guide and the baseball team under the leadership of Joe Oracle they have been dominating the fact that we've got this new division up and running is incredible this is basically the third year that baseball has existed in any capacity at sports ethos second year that it's had kind of a legitimate fantasy presence and now kind of the first year that it's really been a full marketing Blitz and we've added a draft tracker and Joe put out his projections this year it's well worth signing up for the MLB pass and also I've been told that the offer for NBA Subs to extend their subscription to the all-sport for just one dollar to upgrade that got extended through today that's what I've been told so uh lots of reasons to go check out what's going on over at sports ethos and now we can talk about our show for The Day news of the morning and I've had this up on the screen here to start the show saddiq Bey  torn ACL the initial note on him was a knee hyper extension obviously this is much much worse than that he will miss the rest of this year and by all accounts most of next season  rough break for saddiq Bey who actually had been kind of a teetering on the brink of fantasy value all season long he was kind of in the doesn't matter Club until Atlantis started losing bodies here and he actually was putting up some kind of decent numbers of late but I've seen you can drop him there is no clear add in Atlanta despite the fact that both Bay and Jaylen Johnson on the wing are out and of course Trey young is still out in the back court there's just like  a thousand things going on with that team and  there isn't someone that can just step into it  which feels kind of insane but like that's how it is so keep an eye on Garrison Mathews more than anything else vidi I think also he got a start I believe in that ball game yesterday he started at three points and three assists though in 22 minutes I  you know overextend yourself or anything and it's possible that nothing ends up coming out of this  what they really need is for on Yoko Kang woo to come back because now he and Clint capela basically gonna have no choice but to play side by side so that's green that's good news for both of those guys as Capella's minutes caps slowly getting lifted up he's around 26 now Bruno Fernando is putting up some kind of marginal numbers in 20 to 22 minutes of all game but I don't think you can take that plunge unless you really had to  and Atlantis schedule isn't very good to start this week either if that's kind of a thing that you're dealing with but yeah unfortunate news certainly out of hawks territory as they just keep losing starters they're down three of them now  and  you know the the magic of NBA of the play in tournament is that Atlanta despite being six games under 500 is actually still the 10 seats so they have this fleeting hope of getting Jalen Johnson and Trey young back and then making a run at it I don't know what that run would look like but six games under and in the play in he's just a little top-heavy this year guys  that will  so that's the news out of Atlanta and that means that we can now start to look at just kind of the overall card and and what everything means so let's Go reverse chronological lightning round style we will begin with yesterday and we will move our way through the card you can see it I was looking at the Atlanta Hawks box score as the the last dot before going on are  now let's dive in Milwaukee beat the Clippers this is a back-to-back after noon situation for La so they sat Kawhi Leonard and Paul George  there's really nothing on the Milwaukee side no changes just Malik Beasley continues to be a three-pointers stream for Chris Middleton it sounds like he's actually getting kind of close but if you're in your playoffs you can't  like speculatively add someone and hope that they play you just you have to be getting something if you're enrolled and somebody happened to drop Middleton or if you're not in your playoffs yet which some leaks are still  it's unfortunate but some leaves are still rolling like that that's a situation where maybe you could look at Middleton but I I told you guys to avoid him from the very first day of this year and I really haven't moved off of that position as far as the Clippers go I don't think there's going to be another game coming up in at least not in the near future where they sit both Kawaii and PG but should a game surface where that happens Norman Powell is the obvious play dude took 21 shots he'll have to do a lot of the offense James Harden was bad so that also kind of made forced to other people into doing a little bit more stuff zubats takes a few more shots  a mere coffee and Terence man or kind of like the next tear down Clippers have this really good schedule run going but you kind of knew that with that that afternoon thing going on they probably weren't gonna have their their studs play all five of these games  you might very well see this Duds play the next three though they go tomorrow and then they go Thursday Friday so Clippers still on on in the middle of a better scheduled stretch this is sort of the lightest day of it  in terms of if you were going to like start grab a Clipper or whatever but you know you don't need to take that plunge because their guys are gonna be back for the next one so let's just keep moving  Indiana Aaron neesmith 37 minutes that's a team High more even than Tyreese Halliburton  and for me Smith we just kept calling him a soft hold a please try do what you can and then Benedict mathur and went down and it was kind of like oh well now they're gonna need nice myth that just play every damn Wing minute and he pretty much did I mean 37 like I get it it's not Tom Thibodeau 43 or whatever Josh Hart's playing these days but that's so many minutes now for Nesmith that even if he's not doing stuff on the basketball court he's still gonna kind of have to be doing stuff on the basketball court I know it's a weird nonsensical way to say it but like even if his usage is super low even if he seems somewhat disengaged if you play 37 minutes in an NBA game you're basically guaranteed some kind of fantasy stats so now  because of the math and injury any Smith ends up being a pretty good hold  now he's a stronghold instead of a soft one  also of note not picking up obey top and he had a better ball game here but you're not adding him TJ McConnell who we talked about last week as a guy who actually been playing pretty damn well of late Indy has a back-to-back tomorrow if you're looking at it from that perspective if you're just looking at it from kind of the overall perspective McConnell had one  resounding dud in the middle of what's otherwise been a very solid stretch for him that's now lasts about two weeks he's top 70 over that that time span  just a 12 minute game against Minnesota he didn't have it but otherwise the numbers have been excellent and you can almost go back there's more than two weeks now February 22nd so it's more like two and a half weeks almost three not quite where he just started putting up numbers  in 20 minutes it was just like a go get them moment from McConnell  so again Indie schedule a little bit weird they're off today they got the back-to-back and then they go one time in four days after that so there isn't really a long-term play here but if you're putting out a Craigslist ad for assistance Steals on good field goal percent McConnell's Your Man  don't expect him to score double digits every ball game though that even even on this little mini heater he's on that's still been a bit more rare but the assistant the steals have not been rare he shooting 60% over those last two and change weeks that'll get it done and he's you know specialist appeal but good enough  and the math basically tells us that he's been  playable enough in the other categories where the good stuff is currently outweighing the bad  or land oh that's a team where a bunch of bad outweighs the good on the fantasy standpoint France Vagner is literally the only nine category player you've been able to use on that team all season long Paulo continues to be a very solid points League option  call Anthony was better in this one but who cares you know no Markle faults in this ball game no Jalen Suggs in this ball game Wendell Carter Junior happened to play I guess a little bit better at 15 rebound so he saw a few extra minutes but he had mogra a pretty much splitting the center minutes these days it's a mess don't do it don't take the plunge  and a bad schedule the boot  wizards they just keep losing bodies down Marvin Bagley down Rashawn Holmes in this one now lost Landry shamet who no one really cared Bilal Kula believe made it pretty much to the end of the Ballgame but then tweaked ankle and he's questionable  the good news I guess is that with all these guys out a really shortens up the rotation they pretty much only played six guys in that ball game Jordan Poole  got into foul trouble he had five fouls and 22 and a half minutes he just sort of didn't have it bench pool as a start these days though cool if he happens to play in the next ball game and I know I've been pretty much out on him all season long but I you know similar to the Aaron Smith thing if you give him 37 minutes  you probably can play him  he's the only one that becomes borderline for me but like tyus Jones and massive minutes Denny obviously a massive minutes kuzma massive minutes kiss bird is very much as start when he's in the starting five and then bench pool is a start as well so the Wizards he thought the regulars were going to be the guys going down and it's the Irregulars I feel like I'm talking about bowel habits on the Miami side bunch of guys did some stuff  and I don't really care I make as was okay Caleb Martin was decent again Nicole the yovich actually had an okay line  I want nothing to do with these guys outside of when the schedule allows for it and it did last week Miami had four games over the last six days of last week so that's fine but now a lot of these these dreamers they're all off two days  Miami schedule does get a little bit better towards the end of this week if that's the direction you're looking but again we'll cover that stuff on the streaming show later on today as far as the you know the every day years that's what this recap show is about the everyday is on my Miami right now are Rozier Butler bam and then Duncan Robinson is the Tyler hero filling every day or  other bad news from yesterday and addition to the deep bass stuff I threw this unique new up on the screen to start the show basically because woj had just tweeted it out a couple minutes before we went on air but from last night output and Shen badly injured towards the tail end of this ball game he did manage to make it through most of it so at least from that standpoint you got an okay line before the damn Sky fell on you we don't have an official report yet but the dude was wheelchair off the field so  not good  not good on the shengwen front  there are a few possible ads here  assuming he misses three weeks or more  those possible are Chuck landale  Jeff Green  and then the young guys either I'm in Thompson or Cam Whitmore or possibly both or whatever  Shane you're not just taking minutes off the board and this is something we've talked about more lately than we did early in the season just this idea of like what is role really because there's opportunity there's minutes there's a lot of ways to kind of handicap a card  shingles playing 32 and a half minutes which is not a colossal number for a starter but it's traditional starters minutes but more than that you was taking almost 16 shots a game and had five assists so the offense was heavily run and five and a half free throws by the way the Evans was largely running through Shen and Freddie Van Fleet this year  by the way if this is the end of the season for him he'll finish at number 61 and 9 cat with 63 games played I don't want to get too far out ahead of myself but it's a possibility  but then you think about it kind of from the ad standpoint like do we really think Houston is going to be comfortable playing jock landale 30 minutes a ballgame I'm inclined to say no  now shengwen hasn't missed many games this year I think he missed like two you well how many games has used in played  64 any what did I just say 62 no 63 he missed one damn ball game this year so we have almost no data on what  landale gets to do I'm not even sure Jack was healthy for that game that Chen goon missed  but most importantly  he really hasn't played more than teens in minutes  at all this year  and he's a serviceable backup played 19 minutes I think like the second or third game of the year and I had four points and five rebounds  Land Hills best game of the season was probably this last game he got 17 and a Half Men it's so that was again a little bit higher because Shane gun was out and he hadn't nine points five boards for assisted a block but they're not gonna run the offense through landale he's not going to get for assistance ballgame  and frankly I don't know that he's gonna get more than about 22 to 24 minutes of ball game which in my eyes isn't enough because then you've got Uncle Jeffy Jeff Green will probably pay play 10 to 15 minutes and then there will probably be some kind of a stretch eight minutes five minutes six nine I don't know where Jabari Smith Jr is playing Center and the rockets go small  so in that case you'd probably see either Ahmed Thompson or Cam Whitmore pick up an extra is gonna be all of the minutes where Jabari Smith Jr I don't know but does Thompson go from 20 minutes to 24 just Whitmore go from 1718 minutes to 22  or just one of them soak them all up does it end up do the Rockets end up going bigger  they might have to but I'm in times is actually pretty big guard mind you so do you go  do you give almond 26 minutes  because if so then he's the grab  I don't think there's almost any way that Jacqueline Del sees enough playing time to be a 12 team or I know there's almost no chance Jeff Green dies  and then so the guy that I'm staring at I think we should all be staring at is I'm in Thompson because we've seen him do it in 24 25 minutes and it feels like he could get for or five of Shen's minutes and maybe a few of his touches even but is it going to be Thompson one day and Whitmore the next how does this whole thing shake out  if you're looking if you got a dead weight player on your Roto bench you could probably drop them for I'm in Thompson just see how the next ball game goes if you don't have any dead weight then you kind of have to play this one by ear a little bit  or I  no thoughts on the Kings keep playing Malik monk he's been hot Kevin herder is not  that's it  taking Murray tweaked ankle but he's a tough nut I'm gonna I'm expecting him to play in their next game I guess we'll see  New Orleans Nas the Pelicans go or as Trey Murphy goes to Pelicans go that's sort of the way things have worked for them Trey is volcanic hot lately he is surface of the Sun hot and so the Pelicans are winning all of their ball games it doesn't hurt that they played a Hawks team without Trey young without Jalen Johnson and then without Sydney Bay part way through but Pelicans are beating everybody right now Jonas Valentine's has become  a bit Expendable because of how free and easy they are now scoring the basketball if Trey Murphy ever cools off you're going to see JVS minute it's actually come back up I know that seems sort of counterintuitive but they can run a little smaller with Zion its Center and they can just out gun teams right now  when perfect cools off they're gonna need a little bit more size they're gonna need better rebounding they're gonna need JV to do a little bit of the scoring I think you'll see his minutes Trend up a tad and it also depend a little bit on the opponent so don't drop Valentino's  basically from the time that nonce got healthy and the team got healthy he dropped from that top 50 play to more like a top 100 but I don't see him falling really any farther than that  sadly you're not adding Larry Nancy you guys know I love to add Nan's anytime I can but I think I've learned my lesson at this point  we already talked about the hawk so we can keep rolling past them Brooklyn beat these zombie Cavaliers right now 120 to 101  as long as the Nets have this  set of players healthy you start the starters which is Bridges cam Thomas Nick's in Dennis Schroder and Dorian Finney Smith you can start all five of those guys are all getting starters minutes and they're all doing enough with Finney Smith being sort of the  do I really want to wait this thing out because Brooklyn's schedule goes from very very good to a bit quieter here the next little bit actually gets better again in like six days but the only one game over the next five so if you're on the head-to-head side you could probably punt on Finney Smith but there is these guys are putting up giant numbers and if anybody else shows up then we'll reassess things again Cavs are the more interesting side of this ball game without question the more interesting side because they got all kinds of weird stuff going on and I'll in kind of a fun little twist for us a lot of the Cavs have already been ruled out for tonight  I say that's fun because at least we know what to do with it Donovan Mitchell still out back streus is still out Dean way to still out for the Cavaliers so you're pretty much have this iteration  which George nyang starting he's playable when he starts because he's just gonna be out there and away from three point land Isaac of coral is a much better sort of a cross the board stream Carousel only six shots in this game was fairly surprising I think you'll see him do more in the next one  you guys know I don't like Levert's Fantasy game but with this many guys out I don't see how you have a choice but to play him and so that ends up being a start the starter's deal for Cleveland as well  if somebody shows up and it doesn't sound like it's gonna happen in this one but if somebody shows up for the Cavaliers then you reassess  and they play today and then they play Wednesday and then their schedule gets light so at that point whatever sort of Fringe your guys out of like nyang a coral Levert if you're on the head to head side you could potentially move on after Wednesday but if you can squeeze another game or two out while everybody else is hurt oh the Grizzlies good Lord I mean it's hard to even keep track of who's in and who's out for this team they lost to the Thunder by 31 let's start on the Thunder side by the way because Jalen Williams had a pretty bad ankle tweak early in this game he did not come back  case in Wallace ended up scoring 22 Thunder have a bad schedule this week so I had to header as you probably don't do anything with it Roto  think I'm leaving it alone  I guess the question is will Lou Dort end up doing enough he made all five of his shots so this game  doesn't really tell the whole story do we think Cason Wallace is really gonna go get 14 shots in 27 minutes a game this skeptical of that all so  this is I got to see it once with the Thunder I got to see it against the team that's an actual NBA club before I go pick him through whatever carcasses start to surface there speaking of picking through the carcasses  Memphis  I like legitimately I don't know if you can trust anyone on this team on the head to head side because we have no idea who's gonna play on a game to game basis  right now Jerry and Jackson is trying to rack up some games played I still think he's just trying to get to 65 he's at 57 right now so maybe you get another two weeks out of JJ he goes down I think you could play Santi aldama  J Cole ravia is not too far off and I keep saying that but I like  24 minutes does not give me a whole lot of confidence in playing LA ravia and you're like oh Dan it was a blowout yeah but like GG Jackson played 37 minutes and Lamar Stevens played 30 Off the Bench  there is no consistency whatsoever they're just hunting for whoever has any kind of fantasy game available on a given night and if you've got a little bit of game you get to play a little bit more that day and that day only  GG Jackson had 30 points here he'd been horrible for like three weeks before this  like dance should I pick him up no  and then Jordan Goodwin will get a game every you know one out of every three because he's on a two-way deal  Luke Kennard played in this one John contractor did not  you can't do it  Jaren Jackson is startled  certainly for the moment cuz he's healthy  healthy enough I guess  Vince Williams when he is upright you play him  but if he starts to miss games here and there how we Rectify that on the head-to-head side  dejon Jarreau had a really nice game and I like I couldn't have even told you who he was three days ago  picking these guys up  just don't do it save yourself the trouble  Philly in New York I was fully convinced that this was the score at the end of three quarters  we've seen this score at halftime of a number of ball games 79 to 73  neither team broke 40% from the field the teams combined for 32 turnovers the Sixers shot 57% at the foul line this was ugly  ugly  shouldn't be surprised though Phillies down both beat and Maxi so it's just a bunch of  you know whose or what's its  but he'll hold buddy Heald know he came off the bench but he's a hold Paul Reed is technically a whole I'm kind of wimping out on starting him against a games cap but technically he is a hold right now I'm gonna say no to Nic Batum I'm gonna say yes to streaming Kyle Lowry he would have had more than three assists if anybody on his team could make a shot spoiler alert they could not  Uber as a go to buy a series as a go I don't like campaign in nine cat we've talked about this and that's where I'm that's where I am with the Sixers  even after a 73 point game and then for the next you know or a 79 point game for the next they got 73 if Jalen Brunson is even  anything but absolutely atrocious the Knicks win this ball game but he was absolutely atrocious  Brunson you start Josh Hart has played 40 minutes in nine consecutive ball games he's about to hit like he's gonna lose an arm in the next one and I won't be surprised even chenzo precious that she was with those guys are all so playing I'm not playing Jericho Sims  and I feel so sick to my stomach about saying it  stomach not stomach but you can stream Isaiah heart and shine spot in Roto or head to head because like Rodeo what's the point of just having him on the bench it's been a month and change now where he hasn't gotten starters minutes  Mitchell Robinson is inching closer that doesn't look like there's any change coming for hardin's minutes cap and I prayed to the good Lord that I don't drop him this week and then they're like oh by the way you can play 26 minutes now but we're just not seeing it and that roster slot is basically useless on Roto and it head-to-head you can find somebody better  now if the Knicks had a really good schedule I mean maybe uh they don't just a three-game week this week and next week and last week they're in a light light scheduling area  which at least means he won't get a back-to-back off but I I mean it kills me to say it but hardened does not need to be on rosters right now  it's too much of a pain in the butt  Minnesota was down a whole bunch of guys the key ones being no cat for the rest of the regular season no go bare for shortish term and no Kyle Anderson all so for short-ish term  if all three of those guys are out for the Wolves next ball game which by the way is tomorrow they're in La for the Lakers Clippers set and then they're off for three days  this is a tougher call to make I think on the head side that onto but Nikola Alexander Walker played 39 minutes he's very much a start if all of those guys are out on Tuesday nasri is a play the rest of the regular season that's an easy one Jordan McLaughlin at 4:30 but you're not doing anything there Jaden McDaniels took 17 shots which is kind of by Lakers design they wanted him to be the guy shooting I had a chance to watch this game I try to watch all the Laker games still have this fleeting hope that I'm gonna get back to actually covering the Lakers like three years ago or whatever it was um Lakers did a lot of rotating and often did not rotate to cover McDaniels they were like all right if anybody's gonna be taking this thing a better be you and it worked he was bad on jump shots terrific we are we're dog sitting my mother-in-law's dog and then that dog has a high pitched noise and then mine starts yelling  delightful  all right  come on dogs shut it up  I can't pause I'm on a live show they're both going nuts right now  screw it we're just gonna yell over dogs barking  this is idiotic  oh yeah yeah this is gonna be a long week in the best household  multiple dogs and Aaron sign up for this anyway because Minnesota's schedules terrible if you're playing head-to-head you're not gonna add someone today for just tomorrow if you happen to add someone yesterday when the news broke that everybody for the Wolves was out you'll hold on for one more day try to squeeze out that one more big one tomorrow and then you're dropping these Fringe guys because again the schedule just dictates head-to-head you can't do it Roto okay whatever fine like try to squeeze out the game if you wanted to hold on a few more that's all so fine provided you're not way behind in games played  and then for the Lakers Anthony Davis dealing with his shoulder thing he says he's still feels it like Lakers are all so a team in a really light scheduling stretch right now they're off until Sacramento on Wednesday there aren't any fringy players on the Lakers though we'll talk more about them that's just a team where you can't even take you can't even take a stab at a fringy guy and frankly the Lakers schedule is so bad over the next 13 days you might even consider dropping some every day years  like Austin Reeves is very good he's been you know 85 range all year but 85 range with this type of schedule might not cut it  it's four games over 13 days right now people that's almost two two-game weeks in a row  dogs  you know hide him in another room for tomorrow's live show all right that was Saturday we still got a couple more days to cover although a lot of teams played on Saturday so that at least took care of that part of our business I want to quickly remind everybody since a lot of

Saturday's card Chicago they played the Clippers is the Clippers when they were healthy and you don't really do anything besides the big neighbors there and then zubats is kind of like your third string Center for Chicago start the starters  we are inching closer to an Andre Drummond game for whatever that's worth uh once the next I think I said it was like in the March 20th something range where the Bulls play a big team again  it is the Timberwolves and now somebody's here to check on the balcony I can't get through a damn live show YouTubers I need you guys to just wait for just a second I got to deal with the front door hold on everybody okay that was confusing where did we leave off right Chicago I was looking up when they play a big team again and it's the Timberwolves on March 31st but they don't even have cat anymore so I don't know if Drummond's gonna have another useful game this year  Brooklyn we talked about Charlotte they are also in sort of like a bonus zombie mode these days miles Bridges he's a go Brandon Miller's ago Nick Richards continues to be your sort of low-end Center fill in down Trey man these days on top of already being down lamelo ball who probably doesn't play the rest of the year and Cody Martin  so the city meets each is a start he's gonna have a fishy issues but he's a start because the sister just simply going to be high enough and you know again 30 some odd minutes it's a point guard stuff you got to give it a go  Grant Williams in the starting five I am lightly intrigued by but Roto and probably not using a grant Williams game against my cap it's just not fun enough and then Davis bertans is very much streamable on the head-to-head side right now but you are gambling a bit if you try to use him against a game's cap  make sure I've got all my tech going right right now after trying to pause and flip and do whatever Dallas Daniel Gafford time is back upon us thank goodness a perfect seven for seven from the field I know you're like it's only 24 minutes Dan why are you so excited that's all he's needed  he was a third rounder in 26 and a half minutes in Washington so what do we think in 24 minutes fifth rounder sixth I mean either way it's an everyday play yes there was no Derek Lively in this one so that was you know that helped him a little bit but he's starting now that's what I'm looking at so you're basically guaranteed 20 minutes which is probably top 100 anything beyond that is I don't say gravy because we were obviously hoping for more but at least these no longer a good Lord he played 16 minutes kind of guy  PJ Washington I mean I did tell you this type of game was coming and here it is  you know me I'm trying to soften my stance on just playing hot guys and PJ was super high I will continue I don't Maybe  I don't do it myself  that's what it comes down to I don't really play these guys that just sort of get hot it I screw it up for whatever reason I play them on the wrong days  I'd rather play the guys that I trust so for this team right now obviously Luca Kyrie and Gafford are the three guys you trust for Detroit us our Thompson left this game early with an illness but he's not on the injury report so presumably he'll be fine for the next one and Jalen Duren got ejected for two technical fouls so the minutes were all over the map James Wiseman played 30 that ain't happening again Simone funky played 32 started the second half in place of Thompson and I had 27 points on 13 shots that's not happening again all the funko's credit he's been a pretty good three-point shooter for Detroit but done really do much else managed to get a couple of other things because he played 30 minutes but again like you know 2425 minutes for him you might get points in the teens but the other stuff just isn't gonna be there I don't like Isaiah Stewart's Fantasy game so for me I've seen nothing to get me off of Cade  during and Thompson as the three guys I trust on Detroit Boston's rolling into a back-to-back I'd assume that at least some of the guys currently listed as questionable will indeed sit the front end of this Chris duck porzingis is missing games regardless of the back-to-back so do we finally see Al Horford play both I doubt it you'll probably get a Xavier Tillman game Blended in there somehow but he didn't even play in this one Luke cornette got the backup sentiment so is it is it cornet time if you're streaming a Boston Celtic over the next two days because I don't think offer is going to play in both of them I mean you might get like a 27 28 minute cornette game in Utah and altitude or I don't know we'll find out later on but they may rest a bunch of guys this is Boston's got a couple of tanking teams on this back-to-back Portland Utah it's a brutal flight by the way late into the night with the time changing all that stuff  and altitude there's no chance their regulars are playing both of those and frankly you might see I don't know if they're gonna rest half of them and each ball game or you know play them all in Portland and then sit him all in Utah  but that's why you look at okay look if we find out the Boston's sitting let's say Jalen Brown and Drew holiday tonight that probably means they're sitting Tatum and Derek white and Horford tomorrow which means that if two guys or three guys are down in each ball game then you actually do get some streams like Sam Houser would probably be streamable for the back-to-back Payton Pritchard probably for the back-to-back this is thinking more along the head-to-head side and maybe I should save that for the afternoon show when we know more but this is the kind of thing you can look at from a full season like overall standpoint Horford's a guy that you're playing against the game's cap right now that's sort of the only difference because we're seeing this is out  Eric Gordon played 29 minutes he ended up suffering a left knee bruising in this one but he was horrible anyway and you guys know I hate his fan is Fantasy game it sounds like Devin Booker is coming back though so Eric Gordon was going to be totally useless regardless the only question here is you know Phoenix has a four game week but it's a game and then a couple days off do you play Roy so Neil for one more day and then sort of think about whether or not you want to hang on to him as the lone like the sixth man you could probably play because even when Booker comes back O'Neill could still get 30 minutes pretty easily and that to me that's the only question you're sitting on with with the Phoenix Suns right now Spurs took care of the stephanus Warriors the good news on Steph is that they don't expect him to miss more than a couple of ball games they've got Dallas tomorrow I think he's out for that one they're hoping to have him back for the Laker game on Saturday of this week we'll see you know everybody always plays against the Lakers but you know looking at the warrior side and just a minute let's do the Warriors now so Chris Paul got the start they moved trayce Jackson Davis into the starting five to get a little bit of a rim Runner with Chris Paul for  for the screen and Roll It was kind of by Design so you could probably play trayce Jackson Davis for  I don't know I guess that would be one more game  two more  oh maybe they get stuff back for the Dallas game we'll see they got this person again they probably beat him this time we'll see when we supposed to be back for that game too  Brandon put Jim ski I think it's startable while Steph is out Chris Paul definitely is not that there was any question there Klay Thompson's a start Draymond is a start barely coming as a start we can is closed now 26 minutes they're easing him back in I think if we find out that he's good to go for 28 minutes in the next ball game you could probably play Andrew Wiggins but I might wait one more just to see but keep an eye on the starting five because it for Jackson Davis you're not playing movies coming off the bench you could probably play him if he's starting if you need big man stats and just hope he doesn't take any free throws because he went one for five here  I went in circles a little bit hopefully that covered the names for saying Antonio this was the the wemb and vessel list ball game and they won anyway  Devin was sell is like Wendy they they already said that they're hoping to have him back for this ball game tonight the rematch here with the Warriors for sale he yeah we did get the report he's probable that came out yesterday in the evening so that's good news so they expect to be back to full strength meaning you pretty much punt on whatever you took away from this ball game you're not doing that Colin stuff you're not doing Sohan stuff Malachi brain and has been actually scoring a decent amount lately but not nine cat killed in Johnson would have been the guy you'd consider with all those other dudes out but no Trey Jones was a guy you'd consider when guys are out so I think he probably pivots back into kind of the doesn't matter group Champaign no Barlow know I mean it like we saw with the Spurs were when vessel and we were healthy and it was basically those two guys least for nine cat  Utah they're in a weird their lineups are crazy right now Chianti George is a start he's back he's healthy from his illness that's good Jordan Clarkson you can start while marketing is out  sex in your starting Kessler's back so you can start him as well and John Collins those are the five guys I trust right sensible played 32 minutes again  with marketing and then Taylor Hendricks both out and I just can't bring myself to care  and three steals which basically floated his line here because the turnovers were bad field goal percent was good but I don't think we can assume that's gonna happen every ball game  so that's why I'm I'm leaning towards no on sensible here in the short term nuggets I have no thoughts at all whatever you've been doing just keep doing it kcp is in the doesn't matter group Aaron Gordon is more of a points League guy  he didn't play that many minutes in this game  blow out stuff keep it light  and then everything else is fine same stuff  Toronto Portland uh Toronto we just got the report on how many guys are questionable coming into their ballgame tonight Gary Trent just got added to the board with a groin issue that stinks that could keep him out for a few ball games troubling but I'm gonna sit on him in Roto quickly sit on him he's dealing with a sore hip hop hopefully he plays if he doesn't whatever even had to head I think you can sit on him Chris Boucher was the guy that I thought would kind of be interesting but he's questionable with the knee issue 31 minutes dude gets 30 minutes he's a he's a big-time fantasy start  well then you look around you see who's left RJ Barrett is probable he missed the last ball game with an illness Kelly Olynyk is not even on the injury report thank the good Lord so Kelly's a big time start and he posted kind of his first  fat juicy line here first of many I assume gradey dick played 39 minutes that's notable again it's hard to play 39 minutes and not post fantasy value which is kind of what happened to him but like look at Boucher and Trent or quickly or whoever these guys are out then you could even consider a great dick stream  but the fact that none of these guys have been ruled out long-term makes me somewhat reticent about picking anybody up using a weekly move here  or even on Roto like why am I picking up this back up if they might not even get to do anything for one ball game if you're looking at a backup the one I would look at is Boucher and then just hope that he's healthy  if some of these other guys missed time but Barrett comes back that actually I think puts a little bit of a dent into what Boucher did in the last ball game all so Jalen McDaniels there's a lot to kind of watching Toronto but I don't know that I would take a stab on anyone right this second it's 11:15 in the morning here on the Pacific coast we gotta get a report on these Raptors I gotta know when they're playing now when I mean I know when they're playing they're in Denver so it's a slightly later game you're not gonna get info on the Raptors until probably 4 or 5:00 Pacific time and then if you wanted to do something fine you know a lot of Rota leaks are not day of moves anyway so it's too late to do anything with it head to head I don't know how badly you wanted to do it because they play every other day all week meaning you can't even expect to squeeze a back-to-back out of this  Portland also a mess  all right so where to even begin DeAndre ayton is in Anthony Simons is in that's good Anderson came back he had 13 and 5 and at some point here he's gonna be asked to do a lot of stuff and then you're gonna have to weigh out whether the pros outweigh the cons on him and for Roto the answer is almost definitely know for head-to-head Portland goes three games first four days this week so  a lot of guys become playable and head-to-head and we'll talk a bit more about that on the afternoon show but who would I use among that group against the Roto games cap if nobody else is added back in like let's say Jabari Walker remains out and I think everybody else is pretty far away from coming back tibbles a play because I mean five defensive stats and starters minutes is pretty reachable for him for I think you can just frankly kind of expect  to money kumara in full starters minutes is also probably playable against the games cap although he's more of a coin flip and then Delano Banton is shooting a lot and he happened to do some other stuff in this ball game but at least for nine cat the bad has been outweighing the good for head to head  very much playable on the hot stretch do I breathe to drop Chris Murray's minutes dropped off here you know when they had five games in seven nights he was playable three games over four nights I don't know that I would add him now  but if you were in a if you were in a bind like if CD Bay went down and none of these other guys are available that's that's where you could potentially think about it and then our our weekly Adventure in did anybody not play over the weekend  and I think the answer this week was no didn't everybody go over the weekend  thinking back to all of our streaming shows  and I feel like I talked about how you know everybody had either one game or two game starting on Friday nobody had a 0 in there I'm pretty sure every single team played over the weekend right  yeah we got that right  all right quick check of the chat room to see if anybody brought up some players that I skipped over and then we'll wrap this thing up really big social media viewership today  you folks that watch on YouTube first of all thank you you guys are amazing but I don't think you get to see that number I can see it through the back end on streamyard and there's like 650 people watching live on Twitter right now so cheers to all of you  guess that all that all them tweet storms are finally paying off  is Conley a drop this week yeah you could hold through tomorrow if you wanted and then drop after that because technically if you take it in small chunks like you sort of little quantum  one game over two days is average and then they got one game over five days after that so  I think it's probably good to hold calmly on through his game tomorrow and then make a move on Wednesday and just so you preserve moves for later in the week but basically do I think Horford plays in the back-to-back I don't is Sam Houser a possible superstream Maybe who would you choose between Trey man and Jaime has well Trey man's posting zeros right now so kind of has to be a case when he comes back it would be Trey but I don't know if that's gonna be now or a week from now  uh doo doo boo boo boo scoot Henderson vs Banton points League  I'll go scoot I think he overtakes him and does some fun stuff  trayce Jackson Davis we talked about him  crunchy yeah he plays a bunch no guarantee he gets stats we talked about that earlier  I just I don't think there's an obvious add in the saddiq Bey wake which we talked about first thing on the show if you guys are asking about Zeke just rewind all the way to the beginning I was the very first thing we talked about  those if you guys that are asking about streaming stuff again we're gonna talk about that on the afternoon show  the schedule related stuff this show is more about getting you the best possible players so if you're like there's a good question here saying should I drop Daniel Gafford after Thursday  you know for this show the answer is no if you're like dying in your playoffs the answer might be yes cuz then they go two games over six days after that three games over seven though I mean that's not the end of the world so probably not  what about on Echo Congo so imagine him in passing we haven't really gotten a good update on him in a bit  um  I think he's more valuable now than ever if you can stash him because they really have no choice in Atlanta but to play Oh Congo a ton alongside capella when he comes back  but  you know the last news on him was Thursday and that he wasn't going to be reevaluated for at least another week so you can't add him now  and if you've been sitting on him you're kind of stuck sitting on him in another five days see what happens  oh let's see what we got here do we just get Boucher ruled out yeah Boucher ruled out Gregory Trent ruled out a manual quickly all ruled out that happened 10 minutes ago wop right in the middle right in the middle of the show  while being a hosted by dogs and people that need to do a balcony inspection of our apartment building well that's a real pain in the you know what so you probably can go gradey dick tonight if you want I thought we were gonna get an update until like six p.m. so early rule outs at least makes our life a little bit simpler yeah great addicts gonna have to play a bunch so but again you know bunch of those guys might be backed by Wednesday so don't get my thought is don't overextend yourself because you got four moves this week and I don't know about using them this early if you don't know for a fact you're holding said player for more than a day  my man doesn't watch the chat I don't watch the chat in real time it's too distracting I check it at the end here  is not read cool too good to drop yeah oh yeah I mean  you know if go bare and slow mo come back the nasri becomes more like a top 80 top 90 guy and then I think you could drop him after Tuesday for the one game in five days spell  but if if it sounds like gobert and slo-mo are going to miss more time than yeah not just like top 50 and then you try to hold him but  don't  like it's so hard you're in the playoffs you gotta advance  yeah oh and good point yes I mentioned Jalen McDaniels when we were talking about the Raptors 10 minutes ago but I forgot to repeat him now Jalen McDaniels should all so probably be worth a one-day look in quite a lot of formats all right that'll wrap it up we'll try to get an afternoon show going as close to after lunch as possible but my lunch is getting pushed right now I'm Dan bass this is fantasy NBA today thanks for joining us big big viewership today on all formats  a lot of you out on social watching these days so remember to like great subscribe all that good stuff  again two days we're doing them right now see you guys on Twitter in the meantime made it for now
