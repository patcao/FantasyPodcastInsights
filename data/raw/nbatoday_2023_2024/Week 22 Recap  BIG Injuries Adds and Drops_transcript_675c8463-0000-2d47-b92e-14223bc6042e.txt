welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast hello everybody weekend review Edition fantasy NBA today  may have bumped some knobs on my mixer here I'm realizing shows coming in  opposite of hot cold we're coming in cold today  there we go now I got the volume all figured out I you may have noticed  tidied up the facial hair mmm look at that little baby face look at that young dude  oh yeah that guy's not 40 until you see the  male pattern baldness don't  it's becoming significant and I don't like it  anyway I guess it's a show I'm a little tired today I'll be on with you guys the it's mostly just how much sleep I get on a night tonight basis but  we are we are deep into the fantasy season now real deep seasons are ending Rodeo leaves you come down the street you got 15% of the Season left we got injuries happening left and rights at least season in full swing which is why The Weeknd review show which is what this one is welcome to the week in review episode of fantasy NBA today I'm Dan Bass Pros at Dan Bass Pro on Twitter please do give a follow there  and a like and a subscribe and all that good stuff  this is why this show is actually a little bit simpler for me because this show we're not breaking down schedules that's what the other show every day is for  we have the show we're doing in the afternoon every single day every weekday we've done it I think for three weeks in a row now and I even squeezed a couple of weekend shows in three out of four weekend days I think that's pretty good for me  nice ratio  those shows are about schedule that's where you talk about the fringy ultra of fringy deep for ninji guys that have a good schedule  this show the weekend review  its kind of a safe space  it's a safe space from streaming  the streaming we talked about on the weekend review show is about a guy that pops in for an injury replacement opportunity to short stream someone for a big old game we're not worried about weekly moves limits here  this is geared a little bit more towards Roto or Head to Head weekly leagues are also in the mix  so let's get into it  we can review shows we cover basically last four or five days I know it's says seven but we don't really go back to the last weekend because most teams have played two or three times since then we focus on players independent of their current schedule so don't ask about volume  volume of the show you can ask about my voice but not volume of games played we're not doing that at Danbury at ethos fantasy BK which by the way we've been told will become ethos fantasy NBA during the offseason we're going to finally switch that up like rates subscribe check out the links in the show description  for  what do we got in there we got our partners we got our sponsors in the show description manscaped

you know how we do our Friday shows it took me two and a half minutes to do it with the music at the beginning apologies everyone a little bit of a slow start today like I said I'm sleepy  let's do it  we're working in reverse a little bit today is the other thing that I thought was worth popping in there we're gonna talk injury replacement level players first because it occurs to me that the way that I build this list I do the ads we do the holds strong and then weak soft strong and soft holds we do the guys that are nearing a drop or droppable  and then in the past we've done the injury replacement board but a lot of times by the time we get to that I've got all you guys going hey where the hell is  player X  and he keep having to say oh yeah by the way we're going to talk about this guy on the injury replacement board  let's not get out first today and probably going forward I think I'm gonna like this this actually makes a lot of sense to me I don't know why I didn't figure this out sooner  now you guys can see all the players that in my eyes  have not yet established themselves as a an everyday play when their team is healthy but our very much a play right now and you guys can yell at me about it all you want but like you know thinking back to Someone Like A Trey Murphy last year is a good example of someone I left on the injury replacement for the entire season  and this year  we saw when when the pills were fully healthy Trey Murphy was outside the top 120  when  uh Dyson Daniels went down he and Herb Jones each got a little bump that was useful they each picked up you know two three extra minutes and Trey Murphy got very hot which also sort of rolled in conjunction but  I had all these people last year yelling at me like Dan Trey Murphy is number 65 he's number 65 like yeah I don't care what I do dudes rank is I care how it happens and I thought like last year we never actually got to see him be a 9 cat all the time play he was a doesn't matter level play  before someone on that team went down  and this is not to say that Trey Murphy is this has nothing to do with what he is right this second I'm just referring to sort of why I might keep a guy on an injury replacement board longer than people want to see them there but you guys all take this as a slight it's not a slight it's just me being hyper organized so let's go through the injury replacement board and we have to pause on anybody we'll pause on anyone but I'm in Thompson technically in your injury replacement for Alpine shengwen who is out for the season so you know again you could just call them a standard ad but we haven't seen him do it when the team was healthy he wasn't he was getting 18 minutes a game when they were healthy  yes he's a play for the rest of the year so  anyway on we go  Josh Hart  with Julius Randle out  Deuce McBride  miles with ogn and Obi out  Paul Reed with Joel embiid out who again I keep having these feelings of like what when's the bottom gonna fall but he's been fine he's been okay enough  Kelly oubre with embed and Melton out sort of a double it's a combo platter there  Al Horford anytime any Boston starter is out and he's upright is a great play Payton Pritchard with Drew holiday out these days and then other guys are gonna sit during the back-to-back coming up so you get sort of like a again you get a little extra there Nick Richards  Mark Williams never came back  and Nick Richards hanging out in the doesn't matter Zone the entire year  Visalia mitsch with Cody Martin out and I had somebody come into my mentions to tell me that I was being too mean to message by saying he wasn't just a straight play  I don't know what it is that so complicated about this  an injury replacement  is a guy that you basically play  most of the guys on this list are guys you play right now because they're individual game upside is high enough to Warrant a start  like mitts it you're starting right now but what we didn't see was him being consistently good enough until Cody Martin got ruled out for multiple weeks  that is when Mitch moved from one good game out of every three or four to one two good games out of every three basically that's one took the jump forward just because  we want it to be true doesn't necessarily make it true now  I don't know Cody Martin is coming back this season  don't matter Hornets are way out of it there's no reason to bring anybody back if they don't have to  I think let's same story for lamelo ball probably not playing anymore this season and at that point does somebody come back let's say Cody Martin does come back and Mitch it's continues to have fantasy value great at that point you can upgrade him from an injury replacement to a straight play but injury replacement is a play this is not a slight on these players I don't know how many times I have to say that damn thing it drives me insane though that people are like oh damn you're being too mean to these guys this is not mean  this is just have we seen these players  post consistent every day startable fantasy value when the guy in front of them is not hurt is a healthy  and the answer for every one of these dudes I've talked about so far is no  Duncan Robinson couldn't do it when Tyler hero was healthy he's the next name on the list George and yang oh I spelled that wrong  gotta fix that one don't we yeah we're gonna fix that one on the Fly that is Jordan's neang come on best briefs get it together  for maxus  Simon  for us our topsin and there's an asterisk next to his name because fontecchio is hurt right now all so Oscars out for the season probably should have put that in parentheses as well if funk you can get himself back into the mix somehow he'll be a very nice fill in play I have Duncan Robinson on there twice jeez Dan you got to sleep more  oh my goodness geez best briefs  troubling today troubling  cam Johnson right now is on my injury board I don't think we've seen enough from him to say that he's better than a dozen matter level guy when that team is mostly healthy but Dorian Finney Smith missed their last ball game and cam Johnson exploded for a really nice one  key on Ellis with Kevin herder out don't care that he had a quiet ballgame yesterday as I specifically said on yesterday's show at some point he's having these six defensive stat games he's gonna get a game with only one because he's probably gonna average up somewhere in the threes  if you get six one game you're bound to get a 0 or 1 and another  and then slow-mo Kyle Anderson out in Minnesota with cat and go Bear Down  we haven't seen do it until gobert moved out of the way also so there's your injury replacement board and now you know where those guys are so if they don't appear on any of these other lists you don't have to be like Dan why aren't you talking about these guys and I always have to say yet talking about them yet all right here's the ads of the week TJ McConnell second reminder I think people have been slow to buy in on that I thought I was slow to buy in on it but I think I'm still about a week ahead of most people to say hey this guy's actually playing all the time McConnell's ago  uh solid numbers not spectacular numbers but you know between the sort of every day posting almost the exact same line of like 11 points and five assists isn't strikingly consistent 1613 1413 the points over the last four four one four six on the assist 222 and one on Steals and he's been you know right around 50% every once in a while he explodes pops off for a game you know 176 and 6 he had a 26 and 5 with 3 steals game mixed in there so you mix in two really good ones with like eight and nine in a row okay ones and you get playable  last 30 days he's number 81  and last couple weeks he's actually been better than that so McConnell he's doing in 20 minutes a damn ball game just sort of McConnell and Leash right now Santi aldama I  I can't possibly get this one right  no matter what I do I Can't Get aldama Right and timing wise because I was like oh aldama great guy to pick up after the trade deadline because everybody's getting shut down he's gonna do all sorts of stuff and then he just didn't like he didn't shoot in his minutes were all over the map  and I was like oh well okay maybe it's when JJ goes down and he had to cut a couple of decent games when Jaron Jackson was out but then he kind of disappeared wouldn't didn't take shots on offense again and now all of a sudden the Grizzlies have their main guys back and aldamas locked back in so maybe it's a focus thing with him where it's like oh we're playing our good guys we actually have a legitimate shot to win this ball game maybe I should go try and then over the last couple of weeks he's really kicked it into high gear and over the last single one week he's been amazing shooting 49% is at 19 and 8 with 1.7 steals a block and almost four three-pointers a game yeah a lot of that stuff is not sustainable but he's on a serious heater right now  and The Grizzlies you know if if we're all dhamma it's going to be about the simple fact that they're trying a little bit more lately you know Bane being back has been useful for the whole weird trying convincing people of that and Jaren Jackson is playing in most ball games against competitive teams I think that probably puts all dhamma back above the cut line but I've been wrong twice already this year timing wise on all dominant not whether or not he can put up some decent lines but exactly when it was going to happen  total whiffs  I was like oh great he got the whole front Court to himself and then he just didn't want to do anything and now it's like oh he's playing with all these guys that want the basketball and he's decided to rev himself up so I'll admit  I can't seem to get it right on when he's actually gonna go and take some shots but it sure seems like it's happening right now and if I get this one wrong again then maybe I should just be like you know what just do whatever anybody else says on all album because I can't get the timing right on that one  but we're close Jalen Suggs this is you know this is a little bit more of a heater play with sucks he's number one 13 on the year so you know average it all out any sort of like a king among the doesn't matter guys but over the last three weeks he's rolling top 50 because she's shooting 55% over that stretch a mind you fully unsustainable number for a guy who's field goal percent is typically not all that great he has dramatically improved his three point shooting this year he's up to 40% he's at 46 and change from the field but he runs hot and cold he got off to a start this year where he was shooting around like he was like a 48 85 splits and then he went through a long stretch where he was shooting like 309% and the free throw number came way down over that span and he was brutal  and he got hurt a couple times in there well the Steelers are starting to come back again because he's got his legs back I think he can kind of smell the Finish Line a little bit so this is a good time for an energy guy like Suggs to be in lineups because you're out of the Dog Days  energy guys get ruined by the dog days of a basketball season  and on Yoko Kung Wu is on the ads board as a bit more of a stash play because we saw in the last one he didn't really get to do all that much ah they're lost in Phoenix how many minutes that even get in that ball game 19 as line was okay eight and three with a steal in a block on a good field goal percent but generally that's not going to be quite enough  what I'm looking for here is can oh kongu gather a couple of power forward minutes and I feel like the answer at some point is gonna be they almost have to  like if Vitae is not having a decent ball game any play pretty well actually for the Hawks yesterday so he got a second most minutes on the team behind just Deontay Murray but like if Christy's not playing all that well or if DeAndre Hunter is having a I mean he didn't shoot up all that well yesterday but he was being aggressive and I think they liked that part then you'll probably see all Kangoo and capella play side by side a little bit he didn't yesterday that's the thing that would kind of unlock him  as it stands right now he probably profiles as kind of a doesn't matter range dude 100 to 140 kind of somewhere in that range  in the backup minutes 18 19 2021 that kind of stuff that that probably puts him in that one 30 you range  but if that pushes up to 22 minutes and he's top 100 24 minutes he's probably top 85 80 I think it's getting any higher than that but again kind of a upside stash but he's healthy enough to actually give you something in the meantime and if you're looking for guys in that doesn't matter group that have a little bit of upside oh Congo is one of those guys  strong holds these are the holds that I don't think need much in the way of explanation nazre if he can get healthy dealing with a head thing so we don't truly know  what the timeline is when you get into the Noggin stuff  hmm  no your guess is as good as just sort of pop back up again and then it's all good but I've seen when he comes back he's gonna have a massive role and if you can hang on there please try to do so Trey Murphy and Herb Jones are obvious old specially now with Brandon Ingram going down that of course is the big injury news probably should have started the podcast with that Ingram the initial diagnosis is a deep I think it's a bone bruise right  yeah bone contusion which doesn't sound that bad but those things take a while to go away he'll be reevaluated in two weeks which gives you what  10 days left in the season at that point I think exactly 10 days left in the season I think he's out for the rest of the regular season if you plays again it's probably like one game so Ingram probably a drop there is no corresponding ad with Ingram it's just more trade Jones and more or more Trey Murphy and more herb Jones  I in common I can smush those guys together in a graft one guys head on to the other guys body  kante George is a pretty strong hold I know he's got some holes in his Fantasy game that's okay I think you kind of just wanna ride with it and let the usage take over Denny Ave are holds because they have an opportunity to do a bunch of stuff Gary Trent Jr and Kelly Olynyk if we need to Raptors I mean if they have a competitive ball game these guys are gonna put up some big fat lines and they're doing fine even in massive blowouts Isaiah hartenstein is a strong hold his minutes of trended back up to towards 2627 that's a really big deal for a guy who was stuck at about 22 for a while Walker Kessler in Utah and Trey Jones who's kick things back up a click also by the way I think of Trey Jones kind of very different fantasy profile very different player obviously but onycho canggu and Trey Jones remind me of each other because at Baseline they kind of hang out in that 130 ish range and then once in a while if you get them on the right two to three weeks that's when they surged ahead that's when they push themselves up towards the front of that doesn't matter group or maybe even just slightly above it  and that's why if you're gonna play and again like with Roto you don't have to play those guys every ball game but when they get going  there isn't the right like  so compare Trey Jones to a Jeremy Sohan if we're gonna look at those two guys together  so and I I call a guy who's a stream only while warm player  and for me those are guys I generally just don't play Because when the bottom falls out  Kaboom it's rough  there's no floor  for a guy like Sohan or  it was another good example of this Jordan Clarkson when marking in was in there's no floor for those guys every once in a while they have two weeks where they're rolling like top 70 or 60 or whatever but then all of a sudden the cooldown  and they're back near the edge of the top 200 250 like it's a brutal drop off  that's why those guys for me it's like well I'm not gonna take a shot on them because if I catch him at the end of the heater they're gonna do way more damage than good guys like a trade Jones Kong woo  who else on this list might even profile in that range I mean Trey Murphy before anybody got hurt probably profiles in that range as well  these are guys that yes while a lot of the time they may hang out in that 125 130 range they basically don't go lower than that for any extended stretch and Murphy got very cold for a week or two so maybe that's not the best example but like  a bad stretch for trade Jones is one 50 which isn't good but it's not going to totally sink your fantasy team like a bad Sohan run which is top 25 can't even say top anymore that's bottom two 50  that's rough that takes your team backwards  so that's why I'm more willing to look at a guy like a trade Jones who I think you know settles in the doesn't matter group  but can push ahead of that as a stream while warm guys who settle in the 200 range and then can push up for brief stretches as well  the soft hold board you guys might have some arguments with me on this one that's okay I'll give you my reasoning on them and and you guys can take it or leave it soft told number one is Aaron neesmith who I honestly I just I feel like he's playing enough minutes where I'd be floored if he wasn't at least in that doesn't matter group and again that's that's why I feel okay with that because I think he probably is a doesn't matter level guy who can maybe push in front of it if things break the right way  Jonas Valanciunas who by the way I'm again I'm having a very tough time putting myself in people's shoes on this one because I didn't draft him anywhere but just knowing what we know about JV  you know this is this is me making a call from the outside so again you can listen to me if you want but if you're like Dan you don't have anywhere so how can you tell me to soft hold him  with Ingram going down I think you got to at least give JV a shot now to see if they start to run a little bit bigger at times want a little more offense in there at times  if they don't they don't and also you know Larry Nance tends to get hurt every couple of weeks so that's another reason to hang on there trayce Jackson Davis some of you guys might yell at me that I should have him more as a very strong hold but I'm not a full believer yet  he's been playing well  but I think sometimes we start to look at a rookie and see them playing well for you know whatever it is weak and a half and say  this guy's figured it out when we don't really know for sure if he's figured it out or not he's on a run of double digits going for six games in a row the rebounds and pretty good and the blocks have been better the free throws are really rough like real rough 47% over the last month so there's a lot to like about his game over the last month 78% from the field being one of them and the one and a half blocks  but full punt free throw is tough one to swallow when the other stuff is not Hyper Elite  now the field goal percent is Hyper Elite but the volume is not so I'm not all the way there on Jackson Davis I think there's a lot to like there but I just he's got to get that free throw number up into the probably the 60 range for me to really consider taking the plunge because again for all the goodies doing he's presently doing more damage  DeAndre Hunter is a whole and him having a better ball game yesterday made this call a little bit simpler I just I simply don't believe  the  I just simply don't believe that  Atlanta has enough offensive options with Trey young out where Hunter won't have a decent amount of things to do Bruce Brown is a soft hold I'm not as excited about him as I am about Trenton Olynyk but I think there should be enough here specially with quickly out also for toront I mean everybody's out for that team right now so they're ought to be enough and then GG Jackson you guys might be mad that I don't have him higher on the board but just because he's gone on like a three-game shooting spree is not a reason for me to be like oh this guy's magically the best player in fantasy basketball yeah he's running hot right now four games I guess four games shooting spree he's got what 19 threes over those four ball games  guys run hot and cold  he cools off it could get real rough he doesn't typically get much in the way of defensive stats there isn't a whole lot to float things there  rebounds okay for whatever we consider him Wing he's a wing I guess for that team but again it's all about threes and points for the most part so if the percentages dip there isn't that that hammock to hold him great opportunity in points by the way should mention that and again he's running very hot right now last couple of weeks he's top 50 because he scored 25 points a game with four three pointers on 50% shooting in 86% high volume free throws but those numbers probably aren't going to stick I know Captain buzzkill over here but the dude's shooting 44% for the year and 75% of the free throw line and even if you think those come up a little bit 50 and 87 on high volume  feels a bit of a reach  it's okay you can yell at me if you want  the I'm scared nervous drop board Malik Beasley I think he can probably drop there if you want to pre drop that's fine he's not all that exciting of a fantasy basketball player anyway and honest and Chris Middleton are both seemingly healthy enough right now so there you go Dennis Schroder I think a little bit of that sort of initial new team bump is wearing off and with Cam Thomas around I'm just not sure there's enough for Schroeder to do every day to balance out the fact that some parts of his Fantasy game are not there he's number one 57 on the year in 31 minutes of ball game 14.66 find the six assists or nice but there really isn't anything else he does that's been a net positive this season and I find it hard to believe that he's going to be doing more than that the rest of the way in Brooklyn so you know doesn't matter range is probably attainable for him but there isn't much room to go above that while that Nets team is mostly healthy right now and there is unfortunately room for him to taper off below that so not really a big dentist Rooter guy and then Corey kispert who I don't know what the hell just happened but he's completely forgot and how to hit a free throw  and it is fully sinking any chance he's got lately of having fantasy value I I really don't know back on March 8th he went six for sick the foul line and since then his games have been one for two one for two for two one for one heaven forbid one for two oh for two two for six last night  the hell happened  let's do it was an 86% free throw shooter coming into this season this series at 72  yeah  I don't know man  but you certainly can't play him if he's not a positive at the free throw line I was one of the whole reasons to have him on a roster you get decent threes on good both percentages but if one of those evaporates he's not even close to 9 cats startable like if free throws a negative he's way off the board  if you want to give him another game I'm okay with it because his minutes are really high right now with cool to believe being ruled out for the rest of the regular season and tyus Jones see out for the rest of the season or just or  indefinite either way these guys are out a bit so there's a lot of opportunity here for kiss bird and typically when he's played those 3536 minutes it's been good  but typically it's because you get a lot of Threes you get them on a decent field goal percent you know 48% from the field isn't bad  and on 85% battle shooter and that is bad right now  I don't know if it's a temporary dip or what if he's gonna come back and hit nine for nine in the next ball game probably didn't get nine free throws for three games but either way something's gone amiss array here for Corey and I cannot possibly Advocate hanging on while he's shooting this horrible  and finally the watch list which is our final board and then we'll do a quick check of the chat room to see if there's some players we didn't cover that you guys brought up Dillon Brooks is on the watch list he was actually in the midst of having a pretty good ball game yesterday before he got himself thrown out 23 points on 13 shots you know the issue with Brooks is daddy always runs extraordinarily hot and cold and so you need to sort of max out usage with him  he's number one 70 on the season taking about 10 and a half shots of ball game  because then shoot that well  the question I had and I don't think I ever said to pick him up the question I had was when Alpine went down was that 10 and a half shots per game was that gonna go up to like a dozen  and if it did go up to a dozen would that be enough to get him over the cut line  and the answer is so far has been a pretty resounding no  but I don't want to just assume that it's always gonna be a no so he stays on the watch list Jake labor is on the watch list he's been playing  kind of fine but he also can't shoot he's shooting 30 5% on the year and he hasn't had a game where you shot above 50% since March 1st since then 03347 30 451 and 30%  I like the the scoring has been okay he's been in the teens rebounding has been all right steals have been all right in there but when you're full basically punt field goal which is kind of what he's been over that stretch you need to do more in those other categories to make up for it so while he's been shooting horribly despite the uptick in points about dozen points per game five boards 1.3 steals half a block a lot of that stuff actually sounds pretty good but the 35% keeps him out side the top 150 so watch list for laravia in case he warms up  John Conger Luke Kennard or sort of like tandem watch listers for me I think with Roto you can just sort of play conchar as long as Cunard is out because we have no idea when he's coming back if he's coming back so contract would be an injury replacement I guess in that we're gonna sort of categorize him properly for Luke Kennard  and then if Kinard comes back then you put them both back on the watch list and say all right well now who comes out of this pack jock landale is on my watch list he picked up some extra minutes yesterday with Jabari Smith Jr and foul trouble it really does feel like landale needs  so he's running hot right now over the last two weeks he's number 75 because he had that seven block ball game mixed in there if you remove that one  which I know you can't just like take a game and remove it because it happened it's real and that's why he's ranked higher 21 minutes won't be enough long-term for landale  because it's probably not going to average two blocks in 21 minutes if you look at all the other ones and I get you know you look at it you're like okay well you know  maybe that's just the way he operates we'll have one block one block one block zero blocks one block and then boom five or six in one ball game  but there's sort of nothing to indicate that that's normal  and so when you look at what he's done over the last two weeks you get this weird sample size thing going on where there's one massive outlier in there  and if we don't see one massive outlier from him every two weeks then we know it's a massive outlier so yeah watch list  Jaden McDaniels is darn near startable with both cat and go bare and nasri out I should probably mention the fact that all three of them being down finally forced him to take their 13 shots in a ball game  and that's the key for McDaniels he needs to get over a dozen shots  when he's at seven shots again what the hell he's out for the season 8.7 it's not enough  because he's pretty efficient shoots 49% from the field 1.23 a steel 0.6 blocks done rebound or pass very much  so you just need more  you need that ate in some odd shots to go up to 11 12 something like that  so you're getting 14 15 points plus the low rebounds low assist and okay defensive stats and then threes go from one point two up to two  and it compounds  I think with all three centers out I would probably play Jaden McDaniels  I don't believe we have an update on NAS Reed  we did just find out that Gary Trent Jr is questionable so that could detonate a couple of my League's but no update on NAS Reed as of this moment but if all three of the centers are out for Minnesota and we know cats out for the season then you probably start McDaniels oh Chaya who maybe this one becomes more relevant with Gary Trent on the the questionable block if Trent sits you probably could play a bhaji I mean Fantasy games not all that good meh  and then Andrew Wiggins who I'm sure a lot of you guys are like Dan why are you being such a butthole to Andrew Wiggins he just had a really good ball game well  he's showing himself to be not  super trustworthy this year  over the last month he's number one thirty-five which puts him very firmly in the doesn't matter group and that's probably where he sits Wiggins as it doesn't matter there's a little bit of upside for him beyond that but we haven't seen it particularly often so I'm inclined to just believe that he's a doesn't matter guys this year pretty consistently it doesn't matter guy frankly  all right let's see what you guys brought up in the chat room what do we got here remember we're not gonna be doing streaming questions on this show  we are going to be doing questions about  well sort of more Roti type questions  but I'm see if basically I'm looking for any questions on players I didn't mention here's one I have Rudy gobert in Tobias Harris in my IR I can't get into the moves part of this thing  would you drop either of those guys yeah I mean once you get a report that's when you make a call like that if you're at by the way guys if you're asking streaming questions save those for our streaming show  okay we got a question about what to do for next week if you have a buy this week I'll be covering that on the streaming show either today or tomorrow fear not  Denver says the injury Thing versus ads is annoying semantics yeah but I have to though because here maybe I can explain myself to you in a way that makes more sense by the way this is a long time viewers so don't if people are reading they're like oh you're these calling him out no he's not calling me out this is a buddy  the reason I leave people on the injury replacement board and I don't just call them ads is because then I would have to immediately call them drops if a guy comes back and they're not good anymore I want people to know I at least I want I I can't assume that everybody's watching every single show I do if everybody was watching every show I do  then they'd be then I could call someone and add one day and a drop the next day and they'd be on board with it but if they don't if they maybe just watch the Friday shows it's like okay this guy's an injury replacement dude I need to be ready in case news breaks on the guy that's in front of them in the pecking order and so you can just you can plan out your whole year a little more easily that way so that's why in my mind it's actually really important to kind of distinguish between the two any thoughts on Isaiah Jackson for the Pacers well Myles Turner was in foul trouble in their last ball game and then Jalen Smith also is sort of in and out of  Health  all year basically so  you kind of needed a few things to happen at the same time meaning I'm kind of leaning towards a no on Isaiah Jackson sorry Jose I know you probably wanted me to hear a yes on that one  any schedule highlights for next week again don't worry we'll get into that on the streaming show  if Gary Trent Jr is questionable and doesn't play are there any ads I mean Obagi would be the closest guy you're my fantasy hero oh thanks that's nice  let's see here  lot of streaming questions lot of streaming questions  let's go on with Kevin Durant he's been number 26 player for the last two months you know I I think  he still number 11 on the year I'm not super concerned about KD I think these just kind of throttled down a little bit  uh  he had to do a light number 64 over the last month because he's shooting 81% at the free-throw line instead of 90 and is 47% from the field instead of 50 and he's not  quite as locked and the turnovers are at almost four per ballgame over that stretch  you know honestly like  a lot of it's just the percentages  the other stuff is not all that different and they got healthy Bealls been in Booker's been in Katie's been all in together they're kind of taking turns who gets to chill a little bit so it is what it is I mean he's still obviously in everyday fantasy player so  so it goes obviously you'd want him to be really hot right now if you're in your playoffs but this happens to be a little bit of a  semi barely little bit down stretch for him I mean 26 is still pretty good  so many questions about streaming  is Sam Houser back  I don't think we've seen anything yet today  yeah I got nothing on him now if he is back then same house would be an awesome guy to add to this board and frankly maybe he should have been on the injury replacement board up with that sort of asterisk like fontecchio because he's out and Boston's going into this back-to-back where they're gonna rest half their starters in one and half in the other and so if Hauser's in for either of those and he's a really good one so go ahead and in your mind just put Hauser on the injury replacement board but with the asterisk that he still hurt as of this moment  and so you kind of have sort of know no hope but to sit and wait on the injury report and again a lot of streaming questions I appreciate them they're lovely but this is not a streaming show  take them over and Discord maybe you guys can kind of help each other out or you can help each other out in the chat room or you wait we're gonna have our streaming show probably in about four hours from now subscribe and that's a way that you can make sure that you know when that show is going live my goal is sometime around 2:00 Pacific time give or take I will try to give some kind of warning on Twitter about when it's happening and then hopefully you guys can kind of come over and join it from there  those of you that are watching right now on social make sure you follow so that way you can all make sure you see that tweet when it goes out or come on over to YouTube subscribe over there that's a much easier way frankly I believe to do it so make the jump from one platform to the other or and I've said this before the easiest one  listen after the fact plus we get paid more for the ads on those traditional pods I know being maybe too blunt  but it helps pay the damn bills  so anyway however you take in the show obviously I'm extremely appreciative  it's been awesome the growth this year last year years but like  it's crazy how our YouTube's taking off how the pods taking off how the Twitter's taking off all that good stuff so thank you to everybody for all your shares and likes and subscribes and whatever you've done to tell people that you know  go check out our Pals at a manscape.com with promo code ethos 20 ethos 2-0 to get 20% off and free shipping I am at Dan best person on
