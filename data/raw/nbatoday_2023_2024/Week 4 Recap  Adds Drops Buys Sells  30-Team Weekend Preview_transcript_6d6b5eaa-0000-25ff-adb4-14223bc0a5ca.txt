welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  good morning everybody  Welcome to Fantasy NBA today this is the big Friday episode I am Dan bass at Dan best person on Twitter I'm realizing that my board is sort of cockeyed behind me today I don't know why  it is what it is it's cockeyed for Friday  you can find me over on social at Dan best price you can locate this podcast in many places depending on where you want to find it Spotify I tune is any place podcast can be found we're also live on YouTube daily these days  and it's been fun to see the incremental but also pretty quick growth of the sports ethos YouTube channel thank you everybody for what you've done to make that happen and thank you for tuning in and hanging out with us here on this lovely Friday morning Today's Show as you guys have all come to experience and know and anybody new that comes and hangs out with us now this is the big Friday recap we'll go through everything that's happened basically over the last seven days and list out ads drops holds watch list guys injury replacement names by cells we've also got segment it's pretty quick but we zip through it things that we're looking at in each of the 30 teams coming up over the weekend it's a little bit of a rehash because a lot of the names were watching or guys that we talked about during the first very large segment of the show and then of course if there's any time at all we'll do a couple of questions usually it's pretty tight here on this big Friday show so hopefully folks got their stuff in right when I opened the chat room you guys are the ones that are probably gonna get your questions answered if you guys have some big overarching questions I would  I would encourage you to throw those in there those are the ones that I'm more likely to do if I'm short on time stuff that I think that can apply to a lot of people all at once  but let's just go ahead and Dive Right on in again I assume you guys will find me over on social please do take five seconds just hit the Subscribe and like button here at the front end of the show it's super easy to do we've got a lot of stuff going on and I think you guys are going to want to be a part of it I am a low-tech user here on YouTube so you guys get a Microsoft Word document but it's got the names there so you can see what I'm talking about and that way if you lose track you'll be able to figure out what they are beginning with the ads  Derek Lively the second is the first name on my ads board and I went back and forth on this one a lot and I want to spend some time on each of the names on the ads list because there's a little bit of nuance to this  Lively is currently ranked number one oh eight and he's doing it at only 24 minutes per ball game  which and I've said before I said it a couple times I think even earlier this same week he reminds me a lot of Nick klaxon before he started to turn a corner  which again came with  additional playing time that was part of it  but also a lot of it with klaxon was just sort of the overall growth of putting the pieces together  the interesting thing right now is that Nick Blackson is shooting 62% from the field and 71% at the free throw line and Derek Lively is almost a flip-flop of that he's at 73% from the field and 64% of the free throw line Lively's field goal percent is likely to come down we don't really know if it's free throw number is going to move all that much but he's at 24 minutes per game he's at 0.6 deals 1.1 blocks Claxton limited sample size theater 26 minutes per game he's at half a steal and three blocks a night that's number that's probably not gonna hold but these guys have a lot of parallels in 10 points and eight rebounds in his 26 minutes Lively is at 9 points and seven rebounds and his 24 minutes  they really do parallel one each other and we always kind of need that was going to come into his own in fantasy value we just didn't know when it was gonna happen it was really hard to time  and that of course is the same issue here with Lively who's young raw figuring things out certainly the Mavericks best Rim Runner  with Dwight Powell kind of  hyper aging  that's a thing he's like that Robin Williams movie Jack  just got old really fast  which means that it feels like over time the Trust In Lively seems likely took to go up as opposed to down and I know that these rookies man I don't know if you guys could actually hear my neck crack there that was disgusting apologies uh yes there's up and down stuff for rookies  there's no question that that's gonna that's gonna creep in and be a part of it  but  the the best fit line the slope of a trust line for rookies is usually shallow and up  and I'll try to go opposite on myself so you guys can see it here on the YouTube screen it's it's gonna do a lot of waving on its way but usually if you look at like November the trust Factor here versus say like February it's usually higher  in February  does that mean more minutes for lively I don't know but if the trust goes up one would hope that the minutes creep up with it and he's legitimately right now within like  two playing time minutes of consistent fantasy value and so that's why I think you got to add him and just kind of hold on through the ups in the Downs here they're going to be some bad ones they're gonna be some good ones but it feels like at the end of it you're probably in pretty good shape  I put my battery Junior on the list I am you guys know I'm not the big Tim Hardaway Jr guy I just he's number 91  and it always feels like it's kind of hanging on by a thread with him he's hitting almost four three-pointers a game 19 points on 14 shots he's also shooting 91% at the free throw line which seems likely to come down frankly I think the 44% from the field probably also comes down when you consider the shot distribution right now for Hardaway it was a career 42% he has had stretches where he's shot 44 45 percent one of them was actually with Dallas like two and a half three years ago so it's not impossible to suggest he might shoot 44% for the year it's not impossible to suggest he might shoot 40% from downtown he's at a couple of Seasons where he shot 39%  it is probably impossible to suggest he's gonna shoot 901% at the free throw line it's all so what reasonable to assume his steals probably come up from 0.3 to like point five in 2017 28 minutes the Ballgame the rebounds do they stick do they fluctuate doesn't really matter all that much  he has carved himself out a nice little role on this team  of bench Gunner the usage is basically as high as it's been since he left New York which is like that's the good sign can he keep up for 14 shots a game will Luka and or Kyrie Miss enough basketball games to wear the I'm taking 12 shots a night will balance out with the 1520 games of he gets to take 18 or 19 or whatever it is maybe maybe but I think it's good enough right now to add and at least kind of see how it plays out and you know if he hits a prolonged brutal shooting slump then you probably move on from it  Bobby Portis is the next name on the list and he feels like someone that I almost could have put on the injury replacement board because his Ascent has not coincidentally timed with Jae Crowder going out for a long stretch with whatever abdominal situation and so all of us now pour this over the last three or four ball games his scoring is gone up  after  kind of teetering around and like the 11 12 points per game range by the way on the season he's at 13 but a lot of that's because his last three games he's scored 13 19 and 18 points and that's basically since Crowder went down  he shot number hasn't changed a ton over the course of the year it's up over the last five games which is actually a little bit longer than Crowders been a Hurricane  but his total shots this year is down overall  his total minutes were down overall until Crowder went down that's the big thing so forget about like how many shots he took on November 8th against Detroit he got 14 looks in that ball game you want to look at the trend line and the trend line here is Crowder got hurt and Porter's minutes jumped from like 21 a game to more like 26 27  it's been a significant jump like a 25 30% jump in his playing time over the last one week of basketball and that's exactly what he needed to go from that Fort that kind of like one 40 150 range to probably inside the top 100  and this could be a couple of months because Crowders not coming back anytime soon so Portis needs to be on rosters he was probably over rostered prior to the Crowder injury because he gets points and rebounds and people get weirdly  you know  gooey about those  but now he's going to get enough of them to actually be a nine cat guy in addition to like teetering on the brink of points League  talked about him on yesterday's show with Josh Lloyd Bogdan bogdanovich belongs probably calling him an ad is way too late to the party because he's been top 50 so far this year he's gonna come back to earth he's going to come back to earth but he's someone that looks like he could potentially if his knee holds up sustained rest of season value so he's someone that belongs on rosters I don't think we need to spend that much time on him because we have a lot of other names to talk about and there isn't a whole lot more to say about Bogdan other than you know 14 and some odd points two and a half boards three assists that type of stuff feels relatively sustainable for him  three-pointers maybe they come down if his shot profile changes a little bit I know he's making a lot of twos at the moment  that is a high percentage of them to sort of counterweight the three-pointers but again even if a lot of this stuff comes back it's not enough to push them outside the top 100 and he's always had the fantasy profile to be a guy inside the top 100 he just never been able to stay upright  so far he has  no keywords there being so far but you know whatever  Alex Caruso is the next name on the list so this one's kind of like a double whammy Caruso's number 75 in nine cat and some of that because his you know defensive stats are absurdly high and he shooting 61% from the field was just not a sustainable number some of this is because we've heard that the Bulls are exploring trades for Zach LaVine and if they're exploring trades for Zach LaVine that means they're all so quietly exploring trades for  vooch who I don't think he can be moved for another month DeMar DeRozan who could be moved any time they want and presumably this man Alex Caruso but if he has any window in Chicago when those other guys get moved and he doesn't then you're talking significant Caruso upside  he is  a difficult play in head to head because he plays himself into injury often  and he doesn't score all that much and everybody had to head is always looking for points for whatever reason but Rodeo specially games cap when you know he's healthy and playing he's a guy that is doing enough right now to where he belongs in lineups  as does the following man Kevin herder whose hotter than the sun right now he went from being in that one 40 range and now number 62 in this band of basically three basketball games where he's averaging like six three pointers and night  I just so you know looking back to last year on her he did finish I think he was around number 90 let me double check this while we're on air  where it hurt her finish last year exactly number 90  on 48 and a half percent from the field only 73% free throw shooting not a great foul shooter but he was at 15 points 2.73 boards three assists a steal basically on a decent field goal set and not great free throw now this year he's shooting 83% at the foul line is field goal percent is lower than last year the world hasn't really leveled off yet from a fantasy standpoint  there's a lot of low sample size stuff going on there's like 30 probably guys behind him that'll move up the board there's probably 15 20 guys in front of them and blah blah blah his rebounds are also up which I don't know that that's something that's going to stick  do I think he could be top 90 again this year yeah why not  seems repeatable Keegan Murray is doing more but it's so far like Harrison Barnes is the guy that's gonna do even less for the king's  it's not even really clear what Harrison Barnes is doing these days  so sure why not Kevin herder play him seems like a top 100 guy not gonna be a top 60 guy the way he is right now I'm just remember he had these runs last year too where he shoved his way up the board towards 50 and then he'd have really cold runs where he'd fall back towards 100 and he bounces back and forth because For Better or Worse he is a streaky guy  Charis Levert he's been a repeat offender on this adds board but I thought some pokes may have doubted it last week  the main guys in Cleveland are not healthy Darius Garland missed the last ball game Garland and Donovan Mitchell or each questionable for their game tonight maybe you have an update by the time you watch this particular episode of the show first of all cares alert has been like teetering right around the edge of the top 100 when the team is fully healthy which is playable in a lot of formats and then so far Garland's only played in six ball games and I think Donovan Mitchell missed what one game so far so  you've had five or six games almost half to this point where Levert has been able to play basically a starter level orchestrating role  his percentages are always going to tank you which is a  downside that just not going away with Levert any time soon but right now he's at 19 points five boards forest and 1.2 steals with two three pointers mind you and turnovers are not bad and so the fact that he thinks in both percentage is actually hasn't been bad enough to Sag him down he's number 80  and it just feels like he's gonna have opportunity all year so that feels like a guy you should probably just leave on your roster  keyonte George also repeat offender on this board he's still not inside the top 200 on the season and I get it like there's a lot of reasons to be super skeptical about what he's going to be going forward but over the last week he's averaging almost 10 assists the ball game while only shooting 29% what do we think's gonna happen with those  I'll Venture a reasonable guess going way out on a limb the nine assists probably come down a little bit but at the same time this is a Utah team that badly needed someone to just hand the ball to scorers in the right place and God loved him Taylor Horton Tucker could not do that  couldn't just get a guy a ball in the right spot couldn't just penetrate in Dish couldn't run a pick-and-roll the right way  can't take those things  right now he's just on the floor long enough where he absolutely must be on a fantasy team because a starting point guard in the NBA is hard to find and one that certainly one that excel's at passing over the other stuff has just a built-in value now what we don't know about George's where is the fuel goal percent going to land where is the free throw percent gonna land is there enough upside and steals to balance out what will probably be difficulties with field goal and or free throw percent  and is even really gonna be involved in the scoring side of things but all of those giant question marks like they're not necessarily going to be bad their question marks because we legitimately don't know exactly how this is going to turn out and if a few of those things pivots slightly towards the positive direction that he becomes arrest of season play to answer the question that I know is coming if I have him in a roto team I'm probably not starting him head-to-head I am  but if I have Montero team I'm almost definitely squatting on him to see what happens  last name on the ads board is Bilal Bilal  cool Billy  Kula Billy we're doing this together guys  he's actually top 50 over the last week but he's shooting 64% so you know that ain't gonna stick  he's at almost two steals a ball game which I don't think it's gonna stick but we do know that he has defensive prowess it's just hard to average a number that high  so the scoring is gonna come down the threes are going to come down the field goal percentage is going to come down  where does that land him long-term we don't really know and the Wizards are such a cluster mess right now like the largest grossest cluster you know what in the NBA so one we don't know what his role is going to be on a day-to-day basis we don't know what his role will be when Delon Wright comes back because that was something that had put  that had kind of pushed  Cooley as we started a column hula believe down the board a little bit not that he wasn't still playing but he wasn't getting like 30 minutes of ball game due to wizards ever actually let Ty is Jones play or is this actually more of a showcase to try to move him somewhere else mid-season folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown

is this team looming over a ball Club  you kind of have to take a shot on the guy that might get a whole bunch of garbage playing time  that's the story  holds these are the holds they are on the holds board because I think they're kind of tough holds but to me they're  need to be held on to because you're not gonna find somebody on the waiver wire who has the upside that these guys have that's basically why you're sticking with them for now because of either they've done in the past or role has been weird  and here's those names and I don't think we need quite as long an explanation on all of them because you guys know for a lot of these guys what they've been able to do again quickly take five seconds to like And subscribe in between category boards here on the show and please again do find me over on social media the easiest way to do it is actually just to do a Google search for Dan from Sports ethos or Dan from hoop ball and I'll pop right up there on Twitter be so easy to do  here's the hole I'm gonna read one two three four five six seven eight nine names right through and then we'll go back we'll loop back to the ones that I think require additional explanation here's the nine names on the holds board Klay Thompson Deni avdija tyus Jones Jordan Poole Daniel Gafford you may have noticed that four names in a row there are starters on the Wizards Josh Hart Jalen Suggs Markle faults Bruce Brown  I don't think you need an explanation on Klay Thompson because dudes been you know as high as a top 25 fantasy play in the past he's obviously not that guy after two catastrophic injuries but he was a top 55 guy the second half last year  and they're sort of no reason for me to believe that his leg got worse during the summer off  he just can't see a shot go in right now same with Andrew Wiggins that team is  in a bad way you may have noticed by the way that Wiggins is not not on the whole board  and that's because between Klay Thompson and Andrew Wiggins one of these guys has the fantasy profile to get to top 50 and the other one is a fantasy profile to get to like top 85 or 90 so which one of those guys you willing to take a shot on the one that can be top 45 top 50 if things break right  Denny obvious as a whole mostly because he's actually been able to put up go to Fantasy value in with the minutes bouncing all around so far so that one probably doesn't need a whole lot of explanation tyus Jones is a whole because we know he could be a top 50 guy if he actually got to do anything his minutes have been all over the map the Wizards just like aren't even let him do stuff is steel rate is down his assist rate is weird um he may end up as a drop and re-add later on but  not yet and then Jordan Poole you gotta figure at some point he's gonna just go I'm crazy I'm going to take every shot that they will let me take and  you know if that happens then you you probably want to be on board for the lunacy Daniel Gafford he's been a fantasy asset even in his weird minutes Josh Hart no explanation needed  if he gets 30 minutes he's a play he was top 65 and 30 minutes with New York last year the question is whether or not he's going to get those 30 minutes when RJ Barrett is back or if he instead of being a hold is an injury replacement name this year  I don't know that Jalen Suggs needs to be on this list he's been a little quieter the last two or three ballgames but overall he's still averaging over two steals a game while only shooting 38 and a half percent from the fields there's actually room for him to improve  markelle fultz is one that probably requires an explanation because he's dealing with repeated injuries now not a good sign but maybe at the same time it explains a little bit of his clunky start now that could actually be a part of it right now  so I would say don't abandon ship if you can stash him you probably want to stick with it if you can't I get it do what you got to do but I think if you could wait and see that one through he still has the chance I think a very good one actually to get into that 90 range and those types of point guards don't grow on trees and then Bruce Brown I'll admit is teetering a little bit for me just because he really seemed like he's doing a ton but he's number 106 and to me that's good enough to hang on to so just stick it out  oh I screwed something up on my my board here I was trying to separate each of the categories by page but I messed this one up  oh well here's the I'm scared or nervous slash drop board Andrew Wiggins has officially made the I'm actually very nervous here Zone  honestly well at least while Steph and Dreyer out you probably need to hang on just to see if this is his chance to wake up if he doesn't wake up while all the opportunity in the world is at his fingertips  that you probably have to drop it saddiq Bey has had two better shooting games in a row but overall he's a drop or what we can call a schedule play meaning when a team has you know three games in four nights or four games and six nights or something like that these types of guys are still playable slow-mo and Minnesota schedule level play and then Malik monk well I wasn't certain if he could maybe play his way into a role even when dear and foxes around but it looks like he's more of a points assists guy that you're gonna want to roll with when the schedule lays itself out right now as he'll go percent is very low he just hasn't been able to do enough other stuff when fox has been in the lineup and so as minutes have actually kind of taken a hit in those  at some point you're going to get the Malik monk Mega heater ball game  and then you're going to pick him up and you're  then going to get hit with the opposite side of that but  whatever  I mean you guys I think catch kind of understand how this one goes watch list names censor Dinwiddie is on my watch list he's obviously looked a little bit better here with Brandon or brain and Simmons Ben Simmons out and you know one huge ball game followed by a kind of a quieter one the issue that I have with Dinwiddie is that he takes a lot of free throws and historically he's been either a neutral or even slightly below neutral guy in that department and he's not shooting them well so far this year he's always been a bad field goal percent guy we just talked about Malik monk being points and assists only basically and that's kind of what didn't we just dealing with but  if there's enough for him to do and right now with Cam Thomas and Ben Simmons out there's probably enough to play Dinwiddie I just think when either of those guys comes back and I don't know that Simmons ever does but Camus is going to come back at some point in the next week or two  I think at that point Didn't witty probably doesn't have enough usage to Warrant to play even if maybe he does right now  Brandon put Jim ski is the next name on the board and this again maybe a short-term thing he's like around top 120 over the last week the stiffness Warriors  he's gonna do more in those scenarios and now with both clay and Wiggins struggling mightily  I I don't know that the fantasy game necessarily holds up full term he's sort of your hustle point guard where he's grabbed 15 rebounds in his last two ball games he has eight assists six three-pointers in those two games but only one steal  so it's just not really clear that he's gonna do enough fantasy wise but he does belong on watch lists because maybe the Warriors go hard in a New Direction just like hey give somebody who's young a chance to mess around a little bit see if they can hustle their Warriors to a winner too thank you 20 years old Brendan so  still room to grow it just doesn't strike me as probable  that Steve courage just sort of lets him roll outside of the game these games where everybody's hurt and the Warriors of lost five games in a row  similarly with Dario sharp on that team and I have a Warrior's on the watch list with Draymond suspended for another four ball games and stuff out I would guess another couple although I guess they kind of Hope him to have their hoping to have him back sooner I don't know  like some of it depends on the opponent  charges gonna see more playing time here with Steph out because they need a little more offense as opposed to someone like Kevon Looney who I think will play more when Steph comes back so could you try for the games that Steph and Dre are out  yeah you'd probably be able to wiggle top 100 out of him maybe top one ten  but as soon as death comes back I don't think there's going to be enough left for sharks to do  Maybe I'm Wrong maybe he still continues to get you know mid-20s but he's not a  break the bank kind of name and neither is Cavani who usually steps up when Draymond is out but that is often  sort of contingent on Clay Wiggins staff being in there and serviceable and Steph is not in there and Clay Wiggins haven't been serviceable so Looney hasn't been that good either  so all these guys are kind of watch list for me right now I don't think that I can pull the trigger on any of them and then maybe the most obvious watchlist name we've had in for two and five years running now at this point is Jonathan Isaac who I just flipped past on YouTube for some reason I think his number one 22 over the last week and only 16 minutes of ball game I can continue to Mike just the one single solitary point if Jonathan Isaac hits 20 minutes for any reason at all  he's an ad  cam reddish is on my watch list he's been on a steals tear for the Lakers but I also think that as soon as Jarred Vanderbilt and or Gabe Vincent show up that that probably puts a hole in it and there's no guarantee that he's gonna get three or four steals at any given ball game and the other ones it's just okay can he hit some Corner three-pointers  they are putting a lot on the line there with the reddish add  miles Bridges he's I put him on a watch list I know a lot of analysts will probably just have them on their ads board but you know what I don't care because  I'm trying to win this year without Myles Bridges  you don't have to do it that way I get it if you want to pick him up this would be the time to do it because he's coming back but I don't want to do it  Marvin Bagley and Isaiah Stewart or on my watch list neither one of them is able to solidify his body even when jaylen's been out so fat Jordan Hawkins is on my watch list I think a lot of analysts probably have him as an obvious stream but in nine cat he's been outside the top 125 over the last week he's shooting percentage is the big sag so if you're punting field goal it's very different story if you're in points it's a very different story if you're a nine cat and you're trying to Winfield percent he's been basically doing more bad than good during his fill in time this is something you have to be aware of  and then half the Grizzlies is the next name on my list because I couldn't think of a better way to describe it  Marcus Smart is going to be out Jaws still out the team is in disarray can JJ wake up  what about Santi aldama he's one of the guys that has interesting fantasy appeal David Roddy actually has fantasy appeal but will any of them actually have  a job consistently on this team I mean obviously JJJ will  so let's watch let's find out Grizzlies are to me a team to watch I think they're off again and then they have a back-to-back coming up  I believe  but there could be something there  here's the injury replacement board Duncan Robinson is locked in as a Tyler hero replacement Reggie Jackson is right on the borderline playable in all formats as Jamal Murray replacement is also kind of borderline but I think he's a go because generally hunting point guard stats is a good thing to do Malcolm Brogden scoot both out on that one Jonathan kaminga is a hard maybe I honestly I don't know why he's not on the watch list I put him in the injury Replacements because I guess I was feeling saucy when I wrote this up but he is also someone that I probably would just see how it goes first it was a weird decision by me what were you thinking Dan  Al Horford uh porzingis might be back so perhaps this one falls on its face before it has a chance to run but we did get to see him put up a big line last time and you know personas is gonna miss some other game this year Nic Batum was hoping to be back and only two games out it sounds like he's gonna miss at least one more so Rob Covington who played 30 some odd minutes in the last one and if he can get anything remotely close to that he's a massive fantasy guy Alec Burks I put on the injury replacement board and said just the traditional ad board because I do think his role dries up when boy on bug zdanowicz comes back which is supposed to be in the next couple of weeks but I'm good with it for a week or two and then Dyson Daniels who I know everybody's talking about Jordan Hawkins but Dice and Daniels is the guy for me man he's inside the top 80's last week since he's moved into the starting lineup I love the steals I love the boards I love the assists I love the fact that he's not going to completely detonate your percentages  friends I'm becoming a Dyson Daniel so file  like my Aussie listeners are probably happy to hear that  I like him way more than Jordan Hawkins in nine cat as you're filling  is I think the PALS like what he does defensively and just sort of two orchestrate it's a bylaws and some sell highs I know we talked about a few names earlier this week and a lot of them have actually already cashed in our Bi-Lo show from earlier this week on guys like Brooke Lopez and Dame I think there was one other that also hit sell High yesterday that was later in the day so that one hasn't fully clicked yet so I those names actually think ported it over pretty well the Buy Low board is Jared Allen who event at some point the minutes cap is coming off Walker Kessler who I think everybody has forgotten about because jonte George got in there that's all anybody's talking about in Utah but counting George seems like  a perfect guy to help Walker Kessler get rolling when he comes back in their present you know assuming his elbow is better and then as far as the Clippers go I think you can probably buy on hardened and Kawaii right now or you can wait a little bit longer and maybe the price gets better  the cell names is a couple of parallels from yesterday Chad Holmgren already had a little bit of a slippage game he's in the 90 range over the last week because he's human and you kind of knew this stuff was coming he still number 15 overall because the first two weeks were first round level but he's leveling off that's the important thing to know and it'll probably drop back into the 30s so if you can get something in the 20s you probably do it  herb Jones he'll fall back at some point because again he's shooting the ball exceptionally well right now the Steals and blocks are very very high maybe they stick but they probably come down a little bit  I think if you could get somebody and the problem of course is that I don't know that anybody really trusts that herb is gonna be this good all year you probably need him to continue rolling another week or two and then you could probably cache it on herb if you wanted to and then Jordan Clarkson who still not really a fantasy value on the season overall I think he's number one one ninety something  but over the last week he's put up some pretty big scoring numbers I think he's actually number eight over his last two ballgames  you know that ain't sticking 63% from the field a thousand percent at the free throw line he's hit them all that was in percent 100% shooting 1000 he's averaging two and a half defensive stats three threes and 28 points  can you get something for Lava Hot Jordan Clarkson if you can get a top 90 player for him  you do it and that I believe is your week in review part of the show but we still have a look ahead portion to do so don't leave us yet and while I'm pulling up the Friday card for you guys to watch on the YouTube please do again take five seconds to like hit that thumbs up button I can even you might even that's my toe thumb here you want to see the more normal one there's the normal one there's the little stubborn toe thumb just take a second that's it that's all I'm asking to like And subscribe and help us continue to move this freight train along here  that's so easy that's as long as it takes me to get this thing ready to present on the screen anyway  all right here's what's coming up tonight I actually put a lot of this out on social media already so feel free to cruise on over there if you want to see some of this stuff written down  there's a lot of games what is it 11 game Friday no no no no yep 11 game Friday I managed to get through the board quicker than expected so we might actually have some time for questions today for the next Josh Hart we talked about Wizards it's pretty much the whole team the Bucks we talked about Bobby Portis for the Hornets it's really the miles Bridges thing and I know I don't necessarily I say I don't want to pick him up I probably not going to do that but there's going to be a lot of stuff around him that you're gonna want to assess what does it do to Gordon Hayward what does it do to PJ Washington if you're in a slightly deeper League does it do anything to Mark Williams like as it does it does it  push him up does it push PJ up to Center does that squeeze Williams at all we know Rose ears not still not back  so there's sort of more yet to occur coordinate what I think is actually a game time decision so there's that all so but there's a lot of Fallout stuff here to kind of assess  Celtics or Dingus was present at shoot around so was Jalen Brown so I'm gonna assume both of those guys are good to go if they are  sorry Big Al you'll have to wait for your next opportunity Raptors we didn't talk about much Yakima Turtle had one good ball game despite precious of being around so hopefully that's something that can stick  turtle is inside the top 90 over the last week still hasn't moved his full season number up all that far but he's sitting just outside the top one ten which is again more than good enough to get the job done so don't freak out about turtle uh keep trying to come up with nice puns there doesn't seem like anybody's really filling in for OG or Gary Trent right now which seems odd Seasons past you might see them go big and run Chris Boucher a little extra but  by the way we do have confirmation that Russell Westbrook is now going to be coming off the bench  so James Harden remains in the starting lineup rust coming off the bench  this is looking a lot like with the Lakers were trying last year let's see if the Clippers can pull it off together  I might have let Harden come off the bench for a little bit to settle in but I really want to see out I want to force the pieces to work together as fast as possible even if that means you bought him out quicker  we shall see  whoops took a deep breath and coughed  Sixers we talked about the bottom Rob Covington thingy Melton Rowling has been a fun little last week subplot  he's pushed himself up to number one forty one  and over the last week he's number 58 yay you know what would come this is why you was on the tough holds board for so damn long because it was just a matter of time what else we got going on Hawks where's Bogdan gonna end up  that's interesting to me Kings nothing really now that fox is back  nothing  talked about her already Spurs This is a team that I've largely avoided  and I don't feel all that bad about it when banana is  to no one's surprise the best fantasy value on the team so far this year but even he's barely inside the top 60 due to bad percentages and very high turnovers obviously you like 19 points nine boards and two and a half blocks but there's got to be other stuff that goes with it I think for a long time vessel was the second highest ranked spur yeah he's at 88 but he's out keldon Johnson the efficiency started to wane he's now outside the top 15 Jeremy Sohan is one ninety nine Trey Jones is one 30s  if teams don't have efficiency it's hard to put up nine cat numbers  it's just the Spurs right now it's why I dodged almost all of them this year  trying to think of I've nine fantasy teams I don't think I have one San Antonio Spur on any of them  no that's not true I have a couple of Zach Collins's  he's number one 27 a lot of that's because his turnovers are at almost three  um which to me still feels like a number that's probably gonna come down  and the free throws at 72 you kind of hope that those may be tick up a little bit but even that Collins isn't putting up giant numbers feels better than it is because the turnovers and a lot of people don't really pay attention to those but  anyway  Pistons  we talked about Bagley we talked about Stewart we talked about Burke's Cavaliers we talked about Jared Allen as a Buy Low  and Levert nuggets we talked about Reggie Jackson Pell's I spent a bunch of time on Ice Daniels Jordan Hawkins and Herb Jones so I think we're pretty good on that Jonathan glatch for the magic the Bulls um you know you're gonna start  having to sort of way in your mind whether or not it's worthwhile to sit on a guy like a Kobe white who over the entire season so far hasn't really been close to Fantasy value he's number one 1804 on 12 points 3 boards and four assists with the steal on bad field goal percent and okay free throws but didn't really helping you all that much but he stands to benefit in a ridiculous way if any stars get traded what do we think the odds are that that happens in the very near future the bulls look bad so far this year tomorrow was out and they looked worse  they're four and eight  they can't win on the road  they're barely winning at home  how long before they blow it up well you gotta figure that they're going to wait and try to get some sort of assets back they're not gonna Rush this thing they don't have to  so I just I don't think it's gonna happen tomorrow like I feel like the Bulls are gonna  try to squeeze this thing a little bit longer  and in my eyes that's too much time to sit on a guy who's not helping you at all  but you guys can disagree there's no right answer necessarily that question  Lakers I don't think there's really anything I mean I know we talked about camera radish a little bit but I just really nothing to watch on the Lakers Blazers not a whole lot either I could spend some time talking about this sort of fantasy disconnect on shade and sharp who's number one 44 in nine cat but people are doing a lot of celebrating  he's a points League guy right now turn overs are high feel goal percent is incredibly low but the points 3 rebounds are all decent enough and so that's kind of float in the value on him on the points League side but nine caddy hasn't actually been an asset to this point kind of a weird twist surprise surprise of the day Sons nothing is Beale is doubtful as soon as he plays then Moana watch them  but he hasn't  in the last game probably again won't in another one  dude dude dude Jazz we talked about keyonte George Jordan Clarkson Walker Kessler covered them all ready Rockets that's a team I didn't talk about I should have put tari Eason on the watch list because he's looked really good but his minutes have been super low he's playing 16 and a half minutes of ball game that ain't gonna be enough now the nice thing about Easton is that he can rack up fantasy stats pretty quickly so 23 24 minutes might actually be enough to get him there but is he gonna get 23 or 24 minutes and I'm in Thompson isn't even around yet so  and then the Clippers well we just got the report that rust is coming off the bench I don't know that it changes what he is all that much  which is a guy that you close your eyes and you pray he doesn't ruin your percentages  his turnovers are going to be high he's gonna be far better in points League's he's averaging almost two steals a game right now which is a number that you know is coming down  Russ is a cell although on this news people are going to be panicking and so rather than a buy I think I'd probably just say if you have him you're probably stuck with him for a little bit and if you don't probably just don't worry about Russell Westbrook coming off the bench this probably does help James Harden because now he is really the point guard in the starting five it's not Russ anymore so hardens assists probably improve he's going to be running a lot of pick-and-roll with Kauai with Paul George with zubats  and they're gonna put in more I didn't hear I actually try to flip through the Twitter while I'm doing a live show I didn't see who they're gonna be replacing him with my guess would be Terrence Mann but I didn't see the official report on that yet you guys in the chat room can probably get me that piece of data while I'm yammering about all this stuff does it change Russ's numbers at all no I think just like time will change his numbers because you don't figure the two steals are gonna stick and then if everything else stays in that same ballpark that he falls out the top 100 which I kind of figured was gonna happen anyway  but this is probably your opportunity to move on Harden before he becomes the actual point guard and then numbers start to go up  and that is your review and preview and I did it fast enough for I left us some time to do a few questions let's scroll all the way up to the top  by the way about 100 of you hanging out with us right now which I appreciate that's a number that is pretty there's a lot higher than it was last year you can see that the growth just daily here again please like rate subscribe I know a handful of you are thinking about doing it so just freaking do it because it means a lot I think only like 20 of you have actually hit the button which is crazy there's way more of you that have been a part of this thing so far come on  all right let's do some questions  who would you bench between Dlow lamelo Deontay Murray and Drew holiday  oh this is a very specific weekly battle question you want to assist at assisted turnover ratio while maintaining your lead in free throw percentages and steals  oh well Dilo  I mean I guess man this is like  lamelo is not going to be your best assistant to turn over guys there that's for damn sure holiday and and Russell are probably better in that department straight assists you're going to want lamelo ball  free throws all of these guys are okay Drew holidays been the one that's that's kind of bounced around with his free throw stroke throughout his career he's at 81 this year which should be enough delos at 83  where's little Mellows free throw number at this season he's in the 80s right yeah 84 damnable fly get out of this room fly and Deonte is at 82 so I don't know that there's really much of a difference in free throws with any of those guys so you're probably just weighing how badly do I want to assist or how badly do I want assist to turn over  and that would  probably put  Deonte Murray on your bench between those guys I mean the steals thing that hurts cuz he's a big steals Guy but  he's your probably weakest in assists slashes to turn over even if he's good at Steeles and everybody's kind of equal and free throw so I unfortunately I think it's deje there  I know weird  this person's name is just hello  feel like Uncle Leo on Seinfeld  hero and Levert or Middleton for kuzma is the deal Fair considering hero is hurt I don't want kuzma kuzma's a cell guy for me right now he's Number 96 and he's on the way down  if you can get Tyler hero that's who I want he'll be back in the next couple of weeks and he's way better than anybody else in this trade  is ogn and Obi a Buy Low yeah he probably is he's hurt and it doesn't sound like he's gonna play because he wasn't really using his right hand but I believe his Steals and free throw percent are both gonna go up so yes I would call him a Bilo he's currently ranked around number 80 he probably gets up into the 50 range as the season goes  if you can get him for someone in the 60s or 70s I think you do it the question here is about doing a two-for-one I don't know that you're gonna get him for two for one but if you did you'd probably use two guys that are ranked really close to what he is right now which is late 70s early 80s so Umi and Charis Levert Jalen Suggs and on gecko Kang woo  I don't think too for one's work these days but that's kind of the Ranger looking at  should I trade DeMar DeRozan for Jaren Jackson yes who would you say is the first drop out of Bruce Brown Derek Lively or Kobe white it's Kobe white the other two guys are ranked around 105 and Kobes 80 slots behind them  and I get it Josh and I just talked on this show yesterday about how like the difference between the number 25 guy the number 31 guy it's really nothing because a lot of it is team fit but the difference between 100 and 180  that's something  how long will you hold clay in a 14 team or almost the whole damn season 14 or you're just there's no chance you're finding somebody on the wire who has his upside  hey Dan it's France Wagner going to be Fringe top 100 well what was he last year guys  I don't mean to be a butthole about it or snide or someone sarcastic but I would remind you all that frees Wagner last year was number one oh seven per game  and really wasn't any change in our land oh to suggest he was about to do a whole bunch more  he's number 125 this year feel goal percent probably comes up that gets him back around to where he was so yes Fringe 100 probably accurate  hey Dan with a full injured list and more injured players what do you do about Ben Simmons probably a drop if you're injured list is full dude wasn't inside the top 100 it's not like he was blowing the roof off the building this year prior to having to sit out and he's gonna be a headache probably all year  so honestly I don't have any problem with you dropping him even if he wasn't hurt  can't buy his Harris maintain top 40 yes provided the Sixers don't bring in another preeminent scorer  but this is where Tobias was before they brought in Hardin he's just now gone back to Old Tobias  I would venture to say he's having fun again  kind of like John Collins in Utah  happy Friday Dan happy Friday Macs how long would you wait out the Charlotte situation with Bridges coming back today specifically in reference to PJ Washington I don't think is a 12mm I don't think he's a 12 team or with Miles Bridges and I definitely don't think he's a 12 team or with him he's a schedule stream guy who's free throw percent hurts I do think his defensive stats could creep up a little bit but the minutes are likely to come down and Tad I think you're looking at someone who's ranked between 100 and 150 as the season goes which in a lot of formats is just I'm not gonna matter  this question got started abandoned and then started again what are the changes that Mikhail Bridges doesn't make it to the top 30 this season starting to feel like last year's top 10 run in Brooklyn was a bit of a mirage so he wasn't really a he was a top 10 guy for like the first week and a half in Brooklyn but he was more like top 25 top 30 for his overall time in Brooklyn which I think is still something you could probably aim for with him I think he's at 60 right now which  I think we all were hoping for better than that honestly as a lot of names level off his 60 ranck probably creeps up into the 40s anyway but one of the big reasons you drafted Bridges at the end of the second round was because you expect him to play 80 or 82 games so even if he ends up at like 35 or 40 per game that'll still put him at or above his ADP by totals and that was always kind of the appeal with him was  probably won't beat his ADP per game and probably will buy totals  not gonna throw this one up on the screen but baby stay Flo keep keep cooling man keep Cooling best stream options for the weekend for blocks and steals I'm going to close fight and I'm gonna drop Levert I wouldn't  I wouldn't uh I'll admit I haven't looked at who's playing  a back-to-back over the weekend since our Monday show so that is now officially out of my head I can try to pull that up quickly while we're talking I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get it all that fast uh let's see who's playing a back-to-back  over the weekend here it is 18 and 19th Dallas as it back to back over the weekend so Derek Lively is obviously a really good choice there Memphis if you wanted to go the aldama or David Roddy Route assuming that you think Marcus Smart is out those guys might give you a couple of defensive stats  the Thunder go over the weekend I don't know that there's an obvious grab there and I think those are the three teams that have two games I wouldn't drop Charis Levert though  you may regret that one  Dan can you do a fun Story Time segment on the show at least once a month  good God you guys know I'd love to just tell silly stories on here the people crush me when I walk away from the fantasy for even a few minutes people lose their minds  which reminds me I need you guys to lose your wallet over at manscaped.com use

dumb that they make such good products because people don't have to replace them  unless they want to get the new model I guess  fun story time I'll think about it but if I can I mean if something silly happens in my life I'm probably gonna talk about it  who can I trade Michael Porter Jr for he had a bad ball game and he dropped a little bit now he's number 51  I mean you could probably get most players in the  60 to 70 range for him how badly do you want to though I don't think you're gonna get somebody higher and people don't like packages you can pull it off  I  mmm two for ones are impossible these days  hey Dan how would you feel about the trades below porzingis for Freddie Van Fleet  or Devin vessel for Cade Cunningham  I think I'd rather have  we're singing for Van Lee just fair in my eyes and then I think I'd rather have Cade over herself because I gotta believe it at some point that turned over number comes down  oh boy this is a complicated one Dan I need field goal percent rebounds and threes  so you need two big man stats and one not big man stat in a punt points team buddy this is a little specific I can pick up Mitch Robin I mean trimmer he's not playing oh it's Roto so you'd be squatting on him who do I drop out of Ty's Jones markelle fultz Gordon Hayward Klay Thompson well if you need threes you're not dropping Play tomson Because at some point he's gonna start making a bunch Heyward you're not dropping probably false for Mitchell Robinson I can get behind that one  there's your move  what do I do with Austin Reeves he's a hold is Middleton a hold I said specifically don't draft Chris Middleton on this podcast like 15 times during the preseason now you're stuck with a man because this sunk cost theory if Chris Middleton ever gets up into the mid to high 20s and minutes so be a fantasy play but he stuck at 19 minutes of game right now  probably just gonna have to wait it out  sorry bud  should I pick up Terence man and drop Casey P know Terence man never does enough for more than a game or two in fantasy he just he just doesn't have the right profile  would you trade Kyle kuzma and dairy is Garland for Devin Booker yes  Troy called me Thunder dance that's actually Dan Palio although I appreciate it do you think Cade turns things around not not to wear folks wanted him there's I was thinking that he has the potential for close to first round value when I drafted him in the 40s yeah he never did man  he never did  he never did he was always a build guy if you took him in the 30s early 40s you were like I'm punting for free throws because that was the way that he beat that Mark  I do think he's gonna be a lot better than he is right now Steals and blocks should probably come up if you're looking at the first couple Seasons or season and a fraction in the NBA he steals and blocks were definitely higher but that field goal percent is gonna be bad it has been he's shown us nothing to make us think it won't be especially when he has no one helping him score around him  all right I'm gonna start scanning the chat room now for questions that I think can apply to everybody so apologies to Chan because you were the person that got cut off you were the next one on the board but I'm jumping over that because it's a trade question here's one hula believe or Derek Lively who is the pickup  I think I like Lively there  what do you expect from Trey Murphy this season well provided the Pelicans always have some key guy hurt top 90 seems pretty attainable for him but it's gonna take a little time to get there because remember he doesn't really been playing at all lately  is Dyson Daniels a straight add or an injury replacement probably more of an injury replacement but I think the columns out for a while so I wouldn't worry too much about it right now will kauai's stock rise from where it is right this second yes yes  here's an interesting one where do you think Zach LaVine gets traded  I feel like he could end up in Philly but they can't do anything for a little bit  because all this stuff they just got for in the hardened trade I think it all has to sit for like a month I forget what the exact rule is there  but the nice thing is wherever he goes he's still gonna get to do stuff  wherever he goes he'll have a role so don't worry about it  um let's see here  do you prefer below or keyonte George I'm gonna go keyonte George  can I get anything for Bradley bum Bradley Beal know you can't get anything right now you need him to play and actually give you like two good weeks before you can move off of him  sorry VP  I only have one team thank the good Lord  all right let's see if anything else applies to everybody here what do you think the long-term ranking for Trey Murphy and Mark Hill faults is gonna be  well I'm hoping that each guy can get to around 90  oh here's an interesting question how significant a two-for-one deals in a 16 team are compared to a standard 12 I would say on the whole they are less helpful because it becomes harder and harder to find that replacement level player so definitely something you want to be doing in 12  the only thing you want to be doing in 10 teamers at 18 years is two for ones as it gets deeper you have to start thinking all right who is this whack dude I'm gonna have to stick on my bench in the open spot beginning of the season I think you can still pull it off because names are still popping up but boy by mid-season you're mostly just filling in guys with injury replacements  is it more difficult to catch someone and feel goal percent or steals the rest of a week  probably steals  but I don't know what your league looks like let's see here he's shooting through things what about trading Marcus Smart for Walker Kessler I don't think that's gonna be enough but I would try to start exploring what it would take to get Walker Kessler though hmm  what about kristaps we're seeing his vs Kawhi Leonard  or Julius Randle in this one I think I'd prefer Kauai over porting us over Randall that's my order there  do you prefer Bane or Kauai  uh this one's too this one's too hard they're so different  I think Bane if you want to make if it's head to head you probably want the guy that you trust is going to be trying to play but man things are getting funky and Griz town probably Kawaii  let's see trying to find questions again that apply to large chunks of you  would you prefer Jaylen Johnson or Jalen Williams I think Jalen Williams for me  let's see  who should I keep between cam Thomas CJ McCollum or both I think Camp Thomas is back sooner but you're trying to hold both honestly I don't know I haven't seen any report on it I would guess a week or two but  we haven't seen a lot of reporting in Memphis is typically terrible about injury reporting and I think that's going to have to do it oh here's here's one last good one who has regular are better rest of season value Jabari Smith Jr Asante aldama I'll go Jabari Smith Jr because he's your sort of full-time starter but fantasy profile wise if we get aldama better minutes like the Grizzlies decide to at some point pull the plug this year but I don't think we're that close to that yet  I said something about The Vibes going down the tank in Memphis when Steven Adams went out and and a lot of fans jumped down my throat but  when Steve was ruled out for the year that was like the death blow  all right I think that's it I don't know if we're gonna have time for a show this weekend I'll try to get one going tomorrow that would be the best opportunity Sunday is like kids little league stuff basically the entire day friends in from out of town Thanksgiving week all that stuff begins but we will try to get something going tomorrow maybe we can do the Let's Make a Deal episode last week we did one with Scotty Barnes and and folks seem to find that entertaining feel free to throw stuff in the comments after the show is over I finally
