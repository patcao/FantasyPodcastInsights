welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast streaming yeah I can't do it no this is too weird today my nose is too snuffly  I was gonna give you a little semi Sonic remix  Matt  Clippers host Matt  matter Warren I know you're listening out there  wrote us a show wrote us a song I should say not that long ago  streaming time  excuse me a show opening burp  oh that's good podcasting Dan great work all right here we go it's kind of a weekly preview show but also you know mostly geared up towards daily leagues so this is your streaming half of the fantasy NBA today offering for Monday March the 25th I'm Dan vasper you guys probably know that by now but if you happen to be the one new listener I have like to assume that there's one every single day welcome very happy to have you I'm at Dan best person over on Twitter d a n b e s b r i s this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos.com presentation hope you guys will check out that website at some point here down the line and of course you can hang out with us over in our free sports eat those Discord that link is in the show description as are the links to our sponsors at manscape.com and express VPN  as we like to do I like to begin with the worst schedule's of the weeks so you guys know who should be on your shopping block and then we'll pivot  role from that into the better schedules either weekly or daily whatever kind of makes the most sense for you but for those that are watching our video feed will throw up a little too weak cross section of the streaming calendar available to fantasy pass subscribers it's Sports ethos.com it's a really awesome tool I added some color coding for my self I think it's been kind of useful for folks that are watching along as well but this is what you're looking at right now you're looking at a week where and you can probably see it just as I scroll through a lot of teams play Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday not everybody but a lot and that really does color how you're going to be streaming this week because this after last couple of weeks where you you pretty heavily had like six seven eight nine game cards throughout the the week  now you go into one where it's heavy light heavy light heavy light heavy  that doesn't make streaming easier harder whatever it just makes it different  different in that  instead of trying to just maximize who's playing on any given day you know in previous weeks it's like okay this team has five games in seven days bam there's your goal and frankly if a team has five and seven even now you'd probably be walking down that path but think of it more of like who has it back to back or place three and four previous weeks like all right that's a pretty easy call this week not so much  because again particularly Wednesday through Saturday Tuesday through Saturday frankly this week is all about which days your guys are playing and not as much about how many games your guys are playing so I want you to keep that in the back of your mind while I tell you that the worst schedule this week  belongs to  like eight different teams  and there are subtle differences between the two but basically any team that has a three-game week where two of those games are on overload days is your worst schedule of the week  there aren't any two Gamers this week and this sort of traditional sense but a bad team playing  bad team a bad schedule meaning a three game schedule going on two  heavy days you might only get to use that player one time you might be looking at a one game week from some of those dudes if they're kind of near the end like and okay so look those teams are Detroit Minnesota or Lando Phoenix Portland  sort of Toronto  they're sort of like a little iffy  because the Raptors go Monday Wednesday Sunday because like you might not be overloaded on Monday and Sunday so maybe you can use two of them but as I list off all those teams the thing I want you to keep in mind is if you have a really good player it's very different than if you have a fringy player on those rosters even more so than on previous weeks  because if you have a really good player you're going to use them on your overload day that's not a guy that you're gonna drop and say oh you know if I have Anthony Edwards I'm Minnesota he's gonna actually play all three of the games that I have him for this week but if you have  what is it Detroit  or Lando Phoenix like what if you have  Cole Anthony or something like that Portland is actually great example because Portland had a great schedule for like the last three weeks in a row and now their schedule all of a sudden kind of stinks if you're sitting on the little Banton important odds are  you might have room to play him today but he's probably not going to be in your top 10 guys going on Wednesday and Friday  so frenzy Blazer this week  is really more of a one game week because he's that players probably gonna be your 10th 11th 12th or 13th best guy on your roster on Wednesday and Friday and again odds are because those are dozen game days you're gonna have 11 or 12 guys to pick from to start so you're not going to need your 11th or 12th guy so a team like Portland that has three games this week really is only like a one game week  teams that play on the off days when I say the off days I mean the quality days or the light days or however you want to phrase it  no matter how bad the player is if you're going from a Portland guy who plays one game this week to say a Milwaukee Buck Fringe player who plays all three times you're adding two games  or more depending on how you shake it out  the worst schedule of the week I think probably belongs to Orlando because they go Wednesday Friday Saturday meeting they do have one light game day on Saturday  but you don't even get their game today like there's not even a game happening today or tomorrow so not only are you getting basically what's like a one game week for a fringe magic player but you'd have to wait all the way until Saturday to even get a game out of them where at least with the team like Portland you can hold through today you know if you have a Blazer today there's no reason to make a move today because they play today  the other bad one in that group would be Minnesota they also don't play until Wednesday so your were scheduled to Orlando in Minnesota because they're off for two days to start the week I believe they are the only two teams yes that are off two consecutive days to start this week and then all so pivot into that terrible of a schedule meaning three games where two of them are on overload days again it's it's both of them  every other team in the NBA is slightly better I'll repeat it again just for edification the other teams on that list that have three games where two of them basically are Wednesday Friday are Detroit we already said Minnesota in Orlando Phoenix and Portland and then Toronto where their other one is Sunday so you'd want to check and make sure that whether or not that's a an overload day for you or not and also whether today is an overload day for you or not  your best schedule this week belong to four teams  I believe personally if given the option the best schedule is at Atlanta  yes they go today and Wednesday which could be overload days all the time again assuming that today is not an overload day for you when Wednesday is so if you have a fringy hawk that's a game you probably wouldn't get out of them but then they go Thursday and Saturday and the reason I like them as the best schedule is there is a fleeting chance that you could actually use a hawk for all four of their games this week and if it's not a streaming decision if you have like a dejounte Murray it's great to get four games out of a team and to be done by Saturday  because if this happens to be your fantasy finals you could actually drop that guy on Sunday although Atlanta does have a decent schedule again next week so bear that in mind but they've got two light days games on Thursday and Saturday they play today where you're probably not overloaded but you might be with injuries it's hard to be overloaded on a 10 game day it's gonna take 11 12 13 games typically dude get you to maximum overload so when Wednesday is your only one where it's like yeah I probably not going to get to use this guy so I get three games at least out of a hawk and you start the week quickly two games first three days three games of first four  your next tier of good schedules belongs to Milwaukee and New Orleans we've been talking about this on shows for a while now because this was the type of players you wanted to kind of prepare yourself for because they played on Sunday so you got to finish out last week you're not getting games out of them today so if you're not overloaded yes I you know there's a little bit of a annoyance of not getting a game on the first day of the week that's why I think Atlanta is the better schedule but Milwaukee New Orleans played Tuesday Thursday Saturday both of those teams do same schedule this week Tuesday Thursday Saturday meaning you're gonna get to use whatever player you have on those clubs for all three of their games there's no risk of overload fringy good star whatever it is the fact that you don't have to consider whether or not someone's getting bumped is great  so full three game schedule this week for those dudes  that's fantastic for streaming  and the final name I wanted to put on the list of decent schedules is Boston they go today and then Thursday Saturday not as good I'd say as the other ones because let's say you are one of those teams that has the rare overload going today so you wouldn't maybe be able to use your boss in Celtic or they would push someone else out of the board having an extra player is just generally not great but at least it gets you started with the game on the first day you have a couple days off in there which you know again you probably would rather have somebody going on Tuesday so you have to sit through it  but because the Celtics are resting guys regularly and Derek white is actually hurt a little bit and Drew holiday is actually hurt a little bit more than a little bit  you've got better options on Boston then say Atlanta or New Orleans or Milwaukee where your best streaming options are probably Larry Nance uh Bruno Fernando if DeAndre Hunter is on the wire Malik Beasley if he's floating around out there some of those I mean odds are Larry Nance of the names I just said is and Bruno Fernando probably only ones that are available at least with Boston you probably were able to pick up Payton Pritchard during their five and seven a week and a half ago and so you have a pretty good streaming guy that you could just hold through it  and that actually takes us to the last part of this discussion which is what are the names on this board and I think we just talked about them for it later brutal Fernando is on the board we know Jalen Johnson is out for most of or maybe all of this week so that's creates a little bit of an opening for someone like it Garrison Mathews not super thrilled about it but  possibly usable crunchy who doesn't do very much but again in four games possibly you'd get something out of it for New Orleans Larry Nance Naji Marshall and Jose Alvarado are the two sort of lower options on that team  for Milwaukee Malik Beasley is the upper option the lower options would be like Pat connaughton all right I doubt Port is out there but he would be an upper option all so Pat connaughton Patrick Beverley Jae Crowder would be sort of like the lower tier Forum Milwaukee and then Boston your upper tiers would be Payton Pritchard and or maybe Sam Houser and then the lower tier would probably be luke Cornett guys I assume that Jayson Tatum Jaylen Brown Kristofferson is Al Horford are all going to be in for the Celtics for these three games but if anybody misses some time then cornet would get a little bit of a bump there as well  quickly I want to Pivot over to the chat room see if anybody has some names I know a few of you through some names in our our earlier show today and I said hey throw them in the streaming show and we'll we'll talk about him over there hey shark attacks is new listener here awesome happy to have you bud please like And subscribe that goes for all of you new listeners who haven't posted in the chat room  hey Dan I'm in my semi is I need to see if you would drop either a deuce McBride train man  he on Ellis or Desmond Bane for Alex Caruso this week  not really sure what four you know Sacramento goes back to back to start the week so absolutely not on dropping anybody for the king's special with you know the back-to-back being on two days where you probably get to use that player um  NYX Hornets  and Grizzlies are the other ones  Memphis is schedules not very good but Desmond Bane is good enough where if he plays and that and you'll know more by the end of tonight like if he's ruled out tonight in the best you get is a two-game week you could probably pivot off of him Nick's have a four gamer it's just like Caruso I like I just I can't get on board with the idea of making a move just to switch how many what player you have as opposed how many games they're getting and we know with Caruso he tends to play himself into an injury every once in a while so probably not is your answer there although I do like Caruso much more than I like Trey man and Charlotte I just don't know think I'd use a move unless I'm gaining games played  Kate cutting I'm just got ruled out by the way and the middle of our show here and we got some other Jalen Duren is out again Simone from Tech he was out again  AL Jerusalem's questionable so again there's you know that's a reason why you'd probably want to be a little bit careful  so Detroit Bad schedule but you know at least you got like a James Wiseman congratulations James Wiseman streams see what else we got going here is JJJ a play this week finals weekly lock whoo  Memphis plays three playoff teams this week so I think Jaron Jackson's gonna try to play in all three so I'm gonna lean towards yes but oh man that makes me nervous to say it  I'm going into my first round of the playoffs without Jalen Johnson and Donovan Mitchell Kelly Olynyk and altruist or are my waiver streamers any advice you might have to drop Jaylen Johnson  Camp drop Donovan Mitchell  would you rather play Santi aldama this week or Nas Reed both teams with bad schedules this week  Minnesota two overload days and Sunday Memphis Monday Wednesday Saturday I probably go this is gonna sound insane but it probably go all dhamma because at least you can get a game out of him today and it definitely a game on Saturday and for now as read I mean yeah probably is inside your top 10 guys on Wednesday Friday but you probably don't lose a game played their meaning you potentially would only lose one game by moving off of nazreen sucks I hate it because he's the better option but you're probably gonna get two games out of aldama versus one of read if you wipe out the overload days that's the way you kind of think of it in your mind  if you have to use a roster move to switch it I'd say no I wouldn't use a roster move to abandon NOS Reid but if you have both and that's the choice you're making that's the way you go  do you like Payton Pritchard or Sam Houser over Naji Marshall this week um yes yes I do just just better just better fantasy numbers  hold all dhamma after today and drop Pritchard um no I think I'd rather have Richard  for the injury stuff and then all because again with Boston you dodged overload days probably get three full games out of them so I would lean to Prichard there  why would you drop yeah that's their  yeah um do you think plays I have Jalen Duren and son if I take you and my IL Plus  I would lean towards no but I really don't know and he certainly better than Simona from Techo I think fontecchio is the guy you probably have to drop there because we have no time table on his return and he's already been ruled out I have three ads for my league should I use two of them in order to get Pritchard Houser Horford for those quality games on the low volume days  honestly the answer is probably  or it depends t on what your schedule looks like for today if you're if you're overloaded today don't further the overload if you have like nine guys going I would use one move today fill up your schedule today pick up Prichard great you have them for the two quality days later in the week but don't use moves on the other guys because then you're just blowing up the first three days of your week with players you're not gonna get to use  so in that case you wait until tomorrow see what's going on on Tuesday maybe make some moves on guys tomorrow  if ultimately you don't need to then find you could wait and do the boss and stuff on Thursday but I would say go it's based on how many spots you have open to use today  good questions everybody good Queen streaming questions I want to keep this thing under 20 minutes so we're gonna go ahead and wrap it up look for me on the itl the in this league Network today very excited to be doing a show with Jesse severe over their Dynasty Sports podcast on the itl network I should be a lot of fun we'll talk about some of the Silly Season guys  and I couldn't figure out how to get Ryan Ward's clip into today's recap show but fear not we'll be talking with Ryan it's a great interview that he and I recorded at the end of last week that'll be in probably tomorrow show midweek at the absolute latest I want to make that sit on the the back burner for too much longer here as well so big thank you Ryan big thank you to Jesse really looking forward to being a part of that and should I drop zubats for Najee this week  um after today maybe  because after today's zubats you'd probably just get to use his Sunday game and after today you could get three out of someone on the Pelicans and three versus one usually wins out I know Najee Marshalls not putting up much in the way of numbers but usually that wins out and that is our last question for today is we hit 19 minutes and 50 seconds over on YouTube and probably right around that same Mark after I edited in some music on the traditional pod side big big thank you to all of you that listened to all of our shows these days we're doing as many as we can to try to get you guys to the finish line I know I couldn't do any this weekend because it was largely related to my kiddos fourth birthday  got a new family stuff folks and you guys met him Theo came on the show on  on Friday right when he on the Friday show that was fun he's saying Britney Spears into the microphone  all right everybody have a great day I'll talk to you over on Twitter at Dan Vespers and welcome thank you to those that are listening for the first time it's really cool to have you later for now
