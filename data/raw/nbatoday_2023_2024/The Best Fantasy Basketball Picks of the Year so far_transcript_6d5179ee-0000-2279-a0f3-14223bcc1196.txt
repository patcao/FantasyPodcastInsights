welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I've been wanting to do this particular episode for about a month now and the name of changed they've moved they've shifted  and the timing is gotten more and more and more complicated but today I finally decided we are doing this damn show if it's the last thing I do  welcome to best picks of the year so far  December 21st we're about two months into the NBA season so again these names could continue to shift up and down the board but I thought it might be a little bit fun to do kind of an engagement farming type of episode of fantasy NBA today or I go over my top picks of the season to this point you guys can yell at me about them I have no problem with that you can use the live chat room if you're watching the show in real time you can use the comments section after the fact you can find me on social media at Dan best person we can scream about it over there but I thought this would be not even necessarily an exercise I just think these are the names of the guys who have had the largest positive impact  compared at least to where they were drafted  again you can find me over on social at Danbury s b r i s this is a sports ethos presentation that website is sports ethos.com and the news feed is ethos fantasy b k  we're gonna count up  or count down I guess it's the direction we're probably going I don't know what the proper nomenclature is for that as I checked to make sure I'm hitting the right button and on the screen in front of me  and we will start with number 10  number 10 on the board  is Kobe White  let's make that bigger for you guys  Kobe white is the number 10 pick in fantasy and the reason he's not higher is because it took a Zach LaVine shut down to get him to where he's at right now  so things could still change  he's number 73 overall on the season that's another reason why he isn't higher on the board is because his major Ascent has been over the last three and a half to four weeks but the first month of the Season he was out the top one 60 so for a while there the Bulls had their three guys going and Kobe white was a little bit of an afterthought but lately he's gone completely nuts  he is in the top three in the NBA in three-pointers made behind just Steph Curry and Luka doncic  he's averaging 17 and a half points per game on the season  and over the past month he's averaging 23 points per game and is it top 30 player  again this list is not about what might happen in the next month or two months or whatever because ACC Levine might be back for the Bulls you might get traded and there may be heard rumors yesterday even as recently as 24 hours ago that the Lakers were offering up D'Angelo Russell and really Hodge Mora and money and picks and so forth that if those guys come back those are guys that would cut into what Kobe's doing right now but he is a feature part of what they're doing he is playing some of the most minutes of anybody in the NBA over the last month  and even though the Steals and the blocks are basically non-existent heating so many three pointers and he's doing it so if he has been very very good but again I can't put him higher because again it's only the last month the first month was kind of bad if I do this list again a month from now and he's been this good for another month he'd probably end up higher on the list but this is as far as I'm willing to go today  number nine on the board is Jalen Johnson I know he's injured right now but that was a crazy leap he had made prior to going down Jaylen Johnson his current rank is 49  on a per game basis I'm fully aware that he's been out for the last three weeks so that makes it harder but just again this is a guy who in a lot of League was a waiver wire pickup the B150 had him obscenely early so it didn't even League that I was in where someone was reading the Bruce Lee 150 or paid attention to sports ethos he was getting drafted in the last round and again  basically an end of the fourth early 5th round value pretty much since day one  he said 14 points 7.3 rebounds two and a half assists a steal a block a 3-pointer 60% almost from the field 76 at the free throw line and he's been a key part of what Atlanta was doing when they were winning ballgames and since he went down Atlantis basically stopped winning ballgames so there's every reason to believe that when Johnson comes back which apparently we got word yesterday could be within the week he should pick up right where he left off playing 30 minutes a game and being a huge part of what the Hawks are doing it's pretty wild to get a top 50 guy in the last round of your draft that didn't even need anything to happen for him to get unlocked  and that's why Jalen Johnson is number nine not higher because well  partially because he's hurt and partially because the names you're gonna see I just think have been more important  one of those is his teammate Bogdan bogdanovich who's been ridiculous so far he's number 37 on the year with a steals right that still feels somewhat unsustainable but 17.6 points he's all so among the league leaders in three-pointers made in only 28 minutes Paul game right now the steals are great the free throw number is excellent he somehow managed to keep himself from being a large negative in any one statistical category the fact that he's inside the top 40 is ridiculous he's basically an end of the third round value again a guy drafted at the very end of draft and to get someone this High because remember it gets harder and harder to climb the board the higher you go so the fact that he's still in this range and he's played 25 ball games now  that's crazy like he's ahead of bam out of Bio he's ahead of Anthony Edwards in nine category ranking and I know some of that is because his turnovers are at only one point two and those guys turned the ball over significantly more than he does but that is absolutely freaking wild  a massive leaper and again safe to say the only reason he's not higher is because the guys that are up on the top of this board are guys that are in that uppermost Echelon where they're making such a positive impact on your team it cannot be overstated  number seven of my board is Brook Lopez and you guys know I've got a soft spot for Brooke  he was drafted near 75 or 80 in most drafts and he's number 27 right now  sure you could yell at me that Bogdan book zdanowicz belongs ahead of him on my rank board because there within 10 Slots of each other but right now Brooke Lopez is the current NBA leader in total blocks and blocks per game because not only is he blocking over three shots at night he's also played in 27 basketball game this year he has 83 blocks on the year and as an interesting sort of point of reference I'm in a lot of rotor leaks you guys know this about me  right now the middle pack teams in Roto leagues  are at about 200  it's two and a half Brook Lopez's right now and you'd be mid-pack  more than likely you have 12 or 13 other guys on your team besides Brook Lopez though the fact that he's doing that by himself  is not we can't say that's enough to win blocks  but if you have just basically an average team plus Brooke Lopez you go from being the middle of the pack to being way out in front of it  and you got him probably in this seventh round  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your

be 21 plus not available in all locations  Derek white is number six this one's one of the most amazing calls of the Year also someone who was pretty high in the brewski one 50 he was initially getting drafted near 60 and then the Celtics traded for Drew holiday and he fell he started falling 70s 80s range well he's number 22 right now he's been insane 16 and a half points almost three three-pointers four boards five assists 1.3 steals 1.2 blocks from the guard spot and 49.87 splits field goal and free throw percent he is damn close to being a positive impact fantasy player in all nine statistical categories the only one where he's not a positive is rebounding how Wild is that there's only one player I believe right now in the NBA who's a positive impact player in every single fantasy category  and that's Kawhi Leonard  and don't worry he's later on the list but the other guy that's in the running for this is Derek White  and basically what he's missing is about 1.7 rebounds per game  he's a nine cat guy effectively I know small negative and rebounds but you know how hard it is to do that  answer is very very hard  and he's doing it and he was drafted in the 70s and 80s and he's a mid-second rounder  absurd  number five on my list is James Harden James Harden his number 16 right now  he started the year not playing  and that's why he fell in drafts I got him in in many drafts near 60 at the end  that's ridiculous  over the past three weeks he's number six  number six  in nine category leaks this is James Harden we're talking about  I mean really like think about that he was supposed to lose value wherever he went  last two weeks he's number seven last week he's number five I mean we're talking about a guy who's now a mid first rounder Knightley  one of the top assist guys in the NBA again percentages are really good right now because he's basically only doing the things that feel right for the Clippers and it's not gonna hold he's not going to shoot 52% or whatever he sat the last couple weeks for the rest of the year  but he said four three pointers over that strategies near 12 assists he's getting steals he's blocking shots the big free throw impact stuff is all back again basically we're talking about a guy who is a first rounder and was drafted in the 50s and 60s and after missing a few games to start the year and he's  he's up to 22 games played which is right in there with most of the other guys that have been basically healthy this year guys are 26 whatever as the season goes if those guys miss a game here or there and hardened doesn't on any given week they didn't end up basically even in that number  he turned out to be an insane insane pick and I want to address one thing because I think I sent a tweet out that was like James Harden has been one of the best picks and fantasy sports right now and somebody was like you cannot call him that because the reason he fell in drafts was because he was on the trade block and we do things were going on there and I'm like that's like  whatever reason you give people took him where they took him it doesn't matter I took him when he fell into the 50s I think it took him when he even fell into the 40s in a couple of spots and I ended up with way more James Harden than I expected this year  because I didn't think Philly was gonna let him linger for that long  I didn't think they could I didn't think they reasonably could let James Harden hang around that team or he would ruin whatever Good Vibes the other guys were trying to build so I drafted him thinking they're gonna move this guy soon it's gonna happen fast  because James Harden  in Philly at the very least was a cancer to the team they had to get rid of him it couldn't linger for more than a couple of weeks  team got a couple of wins front office is like all right we're good bye James we're gonna get what we're gonna get  they just wanted him out of there  and so I treated him and I know I say don't draft guys that are injured to start the year but I treated him like he was you know one to two week injury and that's exactly what it turned out to be  and then I called him a Buy Low right after the trade because one you know whatever how many four or five games those guys didn't really know how to play together at all and then they moved him into the starting lineup and that evaporated but right now James Harden is number five because he's just been incredible and there isn't many reasons to think it's gonna slow down  Clippers has a team have been fantasy juggernauts  click pause

guys that are in front of hard and like they had to be so good to get where they are right now Chad is number nine on a per game basis he was drafted around 40 to 45 so not quite as far down the board as hard and was at the very end of draft season but also Jets been there since day one Harden was bad the first few didn't play for the first week and a half and then was bad for a few games and so that's why jets in front of him but these are two that could flip pretty easily if James continues to do what he's been doing largely because home runs value and look he's doing really well in a lot of stuff he's positive impact and field goal and free throw percent he's been a small positive and scoring good rebound numbers but let's be honest a lot of Chess value is tied  up and blocks much the way that JJ's was last year so while he is number nine on a per game basis a good deal of that  is the one monster statistical category and then being like kind of good in a few others has helped as well  I don't want to downplay what Jets done that's why he's number four on my list I'm very happy that we had him sort of on our targets board because this was the kind of thing you were hoping for a guy who can block shots big man who can shoot free throws just like one of the tenets of getting somebody who typically beats their ADP and not only has he been making them but he'd been making them at a ridiculous clip and maybe it comes down as the year goes we'll see if the rigors of an NBA season start to wear him down a little bit but so far he's been one of the best picks in fantasy drafted in the 40s  mid to late first rounder right now like he's ahead of Kevin Durant he's ahead of Damian Lillard who's been rapidly On The Rise so maybe that won't last very long but Chet's been nuts and that's why he's number four you guys can probably figure out the top three you're just gonna have to wonder what order I've got them in the next one at number three is Scotty Barnes who's right behind Chet in overall rank at number 11 but the reason I have him ahead of chat is that he was getting drafted a full round later so while Chet you had to probably spend your fourth round pick to get this first round value Scotty Barnes you were getting him out of 5th round value which again that's kind of where James Harden was going near the end but Scotty Barnes has played in five more games he's all right five slots ahead of hardened and so for me the reason he's ahead of hard and Chet is that the degree of difficulty was just higher on this one  I didn't think Barnes was gonna have this kind of leap he was not a guy that I had on my board so  anybody who thinks that this list is self-serving it's very much not this was one I wish I had but I didn't he's at 21 points nine boards six assists one and a half steals one and one point three blocks two three pointers shooting 49% from the field it's been a an increase for him in basically every conceivable way  the only fear of course is do the Raptors blow things up he wouldn't be a guy they traded away but he'd be a guy that goes crazy for you know a month or two when they do and then they probably have to start giving him days off because at that point there'd be no issue but right now it's not a thing you need to worry about Ronaldo still trying to fight at the very bottom of that play in zone of teams and for Barnes to be able to get somebody in the 50s that's been a first rounder pretty much since day one and generally healthy All Season to this point  he's number three  to who on Earth could be number two and number one  number two is old man Kawhi Leonard  I know what you're thinking Dan Scotty Barnes drafted like 20 slots later how the hell can you have Kawhi Leonard ahead of Scotty Barnes well the answer is because Kawhi Leonard has just been better from a fantasy standpoint  Kawaii is number six right now on a per game basis and he's played in I think as at every single ball game for the Clippers and he's played in every single one right now which is nuts did he skip one he might just skip one either way every damn ball game we're just gonna round up if I'm missing one he's at 24 and a half points 2.33 pointers six boards three and a half assists 1.5 steals point seven blocks 52% from the field 88% of the free throw line and a ball tree one point five turnovers per game he is a mistake free basketball player he's a positive impact nine category player in all nine categories and the only one that's closed really is blocks at 0.7 which is like right on League average I guess it's 3.5 assists is really close to leak average all so but it is so hard to be a positive player in everything including a medium-sized positive in points  a medium sized positive and steals feel goal and free throw percent  Kawhi Leonard's just been roaring he's been top four over the last month so Rising as he goes and yes I know he was a guy that was getting drafted like near 30 and so again degree of difficulty was not as hard as someone like a Scotty Barnes or the number one player on our list who I think had the highest degree of difficulty of anybody on this board  but kauai's impact has also been greater  like he's only like three slots ahead of Chad Holmgren but remember everybody in this range it's a bigger Gap  so the Gap in value between Scotty Barnes and Kawhi Leonard is the same as the gap between Scotty Barnes and the number 24 guy so it's like there's a whole round of value in between Barnes and Kauai even though they're only five slots apart and you know same general story for Chet Holmgren like it's the difference between those three slots from Kauai to chat is the same as from Chet down to like LeBron at number 17  there's just bigger impact to move each slot at this part of the board and like look he's chasing down Tyreese Halliburton right now he's chasing down Nicolas yolk so those guys have been playing poorly over the last couple of weeks and Kawaii has been dominating and he could legitimately be a top five fantasy play on a per game side before the month is done and by totals he's even better he's ahead of Luka doncic he's ahead of Halliburton who missed a couple of ball games kauai's number five by totals  he's probably not catching the guys in front of him anytime too soon but you never know  and figuring out my number one is very easy he's the one giant winner that we haven't talked about and that is Tyrese Maxey who's also been truly truly amazing he's number 9 by totals by the way well we're looking at that board he's number 13 on a per game basis so right behind Scotty Barnes they basically are the same rank of our neck and neck and the reason I gave Maxi The Edge over Barnes if you were going to try to figure out why he was ahead of these other guys if because he was drafted the latest of any of these guys going in the first round a 80 p on Barnes was like around 50 Maxey it was more like 55 so I get it it's closed both those guys were fifth rounders but one of them was early fifth the other was mid to late so the action there is again degree of difficulty stuff  and then the other deal with maxi is that while Barnes I think you could probably argue has more positives Maxi has fewer negatives you guys know I like that in in my fantasy stuff Scotty Barnes has a negative in free throw percent in turnovers positive and pretty much everything else Tyrese Maxey is a negative and field goal percent and then most of his other stuff is pretty darn close to Lee average or better  I'm gonna go ahead and go not that far out on a limb and say that if or when we do this show again like two months from now  if the guys keep playing the way they are I probably flip-flops some of these names at the very top  and Kauai might be my number one pick all year if that's the way it goes or hardened could jump up to number one if he keeps playing the way he is Maxi probably Falls to two three or four  because he has actually slowed a little over the last three weeks he was number eight or nine he's now down again just outside the first round kind of a turn guy at the moment where Scotty Barnes is kind of been pretty well lodged in at that 10 11 12 spot for a while uh but in terms of again  number one here for Tyrese Maxey is degree of difficulty that's why he's where he is if he in Barns were drafted flipped if Maxi was the one who went first he probably would have been third on my board and Scotty Barnes would have been first  now before you guys yell at me I do have a list of honorable mentions here's the top 10 all lined up Maxi Kawaii Barnes homegrown Hardin Derek white Brooke Lopez Bogdan bogdanovich Jalen Johnson and Kobe white that's your top 10 and here is the honorable mentions list LeBron James who's been a pillar of efficiency so far this year in frankly a way that I just I don't think that  anybody could have really seen coming and I say that as someone who obviously wasn't as high on him but shooting 54% hit all these three pointers while he's usage is way down  his values gone up and as usage is gone down because his percentages are nuts and his steals have been nuts so far this year  if the steals come down in the field goal percent comes down on LeBron Falls to kind of where we expected but right now he's been amazing Paul George is another honorable mention he was drafted actually very close to LeBron with those guys went between 25 and 30 in a lot of drafts PG slipped into the mid to late 30s like kind of towards the end of draft season and he's at 15 so that's a really good jump for him and if you're like why is why is James Harden on the board but not Paul George A lot of it has to do with PG getting off to that insane start and then he's been sort of trending I'm gonna say down but slightly down since then and Harden's been more on the rise Terry Rozier who likely won't be on this board once lamelo ball comes back he's been in an honorable mention right now because Rosie's putting up third round value  basically all with lamelo out  that's gonna fall we know that CJ McCollum is on the board he's number eighteen but he missed a month so for me a lot of it is I just don't really believe that he's gonna have 2.2 defensive stats and have the percentages he does right now but he's been really really good through his first you know three or four ish four and a half weeks of basketball since coming back or total on both ends of the small Numa thorax he dealt with but he's number 18 right now so if I don't mention him then I just be a jerk and Jonas this is one that I was way off on you want to talk about other ones that I missed jv's been awesome this year he's number 41 his minutes are up despite Zion being back did not see that one coming and his blocks her way up definitely didn't see that one comment and then the other stuff with him like that's all repeatable Goodfield gold good free throw good rebounds that would have been the reason you drafted him but you're getting more you're getting more scoring than expected you're getting way more blocks than expected and that's why he's jumped up the board probably 40 50 slots higher than most people expected him to be I want to figure out if I can go back a page here so you guys there we go now you guys can see the total top 10 while we're sort of wrapping this thing up how this is fun I would love it if those of you watching not only did the usual stuff like lighting liking and subscribing and finding me on social but I would love it if you guys would give some thoughts on the list who did I miss who should I have added should who should I have removed from the list where my honorable mentions guys that should have been on in place of the top 10 and if you guys like this we'll do a top 10 worst picks of the seasons so far I think most people love when analysts come on and clown on things I don't think that's as fun because I like to look at things more from a optimistic positive view but if that's what you guys want you already know who the number one is gonna be on that board but if that's you guys want then that's what you guys shall receive so let me know if you want a worst list in the comments section anybody that's listening can navigate over to youtube.com slash Sports ethos and leave a comment on anyone of the shows obviously leaving it on this one would probably be the most apt because then I'll know what you're talking about but again let me know your thoughts on this stuff let's argue about it let's have some fun let's keep it positive this is a list that doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things congratulations if you have two three or four of any of these guys on your fantasy team and then if you guys want to know who have these guys were on the old man squad and who were guys that Sports ethos were targeting let me wrap and fire through the 10 names here Tyrese Maxey Kawhi Leonard Chet Holmgren Brooke Lopez we're all on the old man squad  Derek white and Jalen Johnson were big B150 sleeper targets the guys I very much did not have on my board whereby white Bogdan bogdanovich and Scotty Barnes of that list and then James Harden was one when he was getting drafted in the 20s I said I wouldn't touch him and when he got moved down to the 40s 50s and 60s he became someone that I talked about the very end of draft season and said this is a guy you have to take a shot on in that range it wasn't technically on any boards that we did but he was sort of a late you should probably take this swing guy so we'll call him a net neutral on that so pretty good hit rate for whatever that's worth definitely one that we missed and let's talk about it coming up in a few hours also on the show if you want to know what's up obviously hitting subscribe is the easiest way to do that but we'll have our Wednesday recap show coming in just a couple of hours thanks for hanging with us hope you guys enjoyed this silly little one-off and again if you like it and you say you like it we'll do the worst list we can all laugh together at that one hope we don't have them I'm Dan bass process for Fantasy NBA Today catch you guys in a little bit
