welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  good day everyone happy Thursday to you all  wear my  Kannapolis Cannon Ballers hat today for those that are doing the what the hell's on Dan's head game  this was one of my kids little league teams until they get to machine pitch or higher  they have minor league teams t-ball coach pitch basically these are the minors and then they graduate and they start to get major league teams that's why you've seen some some Kansas City Royals hats popped up he was a royal this most recent season I don't know what he's going to be in January but I am excited to add to the wall oh hats it's a terrible wall right now it just it needs so much it has so little personality I don't even know what that one was I got it at a baseball winter meeting's like it doesn't years ago  what's under that hat  I got a Visalia Rawhide in there I got a Visalia Oaks in there I got Royals Cal like Golden Bears Dodgers cannonballers  I had to retire them Montgomery Biscuits hat it was too gross like a 20 year old hat now that is disgusting so much Schmitz so much sweat in that one  all right it's not story time it's not Hat story time that's for damn sure welcome  foolish Mortals  two fantasy NBA today  December the 14th it's Thursday morning I am Dan Vespers and this is your daily recap show  which used to actually kind of be our own show remember those days those were wild  I've added some more specialty features I still have all these ideas that I want to try out there and I just have no idea when I'm going to be able to pull him off  maybe I could do one this afternoon I doubt it I doubt it voice needs a little break can't do two shows every day oh I guess I didn't do any on Monday  why do you guys need to think here me as I go through my stream of Consciousness on when I can do shows I don't know  I don't know anyway  a couple of reminders here is we hit the ground running find me on Twitter at Dan best for his d a n b e s b r i s Sports ethos.com ethos fantasy BK ethos fantasy BK is the Twitter handle for your sports ethos Newsfeed Discord link is in the show description I hope you guys will come hang out with us over there and also I haven't been able to do as many live questions I'm trying to take the ones that are sort of applicable to all  and that means that a lot of gonna get skipped these days so if you have slightly more specific questions feel free to use the comments board on the YouTube page that's a good way to get a hold of me as I mentioned yesterday I try to keep tabs on those I don't get to them super fast so if it's pressing you're probably gonna want to just get a premium membership and go hit up the premium Q&A that runs all the time in our Discord but if you got time on something that's a great spot to throw your question in  let's talk fantasy sports now  twas a nine game Wednesday Philly blew out Detroit Pistons  Wizards Spurs they may never win again  right time to give up Pistons of lost 20 One games in a row they are approaching the NBA records of lost a mere 18 games in a row  good Lord there some bad teams right now the Pistons are really bad silly thing is that I think I'd rather watch a Pistons game than a Wizards game we'll talk about them in a minute for Philly Kelly oubre up to 23 minutes in this game yes seven out of nine shooting sort of artificially inflated his number but I do think we need to be holding for now just to see how this whole thing shakes out and this isn't a great game to figure it either because it was a blowout super super early Joel embiid is a monster I did say I thought he had a good shot to be the number one player in fantasy this year I did not think that Che was going to be this far out in front but I don't feel bad about the the previous note and embed is mostly played in ball games I think he missed what two I think Paul read out a couple of filling games there for Detroit there the more  influx fantasy team in this ball game Isaiah Stewart got punted partway through this ball game he's probably a streamable play while both Jaylen Duran and Marvin Bagley or out James Wiseman picked up once Stewart got kicked out of the Ballgame and didn't really do anything with it  Cade Cunningham  that is where I think we left off while the audio issues were kicking up here so let's let's try to pick up from there I got farther than that but we'll go backwards Kate's been better he's been more like you know top 70 some odd last couple of weeks so that's at least an improvement  and I think we I think it cut off before I talked about us our Thompson and Killian Hayes and Hayden Ivy I'm not positive though if I'm repeating myself I apologize I don't know where the audio glitched out I'm sorry it's obviously someone that you're starting wild he's starting he may lose this job when guys come back but we shall see as far as killing Hayes and Jade and Ivan go again apologies if I'm repeating myself I don't think either needs to be held  I'll keep it simple on that front Jane Ivy's not playing enough Hayes is playing more but I just don't think the fantasy game is going to translate the way we would need it to  so hopefully I didn't repeat myself there again I have no idea exactly where it's shorted out New Orleans here's your Trey Murphy Breakout game and these are not gonna happen every night he got extraordinarily hot in this one he was hitting multiple three-pointers from 30 feet away it was pretty awesome actually when he gets going he really gets going but also the Wizards are helpful they have no resistance as a ball Club he's not gonna be this good every night but they you know the Assumption here is that it kind of balances out you'll have a big game you'll have a quiet game he's a great shooter gets you some defensive stats this is why you're hanging on Detroit Murphy simple as that  as far as Washington goes another blowout here means that once again Kyle kuzma was basically the only guy to survive it Daniel Gafford was actually okay as well so I shouldn't say only Kyle kuzma tyus Jones was a non-service non Survivor of this blowout loss  Bilal Bilal excuse me could believe he was better again missed both free throws um you know he's big games coming blowouts and  I don't know that I need to repeat myself again he was also a minus 30 in the minutes he was on the floor in this ball game I don't think that's on him necessarily in fact I'd put a lot of what went wrong in this game on Jordan Poole  but I'll get to him in just a second as far as cool the league goes  I've said it before I'll say it again I've stashed him in a keeper League because I think he could be interesting at the end of the season or going into next year but right now there are too many holes in his Fantasy game  you might be like oh Dan it feels like he's been doing really well the last week outside the top 200 last week 13 points 7 and a half rebounds two threes and 54% from the field that all feels okay although again 13 points is really not much he's been a positive in threes boards and field goal percent the last week he's been a negative in assists steals Blocks he's kind of break even actually so you'll take that brutal for free throw number 42% free throws he's like like five for his last 12 and high turnovers and yeah maybe these things level off but so far we haven't seen his ability to hit a free throw and that's why I'm thinking more down the line and I don't feel bad about that but I gotta talk about Jordan Poole I can't get through Today's Show without talking about how truly awful Jordan Poole looks every second he's on a basketball court right now he doesn't care at all  bad passes bad decision making  just everything he's doing on a basketball court screams I'm not into this  he needs to be benched  he needs to be benched  I don't know if the Wizards have the stones to do it  but he needs to be benched and frankly I don't know that he needs to be on fantasy teams  he's been that bad  if you thought it was bad for the whole season it's just getting worse right now he's outside the top 200  his only positives right now are barely points  barely Steals and then for free throw that's the positive negative and turnovers field goal percent blocks rebounds assists even threes for a shooting guard  it's awful and forget the numbers for a minute just watching him play is insufferable  he's that bad I think you can probably drop him in fantasy and yeah I will probably have some good games here and there you know more competitive ones if you know somebody pushes him to the ground early in a basketball game and he gets fired up and actually gives a crap for a few minutes but he doesn't care he does not care watching him play you can see it in the body language he does not care  yesterday was arguably the worst of it  terrible passes his five turnovers were not a fluke  they were just bad bad passes bad decisions and you could see after a number of them teammates were looking at him like what are we doing here like why are you on the court  you don't want to be here don't be here  other guys were trying who's most trying gaffords trying  Jones is trying Denny's trying bilal's trying  the young guys I'm sure would love to get in there and get some more playing time pools not trying  terrible terrible basketball  meanwhile Terry Rozier who was on our cell High board is uh still sell High  again  it depends on what you get back as I said on that show yes today if you can get like a top 50 guy back you probably do it if you can't you just enjoy this run with no lamelo because Rosie is coast in right now he's cruising he's crushing otherwise start the starters PJ Washington got hurt excuse me early in this ballgame which meant that the starters got to play Gigantic minutes and that's big numbers for all five of them Nick Richards filming in for Mark Williams that's a pretty easy call for Miami we're waiting to find out and and again those that are watching can see the little questionable tags on their screen we're waiting to find out if anybody's gonna sit the second half of the heat back to back which would only open up more streaming opportunities as it stands Orlando Robinson is cool off after a couple of sort of surge games I guess we can take him off of the stream board I met as came roaring back in this one and the heat were able to kind of go small they were not super worried about like Nick Richards taking them in the post so Robinson didn't need to play as many minutes and  you know Thomas Bryant was able to play some more more of an offensive minded Center  I think we can probably leave the center's alone Caleb Martin had a poor shooting game overall he actually kind of was okay I mean if the shots were going in this would have been a pretty good one actually so I think you can keep streaming him with everybody out  jacquez bounced back here but he had been fading so I'm gonna lean away from that stream now you know if like see me if Jimmy Butler and Kevin Love and Kyle Lowry and if you have the team takes the second half of the back to back off then my stance changes on a lot of these guys because basically anybody left is a play at that point but let's say that the heat trotted this same nine-man rotation out tonight Duncan Robinson's a go Kyle Lowry's ago Jimmy Butler obviously is a go and I think I would probably go Caleb Martin as the last stream there I think I skip over the other guys now  Hawks had an interesting little note in this ball game and I was going big  oh 30 minutes capella 34 minutes yes that's right  they finally went giant mostly because of stepped out in at 33 pointers in this game he said you know what I can space the floor I'll give you some power forward minutes  that's a big deal if suddenly he in Capella can share a floor  and this is why we've said hold all year long  Ogden and Obey Pascal siakam continue their Ascent for the Raptors it's fun to play the Hawks though everybody gets big numbers but still good to see Anna know be on the rise no real surprises on the Toronto side other than you know guys getting back where they should be Lakers Spurs this ballgame ended up way closer than it needed to be mostly because Victor weapon Jama and keldon Johnson exploded late when he was hitting step back threes keldon Johnson was hitting Runners banging off of Anthony Davis who by the way I have thoughts on ad and his health at the moment but it wasn't enough Spurs actually was a woman yeah I'm a missed free throw that kind of costume lady had a chance to tie the ballgame at the foul line he missed it Spurs had to follow the Lakers add I think then made three out of his four or four out of four I forget foul shots and that was enough to sort of ice this one away the Lakers did for stretches lead between you know 14 and 20 points and then they just kind of stopped defending late which fantasy wise I'm starting to think maybe Kelvin Johnson is just gonna have a better year I still think that he's a cell if you can lock somebody in for anywhere near what his current ranking is which is 57 I just I don't know how 48% shooting lasts all year it feels like it's got to come down  but the good news here is that if Wendy starting at the five that actually moves Kelvin up to the four  that's a big deal when he was starting at the three it looked a lot like what it should have been last year but him at the five or at the four excuse me that's a big deal so I was too low on keldon people always like Dan you never say I do I very much say when I think I've got something wrong I think I was too low on keldon  maybe because I was too high on him last year and then he was a massive disappointment  I still think it's field goal percent tapers off I don't see this lasting the entire year but if he's gonna log huge power forward minutes that's really really good for him get some closer to the bucket increases the rebounding number he's getting assists because the Spurs refused to play an actual point guard so that's something  all that said if you can sell him for top 75 or better I think I would do it  so I was too low on him but also he's still a sell High two thoughts in our heads at the same time I know we can do this  rest of this Spurs someone was like what are your thoughts on Malachi Branham I thought I don't want anything to do I know he starting at shooting guard I don't care I really don't care they're gonna keep mixing and matching yeah and then when banana its Center is nuts right now he's he's going bananas the turnovers and the free throws and the field goal percent this one was better in this one field goal percent was better overall those things are going to be Troublesome for what for when be he's a negative in all three of those but he's such a giant positive in boards and defensive stats right now that it kind of doesn't matter he's number 20 overall and he's been better than that since moving to Center where again he still can't shoot at all but he's averaging five blocks a game the last week probably not a sustainable number duh but 17 rebounds like  there's no other guy to take a rebound away from him right now  enjoy it just enjoy it  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge

on here on the Lakers side there was no LeBron so you know you got more stuff out of camera reddish Austin Reeves Tori and Prince D'Angelo Russell those were all fairly predictable upticks with brown out and then he Davis had a huge ball game but he is moving like molasses these days he came in with a hip spasm that he hasn't been able to shake for a few weeks turned ankle very early in the Ballgame I would not be surprised to see add take Friday off and LeBron come back for that one and the Lakers try to again beat the Spurs down one Superstar because Anthony Davis is moving terribly like he can't he got four steals that's because the Spurs are a God awful basketball team he didn't block a shot some of that that's when bee but some of that is just that he's not moving he can't Elevate right now the way he needs to on defense he can still play offense because on offense you can sort of set your body up to move the way that it's not going to hurt whatever is hurting you  defense you got to go wherever the other guy tells you to go if you're the offensive player regarding goes a particular way you got to be ready to quickly move with him and Anthony Davis right now just can't you know bum hip bum ankle  hopefully he gets a chance to rest a little bit it'll be good for him long-term I know again we're not complaining because the fantasy stats are big  but he needs a breather and he needs one bad  let's keep moving  Indian Milwaukee they had some post-game fireworks where Giannis claimed that Indiana took the game ball but then I guess he had it and so he ended up with a replacement game ball because they wanted one of their guys who scored his first non IST Finals game NBA point to get a game ball and blah blah blah and everybody's fighting over nothing  anyway for Indiana we at least know that there's no sherbet at power forwards we can move on from whatever questions we might have had their and from Milwaukee  there's been nothing for ages there the same guys you're starting  other than now Chris Middleton getting enough minutes to be a more consistent fantasy play if you somehow waited out the first seven and a half weeks of the Season more power to you I still don't want anything to do with Middleton because the next nagging injuries coming and then comes the shutdown not shut down but then comes another ramp up and the minutes are always going to be in check and back to backs are going to be in check  Middleton's gonna be a pain in the butt even if when he's out there now his his numbers are probably gonna be a little bit better for Giannis 32 free throws in this ball game and dodging a bullet is the understatement of the century that he made 75% of them by the way he's number 18 this year despite punt free throw situation going on despite being one of the worst fat free throw by volume guys in the NBA because the average 132 118 defensive stats and just running away with the field goal percent  volume winning board and so if you went Janice in the first to punt free throws your cooking with glass these days with gas I should say  another six blocks for Brooke Lopez I ain't got any problems there still number 21  Rollo  Memphis another big game for Jaren Jackson he is flying up the boards now he's up to number 50 after dropping out the top one hundred that Buy Low window has officially closed hopefully you guys all went and got him when I put him on the Bilo board three freaking weeks in a row we wondered who might take some shots to replace Desmond Bane the answer was Derek Rose who took 14 shots as did David Roddy I'm assuming Bain will be back for the next ball game so we can basically ignore everybody other than JJJ and Bane on this team and John Moran is now about to come back because what are the Grizzlies at 23 games in the books two more games and then Jaws back will also probably see Marcus Smart both of those guys should be on rosters to see how things happen when they come back  biggest free agent you know waiver wire type news of the day does actually come out of Houston where tari Eason logged 27 minutes and went for 25 points 14 rebounds a steal a block in three three-pointers Dillon Brooks did foul out in 28 minutes so that obviously helped the cause Jalen green was all so really really bad in his 24 minutes which actually not all that unusual these days operating has had a little bit of foul stuff but mostly just wasn't playing all that great in this one JJJ was working him over and so you got some different lineups Jay Sean Tate got some extra playing time because of that Jacqueline Dale didn't buy the way Jeff Green picking up some of those backup center minutes so yeah Houston's rotations were odd in this ball game but I don't care tari Eason we know is a fantasy Juggernaut in  starters level minutes and right here he's sort of just sub starters level maybe not gonna go for 25 and 14 but he's an amazing rebounder very good at getting Steals and if he's really adding the three ball well  that's a huge reason to add just to see what happens so try to add to our ease in anywhere you can after his last ball game I think I said if I can remember the exact words probably not but I'm fairly certain that the report from a couple days ago was  if you got dead weight to cut Easton you can add now if you're if you have exclusively players you want to hold on to give it one more game well we did now this was one more game and Eason was amazing so add add add see how it goes deal with it from there  the Knicks behind a very poor game from Jalen Brunson lost to Utah this sort of an unforgivable loss specially when you considered the lineup that the Jazz were trotting out but at least really it's Randall's continuing his hot run Dante even chenzo got warm you can ignore it Isaiah hardenstein played 29 minutes he didn't do much with them but if he's playing that many minutes he needs to be on rosters I mentioned on yesterday's show he's not gonna get assists like he did in previous stops in his career when he was handling some sort of high post passing situations that just not how the Knicks run their offense so it's going to be points sometimes mostly rebounds defensive stats and field goal percent for heart and Stein  typically that'll be enough  meanwhile Josh Hart got 29 minutes and did nothing  every time I think I can get back on board with Josh Hart he does this  so  what the hell is Josh Hart at this point he's number one Thirty One on the season overall I know we got off to sort of a slow start but this is a bad ball game somehow over the last two weeks he's still number 106  so right now I'm inclined to say let's give heart just a little bit more leash  and see what happens in the next ball game before going back to a drop because the minutes have been better and by and large the production has been better and sometimes there's just one really really bad ball game and that's what I'm going to hope this is but if the next one is quiet we'll go back to a drop I'm just gonna hang on one more day One Day More  meanwhile for Utah they're I mean the starting lineup is now out I think yante George got hurt their expecting him to miss at least the next couple of ball games they think they came out and said at least two games that means it'll probably be more than that Lowry marketing came back I think they're on are they on a back-to-back or no let me triple check myself on that Utah's not on a back-to-back are they they are they're on a back-to-back in Portland that's a tough one so he's probably the expectation is that he might sit this one out for a tanking team I don't know why they would play him but you never know still Walker Kessler again Off the Bench came back for this ball game played behind Kelly Olynyk still got a decent fantasy line out of it but you does get weird man you does gettin weird but here's the thing let's start with the gardens County Georgia's out Jordan Clarkson is out we know those guys are out for at least a week between the two of them probably longer meaning we're finally far enough down the pecking order to where Colin Sexton is going to get significant minutes  he needs to be added for the next week  that's probably it I don't like doesn't need this is not gonna be a long term thing but he needs to be on rosters for the next week okay because he doesn't do that much typically besides score at a decent clip  but with the number of guys that are out for this team he's kind of gonna have no choice but to do enough of that I think to be fantasy relevant for a week  fontecchio  bounced back in this one I sorta don't care John Collins could return at any moment and that's good enough for me to say I'm just not gonna worry about it  Kelly Olynyk has the starting center  in my mind means we stream him  but I kind of need to know if he's actually going to be the starting center again or if it's gonna flip back to Walker Kessler I feel like it's gonna be a Linux because I think this team this with the number of guys that they've got out these days I think they need a center that can space the floor and provide a little bit of offense Kessler fits better when Clarkson's in and when Collins is in and when George is in and when marketing is in and there's enough scoring out there that they can just post him in the middle and say all right be the big man  with Olynyk it's like be a big man but also be a pastor be a floor spacer get under people's skin do all the Kelly Olynyk stuff so I think he probably starts another ball game I don't know for sure just kind of trying to read the tea leaves on who they like in terms of fit with the rest of the lineup uh that Kessler remains then to buy low because at some point he's gonna start I think it's just gonna coincide with when the other offensive minded players come back for this team so  I said a lot of things there let me try to kind of pull it all together into one little package Colin Sexton stream for the next week maybe a little bit more we'll see  if I take you on passing Olynyk if he's starting you play him Kessler you're playing him starting or Off the Bench and you're also buying low  keonte George was a guy that I already said was someone that I felt was hard to hold on the Roto side unless you treated him kind of like an injured player  had to head he was a stashables then you probably can hold on to him but  if holding on to George is gonna force you to take two or three zeros in a row you might have to move on that's the  sort of the line on that one  and I think that's basically everybody there  and then Brooklyn Phoenix not too many surprises in this one other than Brooklyn winning the Old Guard came back and got a Victory Camp Johnson Mikhail Bridges I'm sure they wanted this win well they got it congrats you start the starters for Brooklyn right now for Phoenix Devin Booker still went gigantic even with the big three there now admittedly Bradley Beal wasn't particularly involved in this game you only took nine shots he had a use of trade of like 15 where the other big name guys be a Booker was in the high 20s Durant was in the eye twenties nerc was in the mid-20s  I think as Beal comes up you'll see the other guys do slightly less  for Booker this is a really good sign that he's still put up giant scoring and assist totals even with the other main dudes there  I do continue to want to see how all of the chemistry stuff shakes out but for the moment that's a good first sign that maybe Booker won't see the kind of slippage that I still think we can probably expect but if he really is like exclusively Point Booker even though they claimed that Bradley Beal was running point when he was healthy  we'll see  he's at eight assists the Ballgame I thought he'd be in the I-66 to low 7 so he certainly beating my mark on that one um  and it's free throw number is astronomical which I did not also see coming that said I still and who were we talking about earlier in this one oh Terry Rozier I was like no that wasn't the one  doesn't matter who we were talking about my brain is is toast  I still think if you can get a top 120 that that means that I'm low I think that means if you can lock in someone  who has that full appeal like a Steph Curry who's number 15 right now but is  kind of at a basement level for him all the dream on being suspended forever probably not great for staff  I don't know that there's a great match if it feels like Curry's the match if you could use book or to get him you might want to consider doing it because there is a threat  to Booker's usage right now in a way that there is not to steps  that's why you look at it from that standpoint  that doesn't mean you go and you get someone  who like you're just trying to lock in like a top 25 no because if Booker can continue to run you're not going to want to miss out on that but because there is still that small medium whatever you want to call it looming question I do think that this is a concept that that folks sometimes struggle with specially when I talk about it on Twitter because they're just aren't enough characters to express the Nuance of it Booker  could could stay inside the top 10 inside the top 12 yeah  it's not it's not a zero percent chance he could still stay there  my suggestion is merely to say why didn't you try to get somebody who you know is stuck there that doesn't have something that could knock them off their pedestal and with Booker the thing that could knock him off is does Bradley Beal actually get up to sort of Beale level usage at any point or is he going to be new Kevin Love basically where it's like you know what it's fine I'll take like 14 shots a game I don't need to be a guy who takes 18 19 this year  that'd be a different monster  that would mean that it's Devin Booker and Kevin Durant is Superstars and Bradley Beal as like a featured role player  in that case Durant and Booker can stay where they're at  I don't  I think there's at least a 50% shot that Beal ramps up from what he's been at in his two game since coming back I mean nine shots of the low  he's like a spot-up shooter right now I thought that's I don't think that's why they mortgage to another handful of pieces of the farm to go get him I don't think this is the role that they envision  so that's why I'm like okay look like there's a I don't care what percentage you want to call it if you think there's a 75% chance the booker stays where he's at okay great if you think there's a 40% chance these days where he's at okay whatever either way  gives a decent chunk possibility that he doesn't no matter how confident you are unless you're like 100% chance nothing changes which to me feels what short sighted  I call it 50/50 just for argument's sake call 50/50 book or continues to roll at a 29 and 8 clip on great percentages  can you agree on 50/50 call it a coin flip  wouldn't you rather than flip them for a guy who's basically like 100% chance to stay where he's at  sure why not  but if the best someone's willing to give you is like  Desmond Bain or James Harden don't do it  simple as that just stick with what you got at that point  uh take a quick look at Thursday it's actually like not that small of a card tonight that's kind of cool a quick mid show reminder also by the way of the things that I mentioned at the outset which I wouldn't blame you guys for turning the show off at that point because we went through a six minute technical difficulty thank you Windows update did I even explain that I think I explained that Windows update installed an audio driver update in the middle of a live show  that feels like the kind of thing the computer should be like hey do you want to update your drivers while you're doing a show  and I would have said no you stupid stupid operating system don't touch my audio drivers they're

what do we got tonight Cleveland is at Boston and I'm not much in the I'm not much in the Cleveland Boston game  is this a rematch am I remembering that right didn't they just play two days ago  Cleveland Boston game on Tuesday yeah Boston won by seven  Cavs could really use Evan Mobley back I haven't seen an update on him yet this morning  so wait on that  yeah I think that's it Chicago not much there I mean we're in again we sort of like drew the the stash line ahead of Patrick William's these days Caruso's questionable I believe Miami  just waiting to find out if anybody's resting for the Heat and then otherwise we can get right back into the stream and stuff  Timberwolves whether or not Anthony Edwards plays is something Jaden McDaniels by the way is also questionable so they might get him back not that that really changes much but if those guys are back that probably puts a dent into the nas read heater that's been going lately just keep your watch on that Dallas gotta find out who's in who's out  seems like Dante Exum was playable these days depending on who's out that could change we know Kyrie Irving still out and that's obviously the big one but again you're watching Dallas to see you who's playing so then you can think about exim you can think about Tim Hardaway Jr  etc etc  very difficult back to back for Brooklyn in Denver there's a reason the nuggets are favored by nine and a half points in this game presumably Jamal Murray will be back we shall see I think he's probable last I saw yoke which was ejected in the last one so he'll play Casey P I think is the only question for the Nuggets right now  Utah we just talked about a bunch they're in a tough travel back to back up in Portland jazz or down a lot of players but again we just talked about Colin Sexton being interesting and so on and so forth for the Blazers do they get Brogden or DeAndre ayton or both back for this game that would dramatically change who's doing what out there so keep your eye on the health report for that team too Thunder nothing Kings nothing  again other than the fact that I still think Keegan Murray is a Bi-Lo if you can believe that I think he's going higher  and then Malik Monk's been cruising other than everybody sucking in their last ball game Warriors and Clippers is an interesting one Clippers have been playing well lately Paul George is I believe questionable for today's ball game if he's out you could probably stream Norman Powell  but I would argue that the more interesting side of this one is the Warriors side because Draymond Green  Oh  man I  so probably should have talked about this at the outset I know I said I was going to do a better job of talking about news at the front end of the show and then I just completely whiffed on that today so on green is suspended indefinitely indefinitely meaning could be a few days could be a while  the thought and the reporting suggests that Draymond is going to have to go through some sort of counseling and get help for his  constant  outbursts and attacks happening right now and it's like it is out of control  what do I think I think it's probably 10 to 15 games if I had to guess it's a total guess so I could be way off but  that's kind of where I'm at on the how long do we think draymond's out  but also Clay's been bad Wiggins has been atrocious and Steve Kerr's finally giving young girl guys more opportunities so  Brandon Putski we talked about it on yesterday's show he's probably an ad right now to see how this shakes out ah we could end up seeing more Dario sharp I don't know that he makes the cut for 12 team Roto leagues but when they're scheduled is good he's probably good enough to stream and head to head and then Jonathan comingo was already an ad even before Draymond got suspended and this is only going to sort of further solidify that and I would argue he's probably my favorite of the bunch because again he was already taking a leap in Steve kerz eyes and now there's just 30 minutes that opened up so even if he's not playing great on a given night they almost have no choice but to give caming some run he has issues of this for free throw percent sometimes other stuff gets in the way he doesn't get quite as many steals and blocks as you think giving his athleticism but we've seen scoring we've seen rebounding we've seen some threes we've seen seemingly a little bit of progress in just his overall demeanor so Steph you're starting I think I'm still starting clay I'm not starting Andrew Wiggins definitely starting Chris Paul because he went huge the last time dream on was out that's good because it's a lot of our fantasy teams have  Chris Paul around here  but Jim ski wrote coin flip I probably sit him because anytime I'm on the fence with the guy I don't play him against my games Gap but head to head you can go search probably ahead to head go not a roto go for me and then kaminga I mean we've got we're gonna have a window here to sort of scout it out I wouldn't mind if you sat him in Roto for a game but he's probably gonna get to do some stuff and the only thing you run into here is you know is he gonna be dealing with Kawhi Leonard a lot because that could make this particular ball game a little tougher but overall I think I'm starting kaminga in most spots right now and just kind of seeing how it goes  good job burying the lead Dan tomorrow perhaps I'll remember to do the news at the front end of the show but today I did not  all right here's my quick scan of the very busy chat room holy crap you guys posted a lot of questions oh my goodness  um all right I'm gonna scan through them apologies to those that are listening after the fact uh specialty without the video element where you guys can see me like  rapid fire trying to Robo scanning this thing  let's see one question was whether I'm talking eight or nine cat I'm talking nine cat most of the time on this show is markelle fultz a drop  um apparently he's getting closer I think he was spotted actually doing stuff at practice so if you didn't drop him yet now you might as well hang on  what is he gonna be when he comes back I have no idea I think that I think the Apex for him this year was like 90 range so 12 teams he may have been a drop already 14 and deeper you're definitely hanging on at this point and again 12 teams if you've held for this point you might as well just kind of see  you might as well just kind of see where it goes  question about the live premium or the premium Q&A I mentioned that goes on in our Discord I can't elaborate a little bit on that I feel like I don't know who Dr president 23 is I don't know if you're a member or like one of our employees on a burner account but either way I'll answer the question so in our Discord if you have a fantasy pass or other sports ethos premium subscription you let him a mod know that you have a premium pass and they open up new rooms and one of them is a Q&A that runs with the sports ethos Pros all the time chat room is just open and when Pros are around they pop in there and they answer your questions so it's a really cool feature of the premium pass I don't think anybody else on the planet has that type of thing going on so again if you have any premium stuff it's Sports ethos make sure you're using that in our Discord um okay this is where my everything went down thank you you brutal brutal computer in fact I know you guys are all trying to tell me in the chat room and I really appreciate that but it was an alert that popped up in the corner and I'm honored that said installing real Tech audio drivers and I went what do you mean computer I'm talking right now and then I noticed that everything was dead  ah okay a question who do I prefer between hula believe or tari Eason I would prefer Eason  his fantasy profile is vastly superior vastly  Kelly oubre or D'Angelo Russell I'll go Dilo on that one  Kyrie Irving or Dare is Garland Kyrie on that one  do we think bam is going to be good to go soon um you know what I actually don't know on that one I really don't know heater being as usual somewhat  clandestine that's not the word I mean it's sort of is they're just not giving us many updates you know they said he was going to be out for at least a week it's been about that long so hopefully we'll get an update in the not too distant future what I tend to do in situations like this mentally just to sort of prepare myself and say okay I'm just gonna assume he's out for another week or two and if he pops up before then  great  so just set your sights low set the bar low  and if they jump over it terrific  how much time do you think Kyrie is gonna miss  also very nebulous  I'm gonna say two total weeks from the injury  maybe three  all right um  let's see what do we got here a lot of good discussion going on between the people in the chat room I love that  let's see  um I love the chatter but it does make it harder for me to find the questions  here's a question when do I leverage rest of season appeal as a post to picking up the hot hand in a rodeo leak my specific question is whether I should get someone like Atari Eason and drop us our Thomson or herb Jones or Gordon Hayward and attend team or um  I think you could potentially you could probably go east and over us our Thompson right now  because it does feel like he got that starting job back when during and Bagley both went down but in general you know it's gonna come down to like what a guy's doing short term versus someone long term because herb Jones has been very good all season long to this point Gordon Hayward has been pretty well tied to lamelo being out lately but was very good before that so  sort of like okay I don't know what tari Easton's going to be he might fade again if the Rockets if they're Starters play better guys get healthy whatever there's no guarantee that he isn't going to even be good in their next ball game  now if we use a different example of somebody filling in like let's say a Horford let's say poor thing is went down for two weeks or something and Al Horford was out there that's a situation where like look I'm gonna get a top 50 Productions what am I grading that against the the problem the difficulty with your question shining Knight is that we don't know what tari Easton's gonna be in his next ball game even let alone the next week two weeks whatever so there's a hot hand appeal I get it but there's also a lot of question marks with him so in this case you probably just go with guys that you know are playing well which is the three you already have but if the hot hand was a more guaranteed one like a guy filling in and moving from 20 minutes a game to like 36 minutes a game then you start to think okay like if I can get two weeks of top 50 and the guy I'm dropping is more like a plotting 90 100 10 kind of guy that's where you definitely make the swap hopefully that strategically makes some sense  someone's asking about what's a good return for Lowry marking you're not gonna get a good return right now because he just came back he's not playing well yet once he gets going you could probably aim for pretty much anybody inside the top 20  based on what he did last year and how he started this season but you're gonna need him to look good for a week or two before you could potentially trade from like any point of strength  and that's where I'm gonna pull the plug on things I appreciate you guys putting all these amazing questions in there what I will say is if I didn't get to your question wait till I close out the show here in 30 seconds or whatever put it in the comments I don't care if there's like 20 comments that pop up eventually I'll get to them truly I think I can say I promise that  comment section that's where you go with it  please like like I'm working so hard right now please like the show Please Subscribe if you guys like what I'm doing at some point I'm gonna go back and try to edit out the audio difficulties in the middle but YouTube won't let me do that for like 12 hours so sorry to folks watching after the fact I'm probably gonna try to put a time stamp on this so folks know that they can jump over a few minutes but also I'm not that great of a producer so  oh well I'm Dan Vasquez on social come find me on Discord come find me all the links are anywhere you need them they're all in the show description  might have a show this afternoon leaning towards probably know because I'm tired but we'll see I have this one idea I've been wanting to do forever  we'll see all right see you later for now everybody
