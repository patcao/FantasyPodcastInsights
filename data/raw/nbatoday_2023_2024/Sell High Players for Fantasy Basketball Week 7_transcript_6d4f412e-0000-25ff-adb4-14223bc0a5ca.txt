welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  hey what's cracking everybody Welcome to our week 7 sell High episode of fantasy NBA today I am your host Dan best briefs and a very happy what is it today Wednesday doesn't matter the show hopefully we'll have a shelf life of more than one day guess we'll see you can find me on social at Danbury please friends if you're catching us for the first time like And subscribe something  to something I don't know I'll get my verbs and prepositions and Etc I'll get it all right either way you guys get the gist please do sort of put a  it doesn't even have to be a real coin in the Coffer it's just like an effort coin  I need an effort coin from you whatever that might be today we only have three names and they're a little bit weird actually because  look here's the thing as the season goes they're going to be fewer and fewer players that consensus is going to believe the wrong thing  at the beginning of the year you have a ton a lot of guys that are over-performing small sample size theater  underperforming same kind of thing  so we have tons of names five six seven names at a time sometimes  but as guys come back to where they belong  they're just not gonna be on the list anymore  and also I feel like certain guys even though they're in the cell High Universe like say one of my favorite players to roster and fantasy Brooke Lopez yeah he's probably a cell high at number 21 but what do you gonna get for him  herb Jones same general story these low-scoring high ranking guys who were there because of defense and percentages you're not going to get back a good return on those dudes so even though they are technically sell hi guys there's no point in doing it  which makes it very hard to isolate a true list of cell High players once you're two months into the season and we're not quite that but we're getting there  so now we pivot into some different things little things reasons to sell guys that maybe are still kind of in that small sample size Universe even though we're farther into the season you'll see what I mean by that in a minute  and then guys where I feel like maybe you can lock in some value whatever that might be for one particular reason  so let's go ahead and just embarked upon that right now here is your week seven sell High board trying to decide where I want to put my face here for this broadcast  you know what I'll go to the side we'll go side because it makes my face just a tiniest bit larger chat room is open all the I don't think we'll be doing questions on this one but feel free to talk them Talk Amongst yourself as the  it was a Mike Myers character on Saturday Night Live first name on the list and this is honestly this is probably your best one but I guess you could debate it with the second name and it's not even Mitchell  who  I actually like a lot this year and you guys probably remember during the run-up to the season I called him what I thought was a very safe middle of the second round pick  because by all accounts his role was going to be pretty much the same year over year last season to this season he shot out of his mind from the field last year at 48% I thought okay there's a reasonable chance that that number comes down he was above his career Mark and field goal percent and three-point percent  and free-throw percent mind you although that one certainly wasn't by quite as large of a margin  the assists were down a little bit last year because he's playing alongside Darius Garland instead of in Utah where he was both the shooting guard and the point guard pretty much all the time sorry Mike Conley you didn't get to really do anything until dawn of it left  and so last year ended up being this massive season he was I think number like 14 at the end of the year on a per game basis it was it was fantastic it was marvelous it was number 15 on basketball monster  last year was it 20 8 points for boards four and a half assists one and a half steals like everything was great  so coming to this season the thought was you take Donovan Mitchell somewhere near where he finished last year the floor is very very high because he's not even Mitchell he's gonna get a crap ton of usage he's probably gonna miss a handful of games because he's  I don't want to say long in the tooth but he's not a young buck by NBA standards anymore  but at least you knew that like a worst case scenario for him was just inside the top 30 that would have been a really bad season for Donovan Mitchell and if you take him at 16 17 18 something like that ending up at 30 is not going to ruin your team  and a lot of what we try to do at the beginning of drafts is take guys that aren't gonna ruin your team unless you get stuck in kind of a weird draft position and then you know you're forced to take a slightly bigger swing but if you were a mid first rounder and you had a shot to get Donovan Mitchell in the middle of the second round it seemed like a very reasonable thing to do  as it's turned out through the first couple of months ignoring the injury stuff which I get it is not easy to do we missed whatever it was for five ball games already but he's played in 150 low number he's been by all accounts better than last year  field goal percentage is back down near his career Mark but his free throw number is setting records for himself right now he's at six free throws a game and he's at 90% on those  so most free throws he's taken  well let's see I guess we could try to pull up the full career numbers but certainly the most free throws he's taken since he's been in Cleveland and the most he's taking in something like seven or eight years that's as far back as my calendar goes right now he got six he's at 6.1 he had six in Utah right before he got traded basically but he's never been a 90% before mid-80s consistently for the last three or four years low 80s before that always been a good foul shooter but right now he is going nuts at the free-throw line  so all this stuff is good scoring is down by about one point year over year but a lot of that's because the field goal percent is back down where we kind of expected it to be but the usage is actually higher this season  some of that was because Darius Garland missed a couple of ball games some of that is just like the natural ebb and flow of a season  but the reason that I have Donovan Mitchell on the cell High board  is  mostly because of one statistical category with an honorable mention to free throw percent which by the way he could just have a really good free throw shooting year  even that 90% feels like a little bit of a stretch but you never know  so thought is free throw percent probably comes down from 90 which again not that far but even 87% does make a difference in his value I don't think the field goal percent is changing all that much I feel like last year was probably more the anomaly than the norm so what we're focusing on right now forget this light uptick in usage let's just assume that that levels off as Darius Garland now settles in and he's healthy  is the defensive stats  because never in Donovan Mitchell's career has the average as many defensive stats as he's averaging right now  that's the thing that I really want you guys to hang on to  he is at  2.1 steals  and 0.5 blocks  that's 2.6 together  fairly simple math so we don't need to get too much into that  but it's always it's kind of hard  it's not difficult to remember but  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run

to remember  how much  defensive stats can impact a player's fantasy rank  I mean looking at herb Jones and Brooke Lopez is a great example of how defensive stats can launch a player all the way up the board without doing a whole lot of anything else again I love those guys but that's kind of what's going on there for Donovan Mitchell he's been in the NBA for what like 6-7 years now  by the way feels like he's been around longer than that doesn't it  it's drafted in 2017  anyway feels like he's been around forever he hasn't been around forever Utah for Five Seasons now Cleveland for two  point is he's never in his career been higher than one point nine and that was last season which was part of the reason that he was able to push his way up the board last year  because he was pretty consistently between 1.2 and 1.7 combined defensive stats in Utah jumped up to 1.9 that was a combo career bests and now this year 2.6  way out in front of anything he's done before  could he somehow managed to hold above two steals a ball game anything's possible truly anything's possible  but it's not probable  the scoring seems fine the rebounds the same fine the assists maybe they taper off a tiny bit again that's the Darius Garland effect  free throws I do still think they come down a little bit but we can't really guarantee that we can almost guarantee that the defensive stats are going to come down because he's at a career high and blocks right now which again I know point five career high previously was 0.4 doesn't seem like all that much but you know 8 to 10 blocks over the course of a season actually does matter and it factors into your fantasy rank but the Steels is the big one he's half a steal above any season he's had before  two steals a week over an entire season we're talking about 30 40 50 steals over the course of a year  that feels unlikely to stick  mostly because I mean how many guys actually averaged two steals of all game most years not many  Shae Gill just Alexander is the only player in the NBA averaging more steals per game than Donovan Mitchell who's actually played in some ball games Marcus Smart who's out he was at two and three Simon's played one ball game so that one had nothing to do with anything and then Jalen Suggs who I think we can all agree is one of the best  most disruptive perimeter defenders in the NBA right now he is a 1.9  Donovan Mitchell is fine on defense he's never been a great defender  and so this is a number that we just know is gonna come down because he's mostly been at one point zero to 1.5 in that department he was at 1.5 with the Caps last year so maybe we assume that that repeats itself and when it does this is a very long explanation to get to this when it does when his free throw percent levels a little bit when is Steals and blocks level a little bit he's not gonna fall that far because there's other stuff is still excellent but if you take everything that he did last year  and remove the field goal percent element from it  even if you add the free-throw percent he's still ends up in the second round  which doesn't feel like that many slots I get it moving from number six down to like number 14 which is what I have on the screen here for for those watching the video  that's not that far  but eight slots at the top of the board moving from number six down to number 14 is the equivalent of moving from like number 25 to number 50  the drop offs are just larger for each individual player at the top of the board  so what I would suggest doing and this you know again your hair is a little bit here if you love Donovan Mitchell it's totally fine to just ride him out it's not like he's gonna fall off a cliff he's just going to level as we go  but he's been so good so far that you could probably get someone else who has more I don't say Bonafide MidFirst round appeal but just a safer top 10 type of guy I think Donovan Mitchell's been good enough to wear that could actually work  someone like a Steph Curry who was behind on of a Mitchell right now mostly because his steals are low at the moment but I get the feeling that those two guys are probably going to flip places between now and the end of the year Donna Mitchell six or seven Steph is at like 13 they probably flip why well like I said I think Donovan steals come down I think Luca probably slows as the year goes Tyrese Maxey Scotty Barnes at Holmgren Larry Martin and all these guys are gonna slow a little bit as the season goes on even Devin Booker if Bradley Beal ever plays  that'll allow staff to move up the board Donovan Mitchell will just sort of slide with these other guys and Damian Lillard's gonna move up and Kawaii is going to move up and blah blah blah blah and guys just sort of find their way  so again you're not like  you're not trying to lock in like a top 25 type of value is not even Mitchell is better than that  but it does feel like he's right to drop about seven eight slots as the numbers level off and if you can use him to get a guy drafted MidFirst round just one of them bonafides I think I would do it  but again we're talking kind of around the edges it's a little bit fringy I get it this isn't the easiest show to do right now next name on the list is CJ McCollum and I have questions on how the universe sees him at the moment but I do know that his top 15 ranking right now is not going to hold and this one is a much easier call to make because a lot of stuff happening with CJ is even farther out of the norm and I shouldn't say a lot of stuff it's kind of a few things with CJ are much farther out of the norm where Donovan Mitchell it doesn't look like much but half a steel is a big deal and the free throw percent is a big deal from a column it pretty much comes down to two categories and they are the defensive ones because the interesting about thing about CJ McCollum is that he's pretty much done the exact same thing from a fantasy standpoint for eight consecutive years  there is almost never been a player more  statistically consistent  then CJ McCollum  go all the way back to 2015 in Portland you want to hear his scoring every year since then  and remember there was one season where he was traded so you'll you'll hear two numbers for that year but 2015 in Portland all the way to this season 20.8 23 21 and a half 21 222.2 23.1 24.3 that was the half-season New Orleans 20 and a half it was the first half of that season in Portland 20.9 in New Orleans last year and 20.7 in New Orleans this year  you want to hear CJ's rebounds over that stretch 3.2 3.644 4.2 3.9 4.5 4.3 4.4 4.2  on here's field goal percent over those eight years 44.8 48 oh that'll happen that year 44.3 45.9 45.1 45.8 49.3 during the half season that was the half in New Orleans where he was very hot  first half of that year 43.6 last year 43.7 this year 44.6  he is a pillar of consistency we have seen his free throw percent sort of drop off the last four or five years but even then if you want to go to just free throw percent you're talking four or five years 75.7 there's a 70.6 a 76.9 a 77.8 it's crazy  how consistent CJ McCollum has been in counting categories for almost a decade in a row so when you see something that's unusual you can feel pretty damn confident it's going to become usual and right now for McCollum much like with Donovan Mitchell defensive stats are wacky  he's at a career high 1.7 steals per ball game and at a career high one block per game  but remember  Oddities show up much more clearly when a player missed a bunch of time through the first two and a half or two months of the Season asthma column has he's only played nine games to this point  nine blocks and nine games  is a lot easier to get than 82 blocks in 82 games  for a player like McCollum  he has never posted more than 0.6 blocks per game during any extended run  and he's never posted more than one point three steals per game during any kind of extended run which interestingly was his 26 game stretch after the trade into New Orleans where he didn't block a shot  for two months straight  he's a 2.7 combined defensive steals football game in his career he has never been above 1.6  okay so then the follow-up question is Dan what difference does that actually make I mean 2.7 to 1.6 that doesn't seem like that big of a deal well I already told you what McCollum did last year statistically right 21 points four and a half boards 5.7 assists almost 33s 44 from the fields 77 at the free-throw line 2.4 turnovers 1.4 defensive stats  and this year he's at 20.7 points 33 is for assists just about six or four rebounds just about six assists 44 and some odd from the field 77 and some odd from the free throw line  only 1.4 turnovers by the way I don't know what it's gonna happen with that number I would assume it takes up just a little bit but 2.7 defensive stats do you know what is 9 cat rank was last year  88  and he's at 15 this year basically on the shoulders of doubling his defensive stats  and shaving his turnovers by one that also has played a role  does that mean he's gonna fall all the way to 808 know not necessarily that's not a that's not a guarantee we can't assume that that it's gonna come all the way back down but I think it's pretty fair with whom it's going to come part of the way back down and so from a column as those things level off and everybody else in the league kind of finds their endpoint he probably falls back towards 50  and I think even though it's only nine games I feel like people have seen enough right now to say ooh this guy scores 21 points and he gets some boards and rebounds and Steals and blocks and people are getting sort of all hopped up on the CJ McCollum juice I think you could probably get somebody in the 40 range for him who I don't know  dejounte Murray possibly Tyler hero who's hurt I don't know that that's when I would necessarily Target if someone's frustrated with Freddie Van Vleet I would definitely do that they shouldn't be by the way he's in the mid-40s which is like six slots later than where he was drafted but you never know  could you get  Jimmy Butler after a bad ball game I doubt it but it's worth a try sabonis Myles Turner outbreak and goon all of these guys I think I would rather have Mikhail Bridges probably a harder one to get Jane Lin Brunson  I don't know how much deeper I'd go  but  again like we've seen enough of McCollum a decade to know  that number isn't going to stick  last name on the board and this one's gonna look super weird to the folks that are watching on the screen is bogged on book Donovan who I listed this is nine cat rank is number 49 and his end Target rank is all so 49 and the reason I did that was to illustrate a point  bug zdanowicz is not a sell High because I think his numbers are gonna fall off in fact I think he's playing pretty damn well right now 54 by the way in basketball monster he's 49 on Yahoo I do still think it steals come down so perhaps I should have like just slightly adjusted his per game ranked but it was to illustrate a point  the point here on Bogdan bogdanovich is not to lock in a player with a better per game ranked because of anything that's going to go wrong with bogdon's game 15 in some odd points some threes you know good free throw percentage like this stuff is all pretty repeatable for him  but besides the steals likely coming down from one and a half to more like one or 1.2 yes that's gonna move him down the board but more than anything you're trying to lock in a player who doesn't have a lingering chronic knee issue and we know this about Bogdan  at some point this year that needs gonna knock him out and we don't know when and we don't know what it's going to start in terms of like a spiraling effect  maybe he pushes it off maybe this is the year where he plays in more ball games than usual but you have sort of a double whammy here of understanding that yeah even if the steals only come down from one point five to one point two that's still enough to push him around or two down the board and then the injury wrist that's around that I mean you can't really quantify that by round but you can certainly qualify that by saying look I just rather have somebody who's nearby him in rank even if it's around or around and a half deeper down the board that I just trust to not have a chronic issue D'Angelo Russell  about eight to ten slots down the board rather have him  Terry Rozier Daniel Gafford  DeMar DeRozan Tobias Harris Jared Allen  vouch  Levine if someone would give him up I doubt for boat on  Jakob Pirtle  these are all guys that you I think you can trust better to stay upright click capella  they're not ranked as high as booked on right now  click Appel is not exactly a pillar of Health himself  but you just like you see where they are and they're either  at their floor or their at their cruising speed  this is a harder one to pull off I admit it because he's still bogged on bug zdanowicz and that's why I think you can look deeper don't try to get him for it don't don't try to flip him for another top 50 guy try to flip him for somebody who's around to two rounds farther down the board someone will feel like maybe they're getting to trade up for somebody who's been better per game than the guy they're giving up but you're getting rid of the guy who you know has a weird knee injury and you know his deals are gonna come down like he's just not gonna get that many playing the minutes he's at he's out there to go to fire away offensively he's got the full on green light but he's never been a one and a half steals Guy for game and he's never been a fully healthy guy  and that's actually our show for this one Believe It or Not only three players on the sell high list again I tried to find sell High players that I thought you might be able to move for someone because they're all these names out there where I know analysts are like so high on this guy but it's like  can you  I'd love to sell high on herb Jones but like the world isn't going to give you what you want for him  so okay what do I do and like I'd love to sell high on Chad homerun who probably doesn't finish at number 11 this year but what do you get  is somebody gonna give you a top 15 guy back nah  someone Gonna Give You top 20 probably know  25 even that has a stretch you probably get top 30 back for home good right now but what the hell's the point just see what he does maybe stays inside the top 25 all year  so you're not even locking in value with that so assessing these cell highs what is a cell High versus supply low what is there an actual point to doing it  that made it really hard for me to come up with this list because I like I was I was struggling but then I was like okay I got a few here that we can kind of slice off a couple pieces of pie see if we can turn it into something  no questions for our
