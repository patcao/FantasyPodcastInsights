welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  that was some kind of night  oh my God  what a big Wednesday to start things off man that was crazy  you know what the coolest part about  our first big Wednesday was is that  not only did we have some late round sleepers that went bananas but we actually legitimately had  and I was just talking about this either on a show or with a person I can't remember where the hell it came up we legitimately had a dude that was not getting drafted  go Bonkers last night and do it in a way that looked at least someone sustainable  I'm really excited about this  first things first to anybody that's watching live please throw something in the chat room it's already buzzing I know everybody wants to hear her thoughts on thoughts on big Wednesday that is open here on YouTube for those that are watching after the fact welcome those that are listening on iTunes Spotify whatever other RSS feeds you can pool together out there thank you as always I am Dan Vespers at Dan Bass Pros d a n b e s b r i s on social media this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos prezen station I also had an opportunity yesterday to do a tutorial video for our five new tools

remember today maybe I won't we'll find out in a little bit won't wait but if you're watching on YouTube now or even after the fact in your chat room is enabled on your player you can just click that link and roll right on into our free Discord side which went completely insane last night and welcome to the like 90 new people that showed up anywho we've got stuff to cover so let's go ahead and throw some of yesterday's box scores on the screen and just our break and stuff down  we'll start at the top and it's gonna be a minute because there were a lot of them Atlanta at Charlotte one of the biggest stories of the night we get to talk about right out of the Chute and that's Jalen Johnson playing 29 and a half minutes off of the bench putting up 21.7 boards to assist two steals a block and a three-pointer Jalen Johnson one of the big time brewski 150 sleepers anybody that got the list knew that he was a big time guy and I'll tell you guys we tried our best on that one to kind of I don't want to keep a lid on it but like you don't want to push his ADP up the board too far  and we I think we did a pretty good job of that basically to say anybody that had to be 150 was typically able to get Jalen Johnson because he was going late he went late  until the very end of time and wow what a start  and the amazing part is that you know wasn't like he stole minutes from anybody they literally found 29 minutes for him off of the bench without diminishing almost anyone uh you know John DeAndre Hunter who will not interested in fantasy I Still Play Just 31 minutes to start Deontay Murray 33 Trey young 36  capella 29 on Yakko Kang woo 19 by the way don't worry about that okongo had foul issues  and we we talked about this before Oh Congo is a top 100 to 125 range guy when capella is healthy and he's a top 40 when Capella's out so you just kind of have to balance that over the course the full season  the only spot you could argue that maybe a few minutes got taken away from a starter is saddiq Bey who still had 29 and I actually had a pretty damn good game himself who by the way I think babe belongs on fantasy rosters too he just less exciting because five steals is probably not a sustainable number you figure they'll be fewer steals more threes for him  there were a lot of free throws in this game all so if you're looking at like field goal attempt number Atlantis is going to look a little bit lower but a lot of that is because they took 33 foul shots in a losing effort mind you but who cares because Jalen Johnson was incredible  Hong Kong will be fine don't worry Don't Panic everything will be totally fine  over on the Charlotte side the big story I think is how good Mark Williams looked  13 points 15 rebounds three steals in a block on 56 shooting he was terrific in 30 minutes so Nick Richards got the other 18 meaning we don't have to worry about it Brandon Miller played 25 minutes off the bench he was fine nothing spectacular there not something you really need to worry about yet PJ Washington scored 25 points but he had a really good shooting game I think he's probably someone that hangs out maybe just outside the top 100 which is fine in a lot of formats but you know not something you're super targeting  the this stuff that I was paying attention to on the Charlotte game was Mark Williams for one and that was a big positive Terry Rozier was what's he what's his role and it looks pretty similar last year he had a crapper of a night shooting foul shots but if it's not for that it was actually pretty good game for Terry and then Gordon Hayward who last year I got off the Gordon Hayward thing really early and I want to like this is part Maya culpa and part I got it right because with Hayward  right in the beginning of the year I said hey this is a guy worth exploring he was going late in drafts historically he's been top 75 or better but I watched him for a few games and you could immediately tell that he just didn't have any bounce anymore now he did have 10 points eight boards seven assists he only took eight shots yesterday if he's full facilitator mode on this team it could work I think you only have to go as far as a watch list for him at least for the time being  we got a lot of games to cover so let's keep moving here Washington at Indiana was the next one on the board on the wizard Side Kyle kuzma was efficient which I don't think is gonna be the case every night I you know he's to me more of a points League type of play I know like  it's easy to get caught up in one game sample size of hey he shot the ball well and he made all of his free throws  you could look at the other side too and say he didn't have any rebounds or assists he did have two blocks this whole level off we know what cooze is he's gonna be a high field goal attempt guy you're going to need to get your value on volume from here you're not gonna be able to count on this level of efficiency and you just hope that everything balances out he's not somebody I drafted in anywhere in any League that wasn't a sort of volume-based League meaning points leagues or additional category type of stuff  tyus Jones pretty good first game they got blown out or he would have seen another probably five six minutes in the fourth quarter so good but could have been better Jordan Poole was someone I did not draft anywhere outside of volume leaks as well you someone I kind of focused on as a points League side because of the fear that the bottom could fall out on pool and like we got it right out of the Chute here on him it's not gonna be this way every ball game but I watched a lot of this one live this was a game I wanted to see what Indiana and Washington were doing with their rotations and how the offense looked and for the Wizards there wasn't a whole lot of ball movement  I know they had 28 assists and it was like but they played one of the highest octane teams in League the ones that what you want to get out and run all the time  Wizards got to figure out a better way to get everybody involved not do a lot of pool and kuzma trading off ISO plays and we'll see if they can pull it together I like yellow in 17 minutes off the bench you're not going to pick him up because 17 minutes ain't enough but if you ever gets his legs underneath him he could be someone you pay attention to the big stories I think are number one Daniel Gafford only 21 minutes he had five fouls that was the issue there so don't panic on Gafford Deni avdija is not someone I've been targeting I'm afraid of his efficiency and turnovers he can get rebounds and assists and steals which is sort of interesting but I'm not big on the avda train the train I'm on for Washington is Dylan Wright who played 25 minutes right out of the Chute here I loved it 8 points 6 boards six assists three Steals and a three-pointer I'm all about it man  I'm all about it  if he's getting 25 minutes we saw what he was able to do last year basically in that same general number I want to make sure I pull up the stats and get it right he played 24 and a half minutes to game last season average seven points three and a half boards four assists in almost two steals a game and that was good enough for top 65 value  so I'm all aboard the Dell on right freight train he's another one of my ads from yesterday on top of Jaylen Johnson no obvious things to do on the Pacers side I would say if you drafted Obi top in late  and you were hoping for a massive breakout you had to always know that Rick Carlisle was going to be going hot hand with almost everybody on that team that's not Halliburton Myles Turner and probably Bruce Brown this year because they gave a bunch of money to come in and and be that glue guy and that's what you saw yesterday buddy hield got 25 minutes off the bench he was decent bennedict mathurin seems like he might be moving his way into more consistent minutes and you got some steals  I'm not sold on bathrooms nine cat value yet he might get there but I'm not sold on it Andrew nem hard got 22 minutes off the bench a lot of that was because it was blowout late or Halliburton would have picked up another probably seven eight minutes in the fourth quarter now Hearts double-double not at all sustainable I have and also we've seen enough to know that he really doesn't do anything besides assist which is a weird  fantasy profile but it is his and then topping 19 minutes any Smith 23 minutes Jaylen Smith 14 foul played but very active minutes Isaiah Jackson 11 a lot of people had a lot of stuff on the Pacers because they put up 143 points but the one that I think everybody was looking at was topping and day one was I would say a negative this is something to make us think that his minutes are not going to be even remotely close to guaranteed but I'd like to give it another one or two games to kind of see how it goes or at least a competitive game  Boston beat New York this one Celtics got off to a big lead Nick's came back but we're unable to get up and over the hurdle giant first game for Kristoff or sing us everybody called it a Revenge game but come on he's been gone from New York for years this was just a very good basketball player playing with the best teammates he's ever been with  you guys know me I tried to get Chris Dobson a lot of rotol League's I am afraid of him a bit in head-to-head he probably beats his ADP on both totals and per game but you don't really want to be thinking about the injury stuff hanging over him all the time so but games cap style he's he's gonna dominate this year he's gonna have a fantastic season he's not always going to be quite this efficient with the 10 free throws being a pretty big number for him but I would expect you know slight drop off from last year he was basically a turn guy on a per game side maybe falls back into the mid-late second round per game but that's still beats his ADP buy a bunch  great first game for Jayson Tatum strong first game for Derek white in 32 minutes Drew holiday is someone that I did not draft I was just kind of worried that he wasn't gonna get enough shots and you know luckily for Drew he does a bunch of other stuff but I don't have him anywhere Jalen Brown is another guy that I called kind of a safe play but I also don't have him but for I think one League  I just I hate I don't like drafting wings that stuck that darn good at free throw shooting kind of early  Jane let me be fine he'll bounce back he'll love his better ball game Tatum will have a game that's a little weaker and same with poor singing this but look you've got your five starters with the Celtics in those the guys you're playing because they only went nine players deep last night and frankly they really only used one player in any substantial amount Off the Bench and I was all for it who played 26 minutes  you can watch list for it if you want I don't think 26 minutes is enough for him so this may officially be finally the year he is quote too old for the old man squad and  you'll all be happy to know that I was aware of it and I did not draft him anywhere Nick's side was interesting Nick's side was a weird one so Mitchell Robinson you know he had his issues they were actually a plus one when Mitch Robb was on the floor and a minus 5 when Isaiah hardenstein was out there those two guys split the center minutes basically down the middle I think most games you're gonna see Robinson get more like 2820 kind of split and that should be enough for for Mitchell to be inside the top 100 pretty easily this game was a bad one duh my bigger issue yes by the way the short version there is hold on to Mitchell don't do anything nuts but the slightly longer version is keep an eye on heart and shine because if he starts to take over at that Center Spot in any meaningful way he has a really good fantasy game we didn't get to see it last night but we know it's there  Jalen Brunson Couldn't Shoot Julius Randle couldn't shoot I mean the Knicks as a team really couldn't shoot from anywhere free throws were terrible field goal was terrible they were kind of  it's actually borderline insane that they were in this ball game with his bad as they shot but the big story is there a manual quickly really nice game 20 28 bench minutes I like it he's an ad to me and basically all formats to see all this plays out Clinton Grimes probably droppable Josh Hart unfortunately probably droppable if his bench it's aren't in the high 20s to 30 range like they were at the end of last season if you have Grimes and heart I'd say give it one more game don't make a move off one day but don't hold on too long because they're all these insane guys popping up that you don't want to miss out on  I don't have too many thoughts on Orlando Houston this game was ugly really only one rocket played normal minutes and that was Freddie Van Vleet who was fine not good fine he'll be better than this most days Dillon Brooks I think will probably get more than seven shots most games but I don't like him in nine cat anyway I'll print started fast slowed down in this one ended up with 14 186 which I think you'll take in a game where his team got spanked but the stuff that creeps up with him crept up again the free throws two for four at the foul line is it going to be enough are there going to be enough shots  what are the defensive stats settle on I think shengwen actually kind of repeats what he did last year but we'll see there's a possibility that he gets a little more Jack Lando only played nine minutes which is good news for Sheng goon although I think some 10 Center minutes may have gotten chewed up by a weird combination of Jabari Smith Jr and Jeff Green just something to kind of keep in the back of your mind but I don't want to make too many sweeping decisions based on this ball game same story for our Lando call Anthony he's gonna get picked up at a bunch of spots and they'll get dropped when Jalen Suggs has a better ball game and he takes all of those minutes back we saw it all of last year you guys may or may not remember this Cole Anthony Jalen Suggs could not coexist from a fantasy standpoint when one had a good game the other bad one it happened the whole second half of last year when those guys were both healthy and it happened again  Johnathan Isaac 14 minutes keep one eye on him in case he gets into the 20s if he hits 20 he's an ad otherwise blow out game throw it out the window and move along to this low scoring stinkfest Toronto beat Minnesota 9794 and nobody could shoot other than apparently ogn and Nobby he was the only regular in this game that actually shot better than 50% from the field I mean I guess you could say yakka Pirtle but he only took three shots  fantasy story lines hold Kyle Anderson he played 30 minutes off the bench that's more than enough for him to have good fantasy value hold on my Conley he was fine you know again steering the ship the assist will be a lot better I would think for both of these teams if they have a better shooting night Anthony Edwards made up for his bad shooting with a nice rebounding number and Rudy gobert interestingly at the best fantasy game of anybody on the Timberwolves maybe he ends up being a little bit of a value at a you know 80P near 70 or maybe this is just a really good ball game against a team that took it to the rim and he defended it the one thing I also like was cat getting four blocks nine blocks total for the Wolves 11 blocks over on that Toronto side huge first game for Anna nobian Scottie Barnes he'll feel pretty good about those guys after one game we'll see how that goes over the next couple of weeks Dennis Schroder is the one he and yakka turtle actually the two guys know three excuse me Gary Trent  shooter 22 and 7 no defensive stats for three pointers the no defensive stats is relatively common for someone as fast as shooter has been he's never really been a good steals Guy and the threes were very high for him he is more of a one to one and a half three pointer a game type of dude I don't expect that to change a bunch it makes a lot of sense in points because of the holes in his Fantasy game I highly doubt he's able to keep anything like this up on the nine cat side but you know if he does then I'll you know I'll wear that one I just  he feels like a 100 to 130 range guy in nine category leaks and much better than that on the points League side  for turtle only 24 minutes that's enough for him to have top 100 value but obviously we want more than that so let's just keep one eye on that one should chewa took up the other Center minutes and that was kind of annoying Gary Trent 27 bench minutes I don't think that's enough for him frankly especially not when he's the like the focal point so  I give Gary Trent one to two more ballgames kind of the same story we had with who the hell were we just talking about up above over on the Nicks like a Josh Hart same thing give it give it a couple more games maybe call one week altogether on Trent and we'll see where he settles after that  Detroit Miami it was Kate Cunningham versus the universe and this was certainly one of the big Arguments for drafting Cade is does he have any help offensively in the answer with boy on zdanowicz on the Shelf is now not really k-30 points 9 assists managed to do it efficiently which is going to be the big thing if he's really you know Kate against the universe  Jalen Duren was awesome what a wonderful first game for Duran  I don't know that the blocks hold up for is a lot but the rebounds I think do not that he's gonna average for 14 but he's one of the best rebounders  just on it like all you have to do is see it we've talked about this a thousand times I love watching Jalen Duren rebound because people just explode off of him  the bigger stories in this game I thought I said Stewart had a 14 and 14 double double which is special no defensive stats did it two three-pointers we know we can step out and hit the three ball the team was actually generally better in this game when he was on the floor  he's not a priority ad for me not the way that some of the other guys are like a Jalen Johnson we talked about in my eyes Dillon right I like more even and then we'll talk about Max strus but Stewart's like right behind them  as maybe you're like top honorable mention ad from last night because the rebounds are nice the threes were nice if you could mix in a defensive stat then you're really cooking and you know the like the good news here is that nobody came for his minutes James Wiseman didn't even play Marvin Bagley got 16 total minutes off the bench so that's good for Stewart after Thompson 27 minutes that's something five blocks is amazing but bad field goal percent bad free-throw percent turnovers too high for a guy who's not really involved that much on offense uh  I love the future for Azure Thompson I just think it's gonna take  at least half a season to get there  so someone maybe you could think about trying to buy low on perhaps in December  I don't know we're taking a stab at the date on that we'll see how it actually shakes out over time Killian Hayes I don't think needs to be rostered Jaden Ivy I don't think needs to be rostered I didn't draft those guys anywhere and I don't even know that I mentioned them during draft season which  for better or worse I guess if I had mentioned them I would have said I don't like it Miami was relatively predictable in this one with the one very large exception that's Kevin Love logging 28 minutes as the starting power forward when I think we all thought Caleb Martin would get a lot of that some of this may be because Detroit runs a two big lineup with Stuart and Duran I don't think you get 28 minutes of Kevin Love Every ball game I think you'll see more of Caleb Martin against smaller faster Rainier teams but they needed his size in there and love provided that with 10 rebounds and three three pointers he's a deeply guy and you can watch list him if you want but I just I don't think this is a consistent thing the most hilarious thing that happened last night was Kyle Lowry's fantasy line he played 32 minutes had two rebounds two assists two Steals and one block on 041 shooting  a usage rate ladies and gentlemen  of one point four  one point four  I award you Kyle Lowry the very first Tony Snell award over the years he very nearly went 0's across the board one shot this used to be known as The Shane Battier award but Battier act makes it made his team a whole heck of a lot better I don't know that Kyle Lowry provided that I would be floored floored knocked on the ground floor if the Miami Heat don't trade for a point guard at some point this year because Kyle Lowry ain't it  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and

into the fantasy stuff here let's talk Cleveland Brooklyn next Max druce  story of this ballgame which is amazing because cam Thomas could also have been the story of this ball game there were a few frankly first of all Max Drew's played 39 minutes everybody's gonna be like Dan he ain't scoring 27 points a game  you're right and you're going to say Danny's not going to hit 7 3 pointers tonight  you're right and you're going to say Danny's not going to get 12 rebounds tonight  you're right  but I'm not worried about that  what I'm looking at is opportunity  and the opportunity for Max Drew's  was he enormous  first of all know Jared Allen but the guy that got into the starting lineup because of that was Isaac of coral so if you're looking at his 18 points and thinking I don't believe it you'd be right on the money a coral is probably not going to start when Jared Allen comes back they'll move Heavenly down to power forward but stress is gonna be in there and the reason is going to be in there is because they paid him  that's the story this was a guy that they went out and they got they wanted his ability to space the floor in a way that a coral couldn't do last year and frankly Carol silver who did hit 33 pointers is not a shooter Caris LeVert is a really good bench option on this team because you can run the bench unit he can go facilitate he's more of a slasher his uh  Levert's best ability is going towards the rim  hard to tell you yesterday shooting 24% on 17 shots but Charis Lord is actually guy I would look at on points formats as well because it does seem like he's gonna have a little bit of opportunity here  look going forward is Drew's gonna get more shots than Darius Garland probably not Garland was playing at less than full speed you could tell by the six turnovers we was questionable coming into this ball game anyway so yeah streus he and Garland probably flip flop Max probably gets more like 12 shots and Garland gets more like 17 in most ball games and maybe Levert doesn't quite get that many either but about opportunity here it looks like out of the Chute they want to play Max starters minutes I'm adding him because this is a guy who guns from three point land and I don't think it's out of the question that he hits between two and a half and three and a half threes a game this year and he's a slightly better rebounder than people give him credit for it ain't gonna be 12 and he's not gonna lead the team in rebounds when Jared Allen and Evan Mobley are both out there but more than three four five something like that is very reasonable and just being out there for 30 some odd minutes is enough for him to fall into two assists tonight and fall into you know 0.6 to one steal per ball game and all that stuff rolled together would make him a 9 cat serviceable player  so max Drew's pick him up  on the Brooklyn side campus is one that I'm going back and forth on a little bit obviously you put him in the speculative add department but there's almost no way that he takes 21 shots in 25 minutes every ball game  if they're not all going in  you know this is a game where Brooklyn needed an offensive kick  cam was hot but we also know came in a 62% feel goal guy for his career  he's gonna have a game where he comes out and he takes seven shots in four minutes and misses all of them and he might not see the floor again after that  so points League's absolutely Adam because he's gonna go out there and he's going to gun like he's not waking up in the morning category leagues like if you're in Roto games cap I would pick him up I think but I wouldn't play him in the next one maybe you do and you just hope that the hot streak continues but  it's dicey man we know enough about cam Thomas to know that you get good cam you get this you get bad cam it can go south in a hurry  it's also worth noting Ben Simmons still kind of getting ramped up play Just 23 minutes cam Johnson they were very vocal about him being ramped up from his injury 26 minutes those two guys are going to play more meaning less for Dorian Finney Smith less for Royce O'Neill and sometimes less for cam Thomas as well  by the way  someone in your league didn't hear that cam Johnson was on him and its cap see if you can go buy low on him not that you could I don't think after one ball game but maybe somebody got worried about seeing 26 minutes and didn't see the news  someone in your league might all be upset that Michael Bridges only had 20 points but they shouldn't be because he did it on Phoenix style efficiency six of 12 shooting eight of nine foul shots three steals these are the things that we were worried about the scoring will be fine and Ben Simmons you're hanging on to I mean this I thought was a really promising first game for him 10 boards 9 assists in a block  he'll take that  New Orleans Memphis I didn't have too many questions on the Pelican side herb Jones was better than expected here got more shots actually or just more attempts five free throws eight shots in 38 minutes he led the team in minutes  typically more of a steel specialist I don't think that I'm gonna move off that position after one slightly more rebounding and offensive minded ball game  Zion  what you expected there no surprises Ingram no surprises there McCollum shot the ball better but no real surprises there JV getting 29 minutes was a little surprising I thought we'd see more Zion or Larry Nance at the five and we didn't so if Alan is can actually somehow hold high 20s in minutes and he ends up as a decent Draft Day value I am skeptical though because he didn't last year and New Orleans is healthier now than they were then I was wondering where the Luke Kennard would get playing time and then he got hurt and yesterday's game I think remembering to hit in the head anyway he played 15 minutes before that we'll see what happens if or when he comes back on the Memphis side Xavier Tillman played 34 minutes at Center kind of had to because valentina's and Zion are gigantic so they really had no choice but to go big there any time Memphis plays a large front Court Tillman's going to be a start I don't know if he's going to be a start when they play more stretch 5e type of teams but he very much belongs on fantasy Ross's right now Tillman was getting added right before the season started when the Steven Adams news broke and there's no reason to move off of that position right now and terrific first game for Desmond Bane who you guys know I like the lot as they late second rounder cashed in their JJJ had foul issues didn't really get involved on offense but you know you know you're not gonna turn away five blocks so it's one of those like could have been  worse kind of moments Marcus Smart stunk the free throw line stunk with turnovers he'll be fine don't worry about it he was a 100 range draft pick for a reason and that's where he belongs this is going to be a long show in it well let's keep going Oklahoma City blew out Chicago Bulls had a players-only meeting after losing their season opener rut row she'll just Alexander still very good at basketball  so I think the only real node on OKC chat played 25 minutes he was me  it's gonna take these rookies time man I think that's gonna have a really good year but we have to be okay with the fact that it might not happen on day one  not many players on the bulls look good and yesterday's games acklam went four for 16 from the field Demar nine for 20 missed free throws  vouchers decent only got eight shots but at least he was good with them 119 and 43 Steals and two blocks virtuous was the I survived a blowout loss Award winner on that Chicago Bulls side hopefully they look better in the next one let's not try to read too much into this ball game we'll reassess the Bulls after their next ball game which I believe is tomorrow King's blew out the likely tanking Jazz 130 to 14 behind 33 from Harrison Barnes who said not so fast you all are not taking my shots yet we seen this before from Barnes he tends to get off to Quick starts and then kind of hits cruise control by about December this would be a sell moment ladies and gentlemen because do ain't take in 1698 making 70% of them good first game for Keegan Murray don't care about the bad shooting I like the eight rebounds more than I disliked the bad shooting sabonis looked like himself Fox didn't have to do as much in this one Malik monk had 1 0. 7 9  much like last year though kings are not a team that we really need to dig too far in on  Jazz are worth digging in on John Collins 31 minutes in the season opener 15 and 11 with a steal on good percentages hell yeah that's a win on day one Larry Mark and in probably won't be as good as last year but she'll take it Jordan Clarkson was efficient which is not going to be the case every night lack of defensive stats typical lack of efficiency it's going to eventually bite him you've been warned DHT  not a fantasy play Walker Kessler is a fantasy play this is a buy opportunity if somebody freaks out after 22 minutes because it ain't always going to be like this and the beauty of Walker Kessler is even in 22 minutes he's still probably a top 80 guy  maybe better so don't worry about it he'll be fine don't panic on Kessler if anything probably go try to get him Dallas over San Antonio 12619 this was kind of a fun one we saw Tim Hardaway take 14 shots which was  fine he's a points League option but nothing else  the more interesting stuff on the Dallas side was I thought Grant Williams playing 35 minutes he could actually be a fantasy play in 35 minutes I don't think you have to pick him up because I doubt people are racing to go add  Corner 3-point specialist Grant Williams but if this is his job to just be open on a team that has better passers than a his last stop sorry Boston Celtics put your two superstars are not that great at passing Dallas has two superstars that are better at passing in donshea and Kyrie Irving that means great well he was gonna get more looks from that corner he hit a bunch of them  being a guy who can hit 33 pointers a night without hurting your field goal percent does have fantasy value he'll get a couple of rebounds he'll fall into a few defensive stats not many but  I mean if he does anything along these lines I don't expect 17 points but you know even a dozen points to 14 points five rebounds two plus three pointers on good percentages with half of let's call it half a steel and  0.6 blocks  that's enough  you don't have to add them right away the guy on this team you probably need to go out is Derek Lively who was getting drafted in the last round as kind of like the flyer type in a lot of competitive League's he looked great here on opening night played 31 minutes the rest of the center is on the Mavs didn't even sniff the floor really Maxi clebus started but he got yanked quick and ended up playing 23  by all accounts they'll probably start Lively in the next one no sign of Dwight Powell by the way so they didn't go to a third Center no sign of Rashawn Holmes Lively needs to be added he's on the priority list with the other guys I was mentioning Victor wembanyama foul trouble on opening night I don't think that's gonna be an isolated instant for him this year five turnovers you like the three-pointers you like the steals you like the block you like those six out of nine shooting which I don't think is something that sticks with him but just be ready for the fact that there are going to be turnovers they're going to be fouls they're gonna be bad field goal percent Knights and then they're going to be nights where he goes absolutely Buck freaking wild and you are going to eat cake until you fall asleep with a tummy ache this just wasn't one of those nights  you're not gonna be able to buy on one but Yama whoever drafted him is going to want him for the whole thing so just Let It Be Zach Collins was the thing that I was most thrilled with in this ball game because he played 32 Center minutes 14 5 and 3 with a steel 2 blocks on good percentages that is exactly what you wanted out of Collins if you took him at about pick 100 Let It Ride baby good first game for Devin vessel excellent Trey Jones was fine I didn't like the 25 minutes that's a number that I think needs to come up or I do think his fantasy value won't be quite where it needs to be in 12 tons and Johnson seven assists was very surprising I don't think you see that repeated itself turnovers field goal percent free throw percent that's always going to be the thing that holds him down if you can escape  with your shirt like you did in this one good and then Jeremy Sohan is a guy that and look I like my intention here is not to call out names but I am seeing a lot of fantasy analysts calling this game a massive success for Sohan I can't get there with him 13 points sub-average eight rebounds good five assists pretty good  one steal no blocks fine bad field goal percent bad free throw percent High turnovers he's not going to be a guy who does enough in the other six categories to make up with the fact that he is going to be a negative in both percentages and turnovers so I'm going to call Sohan a points League option if you have him in eight cat hold on to him if you haven't been nine cat and give it a little bit longer but I don't expect the percentages to magically fix themselves you're over year and so that's why I'm much lower on him then a lot of other folks out there  and the last game of the night it ended as a 12-point game Clippers beat the Blazers won 2311 but they were up by 30 at one point  the nice thing was the Blazers cut it to a 20 some odd or right around 2019 20 point deficit late and so the Clippers had to put their starters back in for three or four more minutes so we got just a little more juice out of Paul George and Kawhi Leonard and Russell Westbrook and if he eats a zubats  let's talk about Clippers first because we saw this with zubats last year where he started the season blocking a ton of shots and then it completely evaporated as the season went on sell High that's not to say that he won't be you know 100 ish range or wherever the hell he finished last year 110 on 11 points 10 rebounds in 1.3 blocks that's very repeatable for him but he did it in 29 minutes and he's not going to just change what his fantasy profile is overnight so except that this was a very good game for zubats he's a 100 to 125 range fantasy guy  throughout his career that's not going anywhere on a team that has a good backup center in Mason Plumlee  so high if you think you can get something  Russell Westbrook was efficient in this one 13 assists you're definitely gonna take  I just can't do it  he might make me pay Russ might have this crazy bounce back season where his sister great and somehow his percentages don't break you but  I don't see anything to make me believe that that's going to happen his field goal percent was a bit better with the Clippers than it was with the Lakers when he didn't have to do as much but the free throw numbers still gonna be terrible turnovers are gonna be very high he's not scoring that much he doesn't it three pointers he's just not old rust anymore and so if you're playing nine cat like thank your lucky stars after this ball game if you're playing eight cat he might be able to squeeze into some value and if you're in points leaks then have at it  but  you know me I'm a nine cat guy and I just can't bring myself to do it  Kawaii looked pretty good made all five of his three pointers Paul George looked pretty good no surprise I mean when those guys are upright they're good what's the surprise Rob Covington started this game played 23 minutes had four defensive stats that's about the best you can expect out of him deeply opportunity Maybe  maybe  we'll see let's talk about the Blazers though I think that's what you guys are all waiting for on on this one Anthony Simon's 18 points in 27 minutes Malcolm Brogden 20 points in 23 minutes which is kind of similar to his role with the Celtics last year which by the way if you're thinking hey what if Brogden red does what he did last year well he was number one oh eight last year 26 minutes off the bench with Boston typically 15 points on 11 shots so that's your barometer for him if he gets more shots than that then he's a 12 team start so don't completely write him off just because he's on a tanking team they may need him to steer the ship a little bit  I don't think you need to add him  because I don't think he gets 16 shots nightly but he should very much be near the top of your watch list  I think you can drop Matisse thigh Bowl I don't think he does enough in anything besides steals to Warrant fantasy roster ship I think you should be buying low with all of your mites on DeAndre ayton in case Whoever has him in your league didn't notice that he picked up four fouls in the first 11 minutes of yesterday's game  managed to squeeze out another dozen minutes the rest of the way which by the way call that a win only got two two buckets I should say got four shots up the steals were super weird that's not something that's going to stick but he still got 12 rebounds in 23 minutes and has a shot to be  a legal leader in rebounding this year honestly my I might go Jalen Duren if there's a prop bet on that right now but DeAndre Aiden is going to be up there  in rebounds this season so expect a bigger game next time around Robert Williams took advantage of the fact that 8 was in foul trouble so this is going to be one of the better games I think for the Time Lord he's roster bull I mean you know Robert Williams will probably be you know 110 range or better but he's probably not going to play 23 minutes most games  and then the two younger players that I'm sure you guys are waiting for me to talk about shaedon Sharpe looked good in his 29 minutes he belongs on rosters scoot Henderson belongs on rosters but it's gonna be a bumpy ride because he's a rookie Jeremy Grant he'll be better than this most ball games  Don't Panic there I think he'll actually have a pretty good first three to four months of this season before doing the typical Jeremy Grant petering out routine  but keep an eye on Brogden is probably the the biggest story from that game and  yeah I mean hopefully they're more competitive in the next one  we're gonna Mash both the the recap and the look ahead into one show on this one and again we're going to be doing that most days most days will do the recap and the look ahead at the same time I'll remind everybody ton of questions in the chat room right now if it's always like this I probably won't get quite to all of them but most days it won't be this busy so make sure to get your questions in their day-to-day again find me on Twitter at Danvers let's do the look ahead Philly Milwaukee season openers know James Harden so let's see what the Anthony Melton does let's see what Paul Reed does which doesn't really have much to do with James Harden but something we all wanted to know let's see what to buy his Harris looks like with no Harden in there let's see how much embed and Maxi are responsible for let's just get a data point with no James Harden  from Milwaukee we know Chris Middleton is in ramp up mode they've been very clear that he's not at Full Tilt yet I avoided him like the plague in drafts because I don't know that I believe he's ever gonna be at fully Full Tilt anymore  I'm just excited to see what Jonathan Dame look like together I do want to know what Brooke Lopez does this year  I'm expecting a slight step backwards from his insane oh season last time around but I can't imagine it's going to be that far back because if they're really intent on playing Damian Lillard and Malik Beasley big minutes that guys are going to be getting to the rim on the other team  Tyreese Max is gonna roast that defensive perimeter and they're gonna need Brook Lopez and Giannis back there to block shots so I don't know how you take him out because Bobby Portis ain't blocking anybody shot  we'll see Phoenix it sounds like Bradley Beale is 50/50 to go to night they're hoping the last report was that they are hoping to have him back and if they do then we get to see a little bit more of what Phoenix will look like when they've got their three stars together so that's really the thing to watch in that one Lakers side still no Jarred Vanderbilt so I think you can expect pretty similar to what they did on opening night but I'm watching to see if Christian Wood gets more than whatever it was 14 15 minutes I'm watching to see if D'Angelo Russell continues to have pretty much full grasp on the point guard spot and I'm watching to see if LeBron James gets to 30 minutes because that was something that scared everybody on opening night but something that we had you guys ready for how many times during the season run up that I yell at you do not draft LeBron James's here the Lakers do not want to play in big minutes they don't want him doing what he's had to do in the past because they want him healthy for the playoffs and the way to do that is to keep him fresh  all right let's get to the chat room let's see how many questions we can jam in here we'll go lightning round I'm going to do 11 minutes so at the one-hour mark on today's show we'll pull the plug on it so if I don't give you a super long reply sorry Lewis says Sohan or Trey Jones rest of season I've worries about Sohan and his inefficiencies to my percentages yep I go trade Jones  Marco says I Wendell Carter Junior but I'm thinking of swapping him out for Zach Collins or Isaiah Stewart which would be the better pickup I like Zach Collins in that one window Carter Jr is just not a guy who does anything defensively I don't know why everybody kept picking him up last year or this season I should say he  I mean he's fine but there's no real upside for a center that doesn't get defensive stats in 15 and 9 last year and he was outside the top 100 I had rather take a swing on somebody that Michael a little higher  Windows the safer play I guess  Delonte says it a bball Paul take over tonight I don't know I hope so says he met him in a bar and Philly last year was a really cool dude nice well we're all rooting for Paul Reed that's for damn sure Rock says hi Dan was wondering if you could provide some insight on how to use Fab budget I'm in a 12-team 9 cat Roto League how much Fab should I use to pick up a player like Derek Lively or Jalen Johnson well if it's a if it's a public Yahoo League then you have 100 Faber the entire season which does make things kind of tough  I used about 11 to get him last night and that got him and basically every spot that I did Derek Lively I think I might go between  four and nine because I do think that there's a chance he runs out of gas mid-season but Jalen Johnson is one that you probably want to spend a little bit on but I don't think you have to go like huge in a Yahoo League because most of those folks are not gonna go that big so going even medium will probably get it done that's on Walker Kessler Don't Panic that was size said that Joe says I was just offered Halliburton for Kessler and Mark Williams in a points League standard Yahoo do I do it yes you take a first rounder for almost any combination of non-first rounders absolutely Lester says should I hold Bilal or should I drop him for dalan writer Josh Richardson drop him for Dillon right unless you're unless you think your team is going to be a top two seed because down the stretch and into the fantasy playoffs is when you might get a little bit more out of Bilal when the wizard start to shut people down is Max and All Star this season know says or this is Walter obviously being a little bit facetious here but I do think he's gonna have a fantasy relevant season so pick him up  is Casey p a hold of should I stream his spot depends on your league setting Standard 12 teams he's a whole  that was JC asked that question why AMC says would you drop Bilal or Kobe white for Delon Wright I would drop below  JP says hi Dan Johnson I'm undecided and holding Thompson because of his blocks and defensive stats what do you think I think I'd probably go Jalen Johnson there because his negatives won't hurt you the first two to three months of the season but I do like both of these guys specially from January on so tough tough call there here next question if Paul Reed has a bad game would you dropped and pick up Derek Lively um  bad game is probably not the nomenclature I would use if Paul Reed doesn't get any playing time that's where I might be a bit worried and make a swap  Mitch Robert beef stew I'll go Robinson there better fantasy profile  and a ball over the last one was car asked that animal says I got Andrew Wiggins and benedict mathura on my team should I drop one of them for Jalen Johnson or Max struss  I might be inclined to drop math and for Jalen Johnson but  if both of them are still sitting on the wire this morning you might be able to get away with waiting another day you're not dropping Andrew Wiggins though  YMCA says I dropped Paul Reed for Max Drew's do you co-sign know we haven't seen Paul replay a game yet I think you have to let your guys play one game before you drop them that's the rule that's the fantasy role at least I buy it Jordan says what's Jaylen Johnson's floor as he worth holding in a points League his floor is very low because he's coming off the bench and he could just they could just decide not to play him but the ceiling is why you're picking up Jaylen Johnson because he went nuts yesterday and they seemed to love him he closed the game you saw the ceiling last night that's a guy that belongs on basically all formats Ernest says hi Dan two questions would you trade vooch for Chet  mmm I think I'd rather have vooch  and two scoot is currently my weakest player is their value to keep him there or try to trade for a two-for-one to free up a streaming slot definitely try to do a two-for-one always try to do two for ones doesn't have to be scoot though you're not gonna trade him now you'll if you drafted scoot you gotta wait through  where he starts to figure out at the NBA and that'll be later on his rookie season if you didn't draft School you probably want to try to buy on him in about a month and a half two months something like that so but always try to do it for one trade that's that's a gimme Kobe white or shade and sharp I'll go sharp on that one that's Mike he's questions JC says Casey P or Jalen Johnson oh two very different calls kcp is your you know 95 range plotting along type Jalen Johnson is the could we catch lightning in a bottle and get a top 6 7 5  I think I go Jalen Johnson there and just try to shoot upside YMCA says shout out to you Dan I see family I see fantasy analyst Rivals jacking your Tweet style yeah I do I admit that does hurt my feelings a little bit  because there's so many things that folks could be doing out there like I don't cover Dynasty at all I don't cover points leaks almost at all I don't cover deeply almost at all there's so many things folks could be doing that are still available to be done you don't have to do what I'm doing  Wayne says hey Dan who who would be droppable for the next hot pickup out of Schrader Kobe white Jalen Johnson or Derek Lively  probably Kobe white is the droppable one there Max says is it crazy to drop Wendell or PJ Washington for Johnson or Lively it is not crazy because Wendell Carter Junior is going to be a top 100 play PJ Washington's going to be a top 15 play and you're hunting massive upside if you need those safe guys that are Trucking along though you may end up regretting it still I'm okay with it  Dinesh says what if deje shot better um yeah I mean like shots are going to move around from game to game I wouldn't worry about the one game sample size of what if she shoots better to that take away from jail in Johnson what about saddiq Bey having a bigger game yeah Jalen Johnson's not gonna have a 2021 damn points at night we know that he had a higher scoring game than usual yesterday because some of those teammates stunk but it's about the balance in point he gets defensive stats he gets rebounds he's not gonna crush your percentages we hope and if these types of games pop up that's the upside  Brooke says should I drop I'm in Thompson for Jalen Johnson that Houston team is Log Jam yeah I probably would  Johnny Hill says would you drop Jaden McDaniels for Jalen Johnson um  no I think Jaden McDaniels takes a small step forward this year inside the top 90  and I don't think I would drop that type of guy I'm hoping you have somebody else you could move PM says are you worried about the lack of Derek white usage know he never needed usage  he's gonna get his stuff on Steals and blocks and rebounds and assists and he'll hit some open shots  and he'll probably go top 75 because of it  Blazers says hi Dan I was gonna skip that one but I like it Zoe says which point guard would you guys rather have in Roto Sohan or Trey Jones Trey  Rock says would you drop kcp for Dylan Wright and nine cat Rodeo actually yes I would believe it or not because I liked Elon Wright's boards assists steals combo better than Casey's 3s and steals combo but that's just me you guys know I don't care that much about points  Jose says should I drop so on or Josh Hart for Derek Lively  I think you can probably drop Josh Hart unfortunately  Lewis says should I drop Jalen Johnson for Emmanuel quickly and a points League points lie yeah I think I might go quickly their category leaks I probably lean back towards Johnson but you saw it quickly he's gonna get out there and he's gonna shoot  let's see here there's some chatter in the chat room I love that you guys helping each other that makes me so proud would you drop Jabari Smith Jr for Xavier Tillman know  that was Miguel Chris says Duran did block shots in college like see him with one game yeah I think he'll have more than one game but you know not four  I think the rebounds are the thing that we can really rely on their razor says someone of my 10 team drafted Jaden Ivy in is still sitting on him well consider yourself lucky because that's a roster spot that they should be using on something else there's that Sports ethos Newsfeed make sure to go follow that while we're talking about it on the show I expect to see a few more follows on that by the time I sign off today  we'll Dillon right keep High 20 minutes moving forward we don't even need High 20 minutes we'll take mid-20s and I think the answer is yes because nobody else on that team can play defense  Tony says comingo or Jalen Johnson  Jalen  quick fast says should I trade Harden before Philly or ride it out write it out you ain't gonna get proper value form right now  BS says sex and heard or Ivy I need points  and threes the end of my bench look it's probably heard her  on says what's the Thought on time lord should I drop him for Derek Lively I'm interested in another assist guy Kobe White's on The Wire Jaden McDaniels is another possible 10 team her um  I'm not sure any of these guys is going to be a 10 team value but yeah I think maybe you go Derek Lively and just  end up probably moving that spot around a lot over the course of the year  is Isaac core will pick up no Kelly hubris outlooking Philly and he's going to do enough to be fantasy relevant specially not of Harden gets traded for other dudes who can play  should I pick up Isaiah Stewart for Josh Hart yes  Jalen Johnson rest of season thoughts uh top 100 or better  Jaylen Johnson or herb Jones I'll go Jalen ice cream cone I like that KO hn this might have been asked oh we hit the one hour mark so I'm really running out here is it worth dropping Paul Reed Emmanuel quickly or Ben Simmons for Jalen Johnson um well gosh  probably quickly let's see what Paul Reed does tonight because maybe it becomes more obvious can you hang on a few more hours I hope  Kobe white or shade and sharp sharp did I already answer that I might have  uh let's see here any chance the Anthony Melton ends up not being a nurse favorite yeah there's a chance but he's damn good at a lot of stuff so usually ends up being favorite  do you think LeBron will return fourth round value I unfortunately landed him at 43 yeah fourth seems like attainable for him  pick up between Wendell Carter Jeremy still on going between those and my worried about Jabari Smith Jr  I didn't draft him anywhere is that your answer  is Josh harder to drop Maybe  Donovan Mitchell and Jordan Poole for Anthony Davis in the Zion hunting in threes yeah I mean given your punt that seems like a sort of a no-brainer um  although you may miss the points  when you leave them behind I probably would give in your build and I think we unfortunately have to pull the plug on questions there sorry guys I couldn't get to all of them but I did 11 minutes of lightning round thank you amazing amazing amazing questions and turnout in today's show I hope that you guys will continue to join us
