welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right running a little bit late on this one so we're gonna dive straight on in I got zero minutes to waste it's a streaming show and it's a streaming show for Friday for Saturday and then let's be honest not really for Sunday because Sunday's a 13 gamer and next week is an absolute silly Fest  yes that's right I went there it's a silly Fest let's start Today's Show quickly by talking about next week so that you guys don't worry about it when I don't talk about it that much after these next like 45 seconds  here's the problem with next week  Monday off day  Saturday off day  there are two days next week where the NBA doesn't have games  and yet that's not even the entire story because Tuesday the NBA comes back with 14 games  Friday  every single team plays in the NBA  and Sunday every single team plays in the NBA  so Tuesday Friday Sunday are all massive overfill days  Monday and Saturday are non-existent days  yeah I'm doing some on the Fly color coding for those that are watching with us meaning they are two days next week  where you can technically stream or not  Tuesday and Wednesday  and or sorry Wednesday and Thursday look at this right Wednesday and Thursday and that's it Wednesday is 8 games Thursday has five  meaning you're going to use some chunk of your games next week  on Wednesday and Thursday  and then you're basically going to pray that on Tuesday Friday and Sunday 10 of your 15 our healthy 10 of your 15 are healthy enough to play  I got a question on a streaming show last week that was like how many moves do you hold on to for the very last day of the regular season the answer is probably none  because your whole team's playing and you kind of just have to like hope that 10 out of your 15 guys because every one of them has a game you just have that 10 out of the 15 are actually active  you should basically use all of your moves on Wednesday and Thursday of next week to add some games to your Ledger and then whatever you do on Thursday just try to make sure you end up with the player that you like the most the rest of the way because they're almost definitely gonna play Thursday and then all for Friday  and then all so Sunday  when I say most likely I mean they will every single team that plays Thursday next week also plays Friday and Sunday  because every single team plays Friday and Sunday  you see how that works right  so you pick up a couple guys on Wednesday you trade them back out you pick up two new guys on Thursday and you hope that somehow that adds a like a couple extra games your Ledger the nice thing about next week because it's such a weird overflow underflow week is that everybody's gonna pretty much have the same number of games played there are a scant scant few teams that have a weak schedule Brooklyn only has three games next week Cleveland only has three games next week Indy  the Lakers  and the Sixers and the Wizards those like 16 or something I don't remember what I just counted out everybody else has four they play all the damn time  basically if you have one of those teams that goes say like Philly Monday or Tuesday Friday Sunday they exclusively play on the Overflow days you take their game on Tuesday and then you probably abandoned ship on Wednesday and then on whoever you picked up on Wednesday you will pain and ship again on them on Thursday and then that dude you hold for the rest of the week  basically look for the teams I just mentioned that have two days off in the middle that don't play Wednesday or Thursday Lakers it Pacers Sixers Raptors I just did I say raptors wizard sorry was the other one not Raptors take whoever you've got on those teams and get the hell off of them now Cleveland they don't play on Tuesday which is that the 14th on a cow on Friday if you wanted to but honestly it's easier to just look at the teams that are off for two days in the middle that's again the Pacers the Lakers the Sixers and the Wizards that's next week we'll cover that again maybe on a Sunday show but I wanted to knock it out here because I didn't want to be like Dan you didn't look ahead  what about the rest of this week well um here's the thing  this week is not that dissimilar from next week and that today you've got 12 and Sunday you've got 13 you may or may not have overflow today you probably do have overflow on Sunday and then you've got a Saturday in between that's relatively light  I spent a bunch of time looking at sort of like the combinations and permutations of what you could do over the next couple of days there is no way without an injury to gain two games right now  the only way that someone might come up with in their mind is be like oh well what if you have an overflow Day on Sunday  and you pick up a player that goes today and tomorrow but not on Sunday that I suppose  would potentially be the one way so like if you had  somebody going on Sunday  you could move off of them and get players going today and tomorrow um  but here's the here's the problem with that you're not replacing a zero in between  you're likely replacing a one  because every single team yeah this okay yeah I'm trying to think of the right way to explain it  the reason you can't get it to is because what I just explained is kind of impossible sure you can drop somebody that plays on Sunday  if that's your 11th player and you pick up someone that plays Friday and Saturday here's probably with that every single player that plays on Sunday this week  also plays on either Friday or Saturday  meaning the more simple way to describe that is that no one in the NBA is off today and tomorrow  the teams that are off today play tomorrow  the teams that are off tomorrow have played today  we'll have played today  so sure you could drop someone that's your 11th guy on Sunday and pick up a Grizzly or a piston someone that's going to today and tomorrow but whoever you're dropping on Sunday is also playing either today or tomorrow the game on Sunday from that player but you are losing the other game that player plays  if you're looking to try to drop somebody who only has one game left the rest of this week those teams are Atlanta but that game is tomorrow so you can't really  like say oh I'm going to take this one game and then I'm gonna go get somebody who has a back-to-back or something like that because  you can't do it today  um Denver who also again only goes tomorrow  and I think there's one more that I'm forgetting  hmm no quick quick check on that reveals that no that was that was it  so those two teams the only ones that have one game left but if you dropped them today  the best you could do would be a two game or  in all likely one of those two games would fall potentially on an overload day  you just Sunday or today  so there's only ways to gain one game the rest of the week  outside of an injury if someone's gonna get a 0 and you drop them and you pick up somebody playing two games where you're not overloaded okay fine but in terms of like dropping one healthy streamer for another healthy streamer you can only add one game which brings me to my overarching point you ready for it  the overarching point  is  wait  wait  if you can  wait until tomorrow  to drop someone  that is your overflow on Sunday  if you can  if you're not overflowing on Sunday which seems almost impossible because basically every roster does  then you can make your move today if you need to  because then you could move from one game or to a two game or and there's no restrictions on what days they happen you just go to your favorite player with two games left that's the easiest possible outcome to this is that you're not overloaded on any of the days and you just drop a hawk or a nugget who has one game left and you pick up somebody with two bottom you got one extra game  terrific  in all likelihood however you're overloaded on Sunday meaning that what you're probably going to do is tweak things a little bit  whatever that guy is on Sunday make sure they're all so playing today instead of tomorrow because you can't you don't you're not gonna make that move and drop somebody who goes tomorrow Sunday and there are a couple of teams that are like that look for someone that goes today and Sunday  because now there's Sunday game sort of doesn't matter right you're not gonna get to use it anyway  so effectively that player is only going today  and drop them for someone going tomorrow either tomorrow and Sunday or just tomorrow  that adds a few teams by the way just tomorrow was Atlanta and Denver tomorrow and Sunday you now Loop in the teams that have a weekend back-to-back which is Brooklyn Cleveland I believe the Lakers are in there yes Lakers are in there and the Sixers  so you had four more teams now you got 16 teams to pick from tomorrow they go to marrow alone or tomorrow and Sunday and you can drop the player that after today only goes on Sunday whatever player that might be you probably have a few choices guys that go Friday Sunday on your team right now probably like a half of your Ross roster drop the worst one for someone that goes Saturday Sunday or just Saturday preferably Saturday and Sunday because you never know if somebody might get ruled out and you have to submit so that's why I said wait if you can wait then wait  even if you're not overloaded you can wait and go to one of those four teams that has a weekend back-to-back I beg of you don't use a move today  unless you absolutely have to and I just don't see that many spots where it's like yeah you have to make a move today  why is Dan so intent on waiting because like I've said before the longer you can wait in a given week the better idea you have of what statistical categories you're going to want to attack  do you need rebounds do you need to assist do you need steel do you need threes do you need percentages do you need three whatever the list goes on and on yeah you have a pretty good idea by today but you know what you'll have an even better idea by tomorrow  specifically because everybody's got eight nine ten eleven guys playing today so pretty damn full rosters this is gonna be a day that changes the way your weekly battle looks because there's a lot of guys going  if you have a really bad day and he has he he or she has a really good day  in any specific category that may change your strategy that you thought you had locked in don't make the move today if you could wait until tomorrow and in most cases 19 out of 20 scenarios you can wait until tomorrow  that's the advice for today's streaming show hang on hang on until tomorrow  because tomorrow you've got those choices that we just talked about and let's just quickly go through the teams and what you might be able to do with them my favorites again would be The Weeknd back-to-backs so if you're looking at Brooklyn maybe someone like a trend in Watford I think cam Johnson already got ruled out for one of those so he's been okay lately if Dennis Schroeder's floating around you can go that direction Dorian Finney Smith would also be a possibility there Cleveland you've got Max Drews who played in the last back-to-back I don't think folks expected it but he did if Carol's floating around with all be an interesting backup option there I don't know that I would go a lot farther although we might see Donovan Mitchell rest one and so then maybe a guy like a Gorge and yang would be a deep deep play for three pointers the Lakers I think all five of their starters are pretty much on rosters right now so there isn't much in the way of a Laker you could stream Sixers have a couple of options someone like a NIC Batum would probably be intriguing I'm guessing that the four main horses are probably rostered meaning oubre Harris and then of course the two superstars in embiid and Tyrese Maxey Joel embed likely sits one of those back-to-back so you could potentially go Paul Reed and expect you get about 12 to 15 minutes and one of them and 25 and the other you could potentially go between and hope that he plays 20 some odd minutes and each of them you could go campaign if you think Kyle Lowry sits one of the back-to-back which he probably does  those are your options on the teams with back-to-backs if you're looking at just the teams that go exclusively on Saturday that's Atlanta Bruno Fernando DeAndre Hunter that's about as far as you go there and then for Denver Reggie Jackson is your possible stream with Jamal Murray still questionable for that ball game and those are your choices tomorrow not outstanding admittedly not as good as if you were going today because Detroit has some interesting streamers Memphis has some history interesting streamers  but again unless you are really set unless you really know what categories you're hunting for an extra day of information can be a really big deal  by the way if you're going today on Detroit or Memphis it's amazing mettu is an interesting one Malachi Lynn is an interesting one Marcos Sasser is an interesting one on Detroit for Memphis you shutters a little bit Jake laravia is a possibility Lamar Stevens trade Jameson is probably gonna get to play okay minutes in this game that Jaron Jackson is sitting out I don't know if I go a whole lot Jordan Goodwin he's playing the last few in a row  but it's hard to know if he's gonna play in the next one so that makes him kind of a tough head-to-head note but those are the teams you're looking at there and then you're not going to do anything else because whatever you're doing now your aiming for one of the two games remaining to be on Saturday  assuming your Sunday is overloaded so those are your choices do with them as you see fit  have a great Friday night I told you we'd get this one moving pretty quick let's see here very quickly  oh we got in the chat room let's see I go against a stacked roster tonight I have games  and wave of pressure should I drop Jalen Williams to try and get a back-to-back with Jordan Goodwin I can maybe even just let him go  ah I have eight games if Wiggins plays yeah I mean you kind of have to drop Jaylin Williams  probably go for the back-to-back someone on a back-to-back  I don't know about Goodwin though because he might not play in both but someone on a back-to-back  Malachi Flynn is he worth it yeah he's worth the pickup if you're going for the back to back Dan boy you weren't kidding about Twitter being lit compared to the YouTube yeah people are really watching on social media these days it's very cool  my season goes to the end of the season I have six moves left and half my roster is dated are out should I wait I'm likely to get out scored by a lot tonight but I'm up 100  you have six moves left this week  well you're probably not going to be able to use all six of them tomorrow so yeah I mean max out your roster today and then try to Max it out as much as you can tomorrow and assume that Sunday it's going to be basically what oh you have six moves between now and the end of the season  yeah I mean if it's one long period Then I would say hold off use your moves tomorrow and then Wednesday and Thursday of next week if this is an end of a period and you get like a reset next week then go heavy today and tomorrow because Sunday's going to be pretty well locked up oh okay yeah it's a two week thing so I would say a couple tomorrow and then a couple Tuesday or a couple Wednesday and a couple Thursday of next week is probably the way to go on that one  all right everybody good luck Good Luck Good Luck over the weekend I'll try to get a show going on Sunday to get everybody prep for next week but worst case scenario we'll have two on Monday that'll be a weekly preview show and a weekend review and starting on Monday after those we go back to one show a day Monday through Friday  basically the offseason schedule for one more week we're almost there folks let's try to bring home the w  I'm Dan bass at Dan Bass Pros on Twitter I didn't even say that at the beginning of the show this is a special fantasy NBA today episode the very last single day streamer show could it be  maybe the second to last one way to find out is to see what the hell I'm doing on Sunday  oh kidding we'll talk to you all soon
