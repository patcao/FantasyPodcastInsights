welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I don't know if you guys like the show from earlier today but luckily we've got this one too regular old recap show the usual  winter break for the children continues I've got one kid just room and a half over there playing mine craft on a TV let's hope that that holds him for a little bit  not we'll get a visitor partway through the show  tomorrow I have no idea what the hell's gonna happen  I don't talk about I mean like what's a week I come on this thing and I say something about my personal life I can't stop myself completely it's just a it's a habit it's built in at this point  you guys are gonna have to deal with it  so sorry  anywho thank you for all of the comments all of the engagement on these shows  we have seen a nice little bump in subscribers over the last week or so I feel like the fact that folks are  getting involved on the show is a little bit more might have something to do with it honestly God I have no idea  I don't need this works but please do like rate subscribe all that good stuff you guys know the drill at this point and we can go ahead and dive in here momentarily welcome to Fantasy NBA today that's the first thing this is a sports ethos presentation those of you that are new to the proceedings please find me over on social media at Danbury it's right there on your screen if you're watching if you're listening on the traditional pod channels it's at d a n b e s b r i s yes I did clear 20,000 yesterday yes it meant more to me than it should have so thank you everybody for making that possible it's super weird honestly because  a few years ago I was at like five or six and thought this is sweet man I didn't like I got some cloud in the fantasy and now this isn't just like what is this thing and you know I've had run ins with people that actually know me in the real world technically there were two um  because there was one that's actually a parent at my kids preschool and he was like I actually follow you from a burner account because I don't want anybody in my leeks to know where I get my information and it reminded me of how difficult it is to have  success  in this particular field because  in a perfect world you'd be able to get to one person in the league and then that person would tell 11 other people but no one wants to tell anybody about where they get their fantasy info for fear that they then lose their Edge how the hell do I get over that hump I have no idea  some of the chat room asked how old my kids are three and seven the three year old is actually at like a weird little mini camp one of his friends from preschool their mom set up a pod for this the first four days of this week which was absolutely freaking glorious literally will pay any price to have the little dude out of the house for half the day because big guy he played video game you can watch a movie he can read a book he can do Legos all these things that can keep occupied like they hit those of you with with kids you're like you're not as Dan says these things but those of you that either have very young kids or none you're like what the bleeper we even talking about here kids basically hit a an age at which they become semi-autonomous they still need you for basically everything but if you're just like you don't do crap for 40 minutes they can do it  but prior to that age there's never a second where you can leave them they'll either get hurt or they'll draw on a wall or throw a bag of jelly against your TV screen like there's all the things  anywho  um here's a fun one at the front end of the show all before we dive into the box scores this is basketball related what is your favorite landing spot for Zach LaVine or when do you think he'll come back it's actually two different people were asking about Zach Levine  it's a great question if he's not traded at the end of this little four week  shut down I think they shut him down for longer  and you know maybe I'm off base on that I don't think I am yes he hasn't played since November 28th so we're at a little over three weeks of the shutdown  two days ago I think Billy Donovan was like yeah yeah he's gonna be back and in that like three to four week time line  we'll see  he's not it doesn't sound like he's all that close he's not practicing I think he's mostly just like jogging at this point so I don't think Levine's coming back to the Bulls anytime soon maybe I'm way off I could be way off maybe he shows up next week but I don't think so so then in terms of Landing place it's probably going to be whatever team seems the most desperate  the nice thing about a guy like the lean is that he'll basically be fine no matter where he goes because it's not like he's gonna go someplace that's gonna use him as like a sixth option he's gonna go someplace where he's probably gonna be a second or third kind of like what he was in Chicago  I would argue who's the second option for the Bulls behind DeMar DeRozan  basically for the last what two and a half seasons  guys I have trouble remembering how many years players have been in specific spots  so let's let's take last year as a point of example all right point of reference Levine took 18 shots a game for Chicago he was number 48 in nine cats mostly because good percentage is decent scoring  you know decent threes some assists some rebounds not a lot and you know Steals and blocks are kind of  and wherever he goes he'll probably do like kind of what he's been doing so far this year which is a little bit less than that 16 and a half shots per game but I'd be pretty blown away if a team was like hey he's a clean come join our club you get a dozen shots probably going to be 16 17 shots a day a day  and if that's the Lakers because that's the rumor we heard yesterday  then he replaces DeAngelo Russell and rui hachimura is the latest that we heard he'd immediately go into the starting five  you'd probably see  my guess would be Gabe Vincent would also slide into the starting five he's not a guy that needs many shots and they use him more for sort of defense ball movement Levine LeBron add those guys would have trouble all trading off in the first unit but then there'd be a rotation  same thing if he ends up in Miami  presumably  the Bulls would be asking for Tyler hero back they probably wouldn't get him at this point because Levine's contract is kind of an albatross  but he'd get plenty of shots he's not gonna go someplace and get 14 shots  I don't know what other Landing places are even being thrown or the Nicks is another one that's going out I don't think they're gonna do it  that's probably my least favorite of them but  there's there's opportunity for him to basically do what he's already done  which should put him in the 50 to 80 range somewhere on a nine cat basis so I'm not super worried about it that's my thought on on Zach LaVine but let's go ahead and get into the business of actual recap stuff I know we got a little sidetracked in the Bulls do come up later on in today's show so it's you know it's not all the way off base but  anyway um lots of injuries stuff that's breaking this morning which is somewhat surprising given that  like games are still a long way off but it's a pretty busy Thursday by all accounts it's an eight gamer I like eight Gamers actually it's one of my favorite game quantity numbers I love sevens and eights because there are enough to keep us occupied but not overwhelming  in any event again please take a moment to like subscribe all that good stuff find me on social at Danvers let's dive in now Charlotte got blown out in Indiana hey guys I have an idea for the Hornets how about you guys fire and then rehire Steve Clifford that's going great for you  the Gordon Hayward very brief sell bubble popped before we even had an opportunity to capitalize on it Nick Richards is still a fine fill in I know he only played 19 minutes but this game was over pretty early so don't worry about that and Terry Rozier is all so still a big time sell High guy but we can kind of shoot past Charlotte because there wasn't anything of note there over on the Indie side this game was over early so nobody cleared 29 minutes for the Pacers Halliburton was at 28 Bruce Brown was at 28 but he healed as a 26 Miles Turner was at 25 they were all pretty much able to do their sweet sweet fantasy business before that Bruce Brown is in my opinion a schedule play that's where he's settled now  Aaron neesmith is probably the only real story in this because you guys aren't dropping buddy hield or you're certainly shouldn't be as long as he's in the starting lineup yeah he's inconsistent that's buddy hield he's been inconsistent his whole damn career  Aaron Nesmith  six of six shooting three of three at the free throw line obviously that inflates the numbers I'm not starting him on the Roto side but I do think he makes sense as a head-to-head level dude so I'm okay with that play as well and I also realized that this complicates podcast listening because I'm giving you different guys for different scenarios but I need you to try to do your best to stick with me on this  Miami beat Orlando on the road without Jimmy Butler the magic have I say not surprisingly kind of leveled off after a really fast start they're still in good shape at 16 and 10 but remember they had that what nine game winning streak they've lost three in a row now struggling at on the road in particular this was a rare home loss for Orlando I think we kind of knew that they would come back to the pack a little so don't be surprised if the magic I say lose more than they win the rest of the year but the pace they were on was kind of an unsustainable one  as far as the magic go in this ball game will work backwards here instead of the visitors first we'll go home team first they got Wendell Carter Junior back he played 23 minutes it's not a good nine cat dude he doesn't get any defensive stats saw it here in this ball game again  field goal percent will be decent  he scores some but not all that much he's mostly a rebounding in field goal percent guy which he kind of need like one more thing to be your thing  he doesn't have that third thing  so points League's you can add him he'll ramp up to 30 minutes of game he'll get you points and boards and that's usually enough to sort of clear the point League the threshold  9 cat I don't think so it does push golgappas and moving her back into their sort of split back up duties that's not gonna do  and then otherwise no real surprises  magic were so they had some lineups that were doing better than others so they rolled with those so you saw a couple of the starters see if you were minutes Jaylen Suggs minutes were down and now he's questionable with a left wrist injury that kind of popped up I think that actually popped up overnight Cole Anthony obviously going to do more anytime that there's additional space in the back court and that's kind of it for the magic side the heat are  not going to say annoying but a little Annoying in that  Jimmy Butler was out for this game Tyler hero and Bam are back they have been for two games now  and it just like none of the streamers really made sense in the way that you'd expect hey would Highsmith ended up with the best streaming game but you're not gonna try him Josh Richardson and Duncan Robinson were each okay from a streaming standpoint but he probably not gonna go there Direction because  Jay Rich you need to make sure he's gonna get a bunch of shots same story with Robinson and you can't really guarantee that right now Caleb Martin only got 18 minutes so he's not gonna do I thought Kyle Lowry would play okay but he only got 18 minutes also  hell I don't I mean I  I may have kids played 34 minutes but didn't really do much with them so I'm inclined to say looking at the next ball game how KES got the start so loudly so did Caleb Martin  so if you're choosing someone it probably needs to be from one of those three  but on the Roto side against the games cap I don't know that I'm doing any of them I feel like I would trust Lowry the most and then he went and played 18 minutes so I would have gotten that one very wrong  maybe best to just watch don't have to stream somebody on the heat we don't have to do anything  well Joel embiid is of course Phillies 19 and 8  they win at home they went on the road actually one of the better Road teams in the NBA not the point here they were at home for this ball game  but I'm beating is not garbled you know he's like Prime James Harden but he's seven feet right now because  he he simply cannot be guarded with out fowling  it's it's Shack like honestly  and I don't know if the league is gonna have to change from Rules or change the way he's officiated because it makes for  pretty ugly basket ball  he's an incredible basketball player I mean he's 25 shots 18 free throws his usage was ridiculous in this ball game and he scored 50 51 technically  line of the night for embed and he's just rolling these days catching up with Jill just Alexander on the 9th a pretty incredible season for Joel  but it is at times kind of hard to watch  that's the honest to goodness truth still from a fantasy standpoint what do we got here um jade McDaniels had a pretty good ballgame for Minnesota  really bring myself to care all that much about that they the Philly was trying to guard him with a guard just to see if they could sort of hide I think Maxie was done for a bunch and McDaniels like you know what I'm big enough to do something about this but it's just not gonna happen every night so  don't worry about it I don't worry about Mike Conley I was just you know the tried other stuff the things I think you need to pay attention to on the Minnesota side mostly is Nas Reed starting to cool off because remember he's a stream wild warm guy or was this just this is what happens if you're a big man and you got to deal with joy and bead for any stretch of the ball game you get eaten alive  the Anthony Melton her is die in this one hopefully he'll be back for the next ball game he's a hold Kelly oubre was a guy we were watching to see what his role would be and then both Nick button and Rob Covington got ruled out I think they both were sick if I'm remembering right and so that meant that you'll break out the start only took six shots in 29 minutes that is the magic of playing alongside embiid and Maxi you're not gonna get that many looks  Tobias Harris also a more look so that like  I don't know that starting is necessarily a good thing but I am I'm holding ubre a little bit longer and I know that this one can be  a little bit Troublesome from time to time because we don't really know what he's gonna be and he hasn't done very much lately I just want to give him a little bit longer if at all possible I think on our last show I said one more week and so we're still you know five days out on that  Tobias Harris is probably a little bit of a by low he was a sell High to start the year now he's a pie low so he's gonna level off somewhere in between and  what it would take I don't know I have to do a little bit more digging on that front but he might be on our next Bible  keep watch on that  Cleveland finding ways to win no Darius Garland know Evan Mobley and no Donovan Mitchell in this ball game and they still found a way to Win It  oh I got it we got a confusion on on timeline here folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a

a guest for next week um  you talk Cleveland so stuff on both sides of this one let's start with Utah  and sometimes I get to a team and I don't really know the right order to work my way through it so we're just gonna go one by one  John Collins he's a hold easy call  Larry marketing is back  so that's fine  Walker Kessler starting so he's a go that's good Kelly Olynyk is not so he's a drop that's an easy call  Simona fontecchio is still starting but never really was doing enough for it to matter so no Collin Sexton is starting and he shoots a lot so he's a go I'm good with that not gonna do that much beside score but that's okay that's what you're using them for  and then Taylor Horton Tucker is the big one tht this is too good ball games in a row  yes it's almost exclusively because keyonte George and Jordan Clarkson are out yes it is fair to say I cannot stand Talen Horton Tucker's Fantasy game we've been down this road too many times he's a bad field goal percent guy  who gets more credit for certain things than he actually deserves then he has these games like the last two 27.6 assists and this one was 19 points and 11 assists he actually did a decent ball game like four games back where he scored 23  it's taken Utah to be without most of their back court  oh God I can't even say it without vomiting in my mouth a little bit but you can probably start tht  while he's starting basketball games right now I think he's gonna get enough usage  where the good is gonna outweigh the bad  thing is  that could pivot on a dime  he's also on a steals run right now which is somewhat uncommon for him because he had one steel over his previous four ball games and he has 10 over his last four  I know evens out that's part of the thing he also had a 5-3 pointer game mixed in there I mean this is like he played a Cleveland team that wasn't really playing any defense in this one played a Brooklyn team that had no legs underneath them there's a lot of reasons to look at this and go tht is not gonna last  the biggest one is that like the two guys that they want in front of him in the in the back court are not healthy right now  but even beyond that like we've seen enough of his Fantasy game to know it just doesn't really translate to nine cat points League this is a much easier call points leagues if he's starting you start him that's easy these dream on the points League side for sure because bad field goal percent sometimes bad free throw percent that's stuff doesn't really matter turnovers usually kind of high that doesn't really matter turnovers have an actually been all that bad this year for him so going to Salt steals have been better than usual that's probably a number that actually comes down a tad but will maybe we'll see like he's not a terrible steel guy  so you're hoping that he can score and assist enough to cover up a lot of the holes is where we're at on The Nine Cats side and if he's playing 30 minutes of ball game and the balls in his hand for like half the damn game then okay fair enough  personally I'm probably not picking up Taylor I just I've seen it enough times to know it doesn't really work out  my child does not understand the concept of a live show you want to say hi to people but I can't pause the show right now I'm in the middle of a live show meaning it's not over until I'm done  well I told you  40 minutes ago I was doing my show and I could not be interrupted to get up and walk away so you're gonna have to find something else to do just until I'm done  I did tell you this might happen everybody here on the show all right we got a long way to go here so tht I'm probably not going to do it if you want to it's fine short-term regardless but it's not for me  Cleveland getting a lot of questions about Sam Merrill hitting 83 pointers look like guys run hot and cold so it's like Dan why aren't you taking the plunge on this like  this is a guy who was averaging nine minutes a game before the last couple he hit her 133 pointers and his last two ball games if you think that rate is going to continue I have a bridge to sell you  he's Sam Houser but his last name is Merrill and he's on a different team  he won't get to do as much when he cools he won't get to do as much when Donovan Mitchell's back in there he won't get to do as much if  say Max drusen Georges niang are playing a slightly better ball game  there's no there's absolutely no reason at all to believe that this is the thing that can continue he also does nothing besides hit three-pointers there's no other element to his Fantasy game but he was part of lineups that were winning largely because he was Lava Hot and just was bombing it in from downtown I want to take anything away from Merrill it's a good ball game for him  and himself a nice one  but that's what it was a nice ball game from a guy who we know is not consistently this  Carousel is a go though that one we know specially with both star guards out frankly I'm kind of surprised Liberty didn't play more than 27 minutes but worked out fine  Nick's dominated the Nets 121 102 you're not picking up Donte divincenzo because he does this once a week same story for Josh Hart once a week those guys are scheduled plays only we did get word yesterday in the evening that Mitchell Robinson is now out for the season so I say a heart and shine becomes a very good ad 30 minutes is almost like the basement of what he's going to have to play the rest of the way it wouldn't be surprised to see the Knicks try to bring in another Center that's not Taj Gibson so you know it's not 400 years old  hard times not gonna score very much only had two points here but you want him for his defensive stats you want for his rebounding and by and large he's gonna be able to do those things so just enjoy it because if you picked him up you got yourself probably now at top 75 range center for the rest of the season  top 100 probably at the absolute worst  on the next side just throw it out they got thumped in this ball game a couple of Clyde guys cleared 30 minutes but it didn't really matter cam Thomas we've talked about him a bunch he's a flip guy while he's warm he's warm ish right now see if you can sell him for top 75 when he gets cold you buy him for top 100 and you can try to do that four times during a season if you really want to but overall this is a game we just want to dump and there really isn't a lot to take from the next one on the board either Denver beat Toronto Nicola yokich looked more like himself again with better field goal percent cool kcp looks healthy again great there's really nothing to dig into on the Denver side and frankly there's not much to dig into on the Toronto side either they had a bad scoring ball game here other than Scotty Barnes Gary Trent did get 29 minutes again but he doesn't get enough shots these days at least not consistently y'all could Pirtle got schooled by yokich she's had low minutes two games in a row if anything portals a Buy Low but I don't know like What's it gonna take top 100 to get him right now it's probably worth it  that's probably the only note on Toronto so let's get to a game where there's more stuff going on  Atlanta there's a little bit of stuff going on onyeka oh Kong who played 33 minutes Congo 33 minutes off the bench capella only 21 in this ball game which again does mean that they're minutes coincided for a little bit but again like why do I just tell you to hold on to Hong Kong all season long because this type of stuff happens  there's really nothing else with Atlanta though  Bogdan bogdanovich still trucking somehow  for Houston they were a couple of little notes in this game first of all tari Eason missed this one with a sword knee that's unfortunate we he was really starting to get revved up that opened up additional minutes for in this case it turned out to be Aaron holiday for whatever reason Dillon Brooks was in and out of foul trouble again Jalen Green is  not good  and then arguably the biggest note not that Freddie Van Fleet Barry Smith Jr I Giant game so those are great but those guys are basically on fantasy rosters party Smith is around he's been inside the top 100 for most of the season after like a slow two weeks to begin it right van Fleet now is remember he was hanging around 50 and I just kept saying bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye like an instinct song well he's number 29 now so he ain't gonna be able to buy on Van Vliet anymore  the note I wanted to bring up on this game is Alpine shengwen at 27 minutes  this was the kind of game that I admittedly was worried about coming into the year and it's why I didn't draft shengwen in most places which  I mean for better or worse like I don't know if you want to call that right or wrong right now because Shen is doing numbers that we didn't really expect meaning he's been I think I'd argue better than most people expected in points  and assists  worse than expected by a lot in free throw percentage he just sort of became like a full punt free throw guy overnight  but he's playing 32 minutes of ball game and so to this point from that standpoint I think you call it a big win because he's playing the full minutes  he's been good enough defensively where his shortcomings weren't impacting his playing time  until this one  I think all we can really do is hope that the message was sent  and that he gets back to trying to learn and improve on that side but weird things happen in the middle of an NBA season you know like  guys run out of gas defensively that's harder  the next game we're gonna talk about on the Lakers side is kind of that same thing like when guys get tired it's the defense that suffers  so is shengwen a little bit tired is a possibility are a bunch of guys on this team a little bit tired is that why the Rockets are slipping and they've lost three games in a row  you could blame fatigue  this is a part of the Year where players do get a little wiped out then they get the sort of like Christmas New Year kind of wakes them up a little bit and then January  is a very much a fatigue month for a lot of clubs and it's the All-Star break that kind of gets everybody cooking again and you see the stretch run the teams that are trying to make a run they wake up we're in the dog days now  so what is that mean going forward I think it's a wake up call I'm not actually nervous yet that Shen's minutes are in any kind of Jeopardy I don't think this is gonna be a consistent thing because he's just so much better than their Alternatives offensively  Jeff Green being the main one Jacqueline Dale sneaks in every once in a blue moon but like what if tari Eason was healthy for this game would they have just played him at Center  I don't know  they would have gotten rocked on the boards but look like Jabari Smith Jr went got 13 rebounds because basically playing some Center in this game  so let's hope certainly that this was a one-off  sengun is by the way number 63 in nine cat largely because of the free throw thing if you're hunting foul shots he's been a third rounder  but if his minutes slip it all that would be reason to worry  Lakers aren't guarding anybody right now this game was very frustrating to watch as a Laker fan they were getting blitzed on the glass specifically early in the game  and then  basically once the Bulls saw a bunch of shots go in and put backs and stuff like that then there was just there was no stopping them like tomorrow was hit and all of his spinning turnarounds from 18 feet away all the shots in the modern NBA you'd call terrible they all went down I owe to Sumo it for three pointers  Patrick Williams at 3 voucher three Caruso hit three  Bulls at 8 183 pointers like hers were letting guys shoot the three ball that were historically not that great at shooting the three ball and they all made them  and I feel like so that this is Dan Vespers Laker fan looking at it like  what are you doing but then at the same time like dosumu was shooting like  35% from downtown if you leave these guys completely wide open they're gonna hit shots  in the Lakers are not hustling right now all that to say if you've got a fantasy player probably use them against la  you know that's why is right now  they're on a back-to-back in Minnesota their exhausted  Minnesota's gonna put up a bunch on LA tonight  Lakers are going to get trounced they might want to just rest everybody and call it a night take the loss I know they don't want to lose another one in a row but good Lord  LeBron continues to be  a sideboard I just I can't even I can't even fathom the efficiency he's playing with right now it doesn't matter though because he's got like one teammate that can hit a shot  80 turned his ankle again in this ball game  Austin Reeves is able to hit shots but teams are starting to Target him a little bit more on defense and he's getting beat up on that end Tori and Prince has been better and I guess when you could look at here because D'Angelo Russell is now completely Fallen apart he looks exhausted to me I watch him moving around the basketball court he looks like he is straight up in molasses and it really feels like the Lakers are  tired from the in-season tournament honestly you could make a similar argument about the Pacers I know they clubbed the Hornets yesterday but the Pacers have come out of the in-season tournament looking kind of weary also  when was that game  in season tournament that was December 9th that's 12 days ago already  Pacers beat the Pistons lost to the Bucs lost to the Wizards lost to the Wolves lost to the Clippers finally got a win against the Hornets I don't think it's a surprise I don't think it's a coincidence  that the Lakers and Pacers have combined to win two games in the last 12 days  I think playing that extra game so the high energy it's like coming off of a little mini playoff run  anyway Lakers will be fine they just need some rest they're not getting it in this one in the meantime Taurean Prince is probably playable these days he's not going down three-pointers he's getting some defensive stats they love him he's playing a lot of minutes so  I think you can actually play him in most formats  for Chicago Alex Russo's healthy so he's a goat normally when he's a goal to sumo's arrest he just happened to have a really efficient ball game here so I owe you're not playing Kobe white was a had more of a Kobe white-ish kind of game with some points boards and assists but really little else he'll be fine it's on his act Levine is out he'll be fine Caruso as a go vouchers ago to Mars ago Patrick Williams is kind of the coin flip guy you know against the Lakers it was going to be a better opportunity just you know you probably can play Williams based on who the Bull's opponent is  most of the more I don't say most but more than 50% of the time Williams is a start  Clippers just keep rolling man they shot 56% for this ball game I know Dallas can't guard anybody and without Derek Lively they really can't guard anybody so Kawaii another Mondo game Norman Powell filling in for Paul George had a big game I know he didn't start I don't care  I don't care that he didn't start you just knew he was gonna get shots that's the important part here  James Harden was a little bit cooler from the field who cared 17 points 11 assists two blocks two threes  team is cruising man they are a fantasy gold mine right now and as far as Dallas goes Luka doncic kind of had one of his little call it a drunk game but maybe it's just a being guarded by Kawaii kind of game  I said I trusted Tim Hardaway Jr as the streamer of choice and he was pretty good he didn't shoot the ball that well but he had a bunch of steals in threes and points and that'll get it done I said I was kind of 50/50 on Derek Jones Junior and Dante Exum and he played basically 40 minutes apiece so they ended up with decent lines  what are you doing the next one I don't know I mean here's the thing like neither one of those guys really gets rebounds or assists so your banking you're praying they shoot 50% or more from the field hit a three pointer or two and get you a steel or two they did in this ball game  and like lately they've been good enough  but all so it's so contingent on field goal percent  that it kind of makes it hard for me to sort of say full systems go  like should we play Derek Jones Junior right now  probably the answer is probably and Dante eggs in the answer's probably but a lot of it's because like eggs I'm shooting 701% over his last four ball game that's not gonna stick  he doesn't get that many defensive stats or boards or assists it's all field goal percent right now Derek Jones at least gets steals but he doesn't rebound he doesn't assist  so there there's so much tied in like one category a piece for those dudes  that makes me very nervous to play them because if that one category isn't there for two games in a row that it's a bad bad week  and then The nightcap Boston without Al Horford but more importantly without Jayson Tatum  blew out Sacramento they had 22 3-pointers Kings at 21 by the way for their own side of things but Boston did it on 55% shooting you're just not going to be the team when they hit threes at that ridiculous clip  and that happens a lot of the NBA if you run into a team where they're just shooting like 53% from three and they hit 20 of them they're going to win  that's the NBA right now  Garden don't guard him whatever if a team just gets hot from three they're gonna win can't keep up with that  because he can't get any transition opportunities and three beats to  when Jayson Tatum is out it's usually all Horford but he was all so out so that meant Sam Houser got the start and he was  Payton Pritchard had the better game Off the Bench  you're closing your eyes and you're throwing darts in that spot I'd rather try to catch him when it's a Horford day but today was not that day or yesterday I guess  and then in the king side only Darren Fox survived this one everybody else was pretty darn bad just wipe it  swipe left and keep going it'll be okay  let's very quickly take a look at what's coming up tonight on the Thursday board because it's a slightly larger one so we can just jam through it Utah we just talked about Detroit can they snap the losing streak who is going to be the team that wears it the indignity of being the team the Pistons win or against for the first time in almost two months  Pistons have lost 20 four games in a row second worst losing streak in the NBA right now is the Hornets at six  they got a long way to go  will it be the Utah Jazz  nobody wants to be that team so you know if you got your Jazz guys and even tht because like Detroit so terrible I think you could pretty much start all of those even the fringy ones  Pistons I don't care it seems like it's just Kate and boy on right now  Pelicans were keeping an eye on herb and Trey Murphy Cavaliers will keep an eye on whether or not Donovan Mitchell's back for this ball game but then beyond that like I think we're pretty well locked in on who's a go Orlando Jalen Suggs is questionable if he's out you're not playing Gary Harris but you'll get more coal Anthony Milwaukee nothing Spurs sounds like Wendy should be back so I think we can probably go back to dropping Zach Collins Bulls on the back-to-back this this game has let down written on it for the Chicago after a Lakers game the previous night  that's not to say that the Bulls are gonna lose but I think it's gonna be closer than people think so maybe a good day to play some extra Spurs even though you guys know I'm not a huge fan of that stuff  we'll see Chicago you can play most of the regulars and a lot of the and the 50/50 guys because the Spurs don't defend very well either  Indie Memphis is expecting 250 points almost in this ball game so get them all in there no that's not true we talked about Indy already for the Grizzlies job Bane JJ is as far as I go there Clippers tough back to back here in Oklahoma City this if ever there's a game where the Clippers guys fade a little this would be the one but we'll see  Lakers this is a game where you really want to be careful this game is already talked the Lakers post game talked about completely exhausted they are from all the travel and the in season tournament extra ball games and the highs and the lows and this could be a bad one for Lakers just a warning there and from Minnesota I'd be worried this game's a blowout  but yeah I mean you got all the regulars in that one Wizards this should be competitive you know Blazers they should be able to hang tough and then from Portland I guess we'll wait on a shade and sharp update if he's in I think he was questionable last time I looked but maybe he's been ruled out since then there's been a bunch of pieces of news that broke over the last half hours that I didn't see oh and then we got a bunch of jazz guys out Taylor Horton Tucker outlawry marketing and out  on the second half of the back to back  this is all breaking while I have been talking here  the Anthony Melton didn't practice Nicktoons didn't practice Myles Turner's questionable Jalen Smith this questionable Andrew nem hardest questionable Donovan Mitchell has been ruled out so we got a whole bunch of stuff that broke while on are okay that changes things a little bit so Cavaliers I guess then if you wanted to go Sam Merrell and I Cavs game and hope he gets for more three-pointers you could know Donovan Mitchell means there's a chance I'm still probably not doing it for Utah with all of these guys out on the back-to-back they really could be the team that loses to the Pistons but no tht and no marketing mean you probably could consider funky you might see Kelly Olynyk get moved back into the starting five to get a little more ball movement and scoring we'll see what their lineup looks like but I got to think John Collins and Colin Sexton John Collins Sexton  thank you will of Fortune probably will be putting up some pretty good numbers and again going back to that late ball game I don't see anything on shaedon Sharpe in the last half hour but keep an eye on that if he's in you may want to be a little bit nervous about a Malcolm Brogdon play if he's out Brogden should see 25 to 30 minutes and then he ought to be able to do enough along with Aiden and Anfernee Simons  and then Portland has had Matisse stibel on a pretty good steals run lately so if that's kind of the direction you need to take your team have at it  all righty then all righty then this is show number two so we're not gonna be doing too much
