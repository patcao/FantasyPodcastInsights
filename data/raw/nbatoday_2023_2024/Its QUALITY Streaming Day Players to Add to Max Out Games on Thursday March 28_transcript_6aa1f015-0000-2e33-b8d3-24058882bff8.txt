welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast we're right back on for show number two here everybody it's fantasy NBA today it's our streaming episode I ran them back-to-back  mostly because I kind of hauled butt through the first one didn't want to get log jammed anywhere  it's not the time for those long philosophical discussion so I did have a rant on yesterday's show and plus we got some guests lately it's kind of fun I should probably consider doing that  in the part of the season when everybody's still playing  half of you guys are probably done already maybe more  in any event this is an important day so welcome to show quick quick one here probably 15-20 minute range at Danbury on social media please do drop a follow over there it's at d a n b e s b r i s again  if you're new welcome I love it when there's new folks that makes my heart all flutter what we do on these as I throw the streaming calendar up on the screen we're gonna give you the worst schedules today we're gonna give you the best schedule today we'll try to give you some names that you could maybe Target as you try to Max things out but before we even do that the first thing I wanted to mention was  check your schedule  look at your team and find out what your tomorrow looks like  and then all look at what your Sunday looks like  there's a very reasonable chance and again with Yahoo it's less slightly less likely because there's only three bench slots yeah you got ill slots but there's three healthy bench slots and Yahoo public legs it's a very short bench  you probably have 10 of your 13 guys going tomorrow  but it's also possible that if you sort of hyper loaded Tuesday Thursday already  you might not have a full Friday Sunday  meaning  make sure that if you're making moves right now and you're you know thinking about getting off of someone on a Friday because it's a heavy day  heavy or not heavy is sort of inconsequential it's binary Are You full or are you not full  tomorrow on Friday  if you're full on Friday  then you can afford to probably shift off of that day but really it's about being over full because if you ten guys going tomorrow you don't need to move off of one of them  so whatever streaming you're doing today  should be about one of two different things  thing number one is if you have a 11 guys going tomorrow on Friday that means someone's going to take a 0 or just a non-playing you can't start them simple plate simple way to say it is you can't start them  if you have someone you cannot start tomorrow that's just not a game you're going to get to use  or you can't expect to do yes someone can get ruled out at the last minute and if you're a Johnny on the spot you might be able to shuffle them in your lineup but the timing might not work out the best way to attack it is to try to make it so you had exactly 10 games yesterday on big ones day and exactly 10 games tomorrow on an equally large Friday  I don't think you're full on Sunday I know you're not full today or Saturday so it's really all about tomorrow at this point if you have 11 guys tomorrow try to figure out who your worst player is or let's say your worst player with a bad schedule and get the hell off of them  if you are not overloaded tomorrow so there's no reason to abandon a player on Friday then you're exclusively looking at the teams with the worst overall schedules not just the ones that have a bad schedule because they play on an overload day  I bring that up this up as a preface and I know it took us a couple minutes to get there but it's pretty important the reason I bring that up is  the worst schedules of the week change slightly  because of whether or not this sort of a yes or no to the question I just proposed to you  the worst schedule's  are Toronto because they're off for three days and they play on Sunday and then Detroit Indiana Memphis Phoenix and Portland there's five teams making sure I get that right Detroit they play tomorrow and then they're done for the week Indiana plays tomorrow and then they're done for the week Memphis plays Saturday that's their only game left remaining so there's a slight tweak on for Memphis and then Philly Phoenix Portland not sorry not Philly Phoenix and Portland they are tomorrow and then they're done for the week all so Toronto as we already mentioned they're off for three days and then they play on Sunday so those are your bad schedules the rest of this week  one thing you'll notice that's in common with all those teams is that they each only have one game left  if you are overloaded tomorrow  Detroit Indiana  Phoenix and Portland  end up being  possible zeros because tomorrow is the only day they play  if you have anybody that's even remotely Fringe on those four teams I just mentioned  they gotta go post haste because you could turn no games basically unto into two games  teams that are playing  today and Saturday effectively  or I haven't looked to see is there anybody going today and then Sunday I don't think so doesn't matter basically somebody who's not playing on Friday but still has two games left this week  if you are overloaded on Friday  but you don't have anybody on those 14 teams that I just mentioned  that go tomorrow  and then done for the week look for teams that play Friday Sunday because that's pretty that's a fairly typical schedule alignment the rest of this week or Orlando goes Friday Saturday which doesn't quite qualify because you'd still at least get one game left there but effectively the same because you're probably not overloaded on Sunday you're probably not full you probably have like nine dies going if I had to guess but you know maybe you have a full Sunday also so look for teams that are going Friday and some other day because now you're turning then I a effectively a one game week because you're not getting to use their game on Friday into a two-game week by moving again to someone who goes today and Saturday and then the flip side of that again is if you are not overloaded on Friday then you're just looking at the bad schedules that I just lined out which is the teams that actually only have one game left and it doesn't matter which day it is so all of those teams become kind of the same Beast  Toronto he was definitely worse again because they go on Sunday  and no other days and then Detroit Indiana Phoenix Portland they go Friday Sunday or Friday only I should say and Memphis who goes Saturday only the only real difference between the two is if you really like the player you have on Detroit Indiana Phoenix or Portland you can let them play tomorrow and then you could shift off to a team that still has one game left in the week so there you turn a 0 into a one instead of turning a one into a 2 so it has to do with  is the player you're picking up better than the player you're dropping on those teams  you could do this same thing with Memphis hold through Saturday and then drop on Sunday if you if you had somebody sort of fringy if you wanted to get and this is that math thing again and it's super annoying to try to explain on a podcast because it's extremely boring concept but think of it this way if you have a fringy player on say a good example here would be Portland like tomani Kamara  who's been pretty good lately  and you're looking at  someone who plays on Sunday and there's a lot of them there's 20 teams I think that play on Sunday if I'm not mistaken  that all played say Friday like you're comparing tomorrow who only plays Friday against someone else who plays Friday Sunday the question is is that other guy you're targeting that plays Friday Sunday are they better or worse than Kamara because if they're better  you could make that move now or tomorrow or whatever  and if they're worse then you wait until Saturday and then you make your pick either Saturday or Sunday based on what categorical needs you're having your head-to-head battle so again anytime you can hang on a little bit longer you should  I would say that a situation where it's kind of mandatory to make a move today is again if you have somebody who's possibly getting a zero  or if you have a full fry day where you could turn one of those teams we just talked about where you don't even need their player into somebody who has two games left  so turn to 0 into 2  that's mandatory  however you get to that point  whether it's because again you're overloaded or because your guy's set to  miss games due to injury  you got to turn to 0 into it too you can't take a 0 for the rest of the week that'll kill you  I don't think it's mandatory to turn a one into two today  so again  with maybe the exception of Toronto because you're sitting for three days and then on Sunday you don't have any flexibility you can't turn that one into a two because you'd have to sit on it the rest of the way but like again those other teams we mentioned Memphis Detroit Indiana Phoenix Portland those teams all have one game before Sunday the only problem there is if you end up trying to make two three moves on Sunday all the same time you might go from not being overloaded to being overloaded so if you have like nine guys going on Sunday you're not gonna hold all of these other streamers because you make two moves on Sunday you have 11 and you can't use them all but if you have one slot open you can do something now and do something on Sunday  that's kind of the way you're looking  as far as good schedules go you kind of have to lean towards the teams that are playing on quality days because you know that you're not going to run into an overload scenario so that's Atlanta they go today and Saturday Boston goes today and Saturday New Orleans Milwaukee we've been talking about them for a week and a half they go today and Saturday and then Orlando goes Friday Saturday so they only have one quality game left but at least you sort of know that you're going to get that one but again the you know these are not massive advantages if you're not overloaded it which players make the cut for this kind of thing not many and I did something very smart last night in the Yahoo Fab League that I'm in because you have to make your decisions the night before and I dropped Jose Alvarado yesterday it was a crazy sequence of events and I'm sure you guys can all relate yesterday in the afternoon I was trying to figure out how the hell I had Max druise and I had Mitchell Robinson on my ill in a head-to-head league and I had to get them activated because if I didn't I couldn't make any moves  while they're healthy in and I else slot  so at like 3:58 I'm waiting and I'm waiting I'm waiting waiting waiting finally I'm like screw it I got to get Max Drew's in who's my drop well Alvarado was questionable for today with his core issue and I thought you're done get out of here  so I dropped Jose and  I  moved immediately move Max Drews into his spot in my lineup and then  the hell that I do after that and then I went back  and I had  30 more minutes to make my next call I was waiting to see if Anthony Davis was in or out and so Anthony Davis got ruled out I pulled him to the bench dropped Brandon pajama ski and threw Mitch Robinson into ad slot in the lineup  oh because Alvarado wasn't playing yesterday didn't actually have to bench him I just got him out of the way I threw Spruce into pajam ski spot moved brand into the bench waited then dropped him when add got ruled out so that I could put Robinson into ad slot and I had a full roster yesterday so you know ultimately it it's kind of unfortunate that I had to drop a gemski to get these guys out I probably would have ultimately rather had him playing then Mitchell Robinson maybe I should have just dropped Mitch Robb but I figured I would replace the big man stats and any of it  worked out because I got guys in that were healthy and now Alvarado got ruled out so I didn't end up losing anything on that drop all that to say Jose's not an option for today anymore we've already talked about the Bucks in the Pelicans options for weeks on this show Beasley for the bucks not Jim Marshall Larry Nance on the Pelican side those are the easy ones but now that we are  into a situation where there are two other teams that have quality game days Boston in Atlanta that brings Sam Houser and Payton Pritchard into the mix I don't Boston might have all their guys back but those guys would still be probably I mean they be okay not great and then for Atlanta DeAndre Hunter if he's floating around if he's not Bruno Fernando Viet crede or two guys that are doing sort of enough where again if these are the pickups all the names I just listed  Beasley probably a little bit better than some of the dudes out there and if Boston has anybody out then Hauser and Pritchard probably a little bit better than who you were streaming but again if you were sitting on like a you know timani Kamara  you just you just hold through tomorrow and then make the move on Saturday  so get the better streaming game over the next two days if you're not overloaded and if you are get off the zero and turn it into a two and that good friends is how you build your roster for today quick streaming questions from the chat room what up Dan enjoyed the interviews I watched drainless show earlier today good luck in your finals thanks Matt yeah Legends I gotta get camel on the show  I think I reached out to him a couple years ago but I don't know if I heard back I bet I would now  I feel like I'm I'm  he knows me now I think I don't know I think I've never really spoken to Kamala which is weird because I've talked to Dr a million times  anyway Kenny says I'm thinking of replacing careless vert for tomorrow even though I don't need don't gain a game who's a good Friday replacement for nine cat Jonathan Isaac to Monte Cara Marvin Bagley I would not spend a movie if you're not gaining a game I just wouldn't do it it's not worth it you gain a couple of stats probably by going to frankly any of those three guys over Levert but it's also possible that Karis just has a better game and it's possible the Donovan Mitchell doesn't come back tomorrow even though he's targeting it he might need one more we don't know there's a lot of things that could go wrong there  where I mean you could pick up Jonathan Isaac and he might not play  pick up Marvin Bagley and he might get benched for any of the idea there's no guarantee that the movie you make their pans out in a way that  you know find someone on your team that has a worse schedule and that's the direction you got to go don't spend moves in head-to-head if you're not gaining games I am so bent on that and unless you're getting like a superstar level player  I had a bunch of people my Twitter mentions that were like oh I did this and then I got screwed by it I'm like yeah you you did a thing I specifically said don't do  people that are making moves to just switch what player they have on a particular night it almost always burns up not every time sometimes you you sort of catch lightning in a bottle but play the odds here people get the max games played and let the odds tip in your favor most of the time  who's the better player between these two Deuce McBride or Cole Anthony give me McBride doesn't sound like OG is back yet is Chet Holm getting less minutes from here on out no he fouled out in 18 minutes yesterday so that was a fluke  it'll be fine it'll be fine  and that's your streaming show today everybody good luck make your moves if you turn a zero into a two otherwise graded out figure out if the guy you're picking up is better than the one you're dropping make sure and this is basically if you're turning a one game week into a two-game week  figure out if it's gonna make sense if you can hold on till Saturday or Sunday it's better  then you turn a 0 into a one which is the same as turning a one into a two but you have a better idea of what stats you need and what players are healthy good luck today everyone I'll see you guys over on Twitter it's at Dan best price toodles
