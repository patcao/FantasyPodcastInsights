you can use the comments section great opportunity to get a hold of me also again over in Discord that link is in the show description you can hang out with me you can hang out with the other sports Pros lots of other people that watch these shows listen to these shows read our stuff just a really cool spot that everybody started helping each other in right now very cool that that's come around this year quite excited about that we have a giant Monday card to review so I don't want to mess around too much longer but again stressing cannot stress enough to come find me on social media let us begin Clippers smoke the Pacers put up a buck 51 in regulation because the Pacers can't guard anybody right now and you know what I don't care because that's great for Fantasy purposes and it's great for James Harden who put up a ridiculous line last night 35 points 9 assists a steal a block eight three-pointers on 12 at a 16 shooting three through three for three at three throw line only one turnover hardened right now after what I think we could argue was a relatively slow start to the year because you know he's feeling out his new team  has been a freaking Manassas last two three weeks three weeks now is it a month actually last three weeks he's number five  last month he's number eight so it's sort of happened I guess somewhere between three weeks and four weeks ago or really started to click in for James  and the really amazing thing is that so over the last month hardened is averaging 20 and a half points nine assists 2.7 defensive stats 3.33 pointers and he's doing it on 51 and a half percent from the field and 90% at the free throw line on six attempts per game first of all it's wild that that makes him the number five player in fantasy these days because Joel embiid  is doing unheard of things over the last I guess three weeks it is now she continues to be outstanding Lucas been really terrific this year and then the funny little footnote here is that the other player in the top five  is Kawhi Leonard Harden's teammate on the Clippers who shooting 63% over that stretch  life is good if you're an old man on the Clippers right now and I have a lot of those guys if you bots is one of his little hot runs that's fine you obviously play him while that's going on Paul George is back and he's settling back in Clippers are just roasting people  all these guys are are the superstars are obviously rostered Norman Powell was the one you're sort of watching when PG was out 19 points yesterday and that's fine you know he ended up being in most of their lineups but it hasn't been consistent enough so more of a schedule play on Norm  as far as the Pacers go Halliburton is finally slowing down a little bit which you know he's human he's still number five in nine cat but he has fallen back into sort of like the next group of players he'll be fine he was on a crazy run guys have ups and downs over a long season I think he'll be okay he may be working through some injury related stuff as well  so no I'm not worried about Halliburton in fact maybe this is an opportunity to buy low on him not that number five is low but if somebody's getting annoyed maybe you could get him for someone more towards the back end of the first round like a Scotty Barnes or a Kevin Durant even over these last month KD I think he's like number 10 so  maybe opportunity to maybe just sort of trade up within the first round  maybe not  Benedict mathura at 34 points he does this once in a while and that's like the best way I can think to describe it because there's been nothing at all consistent about mathura in this year  last one of these he added was December 11th 30.7 rebound 8 assists Monster game and then he did nothing for three games after that and then he went huge in this one and there's just sort of  to quote the great Gene Wilder as Willie Wonka there's no earthly way of knowing which direction Catherine's going if you want to pick them up have added I just I couldn't possibly believe that this is gonna happen again for another four ball games  Aaron Nesmith seems to be a relatively safe schedule play type of guy same story with Obi toppin these are not guys that I feel comfortable dropping into a role line up on the day-to-day  buddy hield I'm going to keep playing he was a little better in this ball game he's been bit up and down but you know minutes were there here Bruce Brown I think is kind of falling out of the rodeo play Department it feels like he's settling more into a head-to-head stream he's number 128 he's back there with Nissan Smith frankly  guys like Kevin huerter  PJ Washington  are all in that same range Bobby Portis  these are sort of these stream while hot group  which also is the play in head-to-head on schedule day grew up but not the Rodeo Games cap group  I'm a little surprised by that I thought I thought Bruce Brown getting coming in here getting a bunch of money they  give him a little something to do and he you know boy be in that sort of 90 to 1005 range but he had been able to hold on there meantime Isaiah Jackson got the start with no Myles Turner in this ball game and he was pretty serviceable missed some free throws but otherwise not a ton to complain about here if miles misses another ballgame I'm okay with starting Isaiah Jackson  let's keep going  Houston lost in Cleveland in overtime who doesn't love a little extra overtime fantasy stats Freddie Van Lee 27 points 8 boards  17 assists to steals a block and four three-pointers  Freddie has arrived he's now up to number 33 in nine cats been moving up the board steadily the last two weeks he's actually inside the top 25 over the last month then believe so it's actually been kind of longer I think Than People realize I think he's number 21 over the last month he is no longer a Buy Low he's now beating his ADP and this is why I ended up with so much red band please I didn't like coming into the season I didn't think he was going to be a target of mine because his first  Yahoo pre-rank was like 25 ish and it felt like he would probably do a little bit less in Houston so I wanted to I count for a fall off from Top 20 he started going near 40 and I thought well this is  that's too far  and everything looked good except the steals  as those have begun to show up a little bit more he's been climbing the board and then of course this giant ball game is gonna rocket boost him forward  but that's why I have a lot of Fred Van Fleet and I don't regret it even for a moment  notables on that Houston side it's really Tara Easton play 33 minutes in this one 14 8 and 2 with 4 Steals and a block again I have no idea why it took everybody so long to roster him I said we just needed to see him do it twice  he did it twice I got him in a few places I didn't Biden enough to get him in a few spots that was foolish on my part but I feel good about the places where he's actually on my team so we'll just celebrate those and try not to mourn the fact that I didn't go high enough on my fab in those Yahoo prize leaks to get him in all of them  Cleveland things going mostly how you'd expect Charis Levert is doing enough he has his inefficiency issues but the volume has been high enough with no Darius Garland to where he can be started Isaac okoro is actually been decent the last couple of ball games but I could not could not care any less about that Dean Wade don't care Sam Merrill don't care Max Drew's slight bounce back game he's still an a shooting slump over the last two or three weeks he's shooting like 33% and that'll be better and we know how Shooters run hot and cold at some point here he's gonna have like a three or four game Run where he's shooting 55 or 60% and then he'll go back to where he was before so no real fears there because the minutes and opportunity are fine and then Jared Allen if you're wondering why he petered out after a couple of good ball games he left with an injury actually came back later in the ball game but all I had five fouls in his 29 minutes he'll be fine  Chicago beat Philly on the road it's a nice win for the Bulls but more than anything this was a sign that Philly had played too many horrible teams in a row  76ers I think had played exclusively like true  basement level opponents for like four consecutive ball games they blew out the Wizards by 45 blue out the Pistons by 18 and then blow him up by 32 in games in a row and then blew out the Hornets by 53 and the Bulls are not what you'd call a good team necessarily but they are at least somewhat competent they're 11 and 17 bad but the Hornets are seven and eighteen the Wizards of 4 in 22 in the Pistons are 2 and 25 there's a gap between those teams and Bulls Raptors Hawks which is kind of like the next tier up in the Eastern Conference and the Bulls kind of caught him with their pants down  Sixers I'm sure would be the first to admit it Kobe white continues to Surge with no Zach LaVine vouch yeah he always seems to play pretty well against him beaded feels like it wakes him up I guess  vouchers haven't kind of an odd like an underappreciated season  folks pictures this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run at end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly

21 plus not available in all locations  the only thing we really need out of Hooch that hasn't been there so far is the field goal percent to go from 45 maybe back up to like 46 47 408 but even if it doesn't he was getting drafted in the 60s at the end and he's in the 50s right now and as expected and he sort of like a clean single up the middle he's also played in I believe all 28 Bulls games so far  though the Run of durability continues Demar still not really shooting all that well but five defensive stats free throws starting to come around a little bit I still believe tomorrow is a small by low we'll see but the biggest news here Alex Caruso not only came back but actually survived an entire basketball game he was a plus 18 in a game the Bulls won by four  he's their winner  like if Caruso can stay on the floor the Bulls can be competitive and basically every ball game and if he doesn't it gets ugly  if Caruso is is healthy  I'm playing him because in 30 minutes he's a top 65 fantasy play and that's basically what he did here  if he gets hurt and leaves after seven minutes  that's where the whole thing blows up in your face  Patrick Williams is the question mark I think because you know white vouched arose in Caruso these are guys that are starting if they're healthy do Sumo you're not if all those other guys are healthy Patrick Williams is the one that's on the fence  I think you could start him in head-to-head and there wouldn't really be any downside to that and if you know provided the Bulls schedule is not some kind of unmitigated disaster and this week there is solid they have four games in six days to start the week  they go three times next week which is you know middling I guess and and maybe at that point you rethink whether or not Patrick Williams needs to be on your head to head roster Roto he's very much a coin flip right now because his percentages have been bouncing around a bit he's not great field goal or free throw on the full season 44 and 74 last two weeks he's at 49 and 71 that's been sort of just barely enough to get him inside the top 100 over that stretch over the last week he's at 45 and 78 so one went down the other one went up talking about Patrick Williams percentages here  that's put him just outside the top 100  so technically I think in Roto he is startable right now like just above the goal line so not quite a coin flip just a little better than that like 640 yes to starting Patrick Williams against your games cap but also if you have a loaded team 640 might not be good enough  that's why he's sort of teetering on that thing as far as the Sixers go NIC Batum suffered a little bit of hamstring tightness if he sits that would be good for well Rob Covington but I don't think he's playable but good for Kelly oubre because right now Uber is not doing enough since he's come back from his injury his minutes haven't quite been there but more than anything the shot just isn't falling yet for him 10 shots is pretty close to enough for ubre and so I'm kind of in between on Kelly right now I think it'd be smart if you could hang on to him for like two or three more ball games let the Sixers play a few more competitive ones see what Uber it looks like in those but I also get it there's guys that popped up that you want to be able to drop someone for like you know tari Eason a couple games ago and if someone else like that rolls along or a fantastic fill-in stream type of play  I don't think you're going to kick yourself too much if you had to move on I just try to hang on a little bit longer just to see how this thing shakes out and again if you can't on ubreak I get it  Anthony Melton is a whole he goes through these ups and downs but the defensive stats are always there so nothing to worry on that one and then Tobias Harris has been in a deep Funk the last couple of weeks he's usage has fallen off a cliff largely because of blowouts and also because Joel embiid is just sort of insisting on doing everything right now  that is not gonna hold all season long and Beads not gonna take 28 shots of game these types of runs is why I actually said leading up to the season I thought Joel embed could be the number one player in fantasy and he would be right now if she killed just Alexander was an average almost three steals of all game that's the difference if SGA Falls to two steals per game and beat probably passes him  but again this is what you were expecting you were thinking Joel would take 22 23 shots a night because Harden's gone and so far he basically has  and 11 and a half damn free throws that he's making it an 89% clip this year  better than I thought that would be on that one too  Minnesota beat Miami then it's always a good idea to fade a team getting star players back  Miami obviously like they looked fine and they'll be okay but you knew it would take just a game or two for everybody to remember sort of where the pieces fit and that's not to say that hero and Bam didn't play well but there's a Readjustment process  that's a betting thought doesn't really have anything to do with the outcome of this Blog game Jaden McDaniels came back from Minnesota he did have three blocks but he hasn't really been a 12 team member this year also fouled out in 30 minutes not a guy I don't think you need to add I would rather keep streaming Nas Reed until he cools off on that Minnesota side and then everything else is pretty much as it was Miami is the more interesting story from this ball game because with hero and Bam and Heywood Highsmith by the way not that that really mattered all that much but even with Highsmith coming back and logging his 12 minutes you had autobio playing 37 hero playing 33 haysmith 12 you're talking about some what are we looking at here like 8283 minutes something like that  that matters because Kayla Martin's minutes went down to 22  Josh Richardson was at 26 Duncan Robinson was a 22  I don't see any of those guys is playable  if that's the minutes that they could get on any given night  and then I met jacquez who they liked more in this ball game still got 30 minutes but only at 8 points in three boards yes he had two Steels and two blocks that floated his value I don't think he's a safe play either  and you guys might notice I've left out one name because like a lot of the time I'd like to come out here and tell you that I know exactly what's gonna happen with the particular player  I have no idea right now what's going on with Kevin Love  he's been amazing the last couple of weeks he's pushed his full season value inside the top one 50 and over the last three weeks where is Kevin Love  I mean I got to get was just three weeks or is it two weeks I gotta figure this out over the last three weeks Kevin Love is number 64  and I like most of you probably figured that that was largely because bam in Highsmith were out  but those dudes were back yesterday and Kevin loved still looked good in 24 minutes with 33s 10 boards he's always been a good rebounder for assists good passer great Outlet passer and then if he gets to the free throw line he's good there too not gonna get there as often these days because you know old not like barreling towards the rim  but  and again I don't know that I can make a confident call on Kevin Love  because I don't think any played in their most recent back to back on top of everything else  if you're in a deeply I think the the answer to this is much clearer and that's a yes but a 12 team or this is like  it could all disappear in a moment  remember he started the year like this it's easy to forget first like two or three games of the Season Kevin Love was the starting power forward for the Heat and it was like oh is this is he gonna  like play every day and get a bunch of minutes the first game of the year he played 28 minutes  then he played 20 then he played 18 and they didn't play for a week and a half and there wasn't even really a great explanation given us to why but after that he basically did next to nothing until November 28th  he went like four weeks where he was an afterthought  and then all of us and he started to play a little bit more again all though sporadically but six games in a row now he's cleared 20 minutes including this most recent game with the Stars back and so I just don't really know what the hell it is  I think you kind of need to just roster him to see what's going on because a 24 minute Kevin Love is a startable all format guy  I still kind of can't believe that he's gonna get 24 minutes all season long  it doesn't make any sense to me and he's old and his body probably can't I mean very few players in the NBA that have more gray hair right now than Kevin Love which again you know some of the guys that would probably shave their head but like this is a this is a NBA playing silver fox you don't see that type of stuff too often  you know like his facial and head hair looks like my facial and head hair  those dudes ain't in the NBA let alone our fantasy assets so what I've done is anywhere I have someone that's easily droppable I've just switched them out for Kevin Love and Rodeo I still I'm not playing him game to game because I'm petrified that that day is going to be the day he gets seven minutes had to head he's been playable so why the hell not they have two more games this week Wednesday Friday if you want to move on him from there you can they also play on Christmas day which is you know a small win maybe you move on after that but I think I think I'm kind of talking myself into it live on air here I think Kevin Love is an ad until we see his minutes evaporate which they probably will at some point but  not yet  Charlotte lost again in Toronto I mean you gotta go back two years and ask what the crap they were doing bringing in Steve Clifford  who had all ready once it seemed like things were trying in the right direction and then they haven't been  like what is this is this is this a tank is this a team trying to win  I don't even know  anyway Terry Rozier remains an intense so high while lamelo ball is out miles Bridges was not allowed into Canada because he has a pending court date for  beating up the mother of his child allegedly or I don't know do I have to say allegedly hasn't it already been and we already have proof of this well regardless miles Bridges wasn't there he'll be back for their next ball game so don't like make a bunch of don't pick up Bryce mcgowens here because Gordon Hayward was all so out the big winner with Heyward and bridges gone was PJ Washington who's been very much a coin flip level player had to head fine Roto know but with both big wings out then Hornet sort of had no other choice but to give Washington big minutes and he did good fantasy stuff with it  Nick Richards is a play as long as Mark Williams is out and that's as far as I think we need to go on Charlotte oh you guys might ask what to do with Brandon Miller I think he's still a play he's getting enough shots in minutes where that can remain as well he might not be one lamelo comes back just be ready for that Toronto had something happen yesterday Gary Trent played 35 minutes yakka Pirtle only got 15 the Hornets went small and so I mean they went small I don't know that that's a fair assessment because Nick Richards did play 32 minutes but Pirtle was just bad he turned the ball over a bunch of times he looked like he was sort of at a sorts so they just benched him and Gary Trent got hot  and I don't think that's gonna happen every ball game so frankly I'm not going to worry about it  it's one of those situations where I think we can just go okay and keep moving  that's what I'm gonna do  bad game all so for ogn and Obi so every time it looks like he's about to turn it up then it turns it back down it's getting for us trading I still think he's a by low but it has been a bit of a frustrating run  Kate Cunningham at the line of the night with 435 and 7 did it on good efficiency in Detroit still lost that Atlanta defense is fun for a posing teams problem for Detroit is you know boy and image came back and so then they had two guys that can put a basketball and a hoop but two is still not really enough  Jalen Duren coming back will help this team whenever the hell that happens but for now he's out and you know I started Thompson even even he was bad here with just 19 minutes there's literally nobody else on the Pistons beside Cade and boy on that needs to be played right now you can drop them all yeah they stink  Hong Kong will move back to the bench for the Hawks so that was a little frustrating but he still got 23 minutes which is generally about enough for him to be fantasy relevant I liked it better when he was getting more minutes alongside cappella just didn't make as much sense in this ball game  DeAndre Hunter Falls very much into the stream while hot category of player he's number one 18 on the season he'll go top 50 for two weeks and then top 200 for two weeks so if you can catch him on the good side of that go ahead I just mostly leave it alone  had to head side it makes it a lot easier because again it's not counting against any sort of games cap Rodeo I I basically just don't deal with Hunter  so again I think the stream while warm guys you guys can just sort of assumed that they fall into the same bucket as the head-to-head schedule plays and the rodeo if he kind of stuff  no other changes for the Hawks so let's move on to Memphis okay see  last game without John Moran went a lot like the other games without John Moran and that's Memphis getting destroyed nobody was good for the Grizzlies in this game not one damn player that's not fair Williams actually a pretty good game Off the Bench but again this is a blowout so nobody cares and things are about to change a lot so don't read too much into this bismack biyombo was out if you're wondering why Xavier Tillman got the start for Memphis don't read too much into that  Desmond Bane was worse I think there's a chance actually that Baine and JJJ the efficiency gains they could get with jaw and smart hopefully later this week coming back could actually counterweight some of the usage stuff but maybe not all of it but again for the Grizzlies those are the four names Bane JJJ smart jaw that should be on rosters and then it's also conceivable that a couple weeks from now we decide smart doesn't even need to be on a roster  how about Chet Holmgren seven more Blocks he's got 15 blocks in his last two ballgames and he's up to 2.9 on the season now absurd  Wendy's at 3 Brooke Lopez is at 3 Chet is it 2.9 and then Anthony Davis is at 2.6  those are your block Meister so far this year and Chet moved up to number nine in nine cat on the shoulders of this incredible blocks run  man I'm glad he was the Lone Golic I think I called him a Young's big swing on the old man squad that one's paid off Josh giddey finally had a good ball game I don't care  let's keep going  Denver blew out Dallas and this was what you guys I mean if you really pay close attention on these podcasts we talked a bunch about the Mavericks stream level guys  and I said I thought Tim Hardaway Jr was probably the safest of the bunch and he was bad in this one but at least he's gonna get enough shots typically to be relevant and this wasn't a blowout I think Hardaway probably would have got another two or three shots  15 shots for him with Kyrie out is enough  and then Luca you know versus the world right now  but then there's all these other guys Dante Exum who we're looking at like okay this guy's shooting like 70% over the last two weeks he actually went five for five in this ball game but he doesn't do much else  and do I Powell filling in for Derek Lively doesn't do enough  Derek Jones Junior  does he really do enough and Grant Williams nah  I mean I know this is a blowout loss so none of these guys got to do as much as usual but this is why I'm afraid of the Dallas streamers  because none of them really has that robust of a fantasy game where you're like oh well this if this guy gets 30 minutes he will definitely be a 100 range guy or better right now Dante some has been that guy but that's because he's been shooting 70% Tim Hardaway Jr is that guy in 30 plus minutes but only when he's playing the role of second star  which he is right now but he didn't get 30 minutes so that's why all those dudes hard ways the one that I probably deploy in most formats right now but again  be wary  don't take anything away from the Nugget side other than kcp coming back and none of these dudes really had to play beyond the middle of the third quarter so this ball game was kind of a clunker for fantasy  let's move on mostly to Utah because Brooklyn they just look not great I mean we talked about Camp Thomas a bit this week already as one of a few guys that I like to put in what I call the flip bucket meaning when he gets hot like this and he's been super hot now for two games in a row you flip him because all the sudden people like ooh he's a top 50 guy and then they forget how iced cold he gets in between  so he'll shoot 55 60% for three or four ball games in a row he'll be a top 50 top 40 guy over that stretch just scoring 30 damn points at night  and then he'll get cold and everybody will remember oh no like he doesn't rebound or pass or really get many steals or blocks  all he really is are points and threes and free-throw percent and so when the points dry up and the field goal percent becomes a Whopper of a negative that's how you end up with a guy ranked basically where he is right now which is  number 100 right on the nose on basketball monster  24 points a game 2.435% super high volume from the field 85% from the free throw line there's your positive space for him but when he goes through and right now he's shooting but 55% last two or three ball games well at 45 for the year that means that they're going to be some 20 shot games or he makes six or seven of them and drags you down Top 40 for a couple weeks top 200 for a couple of weeks he's a flipper  see if you can flip him  Utah though so first of all Walker Kessler back in the starting five and that's why every time he has sort of a weird quite game I call him a Bilo because we know what he can be Collins Sexton shot the ball poorly here but as playing the role of both Jordan Clarkson and keyonte George at the same time he's very much a start a fontecchio is still in the starting lineup because John Collins is still getting over the he played Collins played 20 minutes off the bench we still getting over that respiratory ailment presumably he'll be back here as a starter maybe next game of the one after that so then you can use John Collins again  I'm sure someone out there is asking what to do with Kelly Olynyk and Taylor Horton Tucker Well for olenek now these Back Off the Bench he's a drop tht we've seen this very ugly starters level thing enough this year to feel pretty confident in not making him roster  he scored in double figures and something like seven or eight consecutive ballgames but here's the thing about THD  he's on a steals run right now he is 9 steals in his last three ball games sometimes steals are okay and sometimes he'll get you four or five assists but for the most part he's going to brutalize your field goal percent your free throw percent your turnovers he doesn't rebound much typically doesn't it many three-pointers I know he had five in this ball game but everybody gets caught up in the small sample size stuff  not a nine category guy and also again at some point here George and Clarkson are coming back and then all of this is going to get reshuffled  Washington this game ended closer than it actually was if you're wondering why the wizard starters didn't hit 30 minutes this is the second half of a tough back-to-back Wizards were I forget what they were the night before but they played a pretty damn competitive ball game  good news is that you actually got pretty good fantasy lines out of the the four main guys on this club  tyus Jones has been excellent lately we did a whole segment on him  yesterday's one of yesterday's shows he's up to number 59 now inside the top 60 after another decent ball game  Jordan Poole has become a spot-up shooter which honestly is better for the Wizards if that's his role do not orchestrate dear God Jordan Poole don't orchestrate  and then Kyle kuzma had more efficient ball game here he won eight for 16 from the field made all of his free throws so that pushed him just back inside the top one hundred but again like anytime kuzma has a big ball game he's a cell with pool you're not going to get anything for him anyway so there's sort of no point in trying to sell tyus Jones I'm not selling  because of every passing ball game the Wizards let him run things more and more and they are simply better when he's doing that  I think any obvious a drop uh he was someone that I was low on coming into the season I was ready to admit I was wrong about four weeks in when he was sitting near the top 80 and the world has pivoted and made me write on that one so good for me I guess he's back he's number one 40 in nine CAD even trending down and he's another guy who's actually lost activity with more highest Jones  and then I you know I'm gonna have questions I have to answer about be loud cooler  he's not startable until he reliably gets 10 shots or more per ball game because he's not a good foul shooter he doesn't score much he doesn't shoot the three much he doesn't really doesn't assist much he can rebound all right actually first sort of a guard Wing type decent steals that's the nice stuff so the rebounds the steals the blocks  there's an outline I've said it before I'll say it again for cool to believe there's an outline of fantasy value but as long as he's like seventh in the scoring pecking order it's not going to get there yet  anything on the king side Harrison Barnes had a better scoring game but you know who cares Keegan Murray was great again  I mean  like he was the again I do believe he was basically the easiest Bi-Lo call we've ever given out in the history of this show when he was outside the top 100 basically just because he was shooting 38%  the sky was the limit he's number 54 now  and then the next beat the Lakers honestly I don't know what the hell the Lakers were doing on defense in this ball game because Jalen Brunson Julius Randle and manual quickly they pretty much got whatever they wanted  but from a fantasy standpoint you're not gonna read too much into the manual quickly game every once in a while he gets warm and this is what happens Josh Hart I think tweaked in ankle part way through the game I forget actually had him out but he came back he's scheduled play level only  heart and Stein this is a this is a perfect matchup for him who's the Lakers can't rebound at all so he got 17 boards Jericho Sims heard himself so now hard and shine is kind of the only option left besides Taj Gibson who played five and a half minutes and was a minus 8 hardened was a plus 15 so if you're worried about Taj Gibson taking the sentiments I don't think you need to  and in the very short term hardenstein is gonna play like 3536 minutes of ball game so he now becomes a really good fill-in option because at 30 minutes it was like okay yeah I'll probably be like top 100 3536 that's enough time to rack up a bunch of rebounding numbers  so again I don't even care that they don't run any offense through him the rebounds the steals the blocks the field goal percent pray he doesn't go to the foul line all that's going to be enough now because there are literally no other options for the next  meeting was an ad anyway for a low end Center but now they're now you're going to get a little bit of The Upside clicked in  Lakers were mostly healthy and yesterday's ball game Jarred Vanderbilt tweaked his heel part way through that didn't get lodged in any box scores but he may miss a game or two and if he plays through it you may see just sort of like diminished activity but otherwise it's sort of the usual group add obviously Braun who struggled to shoot the ball and yes yesterday's ballgame I still feel like there's kind of an efficiency dip coming for LeBron who's been crazy good so far this year and that regard Reeves was solid um  you know honestly he and Anthony Davis were probably the team's best offensive options delos been  I feel like he's slowed down and and he actually looks like he's moving more slowly but it's probably just a little bit of a confidence thing he's running a little cold he'll make a few shots he'll see a few go in and he'll get it kicked back up not worried about Dlow I do think that this is I don't know if you call it a buy loan necessarily because I don't know that he gets all the way back where he was which was like right around 60 he's at 80 right now but if you can get him for like 80 to 100 range if somebody thinks that he's trending that way I think I would probably do it and that's I think as far as you need to worry about going with any analysis on the Lakers side and that is a recap of your extraordinarily busy Monday we can do a very quick Tuesday preview because there's only four games on the docket before we do want to remind everybody again to check out our buddies over at

awesome  and again quick mid show reminder you can hit me in the comments after the show on the YouTube page that's youtube.com slash Sports ethos if you're listening after the fact you tube.com / Sports and of course do find me on social at Dan best Bruce quickly here for Tuesday Memphis I mean obviously the big story here is jaw how many minutes does he play he helped does he hurt  that's a stupid way to phrase it because nothing could hurt this team worse than their feeling right now for New Orleans a little bit of mourning news Zion is sick he may or may not please questionable right now  and we got some news Naji Marshall was questionable he's been upgraded to probable so he might actually be an interesting sort of one game stream if Zion sits not for Roto I'm thinking more head-to-head side Jimmy Butler also just got ruled out with ruled out excuse me with some calf soreness for the Heat this feels like probably playing a little safe on the second half of a back-to-back but all of a sudden now you may get heat streamers back in the mix again like a cow Lowry who sat out yesterday's ballgame he's probably good enough to go with Jimmy Butler City and out I don't know about going the rest of the way but again we just talked about Kevin Love so that could be something as well oh that ball game you know that game is tomorrow my mistake guys that's not the half of a back-to-back he just got ruled out a day and a half in advance that's actually kind of bad news sorry guys I downplayed it but I shouldn't have that's kind of unfortunate news so that that might mean that Jimmy Butler's missing a couple anyway it does mean that we can look at heat streamers again Spurs will be without Victor weapon llama that means that Zach Collins is probably good for a short little blip play tonight I don't know how long Wendy's gonna be out but that's something to consider while the Spurs most likely get completely waxed by a Bucks team that's favored  by 16 and a half points let's spread for this ball game holy shmoly  I don't think there's anything on the Bucks side that I'm all that interested in  no you know I told we have one eye on Malachi Branham for this Birds but that's as far as I go there  and you'll just you know you'll see everybody take a few extra shots and that may end up being a bad thing honestly  sons are in Portland this is a game that they should probably win you got the three big names not Beal Durant Booker nurk and then Grayson Allen against a bad defense probably good enough in most formats for this ball game Portland's got their guys back now and lately we've seen that that means Anthony Simon's Jeremy Grant DeAndre startable Malcolm Brogden is falling out of the starter will mix scoot is slowly trending up but he's not quite there yet and so that's why Portland's a team you kind of want to watch on the maybe not even the day-to-day necessarily but the week to week to see which direction they're shifting in who plays and how much Boston this is the front end of a back-to-back they're in Golden State they got Sacramento the following day so we know Horford is gonna miss one of those two ball games don't know about the rest of the team presumably it'll be the second half of the back-to-back but we have no idea  so mostly who cares and then Golden State that one is the more interesting team on the late one Brandon project has been excellent here since Draymond went down Wiggins had a good ballgame his last time around coming off of the bench does that mean he can repeat that Jonathan kaminga is your punt free throw stream play right now would I deploy Andrew Wiggins against the game's cap Al know but I would consider picking him up on the head-to-head side just to see if something is beginning to click and maybe it's just going up against second you and it's maybe it's going out there and you know being like the main shooter on the floor and Chris Paul getting you looks and said of playing off of clay and off of Steph in the first unit maybe this is the game that teaches us a little bit about how that whole thing shakes out but again with Wiggins like we know if things break right for him he can be a top 90 guy and that's why I kind of want to say add just in case and if it's terrible then you just drop  I don't think he's gonna hurt you that bad in one game on the head-to-head side and then in Roto you got unlimited moves anyway into your games cap league so pick them up see what happens if you dumped him at the end of the night who the hell cares how much is that hurt we all love adding and dropping players anyway so  why not do it for funzies  all right what do we got coming up here on fantasy NBA today as we head towards the outlet of the show tomorrow Wednesday we will likely have our cell High show along with a recap of this short Tuesday I have a show that I badly want to do  and I'd love your feedback on it if you guys have a moment the show idea is not a typical male bag show because sometimes and I've done these before and I know a lot of folks do them either pod or live YouTube or whatever where you come on and you just take questions from the live chat I've done those before I want to do something different I want it to be a rate my trade show on the Fly I think that could be a lot of fun and the reason I think it could be a lot of fun is because every time I ask on social for people to post trade that they've done it blows up that's like the most active threads that pop up on social these days how are your trades going so why don't we try porting that into a show  it could be an unmitigated disaster but the only way to find out is to try so my hope is that we can do something like that at some point later on this week  it's going to be questionable because of child care stuff but I'd love to get that show going at some point later this week then of course we'll have our Friday week in review show whenever the hell that gets out again Child Care related and that's what's coming up here on fantasy NBA today I still have I have all these specialty show ideas and I have just no clue when the hell I'm gonna get to do them but damn it at some point they're gonna happen I don't even want to tell you about most of them because I think some are going to be so fun and I'd love to surprise him with you with them  but anyway that's where I said on that one I am Dan best press That's I guess the only thing that matters at this point here because we're signing off at Dan Bass Pros on social fantasy NBA Today is a sports ethos presentation please check out what we've got going on at sports ethos either at the website in the Discord again Discord link is in the show description Sports ethos you can see on your screen but most of you know what that is now Sports ethos.com and those that want to bug me with questions throw them in the comments not the live chat the comments after the show is done I'll make sure to check those out at some point before I fall asleep tonight have a great rest of your Tuesday everybody Daniel signing off we'll see you tomorrow or on social again
