welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  what's happening everybody  still hanging on by a thread  a little bit here  the voice is weak  but the will is strong  I'm expecting to have a full strength back by Monday  surely that's the least I can ask after battling through this God forsaken cough and laryngitis all damn week  good Lord I did finally get smart and grab this much larger mug of water big ole Berkeley mug this should last me a little deeper into the show  the chat room is open  for those that are watching live I make 0 promises about how many questions I get to if any  because  folks I've been pushing it a little bit too hard kind of redlining here doing our long Plus shows with laryngitis this is kind of stupid it's a little stupid at some point I got to just take a minute to get the damn voice right but in any event  we're here now welcome to the show it's fantasy NBA today it's a big weekend review Friday show one of my favorites to do every week  I put the thread out on Twitter beforehand so that everybody knows generally what we're going to be getting to I realized now as I just launched the live show that I forgot to create a Microsoft Word document  that I can display on the screen so I'm gonna try to do that actually while I'm talking to you guys but quickly preview of what we got going on this week  you guys know the big weekend review shows how this works we'll be looking through anything that happened over the last seven days basically  I realized sometimes this can be an ever so slightly confusing way of doing things because some of the players listed in say the ads category because we're gonna go through the ads the holds the guys that are either drops are very very close to being drops you've got the  watch list guys you've got some injury replacement guys were starting to build that board out uh we've got the buy lows we've got the cell highs  all that stuff  can feel maybe a little bit  I don't say that a few names at least will be will feel a little bit obsolete because they might have been guys that were ads on Monday but again this is a week in review show so we're looking at everything that happened over the course of the week  got it  good  that means that if you hear a name when you're like this guy's already been doing this thing for four days keep that to yourself because  I know  I already know but I wanted to go through everything that's happened over this last stretch and kind of reset where we are from a fantasy standpoint  that makes sense I won't do this intro every Friday as the season progresses but I know we're still getting new viewers new listeners every week right now so I want to make sure that folks kind of know what they're getting into with this show  I am Dan Vespers you can find me over on social at Dan best Bruce D A and B e s b r i s it is imperative that you guys locate me over there because there are so many things that I can do during the day and over the weekend where we don't have podcasts that I simply can't do as fast here via the spoken or viewable word so definitely do find me over on social media let's dive in now I think we've set the stage quite enough and this is our weekend review show for week two the ads let's talk about them one by one and I also wanted to mention I know I said we were getting right into it folks on Twitter are always sort of coming back at me like blah blah what do you mean this guy's in this this category this is why I really want folks to watch the show because I can provide a certain context here  on the program here that you can't when you're just typing a name on Twitter  add number one this week is Jalen Suggs I've actually been really impressed with what he's done  so far this year and for me it's it's been a pretty big surprise I don't always game yesterday it was not good he was in foul trouble early and he just sort of never bounced back from it and ended up his minutes ended up largely going to Cole Anthony  and I think we saw a little bit extra at Joe Ingles although that had something to do with Gary Harris going down but this happens sometimes Mark helps was hurt Cole Anthony got really hot  so he's got himself into foul trouble and he just sort of never really bounced back from that the beauty of Jalen Suggs though is that he's basically the league leader in the NBA in deflections right now he's basically everywhere so yeah 6.4 boards three assists but Forbes Steals and a perfect four out of four at the free-throw line I know he missed his shots I don't really care if the bottom for him now is sort of like a Delon Wright type of line which is starting to be what we're seeing here  then that gives him that top 100 Floor that he just didn't have in the past  because right now suggests is still only averaging 25 and a half minutes per game 10 points five and a half boards to assist two Steals and half a block he shooting 37% which is a number one would assume that comes up for him hasn't yes yet Mr free throw this year which you know a number that we can all so safely assume is going to come down  I don't know  I mean it's it's safe to assume I think that steals are going to come down from two that's not a thing that's gonna be sticking throughout the season  but also  I don't know that they're going to fall  all the way down to some low number like if suck his playing full minutes which he's not quite at right now but if he's getting to full minutes he's gonna be a 1.4 or more steals Guy because that's just the way he's built he's everywhere  next name on the ads board is Caris LeVert who  I briefly had on the injury replacement board for today's show because yes his numbers do get significantly better when guys like Darius Garland or Donovan Mitchell or both are out  but he's played I think well enough to be rostered  even when the team is healthy now the problem of course with Levert is that percentages kill him he's a 39% from the field right now he's at 54% at the free throw line  we can safely assume neither one of those numbers is going to hold where they are that's why he's outside the top one 30 the other stuff he's done so far has actually been marvelous  five assists 20 points 33 pointers a game turnovers only a 1.5  the field goal for free throw percentage are not going to be good for him they're not gonna be positive but he's also not going to be too basically one you know among the worst in the league at both  throughout the entire season field goal percent is going to get up into the low to mid 40s free throw percentage is probably gonna get up into the low 70s maybe mid 70s and they delightful universe but I don't think we can expect that if you adjust for that right now then he's very much been a fantasy value you also have to adjust for the fact that he won't get 19 shots a game when the team is fully healthy but he's running that second unit and we saw him play really well down the stretch last year so I'm willing to take a shot on him kind of hanging in there and so Charisma Verde is an ad right now for me up I may be getting out in  a little bit in front of things with this one but I put Josh Richardson on the ad board and he's nowhere near fantasy relevant right now so let's make sure that everybody  is fully aware that as I say his name out loud this is not like a you got to go race out and pick him up kind of thing because you're not racing against anyone nobody else is chasing down Josh Richardson in this exact moment  but Miami gave him 30 minutes off the bench yesterday  two days ago sorry doesn't matter the days all blurred together now that we're a day 11 of the season it's officially the grind nothing beyond that really matters  I'd like to draw everybody's attention to basically the final  I was in like maybe a month or so last year it wasn't even maybe necessarily that long but it was a stretch of time late last year  when Richardson got a chance to play a little bit more maybe it was like right around  even go to the game log and figure this thing out on the fly so I'm not kind of hand waving my way through these this explanation on on Jay Rich he's not the guy he used to be  so let's get that out of our minds he's not the Josh Richardson of his early days in Miami even though he's now you know officially back in Miami but there was a stretch like it was right around the trade deadline I think he was actually still in  crap where the hell I mean I forget how many teams he bounced around with last year San Antonio was in the mix New Orleans was in the mix what the hell ordered this all happen and I think it was San Antonio right before the trade deadline and you'll excuse me because I'm trying to keep a lot of thoughts straight in my brain and sometimes they get flip-flopped and then briefly I think even after the trade to New Orleans so he sure got showcased right before the deadline  and he put up pretty big numbers for the Spurs and then after the deadline the Pelicans utilized him as kind of a de facto point guard for a week or two while they were waiting to get Brandon Ingram back and then once he got back yes obviously the job for Richardson decreased considerably and as the team got healthier and healthier than he didn't really have to do as much  but the point of this discussion is to point out the games where he actually got some significant playing time let's play the what does j-rich do when he sees 28 minutes or more game  and it happened more than a handful of times last year very rarely early in the season he had a couple of games like right as the year started where he posted 11 points and 10 assists with a couple of steals in a block he had a 30-minute game this is in late October of last season 12 points five board six assists a couple of Threes in a steal and then he didn't crack 28 minutes again until January 4th where he went for 20 points three boards for assists in a steel anyway the dialogue goes on like this basically not every single time but basically every time Jay Rich got 28 minutes or more last year which I'm classifying as starter level minutes about seven minutes out of 12 per quarter he posted strong fantasy lines  both situations and Antonio  New Orleans either side of that ledger he found his way to good fantasy numbers when he saw 28 minutes  he got 30 minutes  it for Miami two days ago and he was terrible but with the caveat that his terrible was because he shot one for nine  he had three boards three assists a steal and a three-pointer while shooting one for nine  if we adjust for the fact that over his career and obviously you can't you know you can't always make 43% of your shots in a given night but over the course of his career he's been a 43% shooter 37% from 3-point land and this year so far and it's two games he's shooting 25% from the field and 14% from downtown  you worry about the minutes not the percentages right now you know what they're going to end up being  so if you adjust for that that puts him closer to well not quite four out of nine in their last ball game which is what he did in his first game by the way he went three for seven only played 23 minutes and that one six points 3 boards two assists you're not gonna worry about that we're talking about 28 minutes or more if you really gonna get nine shots per game  in 28 minutes or more  maybe that number actually increases as he settles in call it 10  he's going to get three rebounds just being on the court for 28 minutes he's gonna get three assists just being on the court for 28 minutes and historically when he plays starter's minutes he's a one-to-one point two steals guy and he's close to half a block as well  I also assume he'll be around two three-pointers per game because a lot of his shots are coming from that neck of the woods so now we're starting to look at somebody who's more like a dozen points  three boards three assists 1.2 steals two three-pointers that's a guy that's inside the top 100 he's not blowing the roof off the building this isn't like a oh pick up Josh Richardson he's gonna be a top 60 guy now don't take that out of context someone's gonna snip that I'm saying no that's not what's gonna happen but we're already at a part of the season end of the second week where the guy's dad are exploding onto the scene they the folks that come out of nowhere to be top 75 let's go guys are probably dried up by now  so I think this is worth a look to see what happens  Gordon Hayward is the next name on the list he's been an ad since late last week so I don't want to spend too much time on it this is one where you just see what happens until and through a return of Miles Bridges  maybe Hayward keeps his value maybe he doesn't who cares pick him up see what happens Christian Wood is one that is he got drafted in a lot of spots and then got dropped in a lot of spots when he played you know dozen minutes the first couple games of the year his roster ship is still at 39% so it didn't completely tanked after a few really bad ball games but over his last two both Laker wins by the way he's had the best plus minus of anybody on the team over those two ball games  and he's done it by playing within himself and within a Lakers set up in a way that we just haven't really seen Christian would do in the past he's always been a guy that's just tried to go out there and get his and if finally caught up with him or the league was like this guy's not a good teammate he's out there to just go get his points and Boards he doesn't really care what's going on he's bought in in La so far now a lot of things can change over the course of a year but he's earning his minutes and over the last two ball games is averaging nine and a half points 10 rebounds two blocks and one and a half three pointers that's worth a shot to see if it's sticks the Lakers are missing really hot tomorrow that's been helpful they're missing Jarred Vanderbilt that's been helpful for wood they're missing Gabe Vincent which Believe It or Not does have sort of like a triple up effect where the Lakers are more likely to go big but it's also just been a good lineup at the end of the day and I watched these games closely I watch the Laker games more closely than others because I am a Laker fan I like to think that I  kind of cover them a little bit in my own brain  and it's been a good look  like who's going on a road trip starting tomorrow we'll get a little more confirmation there although I think we know Gabe Vincent's out for a couple of weeks  we might see how much more back for a game pretty soon so maybe we'll get a little more clarity there and then Vanderbilt his return what is that mean but Tori and prints left their last ball game as well most forgot about that so I'd say add Christian Wood and kind of see how that plays out  and the last one I'm putting on the ads board is DeAndre Hunter and I admit I'm very slow on this one because I don't believe he's gonna shoot 55% for an entire season he's probably not also gonna have one and a half steals for an entire season because historically his steel rate is more like about point eight point nine in starters minutes so yes those numbers are coming down and with them when the field goal percent dips back down you'll see the scoring come back towards 15 or 16 instead of 18 you'll see the steals come down to more like one if you want to call it that also I guess we could assume it's blocks might actually come up a tiny bit he's taking more three-pointers and he's hitting them at a good clip which we can call a good thing but I'd also point out that the start of this season reminds me a little bit of a start of his season back in 2020 100 was at 15 points 5 boards to assist one point three defensive stats and a little under one and a half three pointers a game on 86% free throw shooting as well and 48% from the field and if you recall then he went down for a really long stretch and injury he was inside the top 80 that year  so no I don't think the Andre Hunter is gonna be what he's been so far which is top 40 That's not sticking but top 80 top 100 is still a possibility so I'm calling him an ad with the hopes that understanding the bottom is going to fall out a little bit we just hope it doesn't fall all the way out  folks picture this nightmare scenario you're hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat your

my face to be big on the YouTube side I don't but that was a little bit too small  let's start on the whole board and this is actually a really long one because I think this is the week of the hold  we made a lot of ads during week one  week two is when we figure out which of them actually belongs still on your team Kelly oubre  this one I don't think deserves that much breakdown  but we heard from Nick nurse that he's gonna start here in the immediate term following the James Harden trade but they did get four power forwards and they like having ubreak come off the bench as a small forward Gunner type so expect him to shift back to a bench role at some point I'm not worried about it when he does what I'd like to note is who ends up in the starting lineup but it doesn't sound like we're going to get that for a couple of ball games  D Anthony Melton remains a hold on my board he is very much off to a bad start in almost every respect  and yet at the same time  he's still fantasy playable not good right now but playable while shooting 28%  if you basically just adjust for that shooting percentage then he said the top 100 guy  because he'll get up to about 41% probably by the end of the year  you know 88 and a half shots I actually expect his minutes to Trend in the right direction maybe maybe not anyway as the shots start to fall he'll go from one three-pointer to one and a half or two the scoring will come up with it it's sort of the rising tide thing with him and I realized he's more of a steals specialist that then sort of tries not to bludgeon you in too many other categories and maybe you don't need a ton of Steel at the end of your roster but I think he's going to be a whole lot of a lot better than he is right now so he's a hold I'm a little bit worried about what all these new guys coming in will do because not that they play his same position but it could force guys down if Patrick Beverley is having a good ballgame he would play more Uber it could take minutes from Melton it's not such a sure bet  as it was when the only guy involved in this trade was PJ Tucker that was actually playing now they brought four guys in that could all be a part of the mix so this is not an indefinite hold but it's certainly a hold for now  I put Isaiah Stewart on this board and I'm really not fully sold on that because as he's playing 34 minutes of game and he's actually ranked behind the Anthony Melton by two slots they were right next to each other in the 150 range  and I just don't know what's Stewart's going to do that's a whole lot better than what he's doing right now other than kind of crossing my fingers and praying that he gets a couple of defensive stats  I'm I met advocated drop on Stewart by this time next week I just want to give it a little bit longer to see if some of those defensive Stats come around and I don't know that they will it's never really been his main attraction on the defensive side he's a power forward on this team now he's not a center so you can't Bank on him just like being near the bucket  when he first came into the league as a center he was blocking a shot and a half per game  now he's at half a block per game and I get it there's a lot of variants on that so it's possible that it bounces back that's that is why I would like to give him a little bit longer because 13 points in eight and a half rebounds don't grow on trees and he's hitting one and a half three pointers on top of it  but I just can't justify a guy who's a negative in every other category besides rebounds  yeah I mean that's the end of that thought really unless the blocks can get over call it one I need to get him to one block per game and that'll keep him on my roster but so far he hasn't all really been all that close to it  herb Jones was someone that I was contemplating moving on from or plopping into a streaming slot and then he had the biggest game of his entire life last night and yeah so obviously he's a hole now  his job you know they're missing Zion they were missing Brandon Ingram for that one so that was a really big part of it for her  I just got to see him do stuff when the team is healthy and at the same time we also all need to understand  that this team is never healthy  it's kind of the Trey Murphy situation but just for her instead and by the way Trey Murphy also not healthy right now so there are three guys that were out for that last ball game that's what it took to get herb Jones actually go do something on offense  please do more herb  we got more holds don't worry we got plenty more than that YouTuber saw me just flip a page Max Drews is a whole we I talked about him every single day this is a guy who has shot horrifically so far he said 35% from the field and he still inside the top 90  because he's rebounding he's assisting he's still hitting three somehow he's getting some steals he's getting some Blocks he's a great foul shooter  when the field goal percent comes around to whatever it is I don't know that we actually know what is field goal percentage is going to end at this year you can't just point to what he was in Miami because his job is very different here  but career is at 42 and a half percent  last year was a 41 previous series of 44 his role is a lot bigger this season he's taking nine three pointers a game but he's also shooting only 31% from downtown after being more of a 37% 3-point shooter in the previous two seasons maybe even more like 38 so that's a really big deal I mean this dude is taking nine three pointers a game he has a real legitimate shot to get close to three and a half threes  I mean that's crazy  that's a lot  it's Klay Thompson s but he rebounds better now I expect the rebounds will come down when Jared Allen returns because right now he's sort of he's fighting with Evan Mobley and then a bunch of guards basically for rebounds so that's not a number that's going to hold  it's hard to see the blocks holding where they are first so because he really didn't get any in my Miami but  rebounds blocks come down field goal percent scoring threes all go up expect this to be a balancing act for him he to me remains pretty easy calls arrested season guys so don't abandon ship their Camp Thomas I don't know why I put him on here on I don't think anybody's contemplating a drop there especially not while Camp Johnson is out but he did have a terrible shooting last ball game and you know eventually he's gonna wreck your field goal percent so just be aware of that  I put the a note on this next one  folks this is the last time I'm going to say this on Yucca okongwu is a hold all season long I don't care if there's a game where he plays 19 minutes I don't care  at some point click a bell is going to miss a game  and then okong was gonna go completely crazy and guess what in the meantime you know what he's ranked right now  73 and he's done it without getting defensive stats so far  this is not debatable  saddiq Bey and Jalen Johnson are also each on my whole list I went heavy on the Atlanta Hawk holds right now Bay got slotted back into the starting lineup when he's in there he can probably ease his way into the top one hundred Jalen Johnson moved back to the bench interestingly those two guys are ranked 90 and 901 per game so far this year so by rank  tells you what you need to know they should both be on rosters  it's not really clear what direction either of them goes from this point which is why they are holds easy peasy kcp as a hold he's gonna have big games he's gonna have slow games it's gonna bounce around but guess what he's number 57 right now so the fact that I have to even talk about it is upsetting Brandon Miller is a hold you guys know I'm not super into rookies but he's number one 11 I'd like to just see where it goes he may end up as a drop specially as the Hornets get some of their injured guys back slash suspended guys back  but he's at 16 points six rebounds 47% from the field 83 at the free throw line she's not really hurting you he hasn't really gotten any defensive stats and we don't fully know if they're gonna come around  but again your week and a half into the season you can't just assume they won't so stick with Brandon Miller see how it shakes out  if we end up dropping him at some point fine  but it wouldn't be now Derek Lively the second and maybe I should have put him on the injury replacement board because his numbers came around when Maxie Cleaver went down Lively has a very interesting Fantasy game he rebounds he actually passes all right from the center spot Steals and Blocks he's shooting 79% from the field right now but he's also only shooting 44% at the free throw line kind of a punt free throw number to this point we don't know how that's gonna play out I think we can assume 79% from the field is probably coming down at some point this year will the playing time Trend up will it turn down will it stay the same is going to be based on injured guys around him  he may end up as a drop but we'll put him in the whole department for now just to kind of see a little bit longer how these things play out and then Xavier Tillman who is more of a spot play guy honest he's number one 61 right now which is not good but he's also only shooting 37% which isn't gonna hold and we've seen his minutes Bounce Around based on the opposition  so far any time the Grizzlies have played a team with a bald dominant but like a scoring threat big man he's been a part of the mix when they've played teams that want to space you out and just use their Center as a defender or a role man or a 3-point shooter Tillman hasn't played you could use them like that or you could drop him and let somebody else deal with that nonsense I actually don't care I have no problem with you guys deciding that Tillman is too much of a headache  I'll leave him on the holds board for now because again we're only a week and a half into the season  Memphis hasn't made a full decision there  but look Santi aldama is still out  that's gonna be a problem because if they want to go smaller that's another opportunity they could play him power forward JJJ Center and kind of alternate who's dealing with what  does Tillman end up as a top 100 play all season long I thought maybe at the beginning of the year I'm thinking probably a little bit outside that Mark now and but I want to give it a little bit longer to see what the next what is the next step here for Mr Tillman  the I'm scared or nervous or drops board is next I know there's a lot of caveats there but I got in trouble last season when I just called these guys flat drops when there is a little bit more nuanced to that  and then the Nuance is  that some of these guys are very close to drops and I wanted to get them on the board somewhere today to talk about but I couldn't figure out where to fit them other than to just expand the drops category to meaning a little bit more  anyway let's get into them these are the guys that are either droppable or very close to Gary Trent Jr  it feels to me like the Raptors he's not part of their plans and that is kind of reason enough  now an injury or two would change that but that's why we have the injury replacement board  Paul Reed sorry everybody  we all took a shot on him at pick one 40 in drafts it's not happening unless you want to wait for the Joel and beat rest game which  I don't know man I think it'd be wants to play for the most part they'll find some games to give him a break here and there and then that'll be a day where you want to roll Paul Reed out there but I don't think you need to sit on him the whole damn season for those nights that again is what the injury replacement board is for  basically all the Pacers Wings is the next name on this list besides Bruce Brown I'm going to hold on to Bruce I think he's got a kind of 95 range Fantasy game for this year but buddy hield is a luxury stash at this point bennedict mathurin I don't know if he's ever gonna get anything else in his Fantasy game besides free throw shooting and a couple of rebounds here and there it doesn't seem like they Trust  any of the other guys to give them full minutes like Obi topping Marinis Smith Andrew Neymar blah blah blah blah blah the list goes all the way down it's the same crap as last year so why bother  my buddy Dillon right I have he's not in the drops list yet he's more in the I'm scared list we need to see the Wizards play a damn competitive ball game because it feels like Delon Wright's going to see more playing time when the game matters  but the Wizards aren't playing games that matter right now every damn game for them seemingly is decided by the middle of the third quarter  at some point they're going to play a game where the score is a little bit tighter  I think that Memphis game was  a little bit closer  and Indie kind of blue things open a little later in the third quarter but like Atlanta they fell apart early in the third boss and they were done by half-time  Indie was like kind of half done  if you want to see like look at Jordan pools minutes he only cleared 30 minutes in the game against Memphis which tells you all you need to know that's the only game they've played where they felt like it was a competitive winnable ball game late and they did they won it but also we don't really know what their rotations are going to look like in a game in a multiple games in a row where they are actually in the mix so let's stick it out a little bit longer on the Delon Wright freight train and see what his job actually is going to be for this team  slo-mo I'm worried he's not a drop yet either I'm a little bit worried we haven't really seen him with the same role he had last year and I wonder if some of that is because Mike Conley exists where you know if you go to the game log and a lot of what he did last year was with some guys out but even once cat came back last season slo-mo was still putting up good fantasy lines  this year the rebounds are down  he assists are still okay but you know he had two in the last ball game and he only cleared 25 minutes only 26 minutes one time that was the season opener and that was the game where he had a line that we were looking for which is 7 points nine boards five assists in a couple of steals that's basically what we're gunning for with slo-mo he hasn't needed to do more than that and now Jaden McDaniels is back also so I do think there's a chance to slow mo and ends up as a way for wire guy I want to give it just a little bit longer and so he's hanging on just a little bit before we get to drop and then Kobe white kind of snuck his name on the last page here of the they flipped it over on YouTube Kobe White's a drop I don't need to wait any longer this is how I felt basically going into the year his Fantasy game is never been good for nine cat he's number 200 and 74 and I know what you're gonna say Danny shooting 31% aren't you a fan of normalizing that type of number yeah it doesn't matter  if you had 10% to his field goal percent and you know two points he's still not a fantasy play because he gets no Steals and no blocks and doesn't make that many three pointers they're just ain't enough there  sorry Kobe White  piece  here's some watch lists names as I remind you guys once again to please like rate and subscribe and for those that have joined us here after the fact that the chat room is open but I don't know that I'm gonna get through that many of them because I really need to give my voice a little bit of time off if you've been watching this show over the last few days you've heard that I sound a bit Gravelly it's probably the kindest way to put it and I just need some recovery time I did bring a much larger water jug today  and I'm hoping that allows us to power to our normal distance but we'll see watch list the new power forwards in Philly let's find out if anybody actually gets slotted in they each got one minute just to sort of touch the floor with their foot see if it was warm or cold I think some of those guys will see more playing time as we go forward we just don't know who yet  Marcus Sasser and Alec Burks in Detroit I think when Burks comes back we might see Sasser slow a little bit but let's keep an eye on both of them Drew Eubanks in Phoenix he's been a watch list guy since this fantasy run up you know back in the draft season because there is always this fear that use of ni-rich can't keep up  particularly once the Suns have their offense back meaning when Bradley Beal gets back in there and they can slot in somebody who is able to score and replace whoever these veterans minimums  goobers are on the team will they need Yusef nurkic in the first unit or will they then start to prefer Drew Eubanks with some back-end defense and you know Rim running attacking kind of stuff we'll see I don't think it's a reason to panic I know you Banks out played nerd yesterday I wouldn't Panic on it yet if you have nerdish but it is always a little bit of a reason that actually gonna be looking over his shoulder there's someone in his review because you Banks is pretty good  Josh Hart is on the watch list I came pretty close to putting him on the ads board or the injury replacement board because he got a bunch of minutes when RJ Barrett went down but I still want to see the minute trend for heart when the Knicks are healthy and it seemed like it was trending up a tiny bit in the last ball game before RJ Barrett got hurt but I need to see it again when RJ's back or do we just pick up Josh Hart call him an ad as an injury replacement add and then at least you've got him in case the minutes actually stick  hey we cracked the 100 live viewers Mark as we clear Josh Hart Nas Reid is on the watch list because damn it I am always gonna be watching Nas read so far this year he is actually inside the top 100 mostly because he's hitting two three-pointers and shooting 56% from the field he just does his fantasy stuff so fast  good Lord I wanted him traded or to sign with the team that was going to give him a reliable 25 26 minutes a night he's averaging 24 with Minnesota one of those it's largely because of one big ball game  and he's been down around 1920 and most of the other ones good Lord I love Nazarene so much I just want any excuse to pick him up and roll him out there so if you wanted to you could probably do it he's 49% roster now so that number has been pretty quickly on the rise after not his most recent ball game but the the couple before that but I tell you man they're just very few bigs that do what he does as efficiently as he does it  it's crazy he has a great Fantasy game  and I I just don't know if we can trust it day in and day out but damn it I really want to put Nazarene on my teams and this is why I want people watching this show because people on Twitter are going to see nazri read on the watch list they're not gonna be able to feel my heart being pulled towards his name like I just want to lean towards my computer screen and touch Nas reads name because I really do think that you could put them on your roster now and you wouldn't feel bad about it  I don't think you'd regret it  Dillon Brooks is on my watch list he's an ads board guy in a lot of formats not as much for me because he's shooting 60% from the field right now and we know that number is going to take an absolute nose dive for a career 41 and a half percent shooter he's way out over his skis his usage is lower than it was in Memphis last year he took 13 and a half shots here before that he took 16 and a half  but you know scoring is up from last year because he's shooting 20 damn percent better he's also a 1.8 steals per game after being typically in starters minutes more like a 1.1 1.2 guy but I mean maybe Houston is playing a healthcare I mean Memphis played a pretty Helter Skelter way  I don't think that number sticks anywhere higher than 1.2 1.3  the assist the rebounds are pretty repeatable the free-throw percent is at 88% I expect that to be no higher than 85 that's the career high for him and guys dude is shooting 63% from three  it's all taking a nose dive for Dillon Brooks so if you want to ride the heater have at it but he's on my watch list cuz I just don't believe this is going to happen  Alex Caruso's on my watch list because day in and day out I just keep praying that Billy Donovan's gonna give him enough minutes to be a reliable fantasy guy hasn't happened yet but doesn't mean a Walt  Grant Williams in Dallas wrote Otis Grant Williams that's the best way I can think to describe him he's number one oh two which puts him firmly right on the game's cap cut line but he is hitting for three pointers a game right now and if he could ever show his damn face in the defensive stats Department that would get him on rosters in a heartbeat problem of course is that Grant Williams is not a defensive stats guy  he's never played 31 minutes a game before so presumably 0.3 and 0.3 will get better  I mean if you look at his Boston days he was playing 25 minutes a game last year he was at 0.5 and 0.4 he was a 24 minutes the year before that he was at 0.5 and 0.7 I think we can safely assume the defensive stats are going to get to at least half and half  but I think we can probably all assume he's not going to shoot 55% from three  41% maybe  so which thing matters more the defensive stats going up or the three-point percent coming down  they probably balance each other out he probably ends up right around 100 to 1:10 which is playable in a lot of formats and not playable barely in others do what you will with that information and then Derek Jones whose quietly having some really good ball games in Dallas and nobody's talking about it probably because not of us believe that it's gonna continue and we have a lot of reasons to believe that that's the case and he hasn't really worked his way onto fantasy Radars yet because his overall numbers remain very bad but all of a sudden he's posting numbers like really legitimately out of nowhere now he's number 262 on the year because he's done nothing other than score a lesbian points per game and  add to that Zippo does even have a defensive stat so far this year no not one not even one  but always last two ball games and maybe some of that is Kyrie related  he scored 22 points and 17 points he said 73 pointers over those so that's why he's on the watch list he's not an app he was an ad I put him in the ads board if you watch list guy I put him in the watch list board  it's pretty straightforward  that's the watch list board by the way  injury replacement board which I had made I kind of screwed this thing up here by  see if I can move it on to the next page ah darn it I couldn't get it to move on to the next page the injury replacement board for those watching on YouTube is on the following page that I'll flip over on this screen but for everybody listening you don't know what I'm talking about it doesn't matter MO vogner  and this is sort of burying the lead he should be one of the first things you do because Wendell Carter Junior broke a finger last night and is expected to miss at least three weeks maybe more  possible I would assume more but I don't know we'll see and Wagner is a guy that like Nas Reed can actually put a fantasy value pretty quickly  does this guarantee he's gonna get all the sentiments it does not but 24 minutes of Moe is probably enough to get him in that 115 range anything beyond that is kind of fantasy gravy so roll with it  Cole Anthony  guys did you know as I haven't had to stop the show for a massive coughing fit today that's a really big step for me Cole Anthony because Mark helps and Gary Harris were both out in the last ball game Harris was in the middle of it but Anthony would stand to benefit and I didn't put Joe Ingles on there because I just don't think that he has the lift anymore not that he ever really had lift but he had sort of guile and now he's just so slow after all these injuries and age kicking in that it's not worth that exploration but Cole Anthony and and Jaylen Suggs who's on the ads board those guys have benefit a lot if faults and Harris Miss additional time and then Dorian Finney Smith with Nick klaxon out has had himself a really good feeling weak this injury board by the way will grow  but what I like to do is play it kind of safe now always talked about we've talked about it this year we talked about it in Seasons past I don't like to do a lot of streaming the first week or two of the season one of the reasons for that is that we often don't actually know yet what player on a team is going to step up when a guy goes down now sometimes it's obvious  Wendell Carter Junior went down we didn't need to know we didn't need a game to learn that moves a guy who's gonna step into more playing time because he's basically the backup center there there's a one-to-one thing  with Brooklyn we didn't know Dorian Finney Smith was going to be the guy to step up a lot of us myself included Ron sharp was gonna get a shot to be Center but it hasn't been him at all they've instead gone to the space doubt mode letting Ben Simmons handle kind of the cluttering of the lane now they only have one guy standing inside and instead they've gone so sort of a floor space in look by playing Dorian Finney Smith so  if we had if I had actually said I'm gonna stream this guy and it would have been sharp there it would have pooped all over the place this is why we wait we want to see what teams are going to do before we act on it  a couple of Buy Low names actually three of them Walker Kessler who has been a massive disappointment so far he's number one hundred and 162 he did have a better ball game this last time out got his season blocks number up to 1.7 with one big one I think he'll get better as the year goes on Utah's still kind of diluting themselves into saying oh yeah we're gonna we're definitely gonna be a competitive team all season long this year they are not the Jazz are two and four Mike Conley being gone one of the biggest reasons for it  they just don't have anybody to sort of Helm the ship and don't get me started on tailing Horton Tucker who will appear in his very own category later in today's show  but look like at some point Kessler's gonna get some more minutes we saw it late last season so whatever you will try to figure out what we can get him for and will you social media for that so again come find me at Danbury so over there we'll run some polls and we'll figure out what we can make these moves on the other two by Lowe's are some really big name guys Damian Lillard who had one gigantic game and so teams thought they were really in for a beautiful start and he's been quite bad since then the last three he's down to number 59 in nine cat on the year scoring only 21 points you know the free throws are floating it because he had that 17 for 17 free throw game but this is not what people expected  even though they probably should have  because putting two superstars together to highest usage players on the same team  takes time to sort out that's just the way it works ladies and gentlemen  you could also put Giannis on this board by the way he's number 166 and some of that is the free throw side but some of it is the fact that he's scoring just 24 points with nine rebounds and two and a half assists  those guys are going to figure it out  do I know exactly how long it's going to take to get there I do not  I do not  but  I'm willing to bet that it's going to happen so go get them and we'll use Twitter for that all so to figure out what it's going to cost Jimmy Butler's the other one he may be the easiest Bi-Lo recommendation I've ever given in my entire life he's shooting 36% from the field only 83% on his pretty high volume free throws only one steel only 16 and a half points only three and a half assists all of this stuff is going to improve for Butler even if you only think he's gonna get inside the top 25 low right now and will again use social media to figure out what that's worth couple of sell hi guys yonas Fallen as a cell High he's gotten off to a really good start this year at top 50 there is zero chance that he stays inside the top 50 big minutes with Zion resting he's been able to do a little bit extra in the early going because of no Brandon Ingram by the way and you're like how does that actually impact Jonas they need more often when one of their key guys is out we saw it last year when this team is healthy JV is  a little bit of an afterthought when they played teams that can attack him on defense he loses his playing time he does have a better shot to get to inside the top 100 this year than I thought on draft night I avoided him in basically every format altogether but ain't no way he's staying near the top 50 so go get what you can for him and his teammates CJ McCollum is a sell High because CJ is number 23 right now  well averaging 24 points almost 4 3 points six boards six assists one and a half steals half a block and he's managed to do it despite the fact that his percentages are not all that amazing do I think he falls all the way back into the 80s or 90s maybe not again with the team healthy I don't think that this type of stuff sticks see if you can get a top 50 Reigns guy for him see if you can get a top 60 range guy for him I think all of that would actually be worth while and finally the one player in a brand new category I call Sai I just can't is Taylor Horton Tucker who I refuse to believe is going to be worth the headache although admittedly he did have his best game of the season yesterday still only got him up to number 145 on the year the assists in the Steelers have been pretty good so far everything else has been pretty bad so far I don't know that any of that is going to magically turn around I understand if you want to ride out the Talen Horton Tucker experience to see if he can start to score 15 points a night with the six or seven assists that he's been getting so far with the one point two one point three steals because if those numbers come around like if you start to score more like 14 15 that probably gets him near the top 100 I don't know that 3 pointers would be coming along free throws I don't expect to get much better field goal present is going to be a problem for him he's been able to do it so far with turnovers relatively low that might actually get worse  but I get it because you're chasing the possibility that Taylor Horton Tucker figures it out but again what are the odds that he just magically figures it out he's had been given starters minutes before and he still doesn't work in nine cat points League you're going to ride it out because his worst categories are the ones that matter lesson points formats I know some points they do care about percentages a little bit more now than they used to but that's not the case for all of them  friends we have more to discuss we have more to discuss and that is the 30-in preview good Lord and we're already at 52 minutes but look we've we've got things to do here so let's start working our way through it we'll start with the seven game Friday this is a relatively light Friday and the reason for that is because the NBA in-season tournament kicks off tonight I don't think that it's going to change things very much in terms of you know who's playing and how much they're playing but we'll get people a little bit of a watch on things the Cavaliers  are the first team on the board  Karis Levert I'm not gonna repeat myself from things that we talked about from the player breakdowns from early but anything else that's worth monitoring there so basically the Darius Garland and Jared Allen health status is the additional things you're going to want to monitor on the Cleveland Cavaliers for Indiana it's all about the wings does anything change their and Tyreese Halliburton status is another one so do we get a teaching McConnell or Andrew Hart data maybe maybe not for the next we already talked about it Josh Hart he's the main thing you can throw a manual quickly on your watch list as well Milwaukee it's all about players settling in Buy Low times on Dame Giannis even Brooke Lopez you could throw him on the Bi-Lo board as well Warriors draymond's impact on CP3 is the main thing we're watching there but also whether or not Andrew Wiggins is just sort of bad now which kind of feels like maybe he just kind of is bad now but perhaps that's all so the time when someone is the maximum Buy Low I don't really want Andrew Wiggins  but I get it because he'll be better than this  thunder know Shay in this game will get a data point on a future Burger board player oh and people keep asking me what the burger board is and I realized I should probably explain myself it's basically the injury replacement streamer board I assigned players value in Burgers last year where if somebody was injury replacement  they got one burger if they were just good enough to be a start in Roto Games Capitol League two burgers if I thought they could be like top 75 or better and three burgers if they were top 50 or better type of fill in for a guy being hurt and out Wizards we just need a competitive game we need some actual data on this team Miami we already talked about Josh Richardson Brooklyn it's who's in who's out Dinwiddie is in cam Johnson still out Nick Clacks and I believe still out as well so again it's about Burger boards there  for the Bulls I just need to see this team like each other a little bit doesn't seem like they like each other right now in addition to the Alex Caruso stuff Grizzlies still looking for a win  this is a spot they could get it three and a half Point Road favorites over the the Blazers who have been to this point frankly playing better than the Grizzlies but for Memphis I'm keeping one eye on Luke Kennard I didn't put him on the watch list because he really all that not that close to being relevant but if they start to actually give him playing time and efficient 3-point shooter like that could rock it up the boards desire Williams you can put on the sort of fringy watch list as well for Portland I think we have a pretty good idea scoot is out for a bit but you know it seemed like the initial move there was just even more Malcolm Brogden  DeAndre ayton is one of the weirdest disconnect players in the NBA right now I saw someone call him a Buy Low and he's number 18 in nine cat that's a weird Bi-Lo rack man  Dallas I think we talked about everything we needed to talk about their which Grant Williams Derek Lively Tim Hardaway Juniors heater weather kyrese gonna play  Denver  nothing  let's go to Saturday  Phoenix can we please get Bradley Beal in there so we can see what this team is gonna look like so far it really has just been Devin Booker against the universe because Cadiz kind of floating into the year  we'll see nirk versus Eubanks we already talked about that Philly  will any of the new guys play and then what impact does that have on guys like uber and D Anthony Melton  Charlotte uh not much actually  very little  Andy we talked about Atlanta  we've already covered everything already there babe Johnson Center minutes all that stuff Pelicans who's in who's out Brandon Ingram is back we say no we saw Jordan Hawkins have a couple of good ball games and then he completely disappeared  and then it was herb Jones in the last one so it's all about figuring out who actually might step up on a game to game Lakers we talked about Christian wood if anybody comes back for that team will pay attention to them as well it Orlando Jalen Suggs Cole Anthony same stuff Mo Wagner we'll get our first look at whether or not he deserves one Burger two burgers three or none Boston nothing Brooklyn we talked about Sacramento  filling in for deer and fox Davion Mitchell had a really good ball game last time out I don't expect him to hit 3 threes and have three three steals though so I still kind of lean my link mug as the Malik Monk Is the guy there Houston it seems like the starters of the guys that are relevant although you guys know I don't trust Jalen green far as I can throw him Utah tht and uh Walker Kessler but no nothing beyond the board that we talked about earlier Minnesota Kyle Anderson is the guy there not as Reed is also watchable talked about Chicago already Denver nothing  and then Sunday Detroit they don't play Friday or Saturday so they're worth exploring all the way into the weekend  Sasser Burks we talked about earlier in the show but also Isaiah Stewart and whether or not he actually is worth  hanging onto but again we're gonna get him a few more ball games to see if he gets a couple of blocks here and there  Toronto not much really we talked about Gary Trent Yakima's minutes are on the board San Antonio Devin vissel heard his groin he's expected miss a few weeks we'll see if anybody steps up there I doubt anybody just drops right into his stuff it's probably just more for the other regulars which maybe then is enough to kind of push those guys into a better positioning I don't like to see more Trey Jones because he's been one of their best players so far and obviously a big big big big game out of wemb yesterday  Warriors we talked about Cavs we talked about or did we did we talked about the Cavs  yeah we did  Charlotte Dallas Memphis Portland all right that's all 30 and that's your weekend preview and that means that we can now finally take a couple of questions as we approach the one hour mark  oh boy let's see how many of these we get through hey before I take questions reminder if you're listening this show come join us live next time or if you're watching after the fact and then you too perhaps can throw your stuff into the YouTube chat soon as the room is open as soon as I open the video basically as soon as I created and streamyard the chat room opens immediately  and the people up at the top were gonna get priority on that one also do find me on social I know new people are going to be finding this show on YouTube this is just the way it works someone's gonna find it that wasn't there before you're gonna hopefully subscribe and I hope you guys will come find me over on social I know I've said it three times but it is going to be one of the most important things you do because we have work to do over there all weekend long let's start the questions Dan would you consider trading away Jaron Jackson and Austin Reeves for Damian Lillard in nine cat Roto  yes I would if it doesn't obliterate your teams build  Bruce Brown has been mildly underwhelming do you think that's because of early season lack of Halliburton getting to the team stuff or is he droppable I'm gonna hang on there I think that he ends up being just barely inside the top 100  and that's worth it for me  if we just look at the numbers and ignore the ethics what do you think Miles Bridges rest of season value is in nine cat is it worth dropping a guy like Austin Reeves  no I would not drop Austin Reeves because I think he's going to be 90 the rest of the way kind of woke up in this last ball game  yes bridges does belong on rosters  I'm not adding him though  I've just sort of put my foot down I said you know what I'm gonna figure out a way to win this season without him but I think you can pretty safely assume he'll be fantasy relevant  I don't know how long it takes him to get there remember he hasn't played in a damn long time but eventually he probably does opinion on a Jalen Johnson for DeAnthony Melton trade I think I'd rather go Jalen Johnson right now  what is the future of herb Jones and Emmanuel quickly in points leaks both just ended up on my League's Waiver Wires I think I'd rather have quickly in a points format because herb he's gonna get a lot of his value from those deals and blocks and I know that they are valued in points but if he's not scoring if he's not assisting if he's not rebounding it's really hard to get enough whereas with quickly he's a little bit the opposite side he's gonna score he's gonna get a few boards he's gonna get a few assists but you know he's gonna Chuck up shots and that creates a safer points League floor  Roto games cap do I brought drop Bruce Brown for trade Jones yes  for our favorite Roto expert all you make me blush would you drop any of the following for Keegan Murray  Anthony Melton shaedon Sharpe Malcolm Brogden Mark Williams John or Cam Johnson ooh that's a tough one I think I might drop De'Anthony Melton for Keegan Murray it would have been Malcolm Brogden except with scoot out now he's got all the room in the world to start to operate if you're thinking later on in a season it's definitely Brogden because his role is going to get smaller every two weeks so looking way down the line probably Brogden if it's got to be right this second it's Morant because he's not playing or Melton who hasn't been good enough yet but probably Brockton if you're taking the Long View  who should I Target in exchange for Ben Simmons to boost my free throws and threes  ah well look Ben Simmons is ranked 93 right now people I think probably believe he's been better than that but he's also gone one for four at the free throw line so that's been Troublesome for him 7 points 10 boards seven assists he's been very dream on greeny to this point and if you're targeting three pointers for him  I would say honestly maxed Spruce probably isn't a bad Target and you could probably get him if you want somebody with a little more name power the who's that guy yeah I would have said Devin vassell but he just got hurt  clay maybe you could get Klay Thompson for him  how'd I do  is mow Vagner gonna go on a top 90 run and as Jonathan Isaac gonna get 20 minutes for Wagner I'm gonna say probably and for Isaac I'm gonna say probably not  should I trade Cade Cunningham for Scotty Barnes his field goal percent and turnovers are killing me to the point that I had to bench him  well here's the thing  Kate is Kate  and he's not gonna average five and a half turnovers a game but he very well might shoot 401% for the season  and this is why I did not draft him anywhere not one place  I thought he would take a step forward from that 90 range  and I still think that that's a distinct possibility because his defensive stats haven't come around yet but right now it does really look like Scotty Barnes is going to be the safer play now Scotty's number 11 that's probably not gonna hold these at two endpoint almost three defensive stats game and 21 points 10 boards two threes and six assists is crazy uh but I have no problem actually with this trade because Cade was not a guy I was targeting in drafts and I do think that the bottom we've seen the bottom fall out now at the same time this is sort of a trademark  sell Low by high scenario so not usually what you want to do when it comes to the stock market but  I think those guys probably end up not all that far from one another so overall I don't really mind that much  damn bird says I'll be the wet blanket on DeAndre Hunter the field goal and steals numbers are definitely coming down yes they are  yes they are but I still think you can stay inside the top 100 just not top 40  razor says people treat you analysts like profits you're just telling us what makes sense based on analytics nothing is certain yeah this is true we're just doing our best  but I did have a rant earlier this week where  I I do believe that and I have to have a little bit of confidence so I hope this doesn't come off like me being a little bit of a dick head but I do think that I am better at this than a lot of people  call it 90% sure there's two percent of people that are better at this than me that probably not as good at Broadcasting um and the reason I think I'm better is because I stare at this crap all day all the time for all like you know  as an analyst for six or seven years and as a player for you know a decade and a half before that so yeah I feel like I'm pretty good but again it is all about interpreting so we try to give percentage chances of things which is sometimes a number we're pulling out of our rectum but  I think there is a reason to hang with analysts on this stuff but everything needs to be taken with a little bit of a grain of salt because we're not going to be right 100% of the time we're going to be alright hopefully more than most people playing fantasy sports but not all the time  thoughts on Deni avdija is he worth an ad in 12 teams well he's got enough to a pretty good start this year he's at number 90 in nine cat  I think the field goal percent might come down a little bit the turnovers are really low for him compared to what we saw late last year  you know what I'm actually okay with it if you want to add him and see what happens go for it  we got a question about the Anthony Melton but I think I talked about him and not enough should I drop nazri for Josh Richardson  they each have about the same probability chance of hitting so I'm gonna say doesn't matter go with whichever players stats you think you'll like more  I have to drop either Isaiah Stewart or herb Jones to make room for a Time Lord who you chucking away Stewart  you know he's 150 and he's playing well right now so  why do you like sucks but not Taylor and Horton Tucker they seem to be very similar one is a better rebounder the other better passer but they're both borderline players in the average categories well thc's turnovers are gonna always be way higher if they're not right now  tht is significantly worse actually in the percentages that's the key here Suggs  we're seeing a nice little step forward and even if you look at when he hadn't taken much of a step forward the nice thing about Jalen Suggs is that no he doesn't really shoot many free throws but  it does seem like there's a chance he took a step forward I think we've seen more than enough out of tht also I think Suggs is a better Defender than Taylor Horton Tucker  and I just think that the  yes if we even if we even if I give you by the way that the average is for the two guys are going to be about the same  Horton Tuckers are gonna hurt you more because he's gonna be doing more of that he's one of those guys where efficiency is actually more important than  having more stuff to Chuck where with Suggs we just want him out on the court rebounding and assisting and stealing and doing that kind of stuff with THC we'd prefer he's just out there getting assistance steals but instead he's out their tanking stuff hopefully that makes some sense  I am running out of vocal strength  if you add Trey young and PG and offered siakam and lamelo do you accept the trade I would prefer  that's a fair trade that's a fair trade  a little bit of a Buy Low on the mellow but also Trey young is you know both of those guys were overdrafted because they get assists Paul George is better than siakam but can't he stay healthy  that's fair that's fair deal Max Drew sir Gordon Hayward I'll go strews on this one because I am worried about miles Bridges cutting into the Hayward stuff even if right this second Hayward is putting up better numbers  should I drop Kobe white for Josh Richardson yes  Mitchell Robinson or onyeka okang points build  I'm okay either way  I think both these guys get up near 70  maybe Mitch Robb then because he's terrible it's scoring  you're not gonna be sad either direction though this there's not a big winner there  who could I trade Kyle kuzma for pickup I honest to goodness I have no idea kuzma again we haven't really seen with the Wizards are he's been shooting the ball really well so far this year he's ranked number four  that number is gonna come down as the field goal and free throw percent dips for Coos  but I think if you could get somebody drafted near 60 that's maybe underperforming a little bit like a Jalen Williams in in Thunder town or just look at your your draft results and try to find somebody drafted near 60 that's not playing as well as we expect and that's kind of the direction I would go there should I drop Kobe white for Cole Anthony yes  I traded Gordon Hayward for Clay Thompson is this a good deal in a points League yeah I'm good with that that's safety  drop buddy hield for Gordon Hayward I'm fine with that  what do you think about Carter Bulls getting 25 to 30 night Jevon Carter I don't care  thoughts on Kessler and Pirtle by low on Kessler a little worried on puddle  he's number one 50  Steals and blocks should improve specifically the steals for turtle but I am a little bit worried because it doesn't seem like his minutes are as guaranteed as we hoped  are you dropping quickly or jaw or Gafford for a Kong that's quickly as the drop  can someone give me the Discord link the one in the description isn't working damn it again  I thought I switched it to the right one  Khan found it  I really thought I switched it um let's make sure that I get the right one in there  I'm going to get the right damn Discord Link in the description  I don't know why that isn't working I switched it yesterday  make sure that saves  I'm going to post it in the chat room right now as well as I'm talking about it and what I'm probably gonna forget to do is post it in the show description over on iTunes and Spotify but I'm very sorry dude I don't know why that keeps happening  there's the Discord link but I'll put it up on the screen for about five seconds here while I'm scrolling back up to the last question I don't know why that  that isn't working right  I'm having a hard time dropping Gary Trent Jr yeah you can give him a little bit longer if you want I just think he's gonna end up a drop  which level of player is good to trade for Jimmy Butler top 70 now you're gonna have to probably do better than that to Pride Jimmy Butler off somebody who took them end of the second early third you're gonna probably want to go for somebody you draft I mean if you have somebody you drafted in the 70s that in the 40s right now that might be a way to do it  I think LeBron is an interesting one he's 38 but everybody's talking about how great he's been because the counting stats have been huge even if the percentage or the turnovers and the free throw percentage of it weighing you down but look if you're not punching free throws or punting turnovers that's a different situation um who else would maybe get it done  I don't think Demar gets it done  I don't think Rudy gobert gets it done maybe you could pair go bear with somebody  McCollum paired up with somebody from like the 70 80 range might get it done  you're gonna have to go higher than that though  Kevon Looney or Mitchell Robinson that's Mitch Robb Wendell Carter Junior Santi aldama  Wendell but probably neither  nine cat punting threes do I trade dejounte Murray for Jimmy Butler yes if you're hunting threes that's a yes  drop Kevon Looney or Walker Kessler for Mitchell Robinson that's a loony drop Kevon Looney  should I trade Maxi and Zack Levine for Anthony Davis or Maxi and Reeves for eight and pool get me Anthony Davis man you get yourself a top three fantasy player that way that's huge  should I trade Jalen Williams for Jimmy Butler yes  tyus Jones are Chris Paul tonight I need field goal percent in threes well I don't know that either of them hits a three and I don't know that either of them is going to help your field goal percent I'll go tyus Jones  give me the Wizards to keep a freaking game close  I just got offered Kyrie for Tyrese Maxey wow  yes take Kyrie  I like I love Tyrese but this is a yeah you got to go get a first rounder  what are your thoughts on Bradley Beal top 60 once he's playing per game  I always  I always have a question about your podcast what's up with what's up with the sexy woman voice at the beginning it's totally not your style oh so you're talking about the recorded one so that is a lady we paid five dollars to on Fiverr back in 2016 and we just left it  if it feels weird for me to be doing the  the voiceover at the beginning of my own podcast but I'll tell you what  put it out there into the universe right now if you guys if anybody listening this show knows somebody famous or has a famous voice I would be more than happy to replace the woman at the front of the recorded pod with that but I don't know what other reason would I have to change it  is Tilman a drop we talked about him earlier scroll all the way back  should I drop Clarkson quickly or Dinwiddie uh probably Clarkson maybe quickly not Dinwiddie  I drafted Jalen Johnson with the last pick but he doesn't fit my team build what do you think are good players to Target in a trade you're not gonna get that much yet people still haven't fully bought in on it you might have been able to get like top 80 after his first big Breakout game but now you're going to need like a month of solid effort and then you might be able to get that top 80  is it bad to have too many players from one team nah it's fine honestly when one guy gets hurt it helps the other guys on your own club I don't really wear that worry that much about it other than if they have a terrible playoff schedule that's the reason you'd get crushed their  someone offered me Marcus Smart for Jalen Duren know keep Duran  should I drop Tillman for Wagner I'm fine with that go get somebody who could go on a heater  Kyle kuzma or Jared Allen Roto give me Jared Allen I think oh nice try buddy I'm not reading that one on air  JJJ and sharp for Halliburton yeah give me Tyrese  I have Giannis  antet team by selling Max you should I'm confused by this question  sorry I don't have any idea I paid 75 dollars for Fab to pick up more Wagner did I overspend yes although if you're fat budget replenishes then you didn't but  I mean when those coming back at some point I wouldn't spend that much on somebody who has like a month long shelf life I'm gonna get to the end of these damn questions people I want to open up a Center Spot by trading cat who should I Target  someone in the top 35  easy peasy  I'm new here that chart in the back looks like it's from years back why do you still have that as a background because I live in a two-bedroom apartment in West Los Angeles where my children share a room about 15 feet that way that used to be my office and so this is my bedroom  this is a board this is a poster board that I've jammed into the bed frame that blocks you guys from seeing the crap on the other side of it at some point I'm gonna learn how to do a green screen behind me because I just got a computer that can handle it but right now I think the board is hilarious so I leave it up I also have a bag of everybody else's sticker so like I could just start slapping other names on it but that feels like ruining something real someone drops Zach Collins how much Fab should I spend not out of a hundred  call it  23  do Tillman and Lively belonging starting lineups today I'm not  what would we have to give up to get Victor wembanyama right now  some of your internal organs  in a deeply who do I try and Target four cut with Kyle Anderson nothing right now he's off to a slow start this is not the time to move  do we start moving in Roto and his next game or should we check his minutes before we decide I only have 10 starting spots so I really want top 100 value  I'm probably gonna start him  but I have no problem if you want to hang on Halliburton for Donovan Mitchell I prefer Tyrese  thoughts on monk Dylan the villain who Bray and Bogdan rest of season while I talked about monk I talked about Brooks and I talked about Aubrey at the beginning of the show so scroll on back to that Bogdan bogdanovich I'm not interested in should I drop Kevon Looney or Jalen Suggs for Mo Wagner I think you could probably drop Looney he's just like he's the same guy forever and ever and ever  he's number 71 right now because Draymond wasn't around we know he's gonna eventually fall back into that like 120 to 140 stream for rebounds range  at the end of it all  quickly ended up on my waivers should I grab for somebody like false or Tillman points League I think you could grab them for Tillman  cam Johnson just got dropped how much hundred dollar Fab should I spend to pick him up 31  you got to go 30 or higher he's gonna be so good when he plays  14 team or scoot Henderson is on the wire should I take him with my second waiver position now only if you're willing to wait until January to get useful Fanny production because it's gonna be a long learning curve here  punting field goal and turn over who should I Target by selling Maxi oh okay now I get it  you need rebounds and assists  I can't give you an exact player  but I can tell you that Tyrese Maxey is being valued right now  not as a first round right I know he's in the first round over his first four games he's probably being valued as a top 25 play meaning that you could probably Target a field goal guy a rebounds assist guy in the  high 20s early 30s and you'd probably get them  I don't know who those guys are  there aren't that many that I would want rest of season I don't think you can get demonic sabonis he probably got drafted too high for you to get him you're probably not you probably don't want Kawaii you may have to just choose whether you want rebounds or assists and then look for somebody who's kind of ranked between 25 and 45 that you think stays there or you could look at somebody who is in like the 50s and expect them to come up a little bit like a Jimmy Butler and  he's Austin Reeves a Buy Low yeah I mean if you think so because I thought he had a pretty damn good ball game last time  but if you think he still alive I would do it  would you give up a late first or early second for Victor women not yet know  shall we worried with the false injury seems like a week-long recovery I'm not gonna worry yet not until somebody gives me a reason to do you discuss points League content not specifically when I get to guys that are terrible in percentages or 1% and turnovers I try to throw in the little note that okay maybe points League this could be more interesting like we talked about Taylor Horton Tucker earlier in the show but we're not gonna have like a show dedicated to a points League because I think you all need to move over to categories but I am going to give you tidbits as we go because the vast majority of players out there play nine cat 12 team head head  Kobe white is about to play a back-to-back I'd hold at least until after that sure that's fine if you want to stream that's fine  but I'm much more interested in what guys are gonna do for me the rest of the year and so that's the direction I'm going to go with them  and 82 minutes into this show I am officially
