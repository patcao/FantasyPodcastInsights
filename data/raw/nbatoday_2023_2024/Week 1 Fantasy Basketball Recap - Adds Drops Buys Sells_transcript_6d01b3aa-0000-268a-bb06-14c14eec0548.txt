b r i s at Dan best Bruce over on social media we've got all sorts of stuff flying around on Twitter these days news breaks and threads and end of night Recaps and look ahead and Bi-Lo targets  I hope that you guys will find me over there anybody that is in the chat room on YouTube feel free to throw some questions in there and if anybody's like is Dan really worth checking out on social media I hope that you guys will then also pop in and say yeah he's extremely active probably to a disgusting level and unhealthy one perhaps  and that's why you guys need to find me over there  I'm also gonna throw the Discord link into the live chat I did I did officially get it into the description of the show so you guys can find it there as well if you guys want to pop on over into the free side of the Discord if you have any of our premium stuff let a mod know in Discord and they'll open up different rooms for you to check that out  today show we're going to be it's the first Friday show of the year which is cool though those that have been watching or listening to Fantasy NBA today for the last couple of Seasons know that we have a way that we do our Friday shows we have the ads we have the drops we have the holds we have the watch list guys we have some injury replacement level players we have some buy lows we have some sell highs we go through basically every big storyline of the week and I put all of this out on Twitter but I do think it's important for you guys to come hang out with us on the show because we can provide a little bit of color commentary to why certain names are where they are the lists are very incomplete in that like you can put on someone in an ads list but that doesn't tell the whole story why are they there what formats do they make sense for all that kind of stuff that's what we'll get into here on today's show so let's throw this thing up on the board those that are listening well I don't worry I'm gonna read every name on it those that are watching with us this is  I couldn't fit all of the names in each section on each page that you guys are gonna see so just remember that we're kind of will go through it piece by piece here I want Microsoft Word with the presentation today just because it would just gonna save me about 20 minutes of throwing stuff into a sheet but it gets the job done  okay okay I think I can make my face a little bit bigger and you guys can still see the words if anybody in the chat room says know the words are too small now let me know and I'll try to move the faces and places around and and then you'll be able to see a little bit better  let's start with the ads and we'll just go through this is in no particular order I was just looking at the recent game played for every single team it's almost like reverse chronological the way I was going backwards through games that happened more recently you know all the way back Wednesday Tuesday whatever the first name is Kelly oubre Jr who's on the ads board but again this is why the show provides a certain measure of context that the Twitter feed does not Kelly who Bray Junior had a really big ball game yesterday 27 points for rebounds of Steel and 5 3-pointers but he did it on a ridiculous nine out of 11 shooting from the field and four for four at the free-throw line those numbers are not sustainable numbers for ubereat who is a low to mid 40s guy from the field and actually not a very good foul shooter in general or at least not a positive impact one  so you could make two arguments about Kelly the first one the negative one is he's not gonna get 32 and a half minutes a game every day because they games where he's not this hot D Anthony Melton is going to take those minutes PJ Tucker's gonna take some of those minutes you might even see the team go bigger or smaller more Patrick Beverley more Paul Reed don't worry we'll get to him in a minute  the guys that are locked in on this team are embed Tyrese Maxey and Tobias Harris so the ones you don't really have to worry about melting is like a partial lock in shot just wasn't really falling for him yesterday and he was having a little bit of trouble with Dame so Philly went to the hot hand  and then you could also argue that Uber is not going to hit that volume or that percentage of shots and and both of these I think are accurate assessments but the thing is right now with no James Harden they need some more scoring and that bench punch that Kelly provided yesterday was critical  so I'm not all that surprised that he came in and got double-digit shots I think that's actually something that you might see from him as long as no trade happens because once something happens with hard and whether he plays for them at half speed or gets traded for someone else who will play at full speed Uber I won't likely be on this list anymore and so you could kind of call them a James Harden fill into some degree but this level of minutes and the opportunity that he's been provided makes him a semi add he's not my most exciting one on this list but he does I think believe belong there at least for now  named number two is Jalen Johnson who just had himself a wonderful game on Wednesday played 209 and a half minutes off the bench 21 points 7 boards two assists two steals a block at 3:30 missed his free throws or it would have been one of the best lines of the damn night made his shots 69% in that ball game again it's not going to be this good every time  you had a lackluster performance from Deonte Murray DeAndre Hunter fouled out in his 31 minutes bogged on bug Donovan I don't think that he's a real threat but saddiq Bey played 29 minutes that's the number that could inch up a little bit  I think as we go into the next ball game for Johnson which I believe is coming up later on tonight  I would expect more like 24 minutes for him as a 29 or 30  but we got a glimpse of The Upside here if  a guy like Hunter fouls out if maybe dejounte Murray is having a terrible ball game if saddiq Bey has a terrible ball game which by the way didn't happen if he's awful you'll see more Jalen Johnson so there these ways that he can sort of squeeze out an extra three four minutes  over the likely I believe 232425 is probably the target they have for him  but you gotta like to steals you got to like the blocks you got to like the rebounds you gotta like to feel goal percent a lot of that stuff is repeatable for Johnson so when he does come out and possibly even as early as tonight have a stinker don't abandon ship that fast because we've now seen the upside and it's good so he's an ad  Delon Wright is my next add one of my favorite ads frankly I know that he only had 25 26 minutes but I don't care because that's more than enough for him he was top 70 last year in 24 and a half minutes 25 or 26 is frankly just freaking gravy he's on a bad team that doesn't play any defense he's gonna be out there hustling for steals Distributing because he has all these guys on his club that want to shoot kuzma wants to shoot Jordan Poole wants to shoot Corey kispert Off the Bench wants to shoot he's got all these guys I want to check get shots up Daniel Daniel Gallinari  and he's a guy that can just go get him the ball  very good rebounding point guard as well no he's not gonna score very much I don't care about that the reason we like the lawn is because he is Hyper Elite and steals he's very good rebounding point guard pretty good at assists and he doesn't need a ton of minutes to get there so even if the minutes fluctuate between 20 and 29  that's fine  there's already a question in the chat room about my thoughts on Kelly oubre I just said my thoughts on Kelly oubre  I need you guys be paying close attention to he's probably a James Harden replacement  and when Harden gets traded I'll say it again what hard gets traded he's probably a drop  and there's no and I also said that in the next ball game when he shoots three for 12 it's going to be harder on you but they need his punch right now and so that's why I think he belongs on rosters in the short term I know so complicated about that Emmanuel quickly next one on the ads board who's another guy that could fall off he played 28 minutes was extremely efficient made seven out of 11 shots in their season opener for 24 points 6 boards for assists of Steel and 5 3 pointers  I just believe that he's better than a lot of the guys on the Nicks and I do despite the fact that he didn't get his contract extended I think he's one of those situations where the cream is gonna rise to the top because in my eyes he's gonna provide better things for the Knicks than Donte divincenzo or Quentin Grimes so I know they like but I think Quickly's better if he was taller I would say he gets in there over RJ Barrett but he's not his Barrett's a bigger dude and they need more size but I think you can expect quickly to get between 25 and 29 minutes per game based on what we saw in game one he's gonna be out there and he's going to be gunning and facilitating with a lot of that second unit stuff and so I think he belongs on rosters  don't worry there are Nick's that are on the other side of this equation that will get into in a minute Isaiah Stewart is the next name on the board he had a really nice first ball game for Detroit with 14 points 14 boards two three-pointers in a couple of assists generally he's not a big defensive stats guy but 35 minutes he'll get a steel or a block most of the time  in 35 minutes I should say but more than anything I thought the 35 minutes was the really good piece of news in this game the team was just better when he was out there as a big dude who now has learned how to space the floor kind of happened mid to late last season  so he can play alongside Jalen Duren as the non floor spacing defensive minded big  and if Stuart can provide a little bit of offense that's what keeps him on the floor over someone like Marvin Bagley who can't really defend is probably a little bit better on offense  and there will be days where Stuart gets more like 28 minutes of bagley's playing really well he might get 2021 something like that but what I saw how did I say a steward in game one was in my mind enough to get him onto rosters just to kind of see how this thing shakes out  by the way I didn't put acronyms in anywhere on any of these lists because I think he's drafted and he's just sit in there and I don't think anybody's gonna punt after one ball game so that's why I skipped over certain guys and if that's your thing like if you're going to be hey Dan why didn't you talk about this guy I can't talk about the whole goddamn B8 today so just hang with me here Max Strauss is the next name on the ads board and I know for YouTubers he's the last name on this page but fear not there are actually more names out there and I know what you're all gonna say and you're right about all of them is he gonna average 27 points of course not is he gonna average 12 rebounds and 7 3 pointers of course not could he get you a steal every ball game yeah  well they get your block probably not  but is he gonna play 30 minutes plus sure as heck looks like it  and this is always been the thing Max Drew's was a guy I don't know if you guys remember this but a couple years ago he was a guy that I think I'm trying to remember what I believe it was the the cheap free agents board that Aaron bruske put together not a fantasy list Brew does this in the offseason every year where he puts together the the cash value rankings for NBA teams looking at free agents and Spruce was a guy that Bruce was maybe it wasn't this list maybe it was just like the the Deep sleepers this is a guy that was like keep an eye on basically forever because his Fantasy game is better than people realize and now we're getting a chance to see it I picked him up every single place I could because knowing full well that this is one of the best games he'll have all year I don't care about that because the Cavs want to have a little bit more offense this season they won games last year largely with defense Jared Allen's not in there right now but I'm not worried about that because that mostly helped is to cook Coral in their game on Wednesdays I think is basically just gonna be there he's the starting small forward on this team probably all season long  yes Jared Allen squeezes the minutes for everybody because Evan Mobley got his minutes at Center and more of his will come at power forward so that pushes a Coro down and whatever he gets would be split between power forward and small forward and Charis Levert if you was getting small forward minutes some of those might have to push down toward shooting guard and there's this trickle down effect so yeah that's why I don't think Max druce is gonna play 39 damn minutes of ball game but 30 plus does feel like the target for him and the fact that he was comfortable just jacking away  great  I think he could be like a poor man's Klay Thompson  better rebounder frankly than clay  so I see absolutely no reason why he shouldn't be a universally rostered after seeing the way Cavs want to use him and just accept that they're going to be days where he's cold his minutes are probably lower on those days but overall he's probably gonna be their starter full-time and you want starters who can nail threes at a good clip like that  cam Thomas is the next name on the ads board and he like Kelly oubre comes with sort of the disclaimer of dude played 25 minutes took 21 shots at a usage rate of 45 and an unsustainably high everything in game one  cam Thomas is going to be your ultimate boom or bust play basically as long as you've got him on your roster  I didn't pick him up anywhere because that's too freaking nerve wracking for me I can't handle the Boomer bust guys if you can have at it  because he's going to be hot for two or three games in a row he's going to score 90 points over those two or three games and then he's gonna go a week where he scores seven points has like a -45 Point differential and doesn't see the court in two out of the three of them  be ready for that because it will happen  Camp Thomas is a guy who gets playing time when he's hot  a little bit like the Kelly oubre thing although I think Uber is probably a little more safe  then cam Thomas  but be aware that's what you're getting into and I even put the words buyer beware on the screen for those that are watching with us right now herb Jones is the next name on the ads board he's more of a specialist he had a better game in the first one played 38 minutes to lead the Pelicans in that category 13 points is probably  safe Target for him maybe even a little bit on the high side eight rebounds is way more than he's going to get most nights three assists is probably more than he's gonna get most nights two defensive stats you're probably looking for about two and a half of those and a three-pointer or two and if you get that you're probably getting what you were looking for with him and if you don't need that stuff then you can move on but I think a lot of teams probably do Xavier Tillman is on the ads board yes I know he was someone that should have been added as soon as folks heard that Steven Adams was down because Tillman was a top 100 play when Adams was hurt late last year and the Grizzlies opened up in a perfect scenario for Tillman because they had Jonas Fallon junos and Zion Williamson is the front Court in game one they have Nicole yokich as the front Court in game two so they really have no choice but to play a whole bunch of Tillman against gigantic dudes that no one else on the team can handle with Steven Adams down  and Santi aldama still down not that he could handle those big dudes either but it's Stillman or bust for the Grizzlies right now so just get on board  Derek Lively the second is also on the ads board no I don't think he's gonna be able to keep up to Pace he kept up in game one he shots 7 of 8 from the field 16 points 10 rebounds of Steel in a block you only missed one of his three free throws  but you have to like basically starters minutes I think he started the second half and not the first if memory serves on that Wednesday game 16 points is way more than he's going to have most ball games 10 rebounds is  I would guess more than he has but if you can get like 10 points 8 boards a steal in a block at him that gets him around that top 100 range and for a guy that you're probably picking up off the wire with upside beyond that if they start to trust him day in and day out without many minute fluctuations then that becomes a pretty damn good reason to take a shot on it folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown well in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the

y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  and the final dude on the ads board is Kentavious called while Pope he was drafted in a lot of spots but we'll call him an ad because there were leaks where he wasn't and this is a little bit of a gray area between our ads table and our holds table on today's show some of the holds are guys that may be should have been added again you know we're doing this for 12 team intermediate leagues if you're in an expert League the holds guys are almost definitely on your team if you're in an expert leak some of these ads were probably on teams coming out of the draft if you're in more of a novice League the holds guys probably are on the waiver wire  make the adjustment to your league I'm doing the best I can is what I'm saying here but Casey p is the last add threes Steals and probably a safer floor than last year because there's no herb Jones in Denver right now  the thing about kcp I want you guys to all so remember that we talked about at Great length last season was that he's actually better when Jamal Murray and Nicole yokich are both healthy because he gets open off of their action  when he guys went down for Denver it actually made Casey's numbers go down to because he just wasn't as open anymore he was less likely to take shots because he doesn't shoot unless he's wide open and if he's not wide open that means he's not gonna shoot oh let's get to the holds board next and we'll try to keep the pace up here I think the ads are the most important so we did spend a little more time on those guys saddiq Bey I put in the holds board I don't know he could have been an ad either way he had a really good first game I don't even know why he's on this list because he played pretty well and I mean put him in the ads if he's in a league where he's a free agent for you on Echo Congo had a bad first ball game and I'm inclined to remind everybody that oh Kang Woo is a 100 to 125 range guy when Capella's healthy that's the way it was last year he played about 20 minutes a game when capella was healthy last year that's basically what he got in Atlanta season opener  had some foul issues so it may be he's playing better you see that push up towards 22 or 23 but the big stuff for okongo didn't happen until capella started missing ballgames and that even last year didn't happen until a few weeks into the season after the wear and tear started to kick in so hang with it if you're in a league where he gets dropped because someone's like just do it's only playing at night or not have minutes  scoop them up because you know good stuff is around the corner Daniel Gafford also a hold Wizards got blown out or he would have probably seen a little bit more playing time I expect him to be between 25 and 29 minutes a game maybe you get into the 30s on really good nights I actually thought Gafford looked pretty damn spry at the beginning of Washington's game but also like the other guys in the club are not gonna be looking to involve him regularly so just kind of know what you're getting into there but he'll be much better than he was in game one  I put buddy hield in the holds Department he was a guy I did not draft anywhere knowing he was coming off the bench and knowing he in the Pacers could not come to an extension on a contract and so he's technically on the trade block and that was just too much  unknown for me on heel to draft him thinking well like do they care enough to play this guy  hey love okay numbers I think he'll be top 100 top 90 ish while he's coming off the bench it's not going to be the top 50 60 range stuff you got as a starter last year but he is definitely a whole so stick with it there Mitchell Robinson is a whole  Tom Thibodeau just like what I say a hard time was doing in game one most days I think you'll see more Mitch Robb than heart but this is something to keep an eye on and you'll notice later in the show we'll talk about heart and shine as a watch list guy slow-mo Kyle Anderson is the next name on the holds board I don't know that he needed to be put on here because he played 30 minutes off the bench  30 minutes is more than enough he was also a plus 15 for the Timberwolves in a game they lost by three  you need a reason to keep playing him that's the reason why slo-mo is not going to score a bunch but he got nine boards five assists in a steel and that's the stuff you're looking for with him and he did it so don't panic on slo-mo he did exactly what we were looking for hang on tight  for more holds Mike Conley I put on the holds board I got again I don't know that he needed to be there because he played 31 minutes as a starting point guard his team could not throw a stone in the damn ocean if they could he probably would have had five six seven assists and of three that's gonna be his role is to get the ball to a guy who's going to shoot it and hopefully it goes in but Anthony Edwards didn't make anything and Cat didn't make anything in their season opener in Toronto and I can basically bet everything I own that a day where aunt and Cat shoot the ball well it's gonna be a day where Conley as six plus assists  duh  Ben Simmons is a whole I know he didn't play that many minutes in their first ball game at 23 I think that's slowly ramps up as he gets his sea legs Underneath Him Four Points 10 boards nine assists in a block though I don't think anybody's dropping him after a pretty good first ball game so stick with it there  Kobe white is a hold for me although I will admit I don't fully trust his numbers in nine cat because he's never been a steals or blocks guy and he's been a poor field goal percent guy so can he do enough in scoring assists and free throw percent positives to make up for the negatives I think the jury is out on that after game one but I do think that it's worth giving a little bit more time  and you're Wiggins is a whole  no one's dropping Andrew Wiggins because they probably drafted in the 90s I didn't draft him I've talked to the you guys about this before I don't like drafting wings that stinky free throw shooting it hurts the categories that I'm typically trying to attack so I have him nowhere but if I'm going to put myself in your shoes if you have Andrew Wiggins you hang on because you know he's he's got top 60 upside which I don't think he gets to this year but he's typically a top 90 top 100 floor guy and so he'll be much better in game two or if he's not game three and so on and so forth let's get into the category I've described as I'm scared or nervous here or droppable players and I the reason I titled it this way as I once again remind everybody to please take a second to click the like button subscribe whether it's YouTube odd side whatever it is that you can do maybe you could drop a five-star review that'd be super swell and also find me on Twitter at Danbury  at Dan best briefs I need to see you all over there it's very important so I can communicate things to you throughout the day but the reason I called this category I'm scared or nervous here or drops is that I didn't want people to see this list and think Dan's telling me to drop all these guys immediately because I'm not  I'm not  because each one of these names has sort of a different scenario at play and your team is going to play a role in whether these guys need to be dropped or not so let's start going through them and I'll give a little bit more contacts first name on the list is Paul Reed who played exclusively back up Center minutes behind Joel embiid yesterday and that meant only 11 and a half minutes which as good as his fantasy stat set is 11 and a half minutes ain't gonna be enough if you need that roster spot  you can drop him  if you're in a roto League where the roster slots are not as critical and let's say you were able to drop other guys to pick up some of our ads that we talked about earlier on this show like a Jalen Johnson or Elon writer Max druce or whatever  then give him another game or two because it's not gonna kill you in that format but if holding on to Paul Reed is going to cost you a win and ahead to head week then I get it  same story for Christian Wood who actually looked much better in game two for the Lakers and got 20 plus minutes which unfortunately isn't really going to be enough for him we've seen it over the years he needs basically starters minutes to get inside the top 100 because of free throw issues more than anything else  and I just don't think he's gonna get there with the Lakers they have too many options too much mix and match you can do on that team with guys like Jarred Vanderbilt when he gets back really hot tomorrow if you want more scoring Anthony Davis at the five is generally the best thing for them it's nice to have the link of Christian Wood and the ability to place the floor but he does have his issues you know sliding to guard smaller players so that's when you'd see Anthony Davis back in there so I just think that match ups are going to be so critical with the Christian Wood stuff and because of that you can't get cute and try to guess which day is going to be a good one and head-to-head side it's probably not going to be good enough every day for you to just compile stats and the Roto side if you're not guessing what's the point  probably can move on  Obi toppin played 19 minutes in a blowout win I'd like to see what he does in game two  I don't want to drop him yet  but if it looks the same in the second ball game  I might  Josh Hart I'd like to try to give him a whole week  that would be my inclination here because the next loved what he brought late last season but 22 23 minutes ain't enough  he's a  he's born  to call him that but I say that of course lovingly for the Danvers old man squad it's all quite boring Josh Hart is a boring because he doesn't score that much but he rebounds like a maniac like an MF or he can pass he'll knock down some threes he gets steals does it on okay percentages like all that stuff is the stuff that my teams tend to Target but guys like that need to be on the court it's not a quick rack-up fantasy stat set kind of guy he doesn't get three steals in 15 minutes he needs to be out there for 30 to get his one and change Steeles and he's be out there for 30 minutes to get his six plus rebounds from a guard spot all that stuff requires playing time which for Josh Hart wasn't there in game one but I want to watch game two and game three see if that shifts in any meaningful way or if it really is just gonna be a share Fest between heart and Quentin Grimes and Donte divincenzo and sometimes manual quickly and all these guys now that the Knicks got a little bit deeper  Gary Trent I was not super high on this year you know the fact that the Raptors don't seem all that interested in bringing him back like they haven't done anything contractually we saw last year once pledged Trent's job got squeezed Turtle still there Danish Schroeder is the starter they've run more precious to chewa stuff  but at the same time Trent is a shooter  shooter who's gonna shoot so if he's out there for 25 26 minutes which is basically what we saw in game one he's not dead in the water  so he's another guy like Josh Hart I'd like to try to give a week too  I put Kyle Lowry on this list because I think it's absolutely hilarious I had to talk about Kyle Lowry he played what did he say 32 minutes and he did nothing he got himself a Tony Snell award yes you can obviously drop Kyle Lowry he is aged and the heat need a point guard so badly if they want to compete this year Taylor Norton Tucker is the next name on this board on the I'm scared Liz he's actually the last name on the I'm scared list then we'll move on to the next category  you can give one more you made it all the way to today and Utah plays today so let's just see how it goes he was very much a last round flash kind of draft pick  could he carry over the preseason stuff I didn't think so but I took him in a couple spots  I still don't think so and if he continues to don't think so for another day or two then I think we can punt at that point  here's the watch list these are guys that I think you can probably get away with  staring at a little bit longer with one very obvious exception that I'm sure I'm gonna get yelled at in the YouTube chat room about and we'll get there in a minute the watch list is Joshua kogi who it does feel like his doing more because the suns are missing a bunch of guys Gordon Hayward could get himself onto the ads board if he looks good the next game  you know he was okay in game one but I don't think he was an immediate add Andrew nembhard is on my watch list I don't think he's gonna have enough to do when the game is not a blowout Al Horford because how could I not have him on my watch list and 26 minutes is not that far off from where he could get to to have fantasy value so don't write them off completely Isaiah hardenstein played more minutes in Mitchell Robinson in game one if that somehow continues  he somehow healthy now and like legitimately healthy he could end up taking over a little bit  Cole Anthony is on my watch list I think that's one of the ones you guys are going to yell at me about but like we've seen this thing a lot with coal where he alternates good and bad ball games with Jalen Suggs  his good game's are fantasy decent but he doesn't do much in the threes steals or blocks department is usually kind of hurt you and feel goal  just I can't get over the hump with him in nine cat points League should be rostered that's a sort of a different discussion Kevin Love is on my watch list I did not see him playing high 20s and minutes in game one I will be floored if he does it again but we can't just write him off so that's why he's on the watch board Grant Williams 35 minutes if that's a thing that sticks you kind of have to do something with it because he is also a boring  he is one boring  but if he plays giant minutes on a team with Luca and Kyrie he's gonna have four to five wide open looks from the corner every ball game and historically he's gonna make close to 50% of those damn shots  so two plus threes a game  10 plus scoring four to six rebounds a night he usually gets us deal or a block on good percentages and that's the key there the good percentages and he's inside the top 100  I don't know what to tell you guys I know it's not exciting but he's on the watch list in case he does it again Malcolm Brogden also on the watch list he had a really good first ball game for Portland and frankly if he actually gets a consistent 24 plus minutes then he probably belongs on rosters  and finally one that I'm fully aware I struggle with more than most is Russell Westbrook I even had someone in the comments on yesterday's show say Daniel Lakers bias is keeping you from getting more viewers and how you talk about Russell Westbrook I highly doubt that's the reason that people are tuning out my show is that I come on air and I say I just can't do it I was quite clear on yesterday's podcast that Russ might be better than I think he is I said basically those words yesterday so no one can accuse me of like not being forthright but I watched him for the last couple of years and anytime he's asked to do more than the bare minimum he turns into a fantasy disaster  turnovers free throw field goal  can any of those things be held in check if they can he belongs on rosters if they can't he doesn't he's widely rostered so  watch list is probably not the right bucket for him but mean we're all going to find out soon I'm just not willing to take that shot  I'm not willing to be the one to take the shot because if it doesn't work he could absolutely obliterate your fantasy team let's go to the last page of this discussion it's got an injury replacement that's Deron sharp because Nick Claxton was spotted in a walking boot this morning so he's probably out for a couple of ball games and maybe you can get something out of sharp in Brooklyn by Lowe's DeAndre ayton who was in awful foul trouble and still managed to salvage a double-digit rebound for defensive stat game I don't know where the hell that came from  Deontay Murray is a Buy Low if people are freaking out about game one he's a top 40 per game fantasy guy who's been generally healthy so he'll be much better than he was Walker Kessler is a Bi-Lo his minutes were low in the first ball game that won't be the case every single night Utah doesn't have that many choices at Center unless they want one real small but there I think ultimately gonna want a little bit of Rim protection and Tesla's the guy that can bring that so if you can acquire these guys for someone drafted say two rounds later because you want to try to make incremental gains in the trades you make don't throw out like Jalen Johnson for DeAndre Aiden because you're gonna get laughed at and then No One's Gonna read your trade offers again look at someone  so like let's assume DeAndre Aiden was drafted in your 50 45 50 this year same story for Walker Kessler actually does jaunty Murray about a round earlier than that look at someone drafted like around 70 that had a really really good first game but you don't quite feel like that's something that's gonna stick  that's the type of move you should be looking at where you won't get laughed out of the room someone might legitimately say you know what I actually feel like I got these players backwards and if you don't that's how you can squeeze out around or to a value in a trade and you just do that constantly throughout the year and you can turn seventh eighth rounders over performing into third rounders over time that's that's a pretty big deal  myself hi oh you know what there were two of these I think maybe there was one more page myself highs were Harrison Barnes and he eats a zubats YouTubers can see my mouse clicking through these windows I didn't realize that Harrison Barnes like we know he's not gonna average 33 points a game and you're probably not gonna be able to get much for him but if you can get somebody that you believe is going to rely be inside the top 100 that's your target same story for Evita he started last year blocking four shots a game for a week and then over time it came down and down and down and down and down because he is who he is and people don't just magically change their fantasy stats that when they've been in the league for all ready half a decade zubats is a double-double guy with one and a little bit of change in blocks but not what you saw in game one  Russell Westbrook probably does make him a little bit better though having a point guard that can get it to a big man so maybe there's a little bit of upside there but certainly after game one if you can throw zubats out there for somebody who's like a 75 range dude  drafted near 75 I should say not someone who's at 75 after three days of basketball I think that's probably the movie make and that is our week in review portion of the proceedings but friends we are far from done  for it is now time  to talk about  The Weeknd upcoming  those of you that had been with us for a long time  and I'll remind you everybody once again to please like rate subscribe and find me on Twitter at Dan best price those of you that have been with us for a long time know that this is one you can throw a question in the chat room and this is when we look at every buddy playing their next game over the weekend  and what we're looking for in those ball games  so this is the how do we stay a quarter step ahead of everybody else in the fantasy space  does that make any sense I'll try to I'll try to  make a I'll try to make that a little bit more clear  right now in particular more so than even later in the year and I'll throw the I'll throw the board up on the screen of the upcoming games tonight the game's plan on Friday night that's where we'll start  over the course of the year if you're in a first come first serve Fantasy League  you want to be the team  that's getting news faster than everybody else  what I mean by that is  if you go into a game with a plan in mind  and that thing that you're looking for happens partway through the game  you can make your move you don't have to wait till the whole ball game is done even to make your move  so this keeps you 340 minutes ahead of other teams in your fantasy league  and this is how we're going to really make an impact so let's look at every team and their next game played and these are the things we're going to be looking for in those ball games we'll start at the top and I did do sort of a truncated version of this over on social media as well let's go through a piece by piece we'll start with the Denver Nuggets kcp is kind of the one thing I'm looking for on that team right now you had a really good first ball game but what's the midpoint for him where the average is settle  Xavier Tillman on the grizzly side is probably the only thing I'm really staring down it would have been Luke Kennard but he took a shot to the head and he's out with in concussion protocol right now so just Tillman for today for the Pistons I'd like to see if I say Isaiah Stewart can repeat it because I just told everybody to pick him up and feel boy wouldn't I be red in the face if it turned out that he couldn't do it consistently  the Hornets that's the next one on the board there sorry guys I did pivot around Gordon Hayward watch list so let's see what he does in game 2 also kind of keeping an eye out for anything related to Myles Bridges I know he's he's still serving some time off but he had all that extra stuff break right before the season started I haven't heard anything about that impacting his season start date but well let's let's just keep that in the back of our minds because anything we do with the Hornets right now has to be with the knowledge or with the Assumption at least for the moment that bridge is going to be back here in the not too distant future and so someone like a Gordon Hayward or a Brandon Miller or even a PJ Washington these guys are all gonna get pushed a little bit  for the next we talked about Josh Hart being someone that I'm a little worried about being a drop Quentin Grimes and Dante even genzo being kind of the The Fallout of that situation Mitchell Robinson and Isaiah hardenstein minutes split is the other one but we did just talk about that as well  Jalen Johnson on the Hawks can he I don't expect him to put up a line like he did in the last ball game but anything would be super swell so that we can kind of really lock in what we already know to be true which is that he has terrific upside I kind of want to know a little bit more about what's the Deep Bay is going to be this year because he's not gonna be a five steals a ball game the Assumption was that he was going to knock down a bunch of Threes And that actually wasn't a giant part of his season opener so is he a guy who's gonna get 30 minutes is it going to be 27 28 how many shots should we be looking for out of bay these are things that we can pull into our data Bank after two three four games going into the season and then we can keep an eye on the Clinton capella on yeco kongu splits but I don't think that anything is really going to change their so do we have to for the heat Kevin Love we already talked about that Celtics nothing I don't have a single question about the Boston Celtics how about them apples  do you  I don't Thunder um  I would love to see a big chat homegrown game I know he he's settling in as this game by game Evolution thing for him  not much else with OKC calves were all watching Max Drew's follow-up I want to throw Charis Levert probably should have been on the watch list on our board earlier in this show he finished last year pretty strong so  is this something that we can expect to continue because he really settled into a more comfortable role as the year went on  nine cats always going to be an issue for Levert but is he going to have that big job Off the Bench I think the Cavs gonna play a little faster this year get more shots up after being at more of a Slowdown team last season  for the Rockets pretty much everything because we got no information from get they got their butts waxed in game one that's interesting a butt waxing I didn't think the show is going to turn that direction today so just watch all the stuff with the Rockets you know what is Freddie Van Vliet look like in that offense what is Dillon Brooks look like in that offense Jabari Smith Jr Jalen green alpern Shane goon any of the young guys coming off the bench what is this team going to be really and today we should get a better idea because they're playing the Spurs if that's a blowout loss then the Rockets really have some trouble  Spurs  can anybody on this damn team not be a percentage is killer it's my thought like Sohan percentages killer kelvin's been one of those  if Trey Jones get 30 minutes I'd be a lot more confident in his stuff and I know everybody's just watching women and I don't blame you that should be fun one of these games he's gonna just go nuts and against the Rockets might be the right time do it because I'll bring exactly known for his defense  for the Raptors is Dennis Schroder just a superstar now I cannot believe that to be true he is not a three-point shooter but he had four of them in the first game we know he's not a big steals Guy so I wouldn't expect that to be a thing that pops up but like is he really gonna be trying to score 20 points a ball game  if so I dramatically undervalued Dennis Schroder but I do think he comes back to Earth but I have to admit that first ball game has given me a little bit of pause and then Gary Trent Jr who we just talked about a minute ago I put input shooter on in my list in that first one I probably should have put him on at least the watch list  maybe a speculative add list  I don't know sorry Dennis I should have put you on something  the Bulls apparently at a player's only meeting after their season opening blowout loss at the hands of the Thunder that's not a good sign but let's see if it changes anything and then Kobe white is the other player who we just talked about as watchlist guy there  the Brooklyn Nets know Nick klaxon we just talked about day around sharp as a possible injury replacement Ben Simmons game two to his minutes slowly creep up cam Johnson is on a minute's cap so let's see what his minutes look like here in this one also apparently dealing with a calf contusion I think I just read  cam Johnson could actually potentially be a Buy Low of people are not aware of the minutes restriction Derek Lively on the maps you're watching Grant Williams we just talked about both of those two guys in the first segment of today's show so I don't think we need to go over them again Clippers Russell Westbrook efficiency stuff is kind of the only well you could put Rob Covington in there because he did start their first ball game that was  something not I wouldn't call it intriguing but it wasn't it wasn't not intriguing who  Utah any shift from game one  because game one you saw Larry marketing and do okay so John Collins with a pretty good ball game and  I mean it's hard to argue that anybody else was all that great for Utah on Wednesday  who am I missing because tht wasn't very good I know they got blown out so that didn't help clerks and I guess was okay but as efficiency was better than usual  and I'll call Walker Kessler sorry forgot about Walker Kessler I got this guy's don't worry  trying to do a lot of things on today's show at some point I'm gonna miss a name  the magic and nothing Beyond just like the Cole Anthony Jalen Suggs stuff Blazers DeAndre bounce back Malcolm Brogden is probably the guy you're really watching close to see if he can sort of jump inside the cut line for the Warrior's know Draymond still I think they're open having backed by their next ball game which I believe is Sun day and then we'll get a better idea of what Chris Paul's role is going to be when draymond's around that's the thing that I am very interested in Andrew Wiggins we already talked about  and then the king's pretty much nothing you know I know Harrison Barnes at a big game and Keegan Murray likely to take some kind of step forward this year but you know beyond that there really isn't a whole lot that that I think we need to parse for Sacramento  let's now let's see here can we move along to Saturday's board and see if there's any teams that we didn't quite cover yet let's see the Nicks we've talked about the Pelicans a herb Jones is sort of a watch guy I think again more of a steals dude but  probably can get himself into that 100 range discussion  not much there beyond that oh you honest Valentina I do want to know what his role is going forward  play more minutes and I expected in the season opener  Pistons we talked about bulls we talked about Grizzlies Wizards play on Saturday gaffer is a guy you're watching their  not a whole lot else I'm not a big Denny Avenue guy from a fantasy standpoint  Indy playing on Saturday but not tonight it'll be topping is the guy you're keeping tabs on there a little bit of Buddy hield watch list kind of stuff  Cleveland we talked about  or did we yeah we talked about Cleveland Philly they go Saturday we just talked about them finishing up yesterday so Kelly oubre is kind of the guy you're paying attention to their Toronto we just talked about Dennis Schroder Jacob Gary Trent Jr Miami I mean they're gonna need somebody to help  someone's got a step up was right three horse race for or three horse team for Miami's just not gonna get it done Minnesota uh nothing really you know nothing huge there I think we know who belongs on rosters and then Phoenix plays on Saturday you're watching to see if anybody comes back it sounds like Bookers gonna miss a couple of ball games maybe Beale comes back  I don't know we're not gonna get a good data point on that team until they're all three healthy together and then Sunday I don't know that anybody plays Sunday that doesn't go Friday or Saturday Milwaukee  I guess it's Milwaukee  but I don't have any questions about them either I don't think that anybody on that team is going to have fantasy value beyond the sort of core four and if somebody does  it would be Bobby Portis  but I'm I don't well whatever you can I mean we could pay attention to Port if you want to Milwaukee if you think someone like Beesley is worth paying attention to I don't  oh the Lakers don't go Friday Saturday they're all so on that list of teams and where there's not a whole lot left to look at their beyond the Christian Wood stuff we talked about earlier all right we got through the core stuff with the show in 49 minutes just like yesterday so we're doing 11 minutes of chat room we'll see if I can get through all of the questions lightning round style after I take a sip of water  here we go rock says what offering either Jalen Williams or Terry Rozier for Deontay B2 insulting know actually think there's a chance that Jalen Williams is better than deshante this year Taro zero would be someone you'd probably want to pair up with another like 80 range guy who did well maybe you can get it for one going there  Delonte says Denny or Delon tomorrow points lie oh that's a different Beast you probably go off and a points League because his issues are points League non-issues  I'm here says how do you recommend managing my games Captain Roto I would say right now play the guys that you are very comfortable  calling top 90 or better  if you're not sure keep them on your bench  first one to two weeks of the Season you'll fall five six seven eight nine ten games behind but you also won't blow any games on a bad one Paul Newell likes the opening music I do too Polly  Wayne says hey Dan should I start Jalen Johnson or Wendell Carter Junior tonight I probably go Wendell Carter I know Jalen's got the better upside but I kind of need to see him do it a few times in a row to really believe that this is a thing that's gonna stick nightly but I still think you belongs on rosters because of that sort of infinite potential  Polly says just on potential alone who are the best of these pickups Derek Lively Delon Wright Xavier Tillman Max Drew's I like them all  um  Drew's probably is my favorite of the four then I go  Delon Lively and Tillman at the bottom I think I just think savior Tillman tapers off when they're not playing gigantic opponents  and from Memphis they're playing gigantic components to start the year now I might be wrong about those last to you might flip tommen and Lively and just take the safer play but I think at some point here Memphis is going to play a team that's more of a floor stretchy 3-point shooting club and at that point Tillman you're going to see them run smaller Santi aldama presumably will be healthier they can run JJ at the five in those games and right now they just don't want to use those guys the five or their hurt so that's the way I lean the way I do but again you could you could flip flop those last ones and I I wouldn't feel too bad about it it's Gordon Hayward a solid ad for a nine cat League not yet  not yet I need to see this a few more times  should I drop this is Wayne should I drop Kobe white or Dennis Schroder for Delon Wright need assists and steals help  well Kobe's not going to get you actually neither of those guys is Gonna Get You many steals shrews probably to get you more assists than either Dillon or Kobe white but dalan is in a category all by himself on steals here so I would probably go Schroeder  and Dylan based on the categories you need if you tip needing more three-pointers or scoring then you relinquished on right and go back to Kobe White  right versus white  Mason says if Jaden McDaniels is my worst player should I drop him for a streaming spot probably not that I don't like Jaden McDaniels but I feel like in Head to Head you almost always want a streaming spot and it feels like either your team is unbelievably loaded or this is a league where you know if that's the worst player than guys like him are probably gonna be on the waiver wired so you're streaming spot doesn't end up being that much of a value switch Jonathan says should I drop Sohan quickly or Jalen Johnson for Delon Wright I'm punting points and threes  it's probably quickly then based on what you're punting but for non punting Sohan is my drop I just don't believe that his percentages are getting any better this year  Adrian says thoughts of having older players on your roster I don't mind you guys know me um but we need to be able to separate the idea of old and durable some of these old guys play every game like vouchers and older dude who plays every day tomorrow is an older dude who's been extremely resilient and then there's older guys who don't  so  I don't think we can all just lump them in together you want  if you're have a bunch of old guys that are hurt  and some of these guys aren't even 34 plus but just hurt guys and old guys I think we need to try to separate the buckets that obviously an event diagram there's plenty of overlap in the middle but between heard and old but it's not you know too concentric circles basically  Jonathan says Horford God dropped in my league should I drop Looney quickly Jalen Johnson are Sohan for him and none of them loony Horford what difference does it make Tony says does nem hard gain any real value at some point this season not unless Tyreese Halliburton gets hurt  Ben Smith azer was dropped for some reason in my league I'm putting in a claim and dropping streus not sure I'll land him as I've got 8 priority but I'm a sucker for upside I don't think I would drop through sex actually I think I'd actually like him more than as or at least between now and February  and that's two thirds of the season  Jean says how do you navigate potentially dropping a hold guy for an ad guy what makes an ad guy a higher priority than a whole guy doesn't really sorry Jean I know my lists are sort of hard to interpret to some degree guys I put in the ad department where guys that I felt were not heavily drafted to start the year and guys I put in the whole department or guys that I thought were generally drafted to start the year but I like them both and so then you're kind of making choices based on either upside or fit on your team but all of those guys in my I belong on rosters at roughly similar  probably priority  should I drop Kevon Looney for Derek Lively yes should I trade sorry that was baby stay Flo on to give name credit to these questions Justin says should I trade siakam for Cade points League  sure why not they're probably gonna be closed go go  I don't know actually the answer is I don't know  I don't know I think they're gonna be close  Nick klaxon or DeAndre ayton um  you know there's a little bit of a what does your team need thing going on here if you're going strict nine cat rankings klaxon probably finishes this season a higher but if you prefer free throws and rebounds over defensive stats then eight and makes more sense for your team  hey Dan  from Chew Chew  I probably butchered that who do you prefer I just want a Murray or Larry Mark in it  log on marketing buy a nose  baby again says uh should I drop Looney for lively or Jalen Johnson okay I think I go Jason over Lively overlooking  bslt I don't know it's Colin sex in a drop for Max truth yes Zoe is Jalen Johnson now a start in games cap Roto or wait and see I'm gonna wait and see a little bit  Jason said Paul George and Reeves or pool and vessel give me the Paul George side  Marcos says thoughts on Markel faults I think he's like a top 85 range guy this year  I know some folks are higher than that I just think that is lack of Threes And the fact that his  free throw percentage is not that helpful is going to cover up some of the stuff he does well which is Steals and he boards pretty well and his field goal percentage is okay because he doesn't shoot threes for a guard so he sort of like a little bit of an off-kilter stats guard other than the steals  but I do think that that capsule a little bit so don't think he's gonna score all that much so I like him you know 80 to 100 range kind of guy definitely belongs on fantasy teams but you know not a not a superstar  Nicholas says I'm getting worried about on Yoko Kang woo would a roto Specialists like you drop him already for Jalen Duren in an 18 or yeah I'd rather have during that conclude in 1800 both of those guys should be on rosters in a 12 team though concave says Purl or Tillman tonight the  so here's the Dilemma there and a DFS or would have a better feeling on it Tillman is gonna play because yokich is on the other side but is he just gonna get dominated so I think I probably go paddle even though I think Tillman gets playing time I just think he's gonna get smashed  Bowdoin says I'm in a super shallow League 18 teams any particular free agent tips in that situation should I drop guys sooner or should I be cautious  you can flip guys all over the place because in an 18 or the whole way we're gonna be filled with great basketball players so the real thing is in an 1810 guys so it plays more like a 10 or a 12 team or number two if you don't do that  package guys to try to get first and second round values that's the only way to operate so take your fourth rounder and your fifth rounder and put him together and try to get a second rounder take your third rounder and your fourth rounder together put him together try to get a first rounder because the way we're going to be so thick with options all year long that your job is to a mass first and second round Talent that's the way you beat other people because otherwise everybody's just really really good  running at a time here I'm doing my best Chris says should I trade my Darius Garland for Desmond Bane and a 10 team member yes I like Bane more unless you need the extra assists but overall I like Bane more than Garland Dynasty should I drop polka chefski for okogie or Goodwin  ah if you're in win now mode you probably want a kogi but Dynasty you might as well just stick with poco if you've been there this long and hope that maybe he gets moved or something but I don't know that any of those guys is going to be a big needle mover in Dynasty this year it's just that a kogi at least is doing something right now  baby says should I drop Looney oh it's the same question again I'm sorry guys  David love you Danny you need to talk about Roto more all I do is talk about Roto almost everything I talk about is nine cat Rodeo I'm the only analyst talking about Rodeo David who talks about Roto more than me I spent the last five years getting yelled at for not talking about head-to-head enough  oh man I'm hurting right now question for Roto bench today Keegan Murray Klay Thompson Xavier Ben Simmons I think it's probably Simmons  Neil says how afraid are you of course Angus being injured I mean generally kind of afraid because he always gets hurt at some point I think he goes for 65 games though this year which would where he's getting drafted in the 40s absolutely obliterated 80P he'll be a value rallings says nine cat had to head who between herb Jones and Isaiah Stewart are you hanging on to ooooo  Duart  I'm gonna regret that herb Jones is safer Stewart's where you're like oh maybe you get into the top 80 range of things break right her probably can't get quite that high that's not accurate  damn that's a tough one  screw it I'll go herb jump no  give me the unknown give me the mystery box we'll go as I say Stuart but I don't know that this is gonna make a huge difference for your team Jason says should I drop a Kong for Jabari Smith Jr know  Lester says who do you prefer and Rodeo Melton or Bruce Brown  hmm  give me Melton but not by much I like Bruce Brown too  Hosea says should I trade my Booker for Ingram and fox  Fair actually that's fair trade  so this should question is gonna depend on who you have to drop  Nails asks for Singas plus Brooke Lopez know we're singing his four Brook Lopez and Jeremy Grant know it's poor singing his side now once not close Nicola says should I drop a Kangoo for Jabari Smith Wait wasn't that one up above  are you guys using burner accounts uh know keep Pokemon  says you didn't butcher my name that bad hey good for me  how did can you give me a pronunciation guide I'm a play-by-play broadcaster so that's actually big for me bow to win  I'm not gonna try the last name Kirk week  Jason Bane for Cade give me Bane  Chris says dan love you appreciate you doing this brother that's why I keep listening oh thanks man that's nice  and AK says  here's my roster would you pick up Derek Lively let me see if I can spot the lowest ranked this the third name on your roster AK just says annoy who's annoy  which player annoys you AKA  that's that's actually really hilarious there's too many Johnson's so I don't know which one you're talking about their Robert Williams the third Terry Rozier Derek White  topic and go bare I'm sorry dude you got all kinds of words in here that aren't actually players you're killing me oh man um  I like Derek Lively  uh probably not oh keldon Johnson okay yeah I think I'd rather have Derek lively than keldon Johnson but  understand that they might both be outside and you might see games from Kelvin where he goes for like 25 points and nine rebounds and you feel bad about it but then look over and see that he shot like three for 19 and went four for seven at the free throw line and then you'll feel better  last question because we're over an hour who would you drop for a streaming spot bow asks so dick Bae Kobe white or Jaylen Johnson  probably White  I just think that even in a great scenario his upside is capped the only way that this one would come back to bite us is if the Bulls early in the season trade  Demar or Levine because then Kobe gets enough usage where he can blast pass these other guys so if that's something you're worried about then drops to Deep Bay because his upside is like kind of 895 range kind of thing he's probably not getting beyond that but why it would be outside I believe outside the top 100 when that teams fully healthy right now so that's kind of the calculus you're sitting on there and I'll slip in one super fast one Matt says oh or Jalen t who's Jalen T who am I forgetting here assuming it's Jalen Johnson not Jalen Williams  not Jalen Smith  it's a lot of Jalen's  if that's Jalen Johnson or okongo I probably go okongwu and that is where we'll pull the plug on the Q&A part this is the week in review and the weekend in advance here on fantasy NBA today I am beyond thrilled  at how many people are hanging out with us these shows the live count is through the roof  last year I don't think we could get past 50 or 60 mode days and we're double that so this is awesome I hope we can keep this going or maybe even growing it as the season goes along the way we do that is with your help so please like rate subscribe however you're taking in the show hang out with us whenever we hang out probably won't have a show over the weekend now that we're into the regular season because Monday will probably have a couple of shows while have the reverse chronological lightning round episode where we go through the weekend in reviews see if any of the stuff we were watching for actually took shape and then we'll also have the weekly preview with Derek ball again so probably two shows on Monday meaning Dana gets to rest the old voice over the weekend have a great one everybody I'm pooped see you soon
