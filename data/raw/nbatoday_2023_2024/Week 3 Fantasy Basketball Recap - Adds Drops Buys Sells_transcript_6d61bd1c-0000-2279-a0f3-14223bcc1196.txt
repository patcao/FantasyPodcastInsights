welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  okay everybody sorry for the slight delay on this one was hoping to get it going about 20 minutes ago but it is indeed a national holiday happy Veterans Day or I don't know what the proper nomenclature is for that hope you have a good Veterans Day honoring those who have or continue to I think it's that have served in the military at any capacity so thank you for your service will fire up the show with that I am Dan Bass Pros this is fantasy NBA today it's week three in review episode these have been a big smash hole hit so far so we'll keep them going every Friday as long as the season persists today we will be covering all of the ads the holds the I'm scared the drops the watch list the injury replacement board the Bilo board the cell High board we got a lot of things to go over on today's show and we'll hit all 30 teams next game over the weekend basically what we're going to be looking for although we do that pretty quick because a lot of the players that come up on those teams are ones that we've already talked about during this sort of first portion of the show  for those that are watching with us live on YouTube the chat room is open I don't know that there's gonna be time to get to questions at the end but feel free to communicate with one another for those watching or listening after the fact I actually forgot what I was about to tell you guys oh find me over on social media at Danbury d a n b e s b r i s that's on Twitter I don't actually think I even have accounts on other things I don't know maybe I do I haven't logged into them in a while so don't worry about those Twitter is the one where I'm doing all my work when we put out sort of a short burst version of all of this stuff this morning so you guys would know what we're gonna be talking about on today's podcast all so  come hang with us in Discord that was the other one I'm sorry guys I'm a little I'm a little out of whack when one kids off school the other one was actually in school right now it's been a weird morning anyway if you're if you're hanging out with us on YouTube the Discord link is in the chat room right now for everybody a live functional one is in the show description so come play with us over on Discord there's a free side where everybody can just kind of hang out and talk fantasy basketball there's all a premium side for folks that upgrade to some kind of fantasy pass at sports ethos those folks have access to a 24/7 Q&A with our Sports ethos analysts you have access to my what's called sort of like a real-time thoughts thread where I just type things as they hit me that goes out before podcast social media so premium Subs get that a little bit sooner  let's get right into it though we got a lot to cover so I want to waste too much time here at the front end  this is let me get back to the top here so I do have a visual aid on today's program there it is  let's see which way which way should I have this display on YouTube  that way looks fine  there are more names than what you see on the page in fact those watching on YouTube you can tell it's just a Microsoft Word documents you can see that there's was that say six pages that's a six down there or eight so little I can't even tell  it's eight It's actually an eight so there's eight pages here so don't worry about like some lists are gonna carry from one page over to the next I'll do my best to try to remind you guys what we're talking about and I know that it's sort of a pet peeve of podcast listeners when folks don't repeat the names they say are or are talking about so I'll do my best to keep that part of the the fun as well  let's dive in we'll start at the top with the ads that's everybody's favorite thing a Jalen Suggs was on the ads board last week but I wanted to put him back in there mostly because I just wanted to talk about him I'm having fun with this Jalen Suggs thing and I know that he's not a traditional Dan best brisk kind of guy because he's shooting 40 and a half percent from the field his free throw number is actually come down he had made something like his first nine or 10 free throws in a row now he's down at 80% which I think is probably closer to what we can expect at of him  so the percentage just stink  not usually the guys I'm hunting for  but you may notice a few things about Suggs that do that does draw my attention to him most notably dude is averaging 2.3 steals per game you guys want to know who's leading the league  in steals right now it's not Jalen Suggs he's actually tied for fourth  that yeah I know I hit you with the okie doke Marcus Smart and Paul George are averaging 2.6 steals per game apiece but the fun part of this is that the only player averaging two steals or more per game that is played more than one game so far this year and is doing it in under  what's the number I guess 32 minutes per game is sucks and he's a 26  not to say that 2.3 is going to stick but among all of these guys that are averaging two steals or more right now the one that has the staying power is the guy who might get to play more as the season goes on  I love me some Jalen's dogs a lot of it is because I've been watching magic games because there's been stuff to try to pick a part with that team like why is Mark hell faults off to us slow start what's Cole Anthony is roll who's filming in for window Carter Jr some watching more magic games this year that I did last season or frankly Seasons passed in almost any capacity  and because of that I mean Suggs just leaps off the screen if you're watching he's everywhere on defense right now I absolute Menace the deflections the steals it's not a coincidence he's getting his hands on everything  so I think there's actually room for growth which would be great because you hope the field goal percent gets up into the I don't know 4243 just like little incremental jumps there more playing time would be more rebounds more assists so that's fun and I just he's number 68 and 9 cat right now and I I like I think that this is this is something that could stick  because other stuff might come up even if the steals rate or total number of steals comes down a little bit  next name on the board is keyonte George who is a little bit less I'd say enthralling then Jalen Suggs but he's one that I think we want to just kind of even if barely just get out in front of a little bit because he's now  the best option and he probably always was the best option for point guard in Utah  they tried Taylor Horton Tucker it was a bad decision  Jordan Clarkson is not a distributor for George twice this season three times actually he's played 27 minutes or more I picked that number because there's sort of a gap for him his minute total this year for keonte 19127 2023 1727 21 31 so this is pretty big gap there where only one time did he really play kind of a middle number of minutes that was that 23 minute game it was a blowout win over Memphis he got in there for some extra garbage time the three times he's played 27 minutes or more which we can kind of round up and just call Starters style minutes first time he had 12.7 board 6 assists a steal in a couple of three balls on out of 12 shooting second time he went for 8 points and four assists with one three ball that was in 27 minutes and then last ball game which I think was two days ago and now 31 minutes that was his first  no I think this is the second start of the year but the first time where they really were like look this is yours now 7 points 9 assists one three-pointer  is what kind of steals rate were really looking at here  because he's only played nine games in his NBA career and he has three steals in those nine games but does that mean that he's really gonna be who gets point a guy who gets point three steals per game that feels unlikely  there are very few players that can play you know 20 some odd minutes and only end up with 0.3 steals you sort of just tumble into more than that  but  at least to this point it doesn't look like he's going to be getting a truckload of them now we again we don't really know where that number ends up  we don't really know where the three balls end up somewhere between 1 and 2 feels reasonable it's where he's at right now but we haven't seen him play all that much so does that have a chance to go a little higher Maybe  I think if you're picking up keyonte George you're doing it under the assumption that Utah's gonna see how this goes with him as point guard for a little bit because they've noticed now that THD is just not going to be that guy  but there are going to be days where Horton Tucker plays Better Off the Bench and he sees extra time and they do have Chris Dunn sort of floating deep in the reserves if they ever wanted to break the glass in case of emergency there so I want to temper everybody's expectations on George I think there's probably about an 80% chance that he's not a top 100 fantasy play even as a starter because again rookie point guards tend to struggle a lot the reason that there's a little room for optimism is that he's not really being asked to run an offense but more so take care of the basketball get it to the scoring guys on the team and then just you know try not to make a bunch of mistakes  so he's more of a speculative add more of a luxury stash I don't think that I would play him in Roto right now against my games cap had to head you play it and you just sort of see what happens what I say 80% chance he probably ends up back on the wire but you see how it goes  now as read I think he might have been on the ads board last week all so I'm not a hundred percent sure on that but he's been great so far he's number 69 and 9 cat in only 23 minutes of ball game 15 points for a half boards and assist a steal two threes on 55% shooting from the field he's shooting Aid and unsustainably high 903% of 3 throw line but he's just a guy that racks up fantasy stats in 20 some odd minutes if anything ever happens to Rudy gobert or Karl Anthony towns not read slides into a Whopper of a slot he sort of that on Yoko Kang woo situation here where if anybody goes down Mega upside as it stands right now he's been good enough  he belongs on rosters and he's a start in all formats  believe it or not those are the only three ads of the week  we do have a lot of holds though so let's start pivoting into those your first hole is Bruce Brown which I think needed more explanation before yesterday where he went for 11:09 and 7 to steals block a three-pointer four out of four free throws yeah only three for nine from the field but this was the kind of game I don't know you can expect nine rebounds most of the time but the well-roundedness of it pushing up to him to 113 in nine cat I think there's room for growth beyond that I think the assistant 2.7 again even with him not being the the ball mover that he was in Denver that's the number that could work its way up scoring could work its way up there's just all these things that could settle in for him so I I feel like he's a pretty easy hold at this point  tyus Jones and Jordan Poole both members of the flailing Washington Wizards pool is ranked 134 tyus Jones Is 129 but the big numbers for those two guys tie us 26 minutes pool 27 those numbers are very low because the Wizards have been in a lot of blowouts and then even in the last ball game where they won it the bench was the reason they won  these guys I think  probably pull up the day by day for either one of them but I feel like we're we're at a point where  they played so far eight ball games how many games of the Wizards had so far this year  only seven all right so they've had a pretty light schedule so far they played seven games  and tyus Jones has played full starters minutes in I would argue one of those seven  so we really don't know what his fantasy year is going to look like maybe it's possible conceivable that he really only gets started it's one out of every seven ball game but providing the Wizards can slightly and then dog days I think they probably do get a little bit more competitive then hopefully you see games more like what he did in Philadelphia 12.6 assists a couple of steals in a couple of threes  that's what we were gunning for from the outset with the chance to do a little bit more  and then a similar thing for Jordan Poole although the difference there is that pool was getting drafted in the early fourth early to mid forth and Jones was like seventh round I think Tyas can get back to the seventh round in per game value he's not that far away from that it's a lot harder to jump those next three rounds that pool is gonna have to climb  again more playing time more stuff but he's only taking 15 shots of game right now free throw is super low for Jordan that'll get better steals unfortunately unblocked probably both come down for him so a lot of things are gonna have to get better to overcome some of the slippage where at least with tyus Jones right now everything is basically in line with what we expected scoring rate assist rate steel rate percentages they're all pretty reasonable for him all we need is the extra 20% of playing time  that would take him from 10 points to 12 from 5 and a half assists to almost seven 1.1 steals goes to one point three one point four two and a half rebounds goes to three that tweak those little tweaks in every category move him from one 30 to about 80 that's pretty easy leap  Mark health is a hold which you know the funny thing is that he was probably a tougher hold before he got hurt now everybody that held him through his short injury is like well I got to see how it goes now that he's back from injury and so far he's just not doing all that much only 11 shots of ball game only four assists the hope is that those numbers get better  my endpoint with false this year  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with

be 21 plus not available in all locations  was always more like top 90 I wasn't super high on him I thought he was sort of like  an easy decision near a hundred as it turns out I guess not that easy near a hundred but I do think he gets back somewhere into that range so hang on I put Brandon Miller on this list I  don't actually don't why he's number one 86 you just you've seen flashes of what he can be  he probably doesn't need to be a hole  playing 31 minutes and he's outside the top one eighties not like he can get more playing time and it's not like more usage about to come his way unless he makes big stride in his game and you've got miles Bridges probably coming back in a week because we haven't heard anything about an extended suspension for him based on the other things that came out whatever was 2-3 weeks ago smashing car windows and whatever  so do we really need a whole braided Miller I put him in the holds and now I'm kind of rethinking it he probably can go  more holds YouTubers just watch me Turn the Page Kelly oubre Jr I don't think you need a whole lot of explanation on that he's been okay since the new guys arrived from the Clippers not as good as he was before but we do need to see how it plays out  one of the hardest holds right now is DeAnthony Melton but he's shooting  29 and a half percent and I did a long segment on him yesterday yesterday or two days ago I can't remember which show it was just illustrating how  you know it reminded me of the Rob Covington drop from five six years ago I'm not gonna go deep into that story again  because  you've heard it recently  but guys don't shoot 29% for an entire season and I know that Melton's not like a field goal Helper but 441 something in that neck of the woods that's a big difference for him  so make him not basically a punt field goal guy right now  get him a little more playing time is the shots fall his playing time probably goes up  I get it it's a very hard hold he's hurting your team more than he's helping if you're in a roto games cap for Matt you probably just stuff him on a bench I don't use it against your games Gap head you can kind of keep flopping them out there and see what happens  but it hurts it hurts I'll say though if you drop him and he starts to get it going you'll feel really bad if somebody else Scoops him up  buddy hield is the next name on the holds board I don't have super high expectations for heal these number one 31 I don't think it's playing time is gonna get much higher you're holding him because you against better judgment meaning me telling you not to do it you have to  once it came out that they hadn't reached an extension and he was going on the trade block he was not a player you should have drafted because you knew that that meant the Pacers were going to be like kind of cool with him but they were gonna force feed him and we even saw that towards the end of last year he became less of a priority the reason to hold buddy hield now is that you're hoping he gets traded  because wherever he goes someone's gonna give him more than 23 minutes  and that would be good  so you can't drop him because you already invested in it and I know some cost theory and all that stuff but lucky for me I have zero buddy hield on any of my team so this is me putting myself in somebody else's shoes what can I say I'm a fantasy empath let's talk Josh Hart who got 30 plus minutes for a few games in a row but not in the last one and that was reason for concern but he's shooting 35% on the year so another guy who's just off to a really really bad shooting start and I have to believe that as that number comes around like Melton you'll probably see the playing time get a little bit more locked in but it's pretty rare to get a shooting guard eligible player who can get you six to eight rebounds a night and one to one and a half steals per game and one to two three pointers a game he gets you these off-kilter numbers  and that is reason to hang on until we see what his minutes are actually going to look like  I don't know why I put my Conley on the holds board I think it's because somebody was arguing with me about how he if you're punting turnovers he's not that valuable okay fine I'm not  simple as that he's number 57 because he's getting you four and a half assisted game and never turning the basketball over there's value in that  whatever let's keep going Christian would I put on my holds board but he's he's if he had a brutal last game filling in for Anthony Davis I just I like the idea that he has a spot on this team and so I feel like we kind of needed to just see what that means but also I get it he's always been a guy dating back to however long you want to go that has needed more minutes to get to Fantasy value last year you played 26 minutes in Dallas and that got him to top 90 but he was also a focal point on offense in those 26 minutes in Los Angeles he could play 26 minutes he's not gonna get 11 and a half shots a game he's not gonna score 16 17 points  he'll have to build up his fantasy value with blocks and some threes and some rebounds and things of that nature well hopefully not putting a dent into your free throw number  yeah he probably needs like 28 29 minutes to be a 12 team guy but I'm gonna give him a little bit longer because we've seen that he and Anthony Davis are coexisting pretty nicely together and I think that means he'll play a decent amount but it might not be enough  I just think we need a little more data to get to that point  Max Drew's is the next on the list mostly because people are like I've dropped maths truce to do blah blah blah and I'm like what he's number 80 right now and he's only shooting 38 and a half percent from the field so far we've seen his minutes are massive Cleveland's playing Spruce 35 minutes of damn ball game which is amazing I did not see that coming he wasn't on my draft board so it's not like I'm trying to protect myself here I just think he's a really good fit for what they're doing and they're pouring as much opportunity on him as humanly possible so we got to see how this thing rolls out there are very few players in the NBA that can hit 33 pointers a game in 35 minutes and don't make fantasy numbers  so yeah why not  Keras Levert this is a little bit of a tougher one he's number one 33 despite average 18 four and a half and four and a half with two three pointers and a steal because he's shooting a high volume 41% from the field in a high volume 71% at the free throw line  the free throw number may or may not move very much feel goal probably gets a little bit better and that's always gonna be the problem with Keras is that he's more of a points League friendly player  but if either of those things even in anomalous sense like you could just have a season where those numbers are a tiny bit better than career marks that would get him inside the top 100 that's all it would take right now and again you're looking for these guys that have opportunity he has opportunity there even when the team is healthy so I think you can hold on to Charis Levert a little bit longer see how the percentage is develop see all the role develops and people are saying that the graphic is messed up right now I don't understand how that's happening but we're going to look into that before we get to the next player  okay that's all fixed now next name on the board is Grant Williams who I'm putting in the whole category for now but I am I'll admit concerned that we saw the beginning of the cooldown we wasn't going to shoot 56% all year while hitting three and a half four three pointers and night  what I don't know is what that number comes down to and what I also don't know is like is free throw shooting is at 65 percent that'll probably go up  and his blocks at point six is deals at point three maybe those all so wiggle  the tiniest bit up the board  so I want to hold because I just I think we've seen enough to know that he could be useful  but we don't know enough if he will be useful  Derek live on my whole board but he might not be there for long now the I think I messed up the screen again  Lively's at 1:23 in 24 minutes a game that's his rank in nine cat right now but Maxi Cleo's back I know Lively missed the last one with an illness I'm talking about when he's actually healthy when all three centers are healthy in Dallas I am worried about the safety in minutes for any of those three guys  Lively certainly has the the best path to value of any of those three and it's like they like him the most but again what we don't know is  will the minutes be secure when there's two when there are two other centers he's competing with so hold for now but we'll get some more data on this over the next game or two I would think and then maybe we'll be able to make a final call Chris Paul is the next name on the holds board he's been disappointing of late he's dropped outside the top 100 and I kept buddies another guy who shooting 36 and a half percent from the field so  you know that's not gonna hold what we don't know is where the assists the minutes the scoring all that stuff like how much usage is gonna stay with him that's still a little bit up in the air but 36 and a half percent is just not gonna stick so  yeah hold  and Klay Thompson I put on the holds board I don't think that anybody's dropping him because they likely drafted him in like the 80 90 range and most of those guys usually get a little more leash and all so Clays a guy who has named power I'm a little worried though Enclave only 13 and a half shots per game so far for Warriors team that didn't exactly add a bunch of other guys that can just blast shots off his percentages yeah it's free throw percent is lower than usual but he doesn't take that many so it's not really a factoring in this is all about just number of shots per game and we need him to get back up into that 17 18 range but that's a far cry from where he's at right now  he's out there he's just not shooting as much  but you got a hold because these clay freaking Thompson if you start to shoot a whole bunch then you end up with the top 60 guy and you'll feel like a real  you know what  a horse's patoot  yep I went there if you dropped him too soon  the I'm scared or nervous here slash drops group is next but

moment here once again to like rate and subscribe as we move into the I'm scared or drops category Taylor he's not an I'm scared he's a drop  out to pasture with you Taylor Horton Tucker I don't need to say more so dick Bae is one that maybe I could say a little bit more on so  for a little bit there we saw Jalen Johnson and Sadiq Bay kind of rotating who was starting and who was coming off the bench and it looked as though  it was based on matchups who was Atlanta playing was there someone on the other side where they needed a defensive stopper like a Jalen Johnson to go deal with like a Shea Gill just Alexander or something like that  but then they played  was the game yesterday in Mexico City or Lando  and Jalen Johnson got the start was that to deal with Paulo  maybe I don't know how those not like a world beater right now  I guess I'm just struggling to see  the game's where they gets back into the starting five why would they not just start Jalen Johnson pretty much every time right now  he's been amazing they seem markedly better when he's playing big minutes Hawks after a pretty good start this year actually at five and three and he's a decent reason why  so unfortunately I think that means that Sydney bay may be a little bit cooked he played 29 minutes yesterday but he only got four shots his role is shrinking he's only taking eight and a half shots of game right now and his value was kind of floating by a season opener where he got five steals he has three over his last seven games I'm just not seeing it right now  I think you can move on  DeAndre Hunter I don't think I should have to say too much about this one his very hot start has ended and now he goes back to being the not that interesting fantasy play that you don't need to roll out there when he's not Lava Hot easy peasy  Colonie is a drop for me right now and and that one might be a little bit controversial and I guess in certain builds you could hang on to him but certainly if you're trying to compete in all nine categories he's not a guy that gets you there he's number one seventy seven I would argue he's a pretty good  runway in the early going with false and Gary Harris mixing time  I don't know more you could ask for other than Jaylen Suggs going down again but please don't do that so Kohl's averaging 15 points and that's fine and all and for rebounds and three assists and that's all well and good but the problem is that you're basically talking about a guy whose slightly sub-average fantasy wise in all nine categories he is not better than what you need to be competitive in any of them 14.8 points is just below average 1.5 threes just below average for rebounds for a guard I guess that's fine but it certainly below average you need about six six in change if you're looking at Roto 2.8 assists slightly below average 0.8 steals slightly below 0.4 blocks for a guard I mean fine but also again the low average 45% shooting below 77 free throw below  I get it like there is Intrigue there and if he was playing 32 minutes and getting 14 shots a game I might say yeah go for it because he's  like each one of these categories if you just bump it up a little bit then great he jumps from 170 to 70 but I just don't think that's about to happen  so for nine cat if you're trying to compete in all nine categories I don't think he needs to be on your team Jeremy Sohan number 203 I've been fading him since the preseason I don't care that he got the starting point guard job I've been fading him because we knew his percentages were bad and they are bad and he is definitely not doing enough in the other categories to make up for it the 4.6 assists is more than expected but not nearly enough you don't need it there are better plays out there and just so you don't think I'm picking on only guys that I've been fading since the outset I think Kyle Anderson is a drop he's number one 37 I think he's actually more of a schedule stream level guy that's seven and a half points for boards five assists one steel one block that stuff is all good but sorry the scoring is not he doesn't hit three pointers he doesn't score I can get over that if everything else was much better but nothing is really Elite for him right now so he's a guy you fill in you know in Minnesota has three games in four nights kind of thing and you can pile up 12 boards and 15 assists and three Steals and three blocks over those four days that's good but if you're only  getting say three games at him over an entire week that's not gonna be enough and that's why I think you can probably turn him into a schedule play more of these names Gary Trent Jr is the next one I know he got a little bit more to do in the last ball game but guess what he's not inside the top 200 and that means I don't think we need to worry about him because much like with Buddy hield Toronto is sort of moved on from the Gary Trent Jr experiment the beauty of Buddy hield is that we know he can post a ton of fantasy value of his minutes are just a little bit higher Gary Trent is getting minutes but he's just not a focal point for them right now  but if you're holding him you're holding with the hope that he gets moved so I get it that's why he's in sort of the I'm scared part it doesn't have to be a straight drop same thing through if for Andrew Wiggins who I I know I said on yesterday's show or the day before that I believe he's on healthy I don't have any proof of it but he just doesn't look like himself at all and whether that means on healthy and like needs to talk to somebody or unhealthy something hurts  no Stigma just he needs something fixed something needs to get remedied  and it's hard to hold on to a guy playing that poorly because he's he's brutalizing your head to head team Roto you can keep on your bench it's a little bit of an easier call there because you know he can be a top 80 type of guy if he's actually humming  but something's wrong and until we find out what that is he's very much and I'm scared nervous dude and if you need that roster space you know what you got to do  let's move through some watch lists names and we'll go a little bit faster now since we're through kind of the the big decisions Jalen Smith is on my watch list I don't know he missed Indies last ball game banged up but he had started to play himself into fantasy value in about 24 minutes a game  I don't think those minutes stick because Indie is by the way shout out to Rick Carlisle  your for playing Four Guys actual starters minutes yesterday doesn't happen very often Jalen Smith being gone probably had something to do with it  but I don't and they get really good bench production because they're willing to play all these different guys in hot handed and all that stuff but I just don't think that like magically erenice Smith or Jalen Smith but both of them in this same bucket are gonna fall into 28 minutes a night there you just have to guess right with those dudes and that's why they're on the watch list and not anything higher Bogdan bogdanovich is off to a crazy steals start to his year I don't believe that that can possibly keep up but also like it's happening now so we might as well capitalized on it over his career in starter's minutes he's been about a 1.1 steals per game guy he's at 1.8 in 24 and a half minutes per game he's taking about as many shots in 24 and a half minutes as he didn't 28 last year so he's out there and he's chucking away which you know good but if his numbers if he's steals number comes down to point eight like it was last year which you presume that's about what it would be in 24 in some odd minutes then he no longer becomes a fantasy asset so watch list sell High whatever you want to call him there I'm not a Bogdan believer let's move on  Jonathan Isaac has made my watch list for the first time this year he got 16 minutes yesterday and he looked really good 12.7 boards two blocks we know he's a guy that can get fantasy value in 20 to 0 minutes per ball game that's all we need  in fact I would offer that the moment he placed 20 minutes we pick him up not before  because also if he plays 20 minutes his body might fall apart  I'm also not convinced that his team likes him that much but yeah I'll deal cross that bridge when we get there  Mo vogner GoGo beta these guys are watch lists to see if either one of them can kind of  you know  the other one on the Noggin knock them out for a minute and actually get the sentiments with Wendell Carter Junior down so far it doesn't look like it's gonna happen so I don't think you need to pick either of them up immediately  Delon Wright who had a few good games to start the year and then completely disappeared before exploding in the Wizards last ball game thanks to that explosion his minutes are back up to 18 on the year 1.7 steals in 18 minutes I mean that's the thing that's staring us right in the face but 18 minutes ain't enough we need him to be playing 24 25 and night if he gets there he jumps from watch list back up to an ad  Deni avdija is all so on my watch list now maybe that one's being a little bit too cruel because he is actually inside the top 100 barely right now but he is inside there mostly because he's kept his turnovers down if he can keep that up and continue to go 13.5 and 4 basically with a steel and a 3 then I'll get on board I'm just skeptical that the turnovers stay super low I'm also skeptical to field goal percent stays at 53 and for that reason he's more of a watch list guy for me than a straight add just because I feel like something unpleasant is about to shake out  Kelly Olynyk is someone I added in a couple of spots but I put them on my watch list here because I don't think you had to I just happened to have some dead weight that I could cut he's number one 32 this year in 20 minutes one would have to assume that he sees a little bit of an uptick with Walker Kessler out for at least a couple of weeks he had a bunch of fouls in their lives ball games still got around 20 minutes so my assumption here is that a Linux sees more like 24 minutes well Kessler's down which should be about enough to get him near the top 100 and that's probably a streaming board level play but I don't know that you have to act on it immediately  I put a manual quickly on this list mostly because I knew if I put him on any other list I get yelled at so instead I just called him a watch list guy he's number one 45 in 44 minutes there's just no room for him to do more in New York  they didn't come to a contract extension so I guess like in the back of my mind I can pray that they move him somewhere I don't think that's gonna happen but you know we can dream  but right now you know nine cat Roto that's not good enough but 15 points almost two threes good free throw percent like there's some stuff that he's pretty good at and then there's some stuff that he's really bad at he gets no defensive stats and that can kind of weigh things down a little bit so if you're punting say blocks or even steals honestly he makes a lot of sense because he's a guard that doesn't steal  if you're trying to compete in some of the stuff where he's not very good then he doesn't make sense meaning nein cat but there are builds where he makes some sense and that's why I put him on the watch list because I knew he was sort of in a little bit of a gray area  lewd Dort has been one of the big surprises in the early going he's actually ranked number 35 in nine cat right now  shooting 50% from the field and averaging both 1.1 Steals and one point one blocks per game guys  we've watched Lou Dort for a few years now we know what his fantasy profile is which is about one steel and about 0.3 blocks per game so the blocks are way the heck out over his skis he's also a career 40% from the field  he's a career 34% are from 3 you know what he's shooting in those right now  53 and 53 respectively  this is a guy who's on a very hot start to the year  sort of Dillon Brooks esque actually but we know the bottom is going to fall out  it's just a matter of time  Luke Kennard is on my watch list he's just been getting a little bit better every game in Memphis and I just I feel like at some point they're going to be like you know what Luke go ahead play a bunch of minutes but not yet you don't need to act on that yet you'd be getting out in front of it  also in Memphis Santee all dhamma whose not anywhere near fantasy value at the moment but I think as a guy we should keep our eye on certainly while Xavier Tillman's out because is bismack biyombo the answer there  guys know I bounce back and forth on whether I actually wanted to deal with the Bismarck experience  typically the answer is no I you know he sort of makes sense as a center fill in type but also man  and then Alex Caruso who lured I'd love to be able to just call him a straight add and he is a good fantasy play so far you know he's inside the top 80  top 90 depending on what websites you're looking at he's been a star double play  but his minutes are all over the map and he's shooting 59% from the field it was good as Caruso is at shot selection  not a 59% or he's career 4345  that number is going to come down which means we're gonna need more consistent run to cover up that drop  and maybe that comes but every time he's ever had to average 25 or more minutes per game his body falls apart  so what do the Bulls do I don't know do they try to push him a little bit more to see if that can squeeze out some more wins I mean he was the guy guarding Kevin Durant in the last damn ball game for good to say they need him on the court but they also need him to stay upright I don't know how they can make both of those things happen at the same time so schedule play Maybe  and I just threw him on the watch list because I thought that was easier here's some injury Replacements as we head into the weekend Dorian Finney Smith for Nic Claxton Royce O'Neill for Ben Simmons Jordan Hawkins for CJ McCollum Marcus Sasser for Alec Burks Jaden Ivey boyun book zdanowicz blah blah blah Kyle Lowry or Duncan Robinson for Tyler hero we're still kind of juries out on that but biyombo we just talked about for Tillman who I'm not all that excited about Reggie Jackson who had one bad one one good one filling in for Jamal Murray Skylar Mays filming in for scooting Malik monk filling in for dear and fox those are your injury Replacements and here's a few Buy Low suggestions Brooke Lopez right now who's sitting near where he was drafted and he's doing it while shooting ready for this 39% I know he takes a lot of Threes he's not gonna shoot 39% from the field all season long that number's gonna get up to the mid to high 40s when it does he moves from Top 80  up at least two rounds maybe more he's blocking two shots of ball game just like you wanted anyway see if you can get Brook Lopez for somebody currently ranked near him on the board because he's a guy that's likely to take a step forward Kawhi Leonard Paul George James Harden the trio it's possible that Paul George James Harden are not buy low enough yet I think Kauai you can probably already buy a little bit low on this may be kind of a preemptive placement in the Bilo board I just think these guys are gonna struggle to play together for the next couple of weeks and at some point in there you're going to see a low window I just want you guys to be ready for it  and then Keegan Murray who I almost forgot to put on this list but he's one of the easiest bible Rex I've ever given out due to shooting 33.5% on 14 shots per game that number corrects itself into the mid-40s he launched pads 50 spots up the ranks  like it's a huge jump scoring goes up threes go up field goal percent obviously goes up  huge huge jump coming for Keegan Murray when they the field goal percent equilibrates over the next few weeks or months or whatever it is I don't know what it's gonna take to get him but I think that's a big time Target  I think he's one of the I think he's the guy like if you're gonna go out there and work on trying to buy low Keegan Murray's the guy because his role is bigger this year but folks haven't caught on to that fact because his rank isn't higher  sell Highs are RJ Barrett Kyle kuzma and Dillon Brooks and it's the same reason for all three of them RJ Barrett is shooting 47 and a half percent from the field and 87% at the free throw line guys he's just didn't magically turn himself into an 87% free throw shooter do you need to know what RJ shoots over his career from any place 40 to from the field 71 at the foul line he's never been higher than 74 and a half at the free throw line both of those percentages are coming down and when they do  fantasy value will also  Kyle kuzma is an interesting one because I do think he's gonna have a decent year but he's shooting 51% from the field  and what else out at the free throw line right now 83% at the foul line  is there a chance that guys just magically have slightly better Seasons than they have before yeah you see that sort of the bouncing around the anomalous stuff it happens but this is a 45% career shooter from the field 73% at the free throw line I don't expect both of those numbers to jump five and 10% respectively easy going to have a truckload of usage yes so he's gonna be better in rank than he was last year but right now he's sitting inside the top 50 fact is action signed the top 40  I don't know that you can get a top 40 guy back for kuzma but if you can get a top 60 guy back someone that not top 60 right now but someone that you believe will be in that range the rest of the way maybe like a DeMar DeRozan Drew holiday is it those guys are 51 52 probably can't get bam out of Bio he's got a little bit too much name power vouch wouldn't be a terrible Target he's at 59 right now and he's been trending in a positive direction over the last week week and a half Freddy Van Vleet it's 63 would be an interesting Target  see what you can get for Coos cuz he's running hot right now  and the last name was Dillon Brooks you're not gonna be able to get anything for Dillon Brooks I don't even know why I put him on this list he's number 74 but he shooting 57% from the field and 94% of the free throw line if you can get anyone inside the top 100 I think a safe top 100 play for Dillon Brooks you probably do it but maybe somebody is upset with someone like a Jalen Williams and on the thunder right now because he's not getting any steals I doubt you can get him but you're better option is to try to Target someone maybe like a Zach Collins who's at 98 but only because his turnovers are a little bit on the high side or a John Collins who's a little low because he's not blocking any shots right now these guys are like safe top 100s and for Dillon Brooks when the percentage is drop out and he goes back to scoring you know 11 12 points a game or whatever it is and he's not even taking as many shots as he got last year in Memphis so the usage is down  it's gonna be a precipitous drop  and believe it or not  that is your weekend review everybody can watch me close out my Microsoft Word document I know classy fairy classy YouTube videos we do here on for Fantasy NBA today and sports ethos before we get to our week ahead or a weekend preview part of the show this is once again a mid show reminder please please please take a moment hit that thumbs up button I think there's been what 30 some odd likes to this point forty and it's like 120 of you guys watching the show hit that button man it actually means a pretty big deal getting us into that algorithm getting more people to check it out more people find sports ethos more people find the shows please do it that's what I please do it and then subscribe if you guys are enjoying what you're hanging out with so far  I am going to send a tweet out right in the middle of a show and then we're going to dive into the  all 30 teams weekend preview yeah probably not going to get to questions by the way just as a warning because we're already at 50 minutes and I was hoping to keep this to about an hour but let's take a look at what's coming up tonight Friday Charlotte at Washington let's go through every team every game over the weekend we'll talk about what we're looking for here  just sort of like a general idea of what's coming up for the Hornets nothing really I don't know that there's gonna be anything until Myles Turner comes back and let's Rozier returns for the Wizards tyus and pool these guys again work sort of looking for the the normalcy of minutes of Dia de la on right we just talked about those guys as well  for the Sixers any changes for Kelly oubre Anthony Melton's shot Nic Batum he's been doing some stuff  I don't expect it to turn in anything big for Batum because every time he plays larger minutes his body breaks down but hey you never know for the Pistons Marcus Sasser we already talked about him as a possible stream Nets streams Finney Smith Royce O'Neill because Ben Simmons is out for tonight Celtics nothing Timberwolves can slo-mo get himself above that that schedule stream play that's what we were talking about before and Nas Reed who's been very good  Spurs I think the only real question is what did Devin vessels minutes look like in this second game back because the only played a handful in his first game off of the what ended up being a much shorter term injury Than People expected but maybe he wasn't all the way ready  Pelicans you're just watching the injury report man we did get word right about the time we went on air that Zion is expected to play so that's one of the guys back I don't think we have word on herb Jones yet we do know that CJ McCollum is out  so does that mean Jordan Harkins time does that mean Dice and Daniel's time I don't know that I know for sure at the answer to that and when I don't know for sure I tend to play it  a little bit safe  operation is a game time decision with ankle sprain if he sits we might get a jock landale sighting and then tari Eason is a fun one did I forget to put him on the man I think I forgot to put Tara Easton on my boards oh Big Time oversight I got to go back and fix that on Twitter too oopsies Daniel get your head in the game man that's a bad oversight  did I put them on anything  no I didn't oopsies  man I feel like I feel like a real dummy right now  anyway we'll get that fixed on social but you guys heard it now um Jazz keyonte George were just sort of taking in what's going on for him and then the whole Kelly Olynyk who does he get enough Setter minutes Grizzlies we talked about Kennard aldama we talked about biyombo already  Clippers you guys know Mavs three-headed Center monster how does that work Grant Williams and Tim Hardaway Jr how does that work Tim hardaway's been  crazy hot from three so far this year which like he's hitting what four four a game right now  and he's made every free throw I just I can't imagine that that keeps up for him but  I guess you never know  or the heck where we hear thunder yeah Lou Dort can you get anything for him before the inevitable drop off comes for the king's Malik monk he's been rolling here Keegan Murray because by low on the market right now Lakers is all about health you know rui came back but I think they're hoping to have Anthony Davis and jaxson Hayes for this ball game still know Gabe Vincent I think yeah Taurean Prince is good to go now starting to get some pieces back but they're just not good without Anthony Davis not surprisingly because no one else can play defense on that damn team except for Gabe Vincent and he's out also whoopsies I guess Dorian Prince can play a little d  anyway we're gonna find out what Christian Wood is going to be able to do with his time for the Lakers  Bradley Beal second game back for the Suns what it was minutes look like Grayson Allen was that last ball game I'm assuming it's flash in the pan but it's also possible that he settles into a better role still there's no Devin Booker so anything that we get out of Phoenix is fleeting  until we see what that team looks like when they got all three heads on the monster going at the same time  during the page to Saturday Milwaukee Milwaukee nothing really I think Brooke Lopez you buy low window whatever that might be or Lando we talked about Jaylen Suggs his emergence who picks up the center minutes can call Anthony get some going and then Markle faults who he's like sort of both by low and also not enough upside for me to get super excited about it in the way that I did about Keegan Murray Toronto what gives yakka portal what gives what gives  Boston nothing Miami we need to figure out who's filling in for Tyler hero because it's gonna have to be somebody can't just be bam and Jimmy every day  I don't think we're gonna be able to rely on Heywood Highsmith to get enough fantasy stuff gaming and game out but I suppose you never know it just feels like it's gonna be Lowry or Duncan Robinson  and I think we need another game to at least have an idea of which one it's gonna be I did pick up Kyle Lowry and one or two spots to squat on  see if it is him if it's just like SPO went up to lower it was like dude I know it hurts to get up in the morning but we need you to go big for two weeks while Tyler's out and low recycling okay bud  I've been working on this big booty for so long it's ready and then at the end of these two weeks or three weeks or whatever it is for hero that louder you might have to sit for a month so maybe  maybe  Atlanta I'd like some confirmation on my Sadiq Bay drop wreck we'll see if that happens Cleveland not much really you know Jared Allen still kind of getting ramped up to full minutes but we already talked about Levert and then stress and for the Warriors the big question is what is going on with Andrew Wiggins Sunday Charlotte we talked about already over the next it's mostly Josh heartwatch you can also throw a manual quickly on that board if you like Wizards we talked about Nets can come down to health if Simmons is out versus Simmons is in oh Cam Johnson is back for Brooklyn tonight I forgot to mention that also so many damn things going on in the NBA it's easy to forget one or two here and there cam Johnson is back to night assume his minutes are going to be in the low 20s here as you works his way back up to Full Tilt I don't think you play him in a game's cap format in 22 ish or whatever minutes we think he's gonna get to head yeah you get him out of your eye else lot but that will be an interesting footnote because cam Thomas is out for a couple weeks now so like one guy goes down another guy comes up for Brooklyn we don't really know how the usage is all going to get split when this team's fully healthy but cam Johnson being back means that with Thomas being out it does feel like if he can get his minutes up he steps into a pretty darn good spot  so we'll see what that all means for Royce O'Neill and Dorian Finney Smith but it does feel like those guys are mostly filling in for Ben Simmons and respectively a Memphis I think we already talked about Memphis right Clippers you know Pacers you can hold your breath that these bench guys are gonna get full minutes all you want suppose we should talk a little bit about bennedict mathurin who's had two good games in a row that's gotten him up to 170 in nine category formats my fear with mathurin and he's had a couple big rebounding games as well is that  like  we can look at what he did last year  and hope that there's some measure of growth beyond that  last year Madden played 28 and a half minutes per ballgame average 17 points four rebounds a game point six steals he's had 20 rebounds in his last two ball game and yes he's played 38 and 36 minutes those are obscenely high numbers  I don't know that anybody can keep up that type of pace  but it also doesn't even really match with what we saw last year like he's playing 36 minutes a game you might be able to convince yourself he's gonna get about six rebounds a night that's something I could get behind maybe you get them up to about point eight point nine steals that's achievable number but again we're going to need like 30 five minutes a game which is asking a lot from a team that rolls hot hand the reason he got more minutes the last two games was because they're in was a hot hand these last two games so if you want to pick him up and get out in front of it and say well you know what maybe he's against the guy who's like getting his confidence going a little bit but also it's worth mentioning he's shooting the exact same percentage from the field so far this year that he did last season his free throw number is down but the percentage is almost exactly the same his threes are the same his rebounds are up a little bit a CIS or a little bit higher I don't know maybe that's something that's happening but there's not a lot to suggest that he's magically changed his stripes  so what we would need is 32 to 36 minutes a game and then you might be able to get on board with something so if you think that's gonna happen go for it I'm skeptical based on the way that rotations tend to go in Indiana  Philly you know again it's all about whether or not Anthony can hit a bucket but whatever Detroit who comes back for that Sunday game is something to keep in mind Chicago I just wanted Alex Caruso to play so damn bad  Kobe white said two or three decent ball games in a row I don't think that that's something that sticks season long he's more of a points League Play than a nine cat guy so that's okay Dallas we talked about Pals it's all Health Denver Reggie Jackson is what you're watching Houston the only real question I think is tari Eason and then Shen's ankle Miami we talked about Spurs there's really nothing to do in San Antonio it's nothing to do  Thunder Lou Dort sell High Phoenix maybe you get Booker back for Sunday I don't know I haven't heard anything  Minnesota we've talked about Warriors we talked about Portland uh Skylar Mays man is it Skyler May's time the answer is probably yes unless somebody comes back for that team on Sunday but if they don't that's a guy you probably want to get plugged in because Lakers aren't guarding anybody right now sky is always not like a big three-point chukar and get a ton of a defensive stats but he's gonna be playing point he's gonna be feeding guys if you're a point guard just feeding dudes it's pretty easy to just sort of blindly fall into six plots assists and he'll probably get some shots up because everybody's heard on that damn team  so yeah I'm into it  Skylanders time  some kind of unfortunate news on the injury front this morning as well Robert Williams has opted for season ending surgery he is hoping to be good to go for the beginning of next year but he is now likely a safe drop in all formats there isn't really an obvious pick up there it's going to be a few more minutes for DeAndre Aiden and then the Blazers will run small for stretches they'll  kind of piecemeal it together so that stinks if you had Robert Williams who was I want to say Trucking along but he was doing pretty much what you wanted which was around top 100 value in about 18 19 minutes of all game he is down and out and you can go find someone else um  I don't think that unfortunately we're over an hour I also have two play-by-play games to do later on today so we will not be doing questions from the chat room hopefully you guys had an opportunity to help each other over their apologies for starting late today and some light apparently technical difficulties in the middle of the show but it seems like we got through it and everybody had a lovely time now we can all cheers to a lovely weekend I am hoping by the way hoping and praying that I can actually do a show tomorrow I can't promise anything but if all the sort of stars aligned on the child care front maybe I can do a show tomorrow morning don't hold your breath but I do have some really fun ideas for next week one of them and this was one of our readers came up with this idea was to basically have like a Deal or No Deal kind of show Where I Come on talk about one player  a buy or a sell so take for example you know this week I had Keegan Murray as a Buy Low and I say  maybe that's the wrong way to do it what about a cell High let's say I have Kyle kuzma and I'm selling and you guys all in the chat room can throw names at me of guys that you would try to buy Kyle kuzma with and I'll spend 15 to 20 minutes just telling you why I would or would not make that trade so basically it's I may be let's make a deal as a better game show comparison but you guys will throw names at me and I'll tell you that whether or not I'm willing to give up a certain player for that and we work on player evaluation and understanding why things are going the way they are and I think that could be a lot of fun we'll also have some just general buys and sells shows I just I want to keep adding things where I can you guys liking and subscribing and all that stuff is giving us the ability to add more things to YouTube to the Pod feed and so I just kind of want to keep rolling into that so again hit me on Twitter on the way out at Dan best hit that thumbs up on the way out those of you that are watching on YouTube those on any format please do take a moment to subscribe and those on traditional pod channels please do drop a five-star review  if I don't talk to you over the weekend good luck have fun finish off game week three and we'll catch you on Monday which is already a two show day so long for now everyone
