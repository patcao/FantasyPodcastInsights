welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast it's another week guys third to the end of the NBA season  we have almost made it  had to head ligers you guys might be done right now so if you're still watching thanks  don't exactly know why  no recovery time that's what I say just keep watching the show forever  that's the way to do it right  I mean as a show host that's the way I would prefer you do it  but I don't  I'm fully aware that we're all human and at some point we probably all need a little bit of a break from fantasy basketball I just happened to be kind of a lunatic my break for fantasy basketball or the one that I feel like I wanted to take  is like right around  the end of the finals was like two weeks before free agency  that's my brains like I don't know what the hell we're going to talk about right now but that's still months away that's three months from now let's get through the regular season  then we'll have our lessons learned series we're going to look at how the big box sites did in their rankings because that'll actually teach us a lot about how to approach  the Yahoo draft board in particular I like to mostly talk Yahoo on this show we'll go through some of the teams team reviews that's all in there we don't break for the off-season hell no we go year-round here on fantasy NBA today  I don't know so last off season I stopped doing the shows live on video in the offseason mostly because the timing was weird and all because  people weren't watching them  they were listening  traditional pods are still getting listed but pokes stopped watching YouTube because I think I don't know algorithm things of that nature  I don't know why I'm talking about this stuff we had a lot of get through today I just figured I'd kind of say hello to you all I'm Dan best person it's fantasy NBA today you can follow me on social media at Dan Vespers d a n b e s b r i s this of course is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation Sports ethos.com  check out the baseball draft guide available now baseball season starts in three days last few days to get your draft guide before your Draft before your season starts on the baseball side do it now awesome content  between Joe's ranks and the draft tracker yeah I mean you're just destroying it  let's talk about some of the games my sign says are a mess so apologies in advance if you guys hear a sniffle or a sneeze or something on today's show can't possibly explain why my family's all healthy so all I can assume is that the fan that we have on in the bedroom blue a bug up my nose I don't know that's what I got  New Orleans took care of Detroit to no one's surprise Detroit is a very bad basketball team and they're even worse when they don't have their best player out there as far as the Pelicans go we were kind of watching the last couple of games just to see what they would be without Brandon Ingram and the answer is kind of the same  Trey Murphy had one of his oops games one for 12 shooting but he did have a steal in four blocks and basically that was the thing the expectation was with Ingram down you were gonna get more herb Jones and more trainer and that's really what you've gotten and then obviously a little bit more Zion and a little bit more McCollum the question on the Ingram absence was would this Force the Pelicans to go to Jonas Valentino's a tiny bit more and he had 5,020 minutes in this ball game but lately he's been horrible  and I I think I've talked about it a little bit on this show but honestly a couple days off I think we can pretty much just sort of Refresh on everything  I didn't draft Valentine's anywhere this year 0 places  any cash League any free leg I didn't have them because I figured that this was the alignment the Pelicans were gonna go to JV might start but he wasn't gonna play that much of Nance was healthy he'd be sort of the defensive switch everything guy they could go Zion Etc and then JV got off to a great start he played you know two and a half three really good months this year but he has completely vanished now  and so as someone who doesn't have Valentine Shooters it does make it a little bit harder for me to say oh well this is what I would do if I was you  but  that said that's what you guys are watching me to do so if I am you on JV  I tried to hang on a little bit longer basically until the end of time with him it's sort of most like an indefinite barely hang on I honestly don't know how bad he would need to be and for how long for me to say it's time to go because it feels like that time should be now he's been horrible for three weeks in a row I mean like Beyond startable 18 19 minutes of ball game just not even close I do think we got it we need to give him some kind of chance  here with Ingram out  an Ingram's out for a couple of weeks mind you  so my my vote on Valentine is hang on just a little bit longer but listen if you don't want to I don't blame you you can cut him loose again I didn't draft him anywhere so I don't care if you cut him loose not like it's gonna be in a front to me I didn't want to have them on my team to begin with  so now I'm trying to do the if I was in your shoes game and it's not as easy as it looks  probably doesn't look that easy  okay cuttingham no Ozark Thompson for the year of course and then no Simona Funke oh and yeah no Isaiah Stewart either so I it's all worth mentioning when you say the following she made me too had a really nice ball game 17 and 83 assists a steal a little block on good percentages he did have five fouls but who cares because he played 39 minutes  and I'm assuming we'll see that this level of production is going to buy him another go at it  Pistons aren't going to be competitive  basically ever  and frankly having Cade Cunningham in the lineup might help a guy like me too because then go get a shot for him to do it himself in this ball game and it's still went okay Pistons had 20 assists in the Ballgame not great  I'm not adding my two after this one but I could probably be convinced if we see him do it a couple of times  not to say that I think it's just gonna magically like happen every day and he's just gonna be great now but  this is a really nice sign  they don't have a power forward behind fontecchio and we don't know when he's coming back  now all of this goes out the window if Simone shows up again here in the next game or two and it's like oh Fenty is back all right we just and you go with him obviously but until that day we're looking for someone anyone at all to pick up some fantasy value on this team and they're basically hasn't been anybody  because in Malachi Flint at a decent game in 25 minutes as well but 25 minutes is not going to be you know sustainably enough time for him Jane Ivy is a points League guy although typically when Kate is out he does enough that you could start him in nine cat talking about ivy James Wiseman empty Double-Double guy with no Jalen Duren around you know if that's what you need I did pick him up in one League because I needed rebounds and field goal percent and I just pray he doesn't have to take that many free throws and I don't need blocks as much from my Center in that League it's a center where I broke or leg where I have booked Lopez so I have the blocks but I don't have the rebounds and the field goal percentage all right wise middle sort of pair up here nicely for however long Duran's out which again  what are they gonna do Rush him back  now there is these guys they're just I mean this is a mess  Royale mess with cheese mess Royale  keep an eye on me to again Wiseman points rebounds fuel goal percent streamer that's it  let's try to make a little Headway here we got a lot of teams to cover Philly Paul Reed had five defensive stats again and I can continue to have this weird sinking feeling about his overall game and yet he continues to put up really really nice defensive numbers more than anything else which we kind of knew he had in him was like on the year in 1926 Steals and a block and he thought all right well if those minutes go up by you know 50% and the Steals and blocks should as well but he's on a tear right now he's got seven steals four blocks in his last three ball games he's been able to cover up the fact that his other stuff is actually been weighed down over that stretch  and that's why I continue to have this this sort of sinking feeling with Paul Reed but as long as he continues to steal more than one a game and block more than one a game it almost doesn't matter what is other stuff is because he's a good percentage is Guy free throw is fine not great but fine feel goal percent is good and so if you get decent to good percentages a few rebounds and good defensive stats you don't really need that much else to hit value in nine cat  last two weeks he's number one hundred and thirteen in nine category League despite seven and seven is the number from appeal they actually hasn't shot the ball that well over that stretch so  I'm left with no choice but to say you can keep starting Paul Reed  I don't care that campaign had 23 points he got hot off the bench is Fantasy game is usually pretty whack Maxi to buy his Harris waking back up again Uber's been pretty good lately so you go those four Maxi Harris who Brave Paul Reed and I wouldn't extend it at all beyond that in Philly Clippers are in a weird nose dive these days that team has really complete they've totally falling apart remember when they were tied for the best record in the west they're five and a half games back of that now and that was only like three weeks ago some of that's because the other teams at the top of the West keep winning the Nuggets in particular they're winning they're like an 80% clip over that stretch  but the Clippers just look  lost right now and they got three weeks to sort it out before the playoffs start  strange I don't I don't fully understand it we're in a zubats my mini minor minor and mini I put together my knee Resurgence 13 to 10 four blocks he goes through these stretches where he blocks a few extra shots and it all sort of levels out he's a 100 to 150 range guy we call them the doesn't matter fan club doesn't really matter play if you need big man stats don't play him if you don't otherwise you're just going hard and Kawaii and PG on this team we move on  Cleveland got Evan Mobley back that's the good news the bad news is they lost this game by almost 40 points roof yowza  back-to-back time for Mobley we don't know if he's going to be playing in it it's against Charlotte so they should be able to take care of business and that one I would assume he plays in the other games this week but I guess we don't know and in terms of minutes cap we also don't really know about that they'll bring him along somewhat slowly because for his poorly as things have gone lately for the Cavaliers they are still the three seed in the Eastern Conference jammed up with a bunch of teams but pretty far ahead of falling back towards the play in which I think is the big fear for a lot of these clubs  likely they'll be fine too easy games in a row so they can kind of figure it out on the Fly  well we don't know from this ball game and the data we were hunting was  canceled Levert maintain some value even with Mobly back  this is again with Donovan Mitchell still out Max Drew still out one thing we can say is that with George and coming off the bench  and it's no longer guaranteed he's not even worth it three points stream anymore  it's really okay you starting Mobly obviously starting Jared Allen you starting Jerry's Garland what we don't really know is what you're doing with Charis Levert I'm inclined to believe that he can still be pretty sort of like Fringe level even with Mobley back  he started this game so they're doing the like Levert you get to start for Donovan Mitchell ordeal I suppose to bring him off as a sixth man type and I don't know if that's a great idea long term but it is what they're doing now so probably give Levert one more game to sort this thing out because this one was a really hard one to get a read on they scored 84 freaking points  he'd had no problem in this game they put up a buck 21 and it was blowout minutes real early so Delon Wright played 30 Thomas Bryant played 20 Heywood Highsmith 25  minutes are all over the map  what are you doing Butler Rozier out of bile the only three heat you're playing right now with Jimmy back all of the fringy guys pushed back farther by the way there was no jaquez healthy for this game either he was joined the infirmed no Duncan Robinson know Tyler hero blah blah blah blah blah if Duncan comes back  I probably play him because he likely takes Patty mills's spot in there and he was putting up pretty good numbers filling in for hero but we don't have an update on him yet today so we shuffle along  Josh giddey had a rare better game I don't care Shea had his worst game of the entire season in this one which ended a fantasy season for me that's sad  man that dude was good all year and then pooped himself in this one well they don't know we're in our fantasy playoffs do they I don't care about anything that happened on the Thunder side of this ball game I know Lou Dort left after 22 minutes but there really isn't anyone that fills in for the Thunder when someone goes down we've had these little Isaiah Joe sightings in the past kenrich Williams was okay case in Wallace has had a couple games where he scored a bit more  they traded for Gordon Hayward who I tried to warn them sucks but now they're bootable me anyway don't need to worry about it because nothing changes there but Milwaukee is notable only because they have a great off Day schedule this week they go Tuesday Thursday Saturday we've talked about this before we'll talk about it more on our streaming show later on today which I'm hoping I can go back to back with this one but you know we'll see how timing goes  obviously Giannis  Brooke Lopez khris Middleton Damian Lily those guys are all startable against the games cap  but you got a whole bunch of other guys you can play because of the  the fact that they go on the non overload days this week so Crowder if you wanted to go connaughton obviously Portis I don't think I'd go Pat Beverley unless someone was out but they're just like I know that these guys are not putting up big numbers poor this will be pretty good he's on a weird kick right now which you know how the sort of hot and cold goes with him but when you look at this week and you got that Tuesday Thursday Saturday thing  even you getting three bad games is better than the zeros you'd get from guys that you'd have to leave on your bench  let's keep going Golden State lost that Minnesota good ballgame though  fought tooth and nail in this one Warriors lost to a couple in a row they're now one game up on the red hot rockets for the last play in spot didn't see that coming  Steph obviously a play  kaminga and Klay Thompson are I think in on plays I'm gonna say yes to Chris Paul those minutes have been a little bit bouncy lately  and then you got a whole bunch of weird decisions like Andrew Wiggins yeah he got like 14 15 points but if you get anything else you don't really know so I'm kind of out on Wiggins Gary Payton had a better ball game here but no  random pajam ski is a no Trace Jackson Davis is the closest of all of them well Draymond Green is more of your sort of Punt points yes but generally he's kind of a doesn't matter level guy but probably leans towards a yes trayce Jackson Davis is an interesting one because he had five more defensive stats and everybody and like I get it has been a lot of really good stuff happening lately in 28 minutes is a huge number for him that's great news  but also he's shown himself to be  basically a full punt for free throw guy he's been awful at the foul line  and the bad news is he's getting there  so it was good as he's playing in rebounds and Steals and blocks and field goal percent most games he didn't have good field goal percent this one the free throws have been so bad that it's actually dragged him out of the top one hundred I think if you need big man stats you probably just have to go for it with Jackson Davis and pray you catch him on a weekend head-to-head if you only take you know four five free throws over the week  Rodeo you know if you have a little bit of wiggle room like if you have the best free throw percent in the league in and there's a gap or what honestly whatever if there's a little bit of a gap behind you in free throw percent that's a guy you could play with so like feel it out a little bit but that's the general  I think move for the Warriors right now  on the fantasy side I should say Nazarene oh baby 20 and 12 6 3 is a stealing a couple of blocks Mondo game from Nars slow mo is a little better here 10 6 and 5 to steals in a block I mean this is basically what you want if you played him the 26 minutes are probably not enough long-term but he has a little bit more involved now with Karl Anthony towns out then obviously then he was before that I still am  skeptical of Anderson as an everyday type of guy  the steals the blocks the boards the assists that's gonna keep him pretty close even if the other stuff isn't as great  and you know getting the nice numbers on those lately has definitely made him a play over the last week  they've all they've gone through a stretch work go bare missed a couple of ball games in there so slow mo had a little bit of a bump in  time on the floor and I think that's probably what it comes down to if he's playing 26 minutes I don't think I'm starting him in All formats if he's at 28 I probably am which is funny I know it'll be that close to it so probably slo-mo ends up in kind of that that no man's land again you know 100 ish range 100 to 1:30 something like that and where if you need some boards some assists out of a forward spot steals out of a forward spot field goal percent but probably not as much free throw we're at this part of the Year where Specialists appeal is is actually a really big deal so let me say oh you know he's gonna be 115 you can't play no that wouldn't be accurate because if he provides stats you need this is the time to just go and do it  all these fringy guys it doesn't they're ranked no longer really matters we're at that part of the year  there's been a little bit of a push this season I think to argue that no rank matters at all which I don't fully agree with I mean you know the guy ranked 40th is better than the guy ranked 80th but where that statement Rings true is in this range  guys that are and we call him the doesn't matter group on this podcast the guys that are between 100 and 140 or something like that where they're all separated by like one slightly better again you know the guy who's ranked 140th if if his 30th game this year was a big one and of a small one he probably ranked 115th that's how close they are in their  so for me to point at the 115th ranked guy and say oh well look 115 ranck you can't start him know that right now would be totally inaccurate  earlier in the year I think you could probably get away with that type of if you know if I had said something like that on the podcast so well you know what like long term we've played them every day he's not really helping your fantasy team  but right now who cares what his rank is over the entire season if the guy is going to give you pluses in stats you're hunting then that guy becomes a play  Indiana and the Lakers combined to put up 295 points in regulation Not only was the score ridiculous but the Pacers went into a foul mode like college ball like with 85 seconds left in the Ballgame Lakers hit something like I don't know eight out of 10 free throws down the stretch and Indie hit three or four three-pointers during that last minute and a half so again that was all ready probably gonna be at about 275 to 280 points jumped another 15  and everybody had some fun this is an everybody has fun kind of game and her heart was actually decent here don't pick him up  interestingly Tyreese Halliburton had one of the worst games on either side Aaron me Smith was playable here but we've downgraded him from a very soft hole to a schedule plate now the hardest schedule guy also Doug McDermott probably doesn't even make it to schedule a level teaching McConnell is a play in all formats he's still just rolling man he played 18 total minutes in this game but he went absolutely Buckwild in them 15 shots in 18 minutes he also had seven assists at a steel  he's cooking these days  and then on the Lakers side there was no D'Angelo Russell but Spencer Dinwiddie has really settled in nicely over the last three or four games for La mostly because of his defense defense has been really good  this game the offense woke up got to the free-throw line  was driving hitting some threes  all that to say  it won't matter when D'Angelo Russell comes back because this isn't dinwiddie's job to score 26 points every game it was his job and this one to be more aggressive on offense because they needed him to be because D'Angelo Russell was out but deal was out with an illness so you know by all accounts he'll probably be back for the Lakers next game which is in Milwaukee tomorrow  if he's not do I think Dinwiddie scores 26 again probably not but he is playing with confidence right now and he probably gets stuck on Dame in that game as well so he's gonna be laser focused just something to keep in mind for tomorrow watch the injury report  I don't generally like dinwiddie's Fantasy game but he's gonna have to be efficient with this Lakers team his job is not going to be to Chuck it's going to be to take the open shots and that actually probably helps him more than it hurts it well we managed to get through 12 teams and were 20 some odd minutes into the podcast so not exactly making the world's greatest time as we turn the clock back to Saturday I want to remind everybody that is

three years in a row they've been a partner here on the podcast and we are extraordinarily extraordinarily grateful to them  for that  Saturday as we go backwards through the weekend Brooklyn sucks cam Johnson was playing well he's out with a toe injury  out of the blue  what a pain in my neck  I will say that with Cam Johnson out Schroeder probably is playable again he's very much on the wrong side of the doesn't matter group mostly because of Camp Thomas honestly that that is a well for the Nets they don't have anything going well but cam Thomas has a bit of a usage vacuum on that team  and when he's out everybody gets a big bump when cam Johnson is out everybody only gets a little tiny bump but for sure that probably gets him up to that kind of like all right well if you need some points some assists  that probably works  otherwise  unless I hear something else I'm not doing anything else how long before the net start giving other guys days off Michael Bridge Is Never Gonna want one but you know what if Nick klaxon rests for a day  should we be ready with their on Sharp are they going small with Dorian Finney Smith at Center  there might be some Silly Season things happening in Brooklyn here soon  but not quite yet Dennis Smith Jr Kate's job all the listed out for tonight already who cares  the next I say a heart and shine back up to 26 minutes we still don't know if Mitchell Robinson is showing up he's been practicing so we assume it's relatively soon  but we heard about that like four days ago and we still haven't seen him  you know so hard and Stein with the minutes cap lifted up a little bit not lifted all the way I should say raise up is a big time play  big big winner here hardenstein finally good Lord at 22 minute 23 minute limit those like a month and change  oh my Lord was that rough miles McBride is your filling for ogn and Nobby played all 48 minutes in this ballgame ridiculous  totally ridiculous but if anybody's playing 48 minutes in the NBA they should be in a fantasy lineup that's just sort of the rule  even Tony Snell could put up numbers in 48 minutes  precious chew it to no one's surprise is a drop  Sacramento at New Orleans or sorry or Lando oral whoops Kiana Ellis 195 and 6 two steals a block and four three-pointers this is what we were talking about  when I said hey he's gonna get you defensive stats basically every single ball game the upside is what if he takes a couple extra actual shots from the field  Keon Ellis over the last week is averaging 6.3 field goal attempts per ball game and he's number 42 over that stretch over the last two weeks he's averaging 5.9 field goal attempts a game we're talking about six shots a night he's number 39  because he's averaging three and a half defensive stats and almost two three pointers a game and this Baymont this contest obviously helped for 3-pointers got some board some assists some points in it sort of lifted everything up but good Lord this is what we were talking about with that upside  frankly Malik monk was awful in this game frankly the kings are better with Alice playing instead of Kevin herder  I don't think there's any question  that someone getting hurt on this team was maybe the best thing that could have happened for the Kings  they're still in perfect I mean who isn't in the NBA but he's made them so much better  Keon Ellis was a plus eighteen  Keegan Murray was a plus 20 in the game they won by two  bench unit for the king's was absolutely atrocious  what do you do with Malik monk oh you probably have to hang on he's been pretty good out of this ball game he went on Twitter to say I couldn't throw a stone in the ocean but at least we won like the beam you know  good team type of tweet but geez oh for 11 that's a weak killer right there  anyway I love this this lineup for the Kings you have  four starters that you can start in fantasy and then monk Off the Bench  Harrison Barnes is back to being terrible as we kind of knew he would  Kevin herding take your time buddy take your time Jonathan Isaac on the other side 25 points and 23 minutes we talked about him on the podcast last week as someone I was like yeah I know you can't really use him in head-to-head because he could just get a day off at any point and you wouldn't even know it was coming but  look at what he could do  what he's in there  we're talking about a month now we're John and I think it's been inside the top 100 and 16 minutes of ball game I mean this is this is the magic of Jonathan Isaac  he's top 30  the last two weeks in 17 minutes these an obvious Roto play  any Roto League you're in he's a play I get it Head to Head its tough and Orlando has a terrible schedule this week they're often till Wednesday and then they play Wednesday Friday which the overload days you might not get to use him anyway but you know maybe Saturday could make an argument for him tobacco back probably gonna skip one of them or get  depressed minutes in one of them either way  he lives  Charlotte continues to be very bad at basketball  Lexi poker chefski had nine five and four he's a watch list guy nothing more than that Nick Richards your low-end Center Trey man you're shooting guard who can rebound a little bit but with big fantasy holes Bridges as ago mitts is a go with Cody Martin out he's got his problems too though  Brandon Miller's ago nobody else is a go that's it  for land of this game was over early so Garrison Mathews at 20 points Off the Bench Bruno Fernando at 25 Off the Bench that stuff isn't gonna happen in a competitive basketball game for Atlanta you're not adjusting what you're doing against the games Capri playing John Mayer Murray you're playing Clint capela you're playing Bogdan bogdanovich  you're  hoping that Jalen Johnson can get back by the end of this week and you're probably playing DeAndre Hunter although again when he cools off from two which it I think is what we've seen happen here over the last two or three ball games his value can tank a bit so if you want to bench in my okay with that head-to-head wise Atlanta has one of the best schedules this week that's why I bring them up they play today which is kind of like a coin flip to be an overload day more like 4060  likely to have an open spotty with how many guys are getting ruled out right now  but then they also go  Wednesday Thursday Saturday so they play one overload day on Wednesday but Thursday Saturday or a couple of really nice light ones mixed in there so lineup for game week and only one of them is on and overload that's pretty good  which brings into the equation guys like Veet crunchy Fernando maybe I'm Garrison Mathews that's a tough one to push on you guys Fernando would be the safest of those guys because he's actually playing a Center Spot unless we hear from on yuccoides  at least the game this week maybe more  kind of makes that one tougher but Atlanta with a good schedule just something to think about and we'll talk more about that on our streaming show  Toronto nice competitive basketball game I don't care that they lost but this just meant that the regulars actually got to play over 30 minutes and we're sort of not great but fine enough Gary Trent 31 points took him 26 shots to get there but 31 points nothing to laugh at Kelly Olynyk double-double 146 and 10 two steals in a block that's what you want out of him uh and then you got a whole lot of maybes gradey dick know for me against the games cap abaji clothes he missed all three of his free throws in this game are actually would have been a pretty good ball game for ochai  I think I lean I mean he's basically a coin flip if you're starting a bhaji you're going for steals basically Bruce Brown all so kind of a maybe I think both those guys frankly all three I just mentioned dick abaji and brown probably all fall into the who cares  doesn't matter whatever you want to call that group and probably towards the back end of it more towards 150 than 100  but they each have a little bit of a specialist appeal gradey dick points in Three's A bhaji a few boards and some steals Bruce Brown boards and assists basically  none of them good enough at enough things to be a start start but all three just kind of good enough to be specialist ish  Toronto schedule sucks this week so they're least there's that  for Washington kuzma ruled out for the next ball game we know that already what I don't know is what they're doing with the center spot because we're Sean Holmes got another 28 minutes here Marvin bagley's back now I would assume that's slides towards a timeshare as Bagley gets his legs underneath them which you probably end up being kind of bad for both guys but until that time you can start pool Holmes probably kiss bird again with kuzma because it's just a lot of shots left over  again I have no idea why kids were can hit a free throw anymore which like when kuzma's in  pretty much makes it so you can't play Corey because like 10 11 12 shots probably isn't enough if he's bad at the foul line  but with kuzma out I have to assume that those shots go up to 13 14 range or at least reliably 12 and so that's probably enough for Corey and then any obvious set to do a lot of stuff and you just have to hope that is efficiency doesn't tank your team  last time kuzma was out just in Champaign was actually kind of okay but I'm not gonna take that plunge that's too risky  this was the second half of a back-to-back for the Celtics and so half of their guys were resting they do not have a back-to-back this week or next week so I presume anyone who's healthy will be playing  but we don't actually know who's healthy for the Celtic sounds like Drew holiday is actually hurt he's missed what three four games in a row now Derek white is questionable for the next one with the right handspring they're going to be going very easy on their dudes and for that reason Payton Pritchard is a guy you can just keep on using same houses a little bit more questionable because if you have a Tatum and brown both in which I'm assume they are  I don't know that like a Derek white if Derek white is out and Drew holiday is out I don't know that that's enough for Hauser  places not gonna shoot eight for nine every ballgame he's been  good Lord he's been hot in a couple of games lately but you'll have poor Singas back  you'll have Horford in he was in for this ball game but that'll push everybody down a Peg and so then it's like all right well one of these guys gets to start is it Howser or is it Pritchard it's probably Pritchard all the he didn't start in this ball game so you know what the hell do I know but if both of their starting backcourt guys are out it feels like they probably would want to point guard  I guess we'll have to wait and find out  it's possible that both of them end up being  useful Pritchard and Houser  but you kind of need to wait on the the say the weather report the injury report before doing anything with it  Chicago's got their main guys back which makes them very easy to handicap tomorrow carusoe  white vooch stardom keep going Phoenix has their main guys in also very easy to handicap Durant Booker nerc Beal Allen stardom keep moving  that was nice we made some Headway there didn't we  Spurs Wendy is questionable  and there's no reason to push him if he's not 100% healthy so I'm gonna assume that Wendy's gonna miss a ball game which means you probably get a one game Zach Collins stream coming up here possibly later on today against the Suns and a rematch  we'll see I guess you can't do anything right now until you we know for sure but when he's out everybody gets a big bump in what they get to do  so you'll probably I mean Trey Jones has a bit of start lately anyway but you might get enough out of a guy like held in Johnson to make him kind of move up near the top 100  vessels ago Zach Collins would be a go and that spot and then Sohan would be a like his game regardless  we had a little kerfuffle  and Houston Utah Kris Dunn and Jabari Smith Jr got suspended for it  for Utah John Collins is a start Collin Sexton is a star Walker Kessler is a start if Larry marketing manages to get his butt back in there he would also be a start and that's as far as I go against the games cap because right now can't they George is so inefficient that he's hurting far more than he's helping now that could definitely change over the next couple of ball games but this is what I was talking about at the All-Star break when everybody was like okay George he's gonna win you a league and I was like well  not so fast points in his sister nice and the free throw percent is nice but no steals no blocks not that many threes and a horrible field goal percent and very high turnovers we're talking about  young guard itis  it's the same for all of these guys  I'm not dropping him though just for whatever that's worth I'm not dropping keonte is sort of too much upside when he gets hot but I don't know how you started to get the game's cap right now  and then with Houston I you know am I gonna start Jeff Green in their next ball game when he and jock landale or battling for sentiments I am not  I am not  Jalen green on the other hand man is this kid turned it up in March crazy he's just a totally different human being this month  you guys know I don't typically start guys when they're on a heater I think this heater might be such a hot hot heater at that I have to change my my take on that so go ahead you know why the hell not Freddie Van Vleet Jalen green  when he gets back Jabari Smith Jr although with Jabari out I wonder if Dillon Brooks takes enough shots to be fantasy relevant for one day two days no one day  done was two games Jabari was one I can remember this  Denver they didn't send a bunch of their starters to Portland uh no yokich know Jamal Murray which meant DeAndre Jordan started played 20 minutes I mean he's he was fine but  not caring about that very much if this happens again the obvious choice to fill in his Reggie Jackson because he's gonna get a bunch of shots and that's kind of what you're looking for and then you know the other regulars are going to be asked to do more but from a fantasy standpoint  you know first of all the Nuggets won this ball game anyway and then if you're looking at like oh when did they gonna have a difficult  travel like it wasn't that difficult of a travel game they had a day off in between there's like whatever the Blazers they got they got nobody healthy  thinking about where the Nuggets might go or do they have a road game maybe the game in Utah you might see that or like the last  two games of the regular season Spurs and Grizzlies but you know they're so close now to getting the one seed in the Western Conference they're half game up on the Thunder they are the one maybe they just kind of go for it  doesn't matter  for Portland  everybody was out know Simon's know eating although she didn't sharp just got assigned to the g-league so he's now approaching return in some capacity know Jeremy Grant know Malcolm Brogden they're down all of their established guys  which means you've got a whole bunch of Silly Season crap to sift through on this team  from a head-to-head standpoint I'll Portland schedule gets not good basically after today they played today and then they only have two more games this weekend in their on the overload days so for head to headers if you have a Blazer all ready you hold him through today but then you probably Abandon Ship tomorrow for to leaders that are trying to figure out who to use against a games cap  I can say with full confidence that I have no bleeping idea  because in this ball game to money tomorrow played 39 minutes the previous one he played like 19 I mean like there's no consistency at all come out was very good in this one points boards assist steals blocks three's good percentages do up reath had a nice ball game here but we've seen him completely vanish out of that Center Spot recently Dubai Walker 15 and 9 we didn't do much besides score and board scoot at 22 and 6 he's gonna get a lot of usage while everybody's out so maybe the answer is go ahead with Scoot and pray he doesn't shoot two for 19  Delano band is kind of the same story just pray he doesn't shoot too for 19 which is pretty damn close to what he did in this ball game  but that's the issue though like you could look at a team and you say oh well you said value right well you know I mean oftentimes yes  but for this Portland team a lot of these guys are simply so bad at Fantasy Basketball from just like an efficiency standpoint that  you don't want to risk blowing up a percentage or your turnovers on the road oh side there's a huge risk there that in my opinion how ways most of the benefits  I don't know maybe I'm it's possible that some of these guys come back I don't have any signs his questionable then I might play  eight and my play  he's got a good show back up again  so I wouldn't invest too much time or resources into figuring out who to play for the Blazers for your fantasy team again for one on the head side this schedule sucks but for Roto a lot of these guys do more harm than good  typically now if somebody like if Kamara starts playing 36 to 39 minutes of ballgame I think I probably would change my tune because this Fantasy game is not that awful at least compared to some of these other guys do a breath also has a little bit of fantasy potential built in there  I don't and Scoot yeah I mean you know the outlines are there  but there's so much downside with these dudes that I just  I can't get over that hump  all right let's play the old game who didn't play over the weekend Dallas didn't play over the weekend Memphis didn't play over the weekend  and that is  it Dallas and Memphis Dallas didn't even play on Friday so we don't even have to talk about them Memphis did play on Friday so let's get to the Memphis box score here so everybody can see what's up  I mean okay  we got our answer who is going to play against another a fellow tanky team Desmond Bane stat this one out JJJ sat it in he played Santi aldama is just rolling right now so he's a play I again I thought this was gonna happen weeks ago but it's happening now so you know finally I guess John conchar played good minutes but he's now doubtful for the next ball game with some heel soreness Desmond Bane is questionable with a back injury Vince Williams who was supposed to be one of the really good ones here he's still dealing with some tendonitis  Jake Lara is sick  oh what the hell we're back to this again  uh Memphis they played today they played Wednesday they play Saturday so a little bit of a clunky schedule on the head-to-head side for Roto aldama JJ those guys are goes right now  oh Luke Kennard is still out for personal reasons we don't know when the hell he's showing up either I don't know how you go beyond those dudes  Alma and Jerry Jackson  GG Jackson is going to have a ton of usage but look what happened in this ball game  included still at 14 and 8 people can be like look 14 and 8 but brutal shooting brutal free throws High turnovers and no defensive stats that's rough when it doesn't when it isn't going in but if every I mean  I don't know how you make a call on these teams in advance because two three guys could swing either way on the injury report  if Bain is in  I pick up these other guys that are trying to take shots on poor percentages maybe you consider it if he's not  it's too risky too rich for my blood  all right what time is it now about 10:15 a.m. Pacific all right let's see if we can get the streaming show going in the next 15 minutes I'm gonna try to go back to back today and so that means we'll wrap this one up anybody got any questions let me let's do a quick chat room check see if anybody has any questions that are not streaming related  that's a streaming question  is Luke kornet being slept on and a game's cap format that is a very good question he's been pretty good  but a lot of the reason why is that Boston's had these back-to-backs they were you know they were on a five and seven stretch where you knew they were gonna go real light on their guys now I'm assuming that if kristap porzingis is healthy he and Horford should play in each of their three games this week which really doesn't leave much room for cornet and by the way one of the other reasons there with the Jalen Brown and Jason Tatum alternating days off that opened up some more time in the front court so you know Horford was in they could go too big men or poor singers in they could go too big men  with Tatum Brown Horford porzingis all healthy they're just very not much room for cornet now if we get to the volume we find out some of those guys are getting ruled out that does change things in my eye  and then every other question here is on the streaming stuff so guys wait around while our streaming show coming up here in the next couple of minutes I do need to set that up and get this
