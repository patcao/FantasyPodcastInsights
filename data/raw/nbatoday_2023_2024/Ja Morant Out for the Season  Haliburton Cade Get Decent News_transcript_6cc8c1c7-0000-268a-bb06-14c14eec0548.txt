welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  well I feel like I've got a little bit more pep in my step today and it's not really a great day to have more pep in your step because  whew the injury news was bad yesterday  real bad  John Morant out for the season  absolutely crushing crushing blow to a Grizzly's team that waited out his 25 games suspension got nine games out of job they were certainly a lot better with him on the court  and now our back to not having him for the rest of the year  we  got reasonably okay news on Cade Cunningham and then Tyreese Halliburton got hurt during yesterday's ballgame we got  kind of okay news on Halliburton this morning as well so I don't want to say it's all doom and gloom  but certainly starts with Doom and Gloom damn it so this is brutal in a lot of ways and you know I said I try to do a better job of talking about the news of the day at the beginning of the show and when there's big news like this you kind of have to do it right out of the Chute Grizzlies are 13 and 23 they're a they've been above 500 since jaw came back but as you may recall prior to his return they were something like  like three and 13 no that's not right let's see their 36 games into the season right now they were whats like seven and 19 or something like that  that's one too many games think they're like six and nineteen or seven and 18 or something like that  that's a team that's not getting all that close to making a play in or playoff run  yeah I don't know that the Grizzlies were gonna get back into it they're four and a half games out of a playoff spot and they had multiple teams separating them from a play in spot but they had hope  and hope was going to be good enough to carry them to the end  without hope it sounds Bleak I'm talking about fantasy basketball still in reality I mean this is reality for jaw but  without being too hyperbolic here  this potentially could change who the Grizzlies do and do not play down the stretch  yet another reason why your head to head leaks should end at least three weeks early  or just switch to games cappotto and then you get what you get as we say to the kids you get what you get and you don't get upset  is there some sort of add in the wake of the genre injury  not really Marcus Smart was largely rostered at this point he's someone we've talked about and I thought with Joe around I wasn't sure he was gonna be a top 100 guy he wasn't a top 100 guy at the beginning of the year but now we really have no choice but to see kind of how the Marcus Smart thing develops over the next couple of weeks what is his actual role going to be on this team because it'll be more than that now than it would have been if John was around the rest of the season  and then other stuff we saw was you know other guys surfacing for a game or two here and there Vince Williams was an example from there this last ball game we saw Santi aldama play better for stretches guys that get hot and then they get to do a little bit more but some of that happened when both jot and Marcus Smart where out at the same time shifting our attention over to Detroit and I wanted to go through these two teams because they didn't play yesterday this news came out on non-game days Cade Cunningham was ruled out for only  7 to 10 days  with a reevaluation at the end of that so it's possible that ends up being a little bit longer but still I think everybody was worried that this was going to be like a three four week thing it might not be that long  I also don't want to spend much time on the Cade Cunningham thing because I don't think that there's an obvious pickup  for Detroit  with him going down for a week and a half you know this could be more for Jayden Ivy we've seen Alex doing more lately  all these guys are fringy schedule play type of dudes  and again if we're talking about you know  what if it turns out to be two and a half weeks or something like that for Cade  this is not a bend over backwards try to get out in front of it kind of thing  especially not with anybody being a guaranteed replacement value guy the team that I do want to spend some time on is the Indiana Pacers but they did play yesterday  so  instead of jumping straight into the Halliburton news  which I mean obviously you're picking up TJ McConnell but we want to talk more about it a little bit more in depth  welcome to the show finally this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation I'm your host Dan Vasquez I am  like 80 to 90% recovered from this thing that's been going around my older kid poor son of a gun he's two rooms over right now he's doing some solo play thank you might be playing a video game on his way young younger dude finally went to school today  he missed  let's see Wednesday Thursday Friday and Monday of this week with it plus over the weekend  I mean it's been  what inhalation stretch it's been here in the best household because they had like  like a slightly stuffy nose and low grade fever  right after Christmas  my little one had it like Christmas Day and the day after in the big one caught it and he had it for three days then we went to Yosemite for four days came back and had one God forsaken healthy day actually was New Year's Day we traveled we came back from Yosemite that day we came home on New Year's Day  and then on the second my older one started  mm-hmm violently and then the little one got the next day and  anyway  uh I got it on Saturday  so I don't know I guess I'm lucky that back on my feet here by Tuesday  good gravy anyway you can find me over on social at Danvers I'm doing something slightly different today all so I am simulcasting the show  I don't know if it's gonna change anything but this episode is available on Twitter all so  if it doesn't do anything then I'm not gonna bother doing it going forward but I don't know figure it can't hurt I have no idea what x prioritizes in now like do people sign on and they see oh Dan is live broadcasting right now  Tis the answer to the age-old question what do you get when you cross an elephant and a rhino elephant I know  which also reminds me of that joke that they told in the original Hot Shots you guys remember this movie Valeria golino I think was the actress getting that right  and she says something like what do you do to an elephant with three balls and topper Harley played by the great Charlie Sheen says I don't know and she says you walk him and Pitch to the rhino  I love that movie  all right let's get into what happened yesterday uh Boston Indy was the first game so we can basically just jump straight into the the big story of the day which was that Tyreese Halliburton went down it looked bad he got carried off the court by teammates because he didn't want to put any pressure on a hamstring I think it was a slip actually  and  it looked like we were looking at months  so you know depending on how you said expectations  the morning news on Halliburton turns out to be pretty good  the MRI revealed a great one strain which is the lowest possible strain you can have of your hamstring he will be reevaluated in two weeks my guess is that he's not ready to go at exactly that moment but the simple fact that this wasn't like a he's out a month plus let's you know piecemeal this crap together  is I think a huge win  in what was otherwise a really bad situation so if he's being rally we evaluated in two weeks shame of this course is that the Pacers are in the middle of a pretty good schedule extra they had four games this week four games next week for games week after that four games a week after that before they finally have a three gamer so  games missed right now are going to be  sure to come and faster and more Fury yes  family is everything as those movies taught us  so you're looking at at least seven games out for Halliburton  biology probably misses another week after that so you're looking at like 11 games I think that's actually what basketball monster has on their board right now and that's why that's how they got to that number because two weeks is seven three weeks is 11 if he is back after 11 ball games you just sort of like chalk it up to  unpleasantness call it a win and move on this is this is a deal for fantasy teams for reality too because I have the Pacers as one of my biggest over plays of the Season at season win totals  and they're gonna have to work their butts off to tread water right now  they beat Boston  the only saving grace here for Indy is that they've got the Wizards next which they should be able to win without Halliburton they've got the Hawks after that which is winnable not easy then they're in altitude twice those are going to be tough ones they got Sacramento Portland that's a winnable ball game Phoenix in Denver those are tough Philly Phoenix again Memphis without jaw I mean  if you look at these 11 ball games I think if you're the Pacers you're you're looking at and you're going if we can go four and seven and get Halliburton back  and we'll be 25 and 22 will still be in the thick of things that wouldn't end us so that's probably the way that they're looking at this next little stretch ball game  from a standpoint there's all kinds of stuff that this could actually mean for Indiana the one big one is that TJ McConnell needs to be added everywhere as fast as humanly possible large Fab budgets were blown on TJ last night and some people were like ah you blew you have your Fab budget for a guy that's only gonna give you a month's worth ball games  honestly I don't mind because when McConnell is the lead horse at point guard and don't don't don't talk to me about Andrew Neymar being the lead horse at point guard we know how this is gonna shake out regardless of who starts the fantasy guy here is McConnell  TJ McConnell playing full starters minutes is a top 50 fantasy play and you shell out for a guy like that when you know you're getting in my opinion at least 10 ball games out of them that's a big big thing  yes bigger and Rodeo then head to head  I get it because with Roto you bank it  you get 10 games out of a guy who was like a fourth round value over the next three weeks maybe more again I don't know I don't know that Halliburton is going to just drop back in and play 35 minutes in his first game back so like what if you get 15 games out of McConnell what have you actually get a full month  of fourth round value out of a pickup that's worth spending on in Roto that's a big like positive Dent kind of guy  and I don't think you need me to go through like oh you know what is TJ McConnell done over the years to make you think that this is something that's going to happen it's  uh  I mean it we have many seasons of evidence that this is an easy one  in fact I think you can even just go to a game early this year did Halliburton miss one or two games earlier this season  McConnell played like 26 or 28 minutes and one of those games  he had a 28 minute game at first third game of the year I think Albert might have even been in for that ball game yeah 18 points 7 boards five assists in a steal on 8 out of 13 shooting  play 25 minutes on December 2nd at 20 points and 11 assists 26 minutes on December 16th 9 points 5 boards 9 assists in a steal  done it the three ball if you want to three pointers you've come to the wrong place but look he played 25 minutes yesterday and Albert and played the first quarter and a half and still had 12 four and seven with two steals  he's a high steals High assists decent rebounding point guard who shoots a high field goal percent and the only thing you miss from a typical guard is the three-pointer  is big men hit threes now I don't need my point guard to hit a bunch of Threes if he's doing all those other things for me  so yes immediate TJ McConnell add  spend if you gotta  smoke if you got him  but I don't think he's the only story here  because sure TJ McConnell is gonna step in and he's gonna have the Lions share of point guard minutes again  you know Andrew he's gonna play more but all he does is get points in assists that's not enough you need other stuff to be a nine cat guy  I believe that Halliburton going down negatively impacts the guys that rely on his ability to get them open  Myles Turner probably a guy who is negatively impacted  by this  I would venture to guess the Jalen Smith is negatively impacted by this Obi topping is likely negatively impacted  by Tyrese Halliburton being out  but there are also likely guys that are positively impacted by Halliburton being out because of an increase in usage typically guys that maybe wouldn't have the ball in their hand quite as much that are now going to be relied upon to go create a little bit more you know McConnell's gonna come in and play minutes but he's not going to do as much as Halliburton did  so Aaron Nesmith gonna have to do more bennedict mathurin gonna have to do more  buddy hield probably gonna have to do more I don't know about creating off the dribble remember when Sacramento asked him to do that and it was not pretty  but he might have to do it even if it doesn't make a whole lot of sense he might have to do it Bruce Brown might have to do it  so  I don't know that there's gonna be a big like starting lineup flip Peru where you probably just get McConnell or an M hard in for Halliburton  and then TJ ends up playing more minutes than them hard no matter how they shake that out  but does this also mean that buddy hield is going to get more shots because that's the guy you need to get more shots to get him back to Value he did yesterday  also got a steal in two blocks does this mean that bennedict mathurin has a three week stretch where he's startled  even outside of points League's I don't know  I kind of feel like I need to see what he'd and matheran in particular look like in the Pacers next ball game before I'm like yeah go do this  if you're in a roto situation you could pick up those guys and just leave them on your bench for a game if you're in a head-to-head I don't know that I would spend a roster move on them in a lot of formats healed is probably still on rosters because he didn't really have enough time to stink  after moving to the bench before this injury went down if you're in a really competitive hyper-aggressive league he probably got dropped because he was bad like straight up bad for three games in a row he had lost his job to Aaron Nesmith  didn't look like anything was going the other direction and then bam oh Halliburton goes down he does a better ball game  so sure I mean like they got three more games left this week you wouldn't move them you wouldn't make the move today but starting tomorrow then they go four and six days so  okay you can take a shot on it there on the head to head side and again for Roto you can make the move early because presumably you're in a game's cap  okay that's basically the injury news for 18 minutes into a show and we haven't really gotten anything that happened truly happened on the box course outside of this one thing  Celtics are as predictable as they come Jayson Tatum was resting his ankle so Al Horford got the start and I'll holler for when he starts is a fantasy play he was fine he wasn't great but anytime Al's gonna get 30 minutes you put them into your lineup  easy peasy lemon squeezy let's go to the next game on the board  I have no fantasy Deltas to discuss from Thunder Wizards none  everything stayed exactly as it was in my mind  for those of you and this is one of the problems with doing a daily podcast is you started settle into this routine of like  assuming everybody's been watching and listening to your show for many years it's a bad habit so for those that are watching or listening today for the very first time here's how I feel about everybody on both of these two teams and why nothing changes for me in their eyes Shay awesome Chet awesome Jalen Williams was a Buy Low about five weeks ago that bad boy is cashed in  nobody else is a nine cat guy on Oklahoma City and I know what you're saying you're gonna be like Dan what about debt no not Josh Getty either points fine cat leaks nah  Wizards all they got to do is not get blown out and tyus Jones is great Daniel Gafford is great and Kyle kuzma is fine  he had a 22 and 15 game and all the best I can do is call him fine because he didn't really do anything else no threes no steals no blocks that field goal percent sorry I know it's feels like I'm picking on Kyle kuzma maybe I am he'd make a lot of teams better but he's also number 140 in nine cat  that's not going anywhere because his percentages turnovers and defensive stats aren't fixing themselves  and then Jordan Poole is absolutely atrocious he's number 182  and every time it looks like he's making even the tiniest bit of Headway  he falls back but  he can't really drop him  can you  any of the is a stream wild warm guy he was great the first three weeks of the Season he was then bad for five weeks and now he's been good for two weeks again so play him when he's good drop him money he's bad  seems like actually he's streaking enough for you can sort of like game out the streakiness  it's not one game here one game there it's you know gets good for a few weeks gets bad for a few weeks  we haven't talked about Bilal believe in a while which honestly kind of makes me happy because there was a stretch there where the Wizards were getting blown out every day and I had to keep deflecting all of these Dan is it time to pick up Bilal and I was like no  it's not he's only getting minutes because these are blowouts and his Fantasy game isn't there yet and luckily the Wizards although lately they got blown out I think like  three of the last four or something like that but prior to that they had been competitive for like five out of six ball games and finally people stopped asking about equivalently so let's keep going that game was not all that interesting for Fantasy purposes Chicago beats Charlotte took over time to get there I mean we're talking zombie Hornets right now  Chicago is getting their bodies back and I don't know that it's helping  certainly Alex Caruso always helps Caruso a plus 17 in this ball game  good God there is I feel like everybody in the NBA is just wishing they could Pride that dude  out of Chicago Lakers letting him walk was the dumbest I mean that was the dumbest roster decision  anyway Andre Drummond sled 21 and 15 in an unexpected Mega burst vouch played 30 minutes Drummond's minutes will continue to dial back as virtual likely I would think moves into the starting lineup in his next ball game  was this Andre's Last Stand probably  I know Caruso's game wasn't all that great here from a fantasy standpoint but he's gonna play a bunch anytime he's healthy so go ahead and start him to Rosen is up into the low 40s in nine cat remember when he was in the late 60s and I was like this is the easiest bible I've ever seen and some of you were like no he's too old no  nope all doesn't make your free throw stroke go away  a lot of these guys get better at free throw shooting as they get older because they're like well I lost everything else I better make my foul shots  exactly and played 36 minutes only took nine shots usage has not come back for Zach lately he's also playing through what we hear is a sore shoulder  that's a weird situation but he's getting the playing time  overarching thoughts  with the team basically healthy right now the guys that you're starting are to Rosen vooch  Kobe White  Caruso and probably Zach LaVine even if this game wasn't all that impressive I always had dropped Patrick Williams as a drop  and Andre Drummond is about to be a drop if you want to hold on for one more game and see what happens I'm old I'm okay with that fine large but we have a pretty good idea what's gonna happen  maybe not a perfect idea  but enough  Charlotte I mean everybody's out Brandon Miller tried to play through a cold or flu or something and he wasn't very good which is a shame because like basically anybody that's upright for this team right now has a chance at Fantasy value Terry Rozier 18 shots and 12 free throws he was a usage Bonanza for Scary Terry he's a sell High  like the most obvious sell high of all time which makes it all the hardest sell High because everybody's like of course you're trying to give me Terry Rozier because him lamelo ball  Gordon Heyward PJ Washington on Mark Williams and on and on and on and on in the whole freaking team is out for a bad Charlotte team what's bad to begin with  so yeah Terry Rose here's gonna have to play the whole damn ball game and Nick Richards is gonna have to play the whole damn ball games and mile bridge is gonna have to play the whole damn ball game  and Brandon Miller if he was healthy he was probably gonna have to play the whole damn ball game but seems like he wasn't quite all the way there and then it's like well someone else might get to do something and this one it was  a felony named Nick Smith Jr  and I can tell you with full honesty  I don't know who this dude is why because he's a rookie  he's a 27 pick in this most recent draft he basically had not played  like in this thing is season high was like  18 minutes know he had a game right before Christmas where he had 19 points this is the second time that he's actually had like a hey look at that guy kind of game so I shouldn't be a total  butthole about it uh but I mean if you've got the stones to pick up and play Nick Smith Jr have at it man I am not coming anywhere near it because in the next ball game it could be Bryce mcgowens or Nathan mensah or JT Thor or ish Smith  nobody knows  nobody knows and it situation just keeps getting worse and worse  I still think this is a Bi-Lo window on lamelo ball  call me crazy call me a Riverboat Gambler for a team that's almost definitely to be shutting everybody down at the end of the year  but I feel like you get lamelo  on the cheap right now  hey before we get to

please do check them out today  let's pivot back into the game Houston lost at Miami I mean the heat are like you know I was just talking about how every team should just sell their whole Farm to get Alex Caruso  every team should literally sell every piece of equipment in the building and take all the money you found to hire Erik Spoelstra  I know he's not underrated because everybody knows that he's a great head coach  but somehow he still a tiny bit underrated  the heater 21 and 15 right now  and their best player has had by all accounts a Down Season Jimmy Butler  and he's only played in 24 of their 36 ball games he's missed a third of their game so far  and they just keep winning  Tyler here oh missed how many games did he only played in 18 of their 36 team I mean they have he's missed half of them  how do they do it  their time for the four seed in the Eastern Conference  running out lineups that are like bam out of bio and  this  it's like going to a restaurant where they list the main course and then instead of saying what comes on the side it just says four sides at random  sir uh yes waiter I will I'll have the ribeye  somewhere between medium rare and medium  oh I don't get choices on the sides you just gonna throw four things at my face and laugh okay  and it works everybody's going to that restaurant so in this one Tyler hero  bam out of bio  they scored 50 points on 32 shots between them I make has continues to be somewhere between decent and good Kevin Love Has grey bearded his way to a fantastic streaming run right now  Duncan Robinson Sometimes good sometimes terrible when he's good he plays he's not he doesn't  I don't understand I mean I watch it they're just like  the Heat  watching the Heat play and I'm not a huge hockey fan but watching the Heat play kind of reminds me of hockey in the way that everything is Tethered everybody's tethered it's like a dance with that team  it doesn't matter who's out there you just drop a new dude in and they know the dance the understudy knows the dance  they're impressive man the heat are  which of course at the same like you can be impressed and at the same time a little bit sad about the fact that  if they had one more truly special player on that team  they could probably win the championship  I hope they I hope they take a swing go get somebody Miami  anyway as far as fantasy goes let's talk about the fantasy ramifications of this game there were very few tari Eason was still out and nobody's really shown in inclination to fill in for him on the Houston side so you had a whole lot of Freddy van Fleet in Alpine Kim Whitmore looks like he's gonna have some pretty good fantasy games but his minutes aren't high enough yet Jay Sean Tate has the minutes but isn't doing anything for Fantasy Jane Lin green is terrible Jabari Smith is up and down but he's got he's a guy who's generally started moving on to the heat side  Kyle Lowry is not someone I'm trusting as a villain he didn't make it through this ball game anyway he was dealing with a cold and then he heard a hand or something like that Josh Richardson and Duncan Robinson played well Off the Bench I'm not trusting the bench guys right now my mainstream is I'm a Kaz who people like oh he might still be good with Butler back yeah he might actually he could be like they could slide one of those dudes up to power forward so you would never  and then I don't know how he's doing but but Kevin Love is a stream right now  if Kayla Martin ever shows up then this gets a little bit funky again but he ain't there right now  uh Utah beat Milwaukee  soundly  soundly beat Milwaukee 132 to 116 this game actually was a bigger blowout than that  Utah's just mixing and matching right now  and rather than get into each individual player because like look Chris done at a big ball game here Jordan Clarkson played well in this one  one two three four five six I would argue that like seven to eight guys had serviceable fantasy lines  and not all of those guys with the dudes who played bigger minutes in this ball game you know Kris Dunn 24 minutes yet 13 assists Colin Sexton eighteen minutes he had 19 points 33 assists in a steal count a George had 19 points they just shot the crap out of the ball 33 assists and shot the crap out of the ball  let's try to make it simple who are the Jazz that I'm starting every night meaning the Roto games cap level  those of you that are uninitiated my  the top level for me is someone I would use against a roto games cap so that's level one  so that's basically like all formats all the time those guys on the Jazz right now are obviously Larry marketing  Colin Sexton and Walker Kessler  because those guys have either very good fantasy game where they don't need a giant number of minutes to get it or are getting consistent minutes or some combination thereof  the next tier down for me our guys that I would call head-to-head only but maybe not Roto so in this case that might be someone like a Kelly Olynyk who's put up pretty well rounded lines lately but not reliably enough to use against a games cap but he's not hurting you anywhere so he's been decent enough for Head to Head John Collins you could probably play on head to head because he's been fine but unspectacular more of like a plotting kind of line um  Jordan Clarkson is a stream while warm guy that's kind of the next level down where you can play them in any format but only when he's on a heater  and then below that is probably just a guy that you're not playing so the three I like on Utah as I mentioned Market in Sexton and Kessler and then there's some other guys that are sort of slotted underneath that but that's where I feel about that team Milwaukee was down both point guards no Damian Lillard no campaign Andre Jackson Jr got the start you know have to worry about that more importantly when Dame is out that means there's probably enough shots for someone like a Malik Beasley to maybe get back over the cut line for a game  and that's another level is injury replacement Beasley is injury replacement level slash 3-point streamer  but when Dame is in there he's not getting enough shots and he's not doing enough things besides just taking three pointers and that's where he sits and that's really kind of the only I think piece of information we learned  from this game on the Milwaukee side  let's go ahead and tackle the last one Phoenix got spanked by the Clippers this was  a re-education homes uh you're seeing Twitter getting fussy right now about how they need to blow it up I would try to remind Suns fans that Phoenix has had their three stars together for what three ball games  because remember Kevin Durant missed a couple games and then it was just be in Booker  and there were some stretches in there where it was just Booker and there were some stretches in there where it was just KD  they're still very much I mean I know we're 30 they're 37 games into the season but they're basically like  you have to treat this like it's November 1st  for Phoenix  we have no idea what they are  I don't think they're going to play very much defense  but at some point offensively this team's gonna be pretty freaking good  I'm holding Grayson Allen that's literally the only fantasy note on this game  possible by low on Bradley Beal because you had that like adrenaline Spike when he came back  now is legs are a little  Jiggly  and then he'll settle in he'll get his sea legs and he'll be okay I don't know that you let me maybe you could pull off a Buy Low if you get him for like 100 range guy and then the Clippers this is one of the Evita zubats by the way Evita zubats is now a member of the stream well warm Department because he runs very hot and cold he puts up these two or three big games in a row  he has a week where he's like top 50 and then  drops off a cliff he's hot right now  so have at it otherwise no big surprises the three main dudes Kauai had six defensive stats yay James Harden Double-Double yay Paul George 25 and 7 yay ish  I didn't think the Clippers were gonna be this much of a fantasy gold mine I have a lot of kawaii and Harden on my fantasy teams because I felt they were just getting drafted too late and  by and large that's worked out very well I didn't have much Paul George and he's number 12 it's crazy the Clippers got three guys on their team inside the top 16 in nine cat  how about them apples  all right that's your recap I'm sorry that everybody's hurt  that's proof  man rough go yesterday rough go  a couple of quick notes from the chat room a lot of the folks that are saying that they're happy to have me back thank you I appreciate it it was  oh unpleasant doesn't even begin to tell the story Brandon Marcus host one of The Two Hosts I should say of our fantastic Clippers podcast here at sports ethos ethos Clippers what type of Duty you're targeting for terrorism that's a great question because I don't think you're going to be able to really fool anyone into thinking that this is Who Rose your is  he's number 26 and 9 cap but he's at 19 shots five free throws and seven assists like he's involved in everything they're doing and at some point lamelo ball is going to come back and those numbers are going to take a bit of a nose dive and then presumably you'll get everything guys come back to for Charlotte  also Rosier and a team this bad and very much a threat to get moved  it's not a guarantee nothing is a guarantee in life  I think if you can lock in a top 50 level guy coming back I would do it I think if the best return you're going to get is like 65 I don't think I would I think I'd rather just ride out the Rosier thing and see how it goes and you know if it hurts later and you're like ah damn it someone is gonna give me Keegan Murray okay fine like maybe that ends up being something you lose in in your head-to-head playoffs on  but for now and you know me I'm all Roto games capping and tallying up what he's doing I I don't think that I would  take something back that's that low I think I would want to aim a little bit higher  shining Knight asks if boy on bug zdanowicz is gonna get a boost with Cade Cunningham out um yeah I mean he probably takes an extra shot or two so it doesn't hurt it's good question  TJ McConnell or benedict mathura on the pickup TJ  should I drop branded pajama ski to burn away her on TJ McConnell um yeah I think I would actually I think put gemski as much as I like him and I like his Fantasy game I do think he's kind of  teething a little bit  and the Warriors are trying something new basically every ball game and at some point dream ones gonna come back and that's I know you're like oh he's a big guy it's gonna yeah it's gonna impact everybody because the Warriors just gonna slide guys up and down the only thing holding me back from saying hard yes on this is the Chris Paul injury  because Chris Paul's out a month and so those minutes are gonna have to go someplace and it does feel like  pajam skis the guy  that should get some of them  but we also know that TJ McConnell is going to go big for three weeks  I gotta go big I think  if you're asking about trade questions I'm not doing those on a live show well we'll have a trade show in fact I have an idea of just doing a show that's exclusively trades at some point  it won't be today and it probably won't be this week unless everybody magically gets healthy in the next 24 hours then maybe  um so let's see when is lamelo ball coming back I wish I knew for sure I think it's gonna be in the next two weeks and we haven't heard anything which means this is your last chance to buy low because as soon as there's a timeline on him whoever's been holding on this whole time is not about to move on  let's see here should be doo doo doo  yeah Chris done in 24 minutes is solid if someone could legitimately tell me that Chris Dunn was gonna get 24 of this stuff um  and it's been like 12 minutes 17 minutes 24 minutes hooray and then back down to like 14 again  um  where do you see Dame the rest of the season  whale  probably not too far from where he is right now I think he's number eighteen in nine cat on the boards I'm looking at  and he's been pretty consistently in that range  I do still think that there is a heater coming where he shoots 50%  for like five or six games in a row just like a like a real Mega heater game version  and that'll push him up a few slots but you know top 18 feels pretty reasonable on Lillard  and what is Jayson Tatum's trade value this is a tough one because somebody probably drafted him at like seven and then he was at 36 last two weeks ago now he's back up to number 23 because obviously he wasn't gonna shoot 79% at the free throw line all year  I think he still moves a little higher than this he said 80.7% I know this is like  it's really math it's it's very hair splitty but if Tatum just continues to do exactly what he's doing in everything besides free throws and the free throws go from right now being a net neutral which again two weeks ago was a small negative now they're at neutral and it becomes a small to medium positive get up to like 84.85% he will move another four or five six slots up the board  so I think Jayson Tatum is probably inside the top 20 inside the top 18 just like game we were talking about a minute ago as the season goes  but in terms of trade value if you drafted him at 7:00 and you're probably don't want to take back someone who's 20  and if you're trying to buy on him you're probably trying to do so with someone that's near where he is right now so I don't know that it's ever going to link up  that's why I had Tatum on the Buy Low board when he was at 36 because at that point I was like you know what you might be able to get him for someone ranked near 20 like Kristofferson gets or Tyrese Maxey where I think these are guys that may be kind of pass in the night a little bit and now I don't think that's gonna get it done anymore now you'd have to go up the board and you have to give up Dame or hardened or Kyrie or Paul George  and I do you want to maybe I mean Tatum's healthier than some of those guys but like  remember when everybody was upset about Kyrie Irving because he was like number 25 he's number 14 per game and climbing  all right let's wrap it up  why because I'm hoping  that I can do another show this afternoon what show I don't know because we did a Buy Low on Fridays feels like doing another one would be a little bit dumb this soon but I have all these ideas for shows that I wanted to do the trade Raider show that I just mentioned earlier in this one  really wanted to do I haven't done a cell high in a while maybe that's the one to just ease back into it but I really want to get a second show going this afternoon and I also wanted to take some time to again shout out the believe Sports Network for bringing us aboard maybe that'll happen over on social anyway they've been amazing so far oh here's one last question Booker owner is it time to panic and sell I watched him play he is always double teamed  listen  if I talk about Devin Booker I'm gonna get accused of being a little bit of a Negative Nancy  and I don't I don't want to I don't want people like Dan you're always down on Booker  I just never thought he was gonna be number 12 which is basically what is 80 P was and now he's number 29 in nine cats it's not that he's been bad he's still averaging 26 points 7.8 assists five boards two threes like a lot of really good stuff  it's it's two things going on how hard it is to be a top 12 pick or top 12 fantasy player because the pinball numbers guys are putting up at the top of the board this year's truly insane they're astronomical but also that there are little things it's nitpicky but there are little things in Devin Booker's Fantasy game that aren't going away no matter how much he's given  those little things are he's not that big of a 3-point guy  feels like he is because he scores a lot but 2.1 right now is pretty high for him  and the assist that we're like eight and change you always do those were gonna start to come down as his teammates got healthier and the steals that were like 1.2 you know those were coming down and the blocks are coming down  and I don't again I really don't want this to seem like I'm picking on him  but what did I say during draft season I said Devin Booker is gonna lose some usage  and he's probably gonna be more in the 20s  then the teens  and he is now  so no I don't think it's time to panic I think this  20 something iteration of Devin Booker is probably more what we should have expected from the outset  but he got hurt immediately  and then KD got hurt and so it was just like Booker against the universe and of course he was gonna put up 30 points in Tennessee because he was playing with a bunch of Joshua's  and even the first wave of Joshua's got hurt Grayson Allen was out for a while and Eric Gordon missed a couple of ball games now you really like  who were these guys  teams getting healthy  when they start to figure out how to play together he shouldn't have to do as much every game  that's okay this was the handicap from the outset he was over-performing early because the situation was better early  okay I'm at Dan Bass Pro on Twitter some of you might even be watching on Twitter right now I have no idea if that was useful if you are someone who watched live on Twitter X send me a note to let me know that it was useful and improved your experience some way if nobody says anything I'll probably just go back to putting it on YouTube iTunes Spotify and all that good stuff but I figured it can't hurt to have it in more places you know more Dan who doesn't want more Dan talking about his family's digestive problems having a great middle of your Tuesday again I'm hoping that we can do another show this afternoon stay tuned for that make sure to like And subscribe however you take in the stuff and that way you'll know if we've got another show in the afternoon if you asked me questions in the chat room I didn't get to things like trade questions whatever you can put them in the comments  or you can wait because it's some point here I'm going to do a trade Raider show and I kind of want you guys to have a whole bunch in the hopper ready to go  keep him ready to go all right later for now everybody we'll talk to you soon
