welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast there's no point in burying the lead  Joel embiid is back  Joelle and bead  is back  yesterday was it tumultuous day for the embiid news because we got word in the morning that he was trying to Target a Tuesday return and then he got downgraded to out and then three hours later he got re upgraded to questionable  gamesmanship  the aristocrats  and beat his back and he looked good and he played damn near 30 minutes all so which I mean  good decision question mark  29 minutes for him beat his first game out of his chute was  a lot more than expected  I mean obviously good because he can be he's a top 100 fantasy player in like 16 minutes this is Joel embiid we're talking about here so 29 minutes 24 6 and 7 with 3 steals yeah a lot of turnovers yeah if you'll go percent was a little rusty to go 12 of 12 at the free throw line  Joel and beat his back ladies and gentlemen that's good stuff I'm Dan bass this is fantasy NBA today  one of our two shows here on this Wednesday morning this is the recap show we'll have our streaming episode it won't be a bigger one again I think that'll be first thing this afternoon here Pacific time  as far as this one goes we've got a nice little nine gamer to recap  folks always ask about the hats I wear on the show I have a short rotation some of the ones that you guys are like what the hell is that or why I guess the question why is Dan wearing a Royals hat today  like kid was on the Royals for Little League  I'm an assistant coach we get a hat  that's it nothing else that's the whole story  let's just Dive Right In shall we yes we shall Lakers beat the Raptors to know when surprise Raptors did get a manual quickly and RJ Barrett back so that was certainly useful they were a slightly more competent team for the minutes that those guys were on the court as far as the Lakers go you know this game was over early so LeBron 28 and a half minutes Anthony Davis 27 and a half minutes they didn't have to play all that much 80 didn't play in the fourth quarter so then you kind of get the question of are those guys going to play tonight for La they're in Washington on a back-to-back so that's not an easy travel deal you gotta do the Customs stuff  I would expect LeBron to sit at add to play LeBron's been sitting back to back here at the end of the year but again you never know this is  the Wizards won last night over the Bucks of all team as a as a terrible loss was just got their 15th one of the year they've been a little bit more competitive lately  to the Wiz in the Wizards defense and you know everybody always gets up to play the Lakers so I don't think the Lakers could just assume they're going to walk through this ball game  and that makes me think that if any of these guys is well enough to play they will play  I wouldn't rule these guys out yet  and then is the rest of this stuff goes it's all you could just dump dump most of it really hot tomorrow right now is doing enough mostly because of field goal percentage any kind of got challenged to rebound a little bit more so you can pretty much start the starters for the Lakers these days even though Austin Reeves  is it a wicked shooting slump right now he's still apply  he got some nice stuff at Max Christy Off the Bench wish he'd play more  they don't Spencer Dinwiddie he's been defending a lot but again you can't there's no point going down that rabbit hole  what about the Raptors Bruce Brown left this ball game early with some nice soreness not sure what his status is gonna be I think he's listed as doubtful right now Kelly Olynyk is a go 1474 a steel two blocks great percentages like his just an easy calls long as he's not turning it over five times quickly you can start again is upside is capped by what's usually pretty brutal field goal percent he shot the ball better in this one same as general story for RJ Barrett although for berries bad at both percentages when the season all roles itself together so he's a points League guy quickly he's going to be good in points lie or points for him at he'll be good enough I would think in nine cat as well RJ Barrett know for nine cat  Milwaukee  losers in Washington  yikes yikes yikes I say yikes didn't really defend and didn't really shoot no Dame again for the bucks so Patrick Beverley got the start he didn't do very much turned an ankle in this ballgame couldn't finish it out Malik Beasley played 30 minutes but shot two for 13 yacht also brutal  typically when Dame is out  you'll get something out of Beasley  Beverly is more than maybe kind of guy in those spots and maybe if you played a full 30 minutes he would have been enough fantasy wise but I don't know that you can necessarily go down that path here's the thing originally it looked like Dame was gonna be out for personal reasons then he got changed to a groin thing or maybe it was a growing thing and a personal thing in any event  I don't know that Dame is immediately back there's no reason to rush him Bucks have a solid seed in the Eastern Conference they're not going anywhere the calves are really the only team that has a true chance of catching them I mean maybe the magic but probably not  it takes a lot to move a few slots this late in the year  so if James sits Dame sits and in that case if we find out Patrick Beverley is going to be well enough to play I think I'd probably consider it as a point guard who it's threes rebounds and gets defensive stats it's a nice kind of out of position thing you can do Beasley is more the three points stream that's you know what you're gonna get there and then pack content in one big didn't see that one coming but no you're not doing anything with that information uh Bobby Portis probably streamable when Dame is out just because of the extra usage out there  I went and I kind of looped around on this team and hopefully you guys caught all the pieces Beasley threes streamer Beverly if healthy I think playable in most formats with Dame out Portis most formats with Dame out and that's as far as I go there you may get some more guys resting I think the Bucks are on a back-to-back question mark  yeah they got the Grizzlies at home  I don't know you might see I don't think Middleton plays you might see Giannis go all those guys out you'd have to take a shot on Beasley I would think  and definitely portisch  hey Beverly probably if he's playable he's healthy  thinking about this all from more of the games caps standpoint  for the Wizards know Kyle kuzma and Marvin Bagley heard again knee sprain left early in this ball game that sucks he was gonna put up a pretty good line one would assume  they can certainly use Rashawn Holmes back just on vukovich played 31 minutes he had 14 and 7 with the steal in a three-pointer overall I think there's going to be a pretty gnarly learning curve there so I'm not picking him up I would rather just wait and hope home shows back up again Anthony Gill played 38 minutes and had 12 and 9 with nothing else  avda is a big winner there he was already a guy you were playing but if he sees some extra sentiments that's a win for Denny pool kispert is a play when kuzma's out we've talked about that  Jared Butler's a guy I've got an eye on but 17 and a half minutes ain't gonna be enough so what happens if this is the lineup for the next ball game which again is tonight against the Lakers although it feels like kuzma probably wants to play against La it feels like he was resting the front end of a back-to-back so that he could play the second half against the Lakers  but we won't know for a little bit later that's just my assumption on the kuzma front  if kuzma's in  I don't know that I play Kiss Bert although you know Lakers do tend to have some issues defending guys that can spread the floor  but I I'd be pretty gentle there if kuzma is in you go cuz you go pool you go off the that's probably it on a game's cap side of Cosmos out you put kiss on the list instead of kuzma but I don't think I'm playing Gil I don't think I'm playing vukovich specially if we think adds can play someone in that front court is going to get  smashed on  and so you probably go a little lighter than you ought the Knicks  they are a bit shorthanded these days if Jalen Brunson doesn't have a world beater of a ballgame they're just not gonna win that's kind of where we're at with an Elias not against the competent opponent like Miami Donte divincenzo Roland Deuce McBride Roland with his 45 minutes again Josh Hart 45 minutes  hartenstein only 18  Mitchell Robinson played 10  president to a 27 hardin's a whole he's been very good lately can't can't dump him after this one after an 18 minute game when he was playing you know close to 30 in some previous ball game  a Chua with with Robinson back like Lee Trends to basically non-existent and then Mitchell Robinson is just not playing enough to be relevant at all right now so he's not an ad so you go Brunson heart McBride and even though heart and Stein so basically the starters probably could have been a simpler handicap there if I just said start the starters  Duncan Robinson slow again for the heat I think I'd still stream him though he's generally been pretty good feeling in for Tyler hero it's possibly doesn't really have a legs underneath them at the moment Rozier had a big ball game so that kind of did the trick here Rozier Butler bam not Highsmith not yovich  not Caleb Martin not Jacques Junior  I think probably the Duncan Robinson but if you want to see Robinson have one good ballgame before you play him I'm okay with that just to kind of like see him get his sea legs again  okay see no Shay in this ball game  I think they were missing someone else but I forget who done matter Shades the big one lost it Philly against the now embedded  they've been immediately again  like rhinestones Josh giddey had been feeling pretty well for Gil just Alexander I think he's probably a stream when she sits by and large you got a better game here out of Lou Dort who's typically more of a 3-point stream when she sits  and then I say Joe and Aaron Wiggins each had pretty good ballgames all so but I don't think I'm taking the plunge on those dudes Wiggins would be the  easier one to maybe consider but I oh Jalen Williams was the other guy that was out in the ball game on that took me so long and then other Jalen Williams had six six and 12 goofball lineups if Jalen Williams and she'll just Alexander are out again I think you could probably go Dort Giddy and Chet I don't know that I would go Wiggins he'd be the next one and then everybody else will be pretty far down the board  for Philly still no Maxi that's gonna be the other one that changes things pretty dramatically here Tyrese Maxey out so campaign had 10 rebounds in this game somehow I hate came cams nine cat game it just it never it never quite sticks in nine cat you can play him in points while Max he's out if you want that's campaign we're talking about Kyle Lowry know Nick button nobody he'll know Paul Reed had 12 and 9 with a block but as MB ramps up he's he's done so no and then Uber a  I think he I think I'm a yes well Maxie's out when Maxie comes back I don't know that there's going to be enough shot out there for Uber to hit his value he's gonna be more open so that's good but  is there enough of available to do so for now just hold on that's the like with Uber you know on a pre drop just to hold until you you're forced to not to so indeed oubre Tobias Harris those are the three guys you're playing right now and then when Maxie comes back probably play them all or bench you Bray and see how that goes but the rest these guys fall back over to the Wayside Houston Falls at Minnesota they were competitive in this ballgame make no mistake the Rockets have continued to be competitive but as I mentioned the schedule got tougher again they had a very like epically light stretch of the calendar and they very much capitalized on it but now they've lost to the baths they've lost to the Timberwolves they've got the Warriors tomorrow the heat on Friday the Mavs again on Sunday the magic next Tuesday and then finally they have two more easy games but they'll probably be eliminated by then sorry Rockets fans you made a guy pretty good run at it but they're back to three being three games back in the warriors with seven games to go each of those teams has seven games left  to me is probably too much ground to make up and who knows maybe the Warriors could could tumble over themselves but they're playing really well right now worries of beat the heat the magic the Hornets the Spurs and then the Mavs three of those pretty good wins and  beat the heat in the magic on the road last week  they've got the Rockets as we just talked about so he used to could gain a game there and the Mavericks again for the Warriors after that but they also have the Jazz twice and the Blazers among their last five ball games I think we have an idea of the eight teams 10 teams I'll get this right in the Western Conference playoff picture  but I you know I guess you never know Freddie Van Fleet I'm in Thompson Jabari Smith Jr Jalen green are all started for the Rockets right now keep an eye on Kim Whitmore if they get eliminated in anybody else starts to sit out some ball games  for the Timberwolves Rudy gobert Anthony Edwards Mike Conley Nas Reed and then slow-mo is your rebound assist steals specialist who did more than that in this ball game and  you know there's no obvious reason for it to be a big or small game for Kyle Anderson guys didn't leave this one Jaden McDaniels just only played 27 minutes they like with slo-mo was doing more  they mixed and matched a little bit  now if Kyle gets 30 minutes then he's a started in all formats and you can see it in this ball game 13 six and nine two steals two blocks and six out of eight shooting when he stuck in that 2425 range she's again much more of a specialist so I think what I call them on a previous show was it doesn't matter guy with upside because he's got those few categories that are nice and last three weeks he's been inside the top 100 because there is that little bit of extra if go bare misses a game or Edwards misses a game or Conley misses a game or Nazis a game then he gets that bonus bump and then sometimes he just gets a bonus in a game where the team is largely healthy  so I I don't think that Kyle Anderson is going to be like the top 50 top 60 guy he was last year when cat was out but even you know 90 range would still be good enough to start in most formats unless you don't need threes basically or points he's not gonna be a big Points Guy but boards assist field goal percent steals those are things he can give you a positive in  and you just again hope he doesn't shoot free throws or turn it over too much and you get a decent ball game like this one  slow mo doing enough doing enough and certainly enough after a good ball game this is a time when you can be a little bit more optimistic about him  Cleveland  I mean took care of business you know that Utah's not trying to win games right now no Donovan Mitchell so if you thought Darius Garland might do more I have bad news for you  Darius Garland one of the worst picks this year unquestionably a lot of guys are getting heat and it should be Garland because  not only has he been bad but he's also missed a lot of ball games he's outside the top 100 per game 117 he's down there with freaking buddy hield  bad year for Darius way overdrafted on the hope that his assist would carry him and  they did not  but anyway you got no choice but to play but this point cuz you know Donovan Mitchell on half of the back to back so well there you go Carousel virtue is a stream when would not have a Mitchell sits  Max Drew's probably a stream when someone sits but he's honestly he's just looks better now that is knee is healed up  so stress kind of a doesn't matter guy with some built-in upside and Sam Merrill hit six more three-pointers but again you're playing with fire there because if he doesn't hit any three-pointers you're going to get like a 2.1 rebound ball game because he's not gonna play  if you need threes badly okay fine but be warned it can go sour  for the Jazz yes if you thought everybody was out you'd be wrong because Walker Kessler left this ball game early after getting his nose broken  I don't know if he's gonna play in the next one might miss a game or two he might get masked and play immediately we don't know yet for Utah what this means is that Colin Sexton is basically the only safe play left for the Jazz and then you have a bunch of guys that are not particularly safe but some of whom have a little bit of upside the  highest floor play  probably becomes oh Mary you're at 7 if Kessler misses time because he'll just play 30 Center minutes and get 10 points and eight rebounds probably and maybe block a shot he's not gonna do a whole lot to help your fantasy team but he's probably not going to do that much to hurt it either  I think we've all seen enough of keyonte George at this point to say okay Dan you might have been right about the whole like nine category issues thing count as a points League option and that's it  taeler Hendrix is intriguing now that the whole team is out remember when only like two guys were out for Utah and I was like I don't think there's quite enough for him to do well now you got like five key guys out who Larry marking in Jordan Clarkson Walker Kessler John Collins am I forgetting someone or is it those four  in any event that's like freaking 60 shots back in the pool for everybody else to take and so now Hendricks if he gets 13 shots  and he's probably startable because he's not a bad rebounder he didn't do much in this ball game but he'll probably get people plays 27 to 32 minutes he'll probably get six to eight rebounds  score a little bit because he won't have a choice get a steal or a block or some combination thereof  so yeah I mean I think you can probably pick up Taylor Hendricks see how this stretch run goes and then Bryce sensible and now with two good ball games in a row he will cool off friends  and the question becomes is there enough other stuff going on and the and honest to goodness answer is  I don't know yet  I don't think any of us really truly knows  if Bryce sensible has a translatable fantasy game yet  because we've never seen it  you can try to guess you could try to extrapolate mean dudes a rookie so the sample size is extraordinarily small handful of games he played 32 minutes back on March 9th he had 16 and 2 3 assists three steals 5 turnovers in that ball game  last two games he scored 22 points and each of them  going 14 for 28 so 50% shooting is also at five and a half three pointers in those games which again you know you want to talk about not sustainable  what I think we don't know really is what you know what is the rebound number gonna settle at 5  assists what's that gonna settle at three  can you get a steal per ball game maybe  one feels like around one in 30 minutes  22 points is all probably not gonna stick so what do we gonna get out of Bryce sensible 14 15 points 5 boards three assists that's not bad  it's one of those things now we're at that time of the year where I could say oh I get out in front of this thing but like  what we got 15 days of the Season left at this point what do we even gonna try to get out in front of  the only reason to pick somebody up at this point in the year is to play them you're not squatting on somebody because what are you gonna get two games out of them if you wait a week I will personally say I am not confident enough to pick up and start Bryce sensible in the next ball game and  maybe that means I miss a good one but I they're just so many guys available right now in League's that I don't feel like you have to take a chance on someone  probably coin flip for sensible that he puts up  nine a nine cat usable line in his next ball game probably a coin flip I'd say Hendrix is probably a little better than a coin flip and then obviously Colin Sexton and Omar Yates event is probably a little better than a coin flip 2 provided all of these guys remain out for the next ball game  Spurs lost to gitty Osman in this ball game so the backup to the backup to the backup now we're gonna have to go a little deeper  so obviously when be 2315 and 8 with a steel and nine blocks on Wow 29 shots I didn't see that last night 31% shooting on 29 shots trade Jones triple doubled he's in a great spot here with Novell no Sohan  now no Osman  the list goes on and on  well most of these guys with the exception of Osman have been  ruled out for the year  for the Spurs so  you know what we saw in this ball game is probably what repeats itself for the Spurs maybe the rest of the way  meaning  Malachi Branham 24 points very good points League option brand I'm not a good percentage guy and he doesn't do much else besides score  Julian champagne is the one I would look at for nine cat 11 and 5 2 assists a steel block and a three-pointer he can get Steals and blocks we've seen that in  I mean honestly at this point for champagne we have a I think a good enough sample size  to say that if given starters level minutes he can probably get about 12 points a steal and a block  ish  if you look back at last year he wasn't really getting either of them so I guess the question is is this year the outlier or was last year the outlier he's not gonna shoot all that well he was at 46% last year he's at 40% this year and the shop profile isn't changed all that much either but decent For You Shooter should he get to the line he's at 81% on the year now that the minutes are there you're looking at probably more like four between probably four-ish rebounds over two assists  steal a block and maybe two three pointers  I think I might take a shot on champagne  also the usage is going to increase here because you've taken guys that Chuck a little bit out of the equation not a Chuck is probably not fair because vasel is pretty good actually and then so hands not what you'd call it chukar but not a very good shooter still those are guys that were doing stuff when they were out on the basketball court and now that stuff has to go to somebody and it's not all gonna go to Malachi Branham although kind of looked like it did yesterday  so yeah I think champagne can repeat a line like this one 11 and 2 with a steel block and a three-pointer that's kind of a middle that may be sort of the average  and that's not bad  that's usable anywhere you need defensive stats or basically a guy to kind of give you a little bit of a lot of stuff  A Little Mac Dre in I guess  so probably not a ton of upside I don't think he's going inside the top 75 but you could get probably 100 to 120 range out of him and that that play a little bit  no real news on Denver still no Jamal Murray Reggie Jackson continues to be a very bad nine category fill in but if you badly need a couple of points in a couple of assists he's probably worth a shot there but I don't so I didn't nice 16 rebound game for Michael Porter Jr though  about them apples  Clippers are  not good these days no Kawhi Leonard so that certainly played a role and that meant Norman Powell got the fill-in starred and he was fine but nothing spectacular so you go Paul George you go eat to zubats and you go James Harden who was awful also Russ had 20 points I don't care and you just you're not doing anything else you're not going any farther with that Clippers team for the Kings uh  you know again no Kevin herder and no Malik monk so you get this sort of different look which meant  you know more shots for Keegan Murray that's really good for him  Harrison Barnes was someone I thought might do a little bit more as kind of a points play I don't want anything else besides that he was bad Trey Lyles out played him and so Trey Lyles ended up being his lightly better play in this game but you're not doing anything in nine cow with either of those guys again with Barnes I guess okay so nine cat with Barnes if you badly need points some threes and the percentages not to kill you that would be a possible play and you know be probably does end up in the 100 to 150 range with all those other guys out I also think Keon Ellis ends up in that range he fouled out in 22 minutes if you're wondering why Alice's minutes were much lower in this game fouled out in 22 minutes just by being a plus 11 during the only 22 minutes he was on the floor in a game that they won by 14 so basically he was part of the lineups that were building the lead  with Barnes it wasn't a foul issue with Barnes trials was just better  he out Harris and Barnes did Harrison Barnes  so hold on to Alice if you need boards and are boards and on the right word like a smattering of rebounds assists and and very good shot at defensive stats and again just assumed that this was a little goofy because again he fouled out  he's gonna guard somebody important on the other team  James Harden perhaps who goes one for seven shooting and barely could get himself involved five turnovers you don't think he has played a role in that Keegan Murray good defense too Kings of up their defense a lot since they went to this key on Ellis Centric team and that's gonna help them steam is more dangerous come playoff time than people realize because of that  Mavs needed to get something out of their bench in this game and they didn't they didn't I believe the Mavs bench scored 13 points in this game  not great Bob Tim Hardaway Jr had seven of them now to be fair Luca Kyrie and PJ Washington pretty much took every shot in the game  and you know I don't know that PJ taking every shot was the greatest idea on Earth but he took them  and when he does he puts up some fantasy value but I still prefer Kyrie Luka and Gafford as the three guys I'm playing Derek Lively out so Maxie kluba back into the rotation a little bit and nobody cared and for the Warrior's they're this really interesting run the Warriors are on right now and it's fueled heavily by a Draymond Green Renaissance 118 and 64 steals in a block I think he has 10 steals in his last two ball games this is like vintage Draymond I guess he smells the finish line now and realized that they didn't win a few games and they were gonna lose that last playoff spot play in spot to the Rockets Andrew Wiggins is a hole he's been better lately Steph is been kind of average lately he'll be fine  Chris Paul I believe is a drop I made 14 and 5 so slightly better line here but not playing enough minutes Brian had a better game but he had three or four bad ones in a row so no and then Trace Jackson Davis much slower ball game here but he's a hold  and on the maps just pick centers apart so Warriors tried something different  there isn't anybody coming for Jackson Davis's 20 to 25 minute role and if you need big man stats he's a really good solution there and again you just sort of pray that he doesn't go to the free throw line if you're actually giving a crap about free throws anyway  a question about a couple of guys that didn't play yes yesterday Trend in Watford and Andre Drummond and I'll talk about those guys here before we wrap up our first of two shows today Trend and Watford is intriguing I I believe  right now that if everything stayed exactly as they as it is in this moment for Brooklyn meaning and their last ball game cam Johnson I believe sat that one out because there was a back-to-back he was resting if that's the case and obviously know Ben Simmons then Watford probably deserves a spot on rosters as kind of like a 100 range guy 100 to 125 130  if one more Wing goes down then I probably play Watford in a games cap format but in my opinion we're still one guy away it's close it's very close but I think we're I think we're still one guy away and then Andre Drummond  you know his value is very much locked up in rebounding and lately he's been gobbling him up even at a fast clip for Drummond  so you know specialisti  look at your board look at your team look at your opponent figure out if you actually need rebounds at all and if you do congratulations because he's gonna get you well lately he's gonna get you 10 and on the year he's gonna get you nine so you know great but you can't rely on anything else he's a his he's an historically bad for free throw shooter his field goal percentage is probably going to be decent but he's not gonna take more than six seven shots of ball game most of the time so you know three out of six four out of six kind of stuff so bored some field goal percent I wouldn't count on anything else from Drummond which makes him a probably 100 to 150 range or maybe even deeper than that 100 to 200 range one to two category hyper specialist play I have him in one League I did Adam in one League where I am violently attacking rebounds but otherwise he tends to do more damage than harm in that league for instance the one of the a couple of things that I had to look at were okay what's the difference what's this separation between my team and the next one lower than me in free-throw percent meaning can I withstand a week of Andre Drummond's bad for you throw and not lose any ground in that category and the answer I came up with was generally yes and I kind of looked around like do I need points not that really my team's kind of mid-pack and we're not going up and down in points probably not going up and down and steals blocks all that much although he's you know okay in those assists I don't really need all that badly so I looked at this and I was like you know my best shot to win is to forego a couple of categories and just Hammer rebounds and so I picked him up but it under most circumstances he's not a guy that I'm super high on Drummond I should say as more than like a 141.50 range dude with the  the ultimate and Specialists appeal  all right I think we can take a break when I say break I mean a couple hours we'll come back we will get you the streaming show after lunch today and then if you guys still want to hear more Dan I'll actually be on the call for USC Santa Barbara baseball that's happening later on tonight that'll be not on our YouTube page that'll be on the USC Trojans athletic page so you can get three Dan shows with that last one being like three and a half hours long  I just heard my dog growling at someone probably should have wrapped up the show before that started I am Dan vests I forgot to do any promo today but please everybody please please please please if you have a moment I really badly badly need you all to leave a five-star review on iTunes please go do it I know that it's probably too late in most of you have stopped listening because your leeks are over but please go drop a five-star review and if your brand new to the show find a way to subscribe whether it's on Twitter you follow me there or you know roll on over to YouTube and subscribe there  I would strongly recommend subscribing on iTunes Spotify or some other traditional pod listening Implement because some of our shows in the offseason will not be on YouTube and on Twitter as well some are going to be audio only when you know kids are off for summer break or whatever and I can't really  count on having 30 quiet minutes in a row which feels like a very small thing to ask but it's a pretty big luxury when you have two young children in your house and right now I don't because they're both at their various school or preschool but in the summertime they'll be home for stretches and Heaven Help Us all but we may have to record those shows and then kind of release them after the fact because I'll probably have to edit out screaming  is Cade playing  right now though asks I don't know  I don't know we'll find out in a few hours he's questionable for every ball game they're you know picking and choosing a little bit I would assume he is unless someone tells me otherwise the Pistons have a back-to-back  on Friday and Saturday  so I would expect he sits one half of that he said out both halves of their last back-to-back but I can't find another game that he didn't play that wasn't attached to a back-to-back  all the games he's had off lately have been either the front back or both ends of a back-to-back so I'm assuming he's playing tonight unless someone tells me otherwise and then over the the Friday Saturday ones I be probably misses at least one of those two ball games  and what about shakeel just Alexander I don't know um we got ruled out in the last one  I mean that means he's hurt that's the best way to describe it like they're fighting for a 1 seed and you know they want it because home court matters in the NBA these days like a lot for most teams  Thunder 29 and 8 on their home court they're good on the road make no mistake they're still 23 and 15 but you want to have as many games on the court where you're as good as possible nuggets are better at home wolves oddly are almost the same home and road so they the only one in that top three where it's like maybe they don't care that much but I think they're organization would rather get the you know concession sales from a home playoff game  teams won home games  with the exception of the Wolves the Clippers and the Mavericks who oh and the Pelicans  that's weird no Western Conference teams that are  not that different and then you got it then you got a team like the Lakers that's 15 games over 500 at home and five under on the road 20 swing and they're going to be on the road everywhere they go in the playoffs anyway I think the Thunder care  there again they're good at both  but four and a half five games better at home that's that ain't nothing  so if she can play he'll play so I think he's hurt right now  I think he's hurt  um  so I think Cades I think Kate probably misses this ball game because I don't think he was sitting the last one out for rest I think if he's probably actually dinged up but nothing where you can really do this morning 10:23 a.m. Pacific time there's like nothing I can do right now to say I know for sure we'll find out in a little bit this is silly season and anything is possible he could have just been resting it just it felt like he actually was hurt because you know there's no reason like you might as well play your guys in the easier game of a back-to-back to sort of lock up one win as a posted now if he comes back to play Boston they might end up losing both of these games  we have a weird phenomenon  all right well that was you know another six minutes of yamming that I wasn't planning on again we'll be back in a couple of hours with the streaming show once again I want to remind everybody today tomorrow Friday those will be our last two show a day's of this NBA season starting on the weekend I don't think I'm gonna have time to do a streaming show on Saturday because kids stuff all morning in the games will start by the time I'm home Sunday there is a possibility I might be able to get you that last day of the week streaming show Monday we will do a weekly preview show  you know Monday we might do two shows  weekend review one and then a weekly preview the other and then Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday of next week will be single shows there's no reason to a streamer show in  the last week of the season because most Hadleys are over and the ones that do exist you're basically just watching the wire the whole time because half of your guys are going to get ruled out at the last minute there's really no reason to Long stream the last week because all those guys are going to skip two games anyway so my like if I did a streaming show the last week I would just come on air and go hey everybody it's me Dan best for remember just watch the news rotate healthy guys in rotate dead guys out the end bye bye and that is the end of this show I'll see you guys in about two and a half hours for a streamer I'm Dan Bass Pro Sports ethos.com and fantasy NBA today I'll see you in a little bit
