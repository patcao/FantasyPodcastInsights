welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  who doesn't love a good day starting with some breaking damn news  I love a day  that starts with some breaking damn news Terry Rozier  is now a member of the Miami Heat  big news of the morning  trade going down we don't have to wait long these days we had siakam a few days ago we got Rozier now  good times are these  wounds and Shams Duke and it out just like its trade deadline morning even if it's two and change weeks away  the new news which I have just alerted to you guys details as I have now flashed up on the screen  well John's each tweeting some iteration of the Charlotte Hornets or trading Terry Rozier to the Miami Heat  for a 2027 first round pick and Kyle Lowry headed back to Charlotte in the first of what it feels like going to be many trades and I don't want to get my hopes too high about this trade deadline but the fact that we've had two pretty big ones and we're not even into February yet well that's got me all tickled  I am Tickled Pink Ladies and Gentlemen  welcome to Fantasy NBA today this is your instant reaction episode we'll also take the second half of the show to break down the Monday results so you could just kind of stick around we'll roll two shows into one but Point number one here  in addition to welcoming you all to the show Welcome to Fantasy NBA Today sports ethos.com presentation I am your host Danvers at Dan best person on social media please please please make sure to drop a follow over on social that has been one of our greatest weapons in the growth of sports though so I'd love to see you guys over there  and I got plenty of the things to tell you about but I'll do that mid show because right now I know you guys want to hear what's going on with this trade  let's start with the easier side the easier side of this trade is the Rosier side because Scary Terry as many folks know him for  reasons I don't know beyond that scary and Terry Ryan is likely to do less in Miami then he was doing in Charlotte he's been playing for a team that's not playing for anything he's been very efficient this year a real nice Spike back to  honestly these are Heights that he had never reached before thanks to an Incredible 2 point shooting percent this year  but more than anything you know he's taking 18 19 shots a game which is where he's been the last two years last season you saw his efficiency fall through the bottom of the barrel  it seemed like it was because Charlotte was basically missing all of their other offensive weapons there was no careful how I phrase it there was no miles Bridges there was no mellow ball last year so he's basically on his own this year  there have been stretches with no lamelo yes he missed whatever it was six seven weeks but by and large Terry's actually had other people near him on the court someone else on the floor that can actually draw a little bit of attention  and then some of it is just luck guys have good shooting years guys have bad shooting years these things level out a little bit  what's important to remember is what's switching places here the heat didn't give up any of their High usage guys Jimmy Butler Tyler here Obama are all still there so there's just simply no chance that Rozier rolls into Miami and gets 18 plus shots per game because basically nobody in Miami gets 18 shots per game I think Tyler hero is the leader in field goal attempts on that team right now hero is at 1918.9 then you got out of Bio at 15.7 Jimmy Butler had only 13 and a half  there aren't 18 plus shots of available to Rozier  he'll take other people's stuff like Josh Richardson may just not play anymore he was taking eight shots fine maybe give all eight of those two Rozier or does he get a few from Hopkins or does he take one from Butler and one from out of bio and one from here and like they'll find a way to get him into the teams  but it's not going to be the high teams anymore  where does that mean ends up well I wouldn't it's not panic time for Rozier you know he's having this outstanding outstanding season to this point he's at 23 points four boards six and a half assists 1.5 defensive stats almost three three-pointers a game on 46 85 splits that's been amazing and we always kind of knew it was going to come down we just didn't really know how it was gonna come down  he's number 37 and 9 cat right now so let's just do some math at the moment he's a 23.2 points on 18.3 shots per game and 4.33 throws if you just by the way he's also playing 35 and a half minutes per ball game which may or may not hold you know Miami's main guys are all under that Mark at a bio at 35 is the highest for the heat so assume Rosie's minute total is all going to come down a little bit I'd expect his shots fall from 18 probably to more like 13 14 range  anything over that you can consider yourself a little bit fortunate and that's a big drop off your effectively shaving 25% off of what he's done  so just take that and apply it to the ball in hand categories meaning scoring threes assists and the percentages  and then you have I think a pretty good idea of a rough it's Fuzzy Math to be sure because you know you want to get into the deep deep Weeds on this you're going to almost definitely get something wrong if you're going to Fuzzy Math this you take about five to six points away so put in more in the 17s come from three down to like maybe 2.2 2.3 it's possible those actually stay higher if his field goals come farther away a sister gonna drop six and a half is definitely coming down because he was the primary for a long stretch this year with no lamelo ball and now he's the fourth  option and still I would argue probably the third point guard he kind of option on the heat so take those six and a half assists and probably drop them by about one and a half call it maybe more even four and a half five is probably any reasonable Target  the field goal percent become a slightly smaller and negative the free throw percent becomes a slightly smaller positive you're now looking at someone that still putting up okay numbers call it you know 17 points  call it 2.84 3-pointers still four rebounds fine you can leave those I don't care just him a little bit if you want four and a half to five assists that's this is still someone who's in a pretty good number but now you've basically just described D'Angelo Russell who's at 16 and half points six assists 4878 split so slightly lower for Rosie on one slightly higher on the other but you basically describe the Angela Russell who's number 80 on the year is that satisfying to you if Rose zero is number 80 going forward  if your answer is no I would counter with the following argument  Isn't it nice that you don't have to worry about him being shut down now  I thought  I personally I think this is a reasonable trade-off if you have Rozier on your fantasy team you should be happy about this because the months of March and April are now safe  even if a full shutdown didn't come until the final call it two weeks of the Year there were going to be rest days  there was going to be dial backs just not playing full minutes so this is better  this is 100% better than him staying put  is the best possible lame landing spot of all the teams that were looking for someone who can score I mean I'm sure we could have found some place where you'd be like oh well here's where you could actually still get 15 or 16 shots  but here's the thing Miami is competing they're the sixth seed that's a really really critical spot to want wins because you don't want to fall into the play in tournament so he's gonna be going he's gonna play as many games as humanly possible between now and the end of the year you don't have to worry about any a nebulous where will he won't he around the trade deadline it's just you're safe now  take the hit  and be okay with the safety of it  and don't complain  if you are anyone looking at Terry Rozier this is possibly a chance to and I don't think you can call it a Buy Low on him because I think somebody if you have Rozier you're probably more excited about the fact that he's not a shutdown anymore but if you come to Miami and he'll probably have a few really big ball games right at the beginning because they're going to be forced feeding him to make him feel comfortable but there's gonna be a little bit of a dip  when it settles in and he sort of the whole situation realize he's not gonna do as much as he did in Charlotte that there might be a window there to get in but I don't your threading the needle a little and I don't think that effort is really worth it  one of the questions from the chat room is does Rosie you're gonna assist bump no not over six and a half  there's just no planet where he is  exclusively point guard bald distribution and like we've seen how unbelievably difficult it is to post an assist counter than 6.6 there's basically a dozen guys in the whole NBA that are doing it right now and it's basically guys where the whole offense runs through them  the guys ahead of Rosier and assists right now  are now forget to do the very tippy top of the board like Halliburton Trey young dantec and yokich who were everything goes through them we're talking lamelo his teammate Hardin  sabonis  LeBron book Cunningham Chris Paul before he got her at Dame  unfortunately Rosie is not those guys he's not going to be like you almost everyone of those guys is either strict point guard  like Chris Paul in that list Freddy Van Vleet also in that list I skipped over for some reason or frankly hardened this year he's almost strictly point guard or the Hub on offense so Booker LeBron who's all the point guard Cade so bonus  Rozier was that well lamelo was out in Charlotte but he is not that in Miami it's gonna be Rosie's gonna be a part of a three four-headed monster that's initiating offense it's going to be ball movement based I think it's a sis actually come down from 6.6 if they stay that high you call it a massive massive win and I don't think that they will here on the other side you've got Kyle Lowry headed to Charlotte and they've already talked about how they're gonna try to shuttle him along to a new place and if they don't he'll probably be a victim of the buyout Market which is smaller by the way now the new collective bargaining agreement says that the high apron which stuff that I don't completely understand but teams that are over a particular salary threshold cannot get guys on the buy-out market so it's a smaller one  but  that also means so this like created two different things it  these teams that are spending a ton of money  they can't just sit back and wait for guys to fall in their lap the way that they could in the past  but it also means that they're not  well it also means that if they actually want somebody then they have to go trade for them so you might see one of these really high spending teams offer up a second round pick to get someone like a Kyle Lowry before he hits a bio Market that's much narrower there are only like five or six teams that consider themselves Championship contenders that aren't over that salary threshold  but I don't care wherever Kyle Lowry goes he's not going to be putting up fantasy values so you can just ignore that basically all together I don't need to be playing much in Charlotte and I don't think he's going to be playing a ton wherever he ends up the questions I'm getting a ton of in the chat room on Twitter is about Nick Smith who was a late first round pick for the Hornets this year and has done a couple of things so far this season but not very much there was like one or two games in there I think a couple of weeks ago I made a joke at and somebody on Twitter was like why are you being such a meanie to Nick Smith like well  because he has the most generic name on planet Earth and I haven't really seen him play at all  he's played in 26 games so far this year most of them a very limited minute it's his minutes of trended up a little bit lately you get a 19-point game right around Christmas or he hit five three-pointers he had a 15-point game on January 8th or he hit three three-pointers  but I would point out a few things about Nick Smith the main thing is that Nick Smith has played 391 basketball minutes this year and has three steals  rut row  that's not many  that's an obscenely low number actually and I've got to think that that probably comes up a little bit as he figures out the NBA game but if you're getting all hot and bothered about a Nick Smith add in a nine cat format I think maybe you might want to pump your brakes a little bit  not just because his minutes are not going to be guaranteed here and I think by the end of the trade deadline he probably does end up playing a decent amount because woj also tweeted and I don't have this one on speed dial here for the for those watching on video  that the Hornets have basically said we're not done we're gonna be trying to amass stats we're going to or pics I should say not a mass stats that's what we want our fantasy guys to do they're gonna be trying to ask pics so they'll be trading the likes of Gordon Hayward presumably or waving him they're trying to move miles Bridges because he's about to take some money and I don't have that many other  contract slash old guys that they could do anything with but anybody that that's sort of not attached they'll they'll be trying to move meaning everybody but little mellow ball and Brandon Miller and probably Mark Williams is available in some capacity  but here's the problem with all of that we've kind of seen the Hornets with everybody out and we've seen a couple of Nick Smith you know 25 to 32 minute ball games  and they were only okay  which doesn't necessarily preclude him from having an interesting stretch run in silly season mode  but it does mean that if we're all going oh my God Nick Smith it's Nick Smith it's Nick Smith  I want us to to look closer  most of the time guys playing low minutes go really really hard in their moments  and so far this year Smith and 15 minutes of ball game is averaging six and a half points 1.7 rebounds and assist and point four defensive stats  and that's largely because he had like one or two games mixed in there where he blocked two or three shots I think he had like a two block game mixed in and a couple of ones all clustered together right at around the turn of the year otherwise and like listen I know the minutes are not all that high but Nick Smith has not had a defensive stats since January the 8th  that's seven games where he's played something like 105 minutes zero defensive stats  you guys know how hard it is to have nine category value with almost nothing on the defensive side  it is so hard  it is so obscenely difficult to basically just complete throw away and we're not talking about low we're talking about like none  this is like Kris Dunn scoring Four Points a game this is like somebody averaging like one rebound again  it's crazy difficult to have fantasy value if you are that close to a 0 in two categories and we'll add on top of that the fact that it's not like he's going to be a field goal percent wizard a rookie that isn't getting to the rim all the time he'll go percent is good to be low  he's chucking threes and he has a good 3-point percentage so far this year shooting 46% from downtown even if we very liberally assume that that could continue  he'll go percent is going to be low  and a sister probably gonna be low if lamelo ball is upright would presumably they would come up a little bit as guys get put on the Shelf put in shrink wrap for the rest of the year  and I don't mean to be Captain buzzkill or anything uh  but like again if you if you guys just do this exercise with me like how far down the board do you have to go to find the first nine category player who's averaging under one combined defensive stats per ball game  how far do you have to go  I did not prepare this before the show so we're just doing it  cat and Jaylen Brunson are like the first two you come across that are at one point two  but still over one  are we guaranteed that Nick Smith won't hit one I mean you know 30 minutes of ball game he could probably get to one  but again we're down talking about a guy who's probably gonna score in the teen's very get a couple of rebounds and a few assists and very low defensive stats and very low field goal percent we don't even really know about free throws because what is he taking like three four the entire season or something like that  if you're relying on a young guy with a  obtuse percentages and few defensive stats you're basically going all the way down the board to  like a poor man's version of Austin like Austin Reeves if he didn't have good percentages  I don't know that Nick Smith can get inside the top 100 as his game is currently constructed now if you're again we can do this points League argument or we can do this nine cat this category League argument  and say okay if I'm hunting this this and this then okay at five it works  but again it's really needle threading I added him in a points league for whatever that's worth you guys want to know what I'm doing I did not add Nick Smith in any nine category formats because I don't think that is game is gonna translate quickly and like with most rookies you're giving them three four months to figure it out he's only played again a few hundred minutes that's not nothing  and now the chat room is asking Dan what about Brandon Miller he's also a rookie are you as down on him the answer there is no  for a couple of reasons number one is that he's already played what three two to three times as many minutes as Nick Smith in their careers to this point the learning curve has been shortened for Miller he's already had a number of games where he's learning the NBA speed also of note we know Brandon Miller is a decent free throw shooter he's at 82% on the year we know he can knock down some threes you know field goal percentage is not going to be a very good we know that in starters minutes he's at one point two combined defensive stats which isn't great but it's not going to break you we also know that in starters minutes he's gonna get you four rebounds maybe a few more than that depending on how time and playing time shakes out here you know he's gonna get you two plus assists there's already a knowledge built-in  could Nick Smith get to what Brandon Mueller is doing  I find it hard to believe that he can  do the rebounding that Miller's at which I know is only four in 30 minutes of ball game but as guys continue to get out of the way Miller's gonna continue to feel more comfortable doing more we know that he's a decent free throw shooter presumably for Miller you could see the field goal percent start to tick up little by little because of that learning curve thing  now he's largely rostered so this is a discussion that you probably don't really need but listen I got to do all of these shows like somebody's watching for the very first time so let's wrap this thing up we've done 20 minutes on the trade  tarot Rozier gonna take a hit but you don't have to worry about the shutdown anymore so take a deep breath Kyle Lowry probably not gonna play in Charlotte if he does it'll be very little wherever he ends up it'll probably also be relatively little don't worry about him Brandon Miller is the guy you want to make sure is on a roster somewhere he's already like 55 60 I think ish percent rusted so he's not gonna be available in that many of your League's but you never know he's available in one out of my think like 11 league so again there's a possibility and then Nick Smith Jr who I think people are like are probably getting too excited for because they really want to be able to do something related to this trade is going to get an uptick but I don't think it's gonna get him inside the top one 25 and 9 cat I think it gives him an outside shot at points League value Brandon Miller's gonna have a lot of points League value by the way and that's where I think I stand on this trade  um before we get into the the box score stuff from yesterday because that that's still needs to happen I want to finally take a moment to welcome everybody to the podcast this is fantasy NBA today it's the Terry Rozier breaking news Edition but we're all going to review yesterday's scores which did actually involve a

hanging out over there that link is all so in the show description lot of really fun ways to hang out with the very very sharp folks that follow Sports ethos on Twitter and on YouTube we have one new viewer today asking what's with the outdated draft list in the back I'm so glad that that comes up once every couple of months on the show this was the draft board from 2020  so this was the covid draft  those of you that have followed me back then and now it's a long time ago we did a I normally leading into the season I do an industry wrote a mock draft but that year like first of all the offseason was like six weeks long which was crazy because the Lakers won the championship and what like the end of October and then everybody was back at training camp and the beginning of December  uh anyway I  put together that industry mock  and I reached out to the guys at FJ fantasy I think they may have contacted us at one point say hey you guys want to help us run this thing and sure enough they said yes so the logo for their companies just off screen here that's not on purpose it's just the way that the camera worked out today so we put this thing together and they did the board on zoom while their rested all the analysts were making their picks on zoom and at the end of it I was like where are you guys know like we're in Cleveland I was like um  how much are gonna cost to ship me that board because on the other side of this board those of you guys that have watched this show a lot you already know what I'm gonna say  is my bedroom because I'm in a two-bed two-bath apartment in West Los Angeles with two kids who share the other bedroom down the hall that used to be my office meaning my office now is jammed into about let's see my arms stretches there that's the wall and then right here is where just like the rest of the room begins so whatever my wing span is plus about seven inches is the width of my office and the depth of my office is this which I'm touching  to right behind the camera  I ain't got room but anyway that's the board it's hilarious you can see where certain like LaMarcus Aldridge is right back there  there's Lamarcus  John Collins was a second rounder that year see if I can get that point right it's hard for me to do it backwards so thank you that's I always have fun talking about this silly draft board and I plan on keeping up forever because every year we get farther away from it it gets funnier  or at least I think so  I don't know  maybe you guys disagree  anywho let's talk about yesterday shall we there's the Charlotte game let's talk with the Charlotte game actually since that's a nice segue into doing the breakdown  you see Brandon Miller had a big ball game mostly because of very good shooting we're gonna need him to do more and the rebounding and assist departments but I have some confidence that he will especially as someone like a miles Bridges maybe gets out of the way do they I don't know what they do with PJ Washington I think they just brought him back but presumably if they can get something for him they would do it so again like you're clearing the deck here what if PJ Washington is gone what if Nick Richards gets moved and Mark Williams doesn't come back to you pick up someone like a Nathan mensah or JT Thor  not yet not yet do you pick up an ish Smith know  in the short term lamelo ball miles Bridges PJ Washington Brandon Miller all very reasonable plays right now and I don't know that you I mean even if Nick Smith does start getting the start now with Terry Rozier gone I don't know that immediately he makes a ton of sense anyway as we just talked about a moment ago but all so in this ball game and it's so funny that like the headline today  is  not the fact that we had two centers scores 60 or 70 points yes today but cat had 62 and then basically the whole team got called out by their coach for playing selfish and unmotivated basketball and this was like  okay guys what do you think happens to the Wolves if they give Mike Conley a day of rest  tuta unfocused and unserious basketball my Conley to me like there's no chance that you would ever get an MVP vote because his numbers aren't big enough but he is undoubtedly the most important player on the Timberwolves not the best not the most exciting not the most like basketball important but the most overall team importance is Mike Conley every time that the wolves have had like a ridiculous joke of an effort game Mike Conley is the one that wakes him up and fixes it  and he wasn't there for this one and it burned him  so there you go um we we just had some weird breaking news that will get into in a moment here related to Tristan Thompson but not gonna have any bearing on anything otherwise for the Wolves you know have to worry about a whole lot here you know Mike Conley was out nickeil Alexander Walker got the start and got really hot from three but overall you're not actually doing anything with that and now we can Retreat to the top of the board and we'll start with game number one and we'll move through this stuff a little bit quick because honestly yesterday there was like one in my eyes really important fantasy story and then a lot of really big lines from people that are 100% Ross rostered maybe two fantasy stories anyway Milwaukee beat Detroit won 2213 it took him longer to put the Pistons away than it should have but they ultimately got him and that's fine as far as Detroit goes after Thompson is a guy you're keeping an eye on he had a very bad ball game here so I don't think you need to be out in front of it some folks are calling him a trade deadline stash yesterday I called him or on the show I  mentioned him as a possible trade deadline stash and then when I broke it down if you listen to the whole discussion on it I think he probably profiles more as a silly season type of AD but you never know the problem is that Detroit just doesn't have that many veterans that they can get out of the way Alec Burks boy on bogdanovich  end of the list at least among guys are actually playing any kind of minutes for this team and even if those guys are gone that doesn't immediately guarantee that Thompson is going to play full starters minutes  I think there will be a time later this year at that Thompson does get starters run but it might be March instead of February  Isaiah Stewart had a big game Off the Bench but I don't care because we know enough about his Fantasy game to know that these Steals and blocks are not sustainable these might be the only ones he gets for a month frankly and  yeah I'm just not I'm not buying it sorry I'm not buying it Cade Cunningham by the way supposed to be back in the next couple of ball games and then Jaden Ivy and Alec Burks are each gonna take a hit  Ivy's been sort of borderline in nine cat anyway playable in points which probably does continue after Cade comes back almost no chance that he can maintain top one 20 or better Nine cat value at that point but you'll see  Cleveland beat or Lando calves with another blowout win they are absolutely smashing teams right now eight wins in a row for the Cavs and I get it not all of them have been hyper impressive I thought this one was actually kind of an impressive win and they didn't need to play the fourth quarter again basically so Donovan Mitchell just keep putting up these colossal lines and 30 minutes of game instead of 35 number six uh in nine cats still largely because he's he remains at two steals for ballgame which I think is second or third second because Marcus Smart was second and he ain't playing for a while spite is behind Shae Gill just Alexander and not by much anymore in steals  Sam another 8 3 pointer game and I just I for better or worse I cannot get on board with this stream I know that I'm probably being short-sighted here  or long sided  by saying I just can't do it but you got to know that this type of production can't keep up for longer than a game or two  and  I mean I get it he's a very good shooter is it two and a half three pointers a game this year in 16 minutes a night so like when he gets actual minutes heating four to six three-pointers in that stretch  but there's just there's so little else and in non blowouts he's not going to play 30 minutes he's gonna play 20 and maybe you get your two three pointers there but there's probably not gonna be a whole lot but beyond that it'd be sweet if he wants someplace he could play 30 minutes but that ain't gonna happen and the calves love that they have shooting so you know three-point stream if you really need it Dean Wade is kind of a similar story Max druce showing some signs here two games in a row 50% are better now we just need a whole ball game because he's a guy that needs the 34 minutes to actually get to his value and that's basically about where you leave it no Charis Levert he'll be back relatively soon  Orlando is falling on Hard Times magic are now the eighth seed in the East remember when they were like the second or third best record reality has set in their 23 and 21 which again not bad but they've been on kind of a bad run here Wendell Carter Junior has regained control of the starting spot and so now we can get back into that same old discussion with him of can he get inside the top 100 I think the answer is no  but he could potentially get kind of like back where he was last year  which if memory serves  it was it 103 in a pretty good year  so that's probably your best case scenario  well that's a lot of things break the right way so what does that mean um nine caddy probably should be roster just to see how it goes points leagues he almost definitely should be rostered you can obviously move on from Go-Go bitossi and mo Vagner that whatever that was is done  and then Jalen Suggs is another one where every time he has a decent game I'm like all right I guess I can give him like another two games to see how this goes I think I may be at a game's on sucks he was very very good at the beginning of the year the Steels have tapered off considerably I know he had two in this ball game but it just seems like he's at a gas and I don't know if there's another way to explain it but the defense is not the same as it was early this year  maybe it's injuries piling up whatever it is he's not the same and he's way outside the top 100 for multiple weeks I think we can probably move on and I don't think someone else is going to be like someone will probably pick him up and then they'll probably move on to maybe bust out of it after the All-Star break maybe just need some time off but I mean Mark Hill faults is healthy we didn't play in this ball game but he's healthy so he's taking minutes and Cole Anthony he's taking minutes and it's just  it's kind of too many guys right now in Orlando Joel embiid put up 70 on the Spurs and it's not even the story of the night  crazy that Terry Rozier getting traded took precedent but from a fantasy standpoint that is more relevant still an absolute monster a game from Joel embiid I put on Twitter yes leave somebody proposes straight to me I'm in it a handful of  Yahoo public prize leagues  and someone actually offered me embiid in one of them before this game happened I obviously accepted the trade because it kind of doesn't matter what you're sending back if you're not sending a first round or back you pretty much take Joelle who with this colossal ball game actually moved in front of Shae Gill just Alexandra and me now the number one player in fantasy sports this year and that is a big drop off between Shea and yokich but like  how ridiculous man this dude is ridiculous  he was great in every respect and he did it on one turnover  wild stuff uh we've learned again that Kelly oubre is not usable here when I'm being in Maxi are healthy and hopefully we get the Anthony Melton back and they're not too distant future over on this first side really cool game for Victor weapon Yama up to 28 minutes that's a good sign Trey Jones got hurt but the word out of the locker room was that he wasn't bad so hopefully only small amount of time missed I guess we'll see Spurs have sort of no reason to push anybody through stuff but you're holding Trey Jones at least until we learn what's going on because he's been very very good since moved into the starting lineup Jeremy Sohan was decent in this ball game not great but decent he's been on a pretty hot run lately  and I think a lot of that has to do with having an actual point guard orchestrating that first unit first unit has been a lot better with Trey Jones to know when surprise  I'm trying to do a better job of being okay with streaming hot players and so on his hot right now so go ahead and stream him while he's hot just realized that it may run out relatively soon  we do have some new news by the way there's other injury news that will get to do that after getting through this this recap here that I'm trying to get through kind of quick Memphis is always interesting and Santi aldama was going to be the story actually fantasy wise he was as the games were happening last night before I saw him bead score 71 points the thing I was gonna talk about in the thumbnail art for this game was gonna be Santi aldama who started from Memphis I think some of that I had to do with playing against the Toronto team that doesn't have a traditional Center you'll probably see Xavier Tillman play center so they can preserve Jaron Jackson at least in Hill until he gets shut down  but now we know at least if they'll Thomas healthy that Memphis is willing to go small in the starting five against smaller teams  and in my eyes that's actually really big piece of news and I was gonna say hey we got all go pick up Santi aldama because if he's gonna start some games you know he's gonna get like 20 some odd minutes off the bench even when he's a reserve he's probably gonna play 23 24 minutes  if he doesn't get hurt in this ball game as a starter he's probably going 28 to 32 range and you know he has fantasy Value Inn 30 we saw that last year we've seen it first sort of fits and starts this year when Obama gets 30 minutes it's a really well-rounded line points boards some assists some steel some blocks it a three I like him a lot as somebody to I don't know if you want to say he's a full blown add right now but he's awfully close now the injury is a bummer  he was just dealing with some nice soreness I don't like when it's sort of a nebulous we don't know what the injury is scenario but I like his Fantasy game when he's getting minutes and so you know I think  if you can do it you should try to stash aldama  but if we get a bad report then I see you can flip on that and if you sort of strap for Ross or slots then that's the reason why you wouldn't but I loved the fact that he got to start and I mean you can game it out a little bit you can try to figure out who Memphis is playing are they gonna be playing traditional big men like they got the Heat next what I'll dama have started with they let him or JJ deal with bam know they probably go big there and then the magic they could go small there the Pacers they could go small their kings you need a big against a bonus calves probably need a big Warriors you could go small  Celtics you need a big Nicks you could probably go small right now all the who knows a hard time anyway so you just started gaming it out like how many of these games do you think aldama could start half I would've been good enough if he stayed healthy so that's the whole let's get a report if the report is ah you know might play in the next one then I'm probably adding him  I like JJJ here while he's still going it's sort of Jaron Jackson against the universe yet a nice seven defensive stat ball game he's up to number 41 by the way in nine cat and he's been  amazingly healthy so far this year I think Jaren it is number 32 by totals  so it actually hasn't been the disaster that everybody's claiming it's been but it might be here in the not too distant future because there's almost no way that he gets through the whole season without a bunch of rest days and then probably a shut down very late in the year still if you can get a few more games like this because I don't think they're shutting down before the All-Star break and they're probably not doing it immediately after that but you might start to see those built-in rest even on back-to-backs  you could probably get someone in the 40s or 50s form right now even and that's I mean you take the loss but again you sort of it's like the same thing with Rosie you get out from the wrist at the end but if you lead guns early or if you're in Roto or whatever you can also still play it out Vince Williams is a star Luke Kennard is a start someone was asking me my thoughts on GG Jackson and I I've said them a few times but I'll repeat it very quickly he's gonna be very inconsistent his minutes are going to be inconsistent scoring is going to be inconsistent I was not on board with that one  as far as the Raptors go they need Turtle back because the whole Center situation is but that young had a nice one here but he and jaunty Porter and and no one have been sort of alternating in three one every three games being okay Gary Trent only 24 minutes that's not gonna get it done Dennis Schroder only 22 minutes that's all so not gonna get it done we need Bruce Brown out of the way and it sounds like that's still a very distinct possibility because Scotty Barnes RJ Barrett a manual quickly are all going to get big minutes and pearl will probably play in the mid to high 20s when he comes back which only leaves enough for a little bit else and if Schroeder Bruce Brown and Trent are all fighting for the same 65 minutes that's one too many people's  what does that mean in terms of how you use your roster slots they're probably both shooter is the easier call here of someone you should sit on through the trade deadline because Bruce Brown gets moved his value comes back up to that kind of like one 15 range Gary Trent is the one where we really don't know because I need him to play 30 minutes and I also need him to get a dozen shots and neither one of those things is a guarantee he's a sort of traditional you know 15% chance that hits trade deadline stash kind of guy  Boston beat Dallas no Real Surprises with the Celtics ever  Chris stop sat this one out on the back-to-back so I'll Horford got the fill-in easy peasy for Dallas Kyrie Irving Luka doncic and Derek Lively are startable Lively's losing some minutes to Maxi kleeba but generally we've seen that Lively can be top 100 in about 24 25 minutes a game which is what he played in this one I think your actual fear with Lively is not chleba but the Mouse trading for a big man which we've heard multiple times there on the prowl baby they're looking at Daniel Gafford they might even look at someone in Charlotte if it's you're going a little bit younger there but like a Nick Richards would be interesting there's only a couple years into the league  the house where we just talkin' about the other day I already forgot forgot the name somebody more oh Clinton capella was the more expensive option  I don't I mean Turtle would be a slightly more expensive option if Toronto goes that direction  be great for all of those guys fantasy value  well not say great but be fine and that is the wings go here it sounds like Dante exam might be back by tomorrow for the Mavs and nobody's really grabbed that job by the horns Josh Greene was not very good in his fill-in work here Tim Hardaway Jr I think prefers coming off the bench Derek Jones junior is kind of Hit or Miss  I've said on this podcast many times and I'll say it again I don't think any of those these guys including eggs them is gonna be inside the top 100 rest of season but if any of them has a shot it would be excellent  Kevin Durant game winner 40 Burger second game in a row turns out friends Kevin Durant still good at basketball he's right behind Luca by the way for sliding into the eighth spot in nine cat  one more big ball game from KD or a slow game from Luca or Kauai and Durant might be your number seven player so uh yeah still good as far as fantasy stuff goes not a lot to take away from this game on either side in fact zero for me to take away on the Phoenix Side Chicago Zach LaVine out for a couple of weeks here the guys are wondering are is Patrick William's playable as a starter is Iota Sumo Gonna Get Enough run off the bench to play and the answer I think we're both of those guys is scheduled play only  which is not the case this week Chicago actually has a terrible schedule over the next through the All-Star break and like it doesn't get good again until late March nope that's not right early March sorry my days right you jerk  um  so I'm kind of on the side of no and Levine should be back or traded by then so we'll have some sort of closure on it and so otherwise Kobe white vooch Caruso DeRozan those are the four you go with  Trey young and concussion protocol so Atlanta had to try to win another one without him they couldn't do it Sacramento just as too much Firepower and this one it came from who  Harrison Barnes  trying to get itself traded  or trying to earn himself playing time probably trying to get himself traded we know he's on the Block we know the Kings and everybody around them want to move off of Barns and rightfully so he's been a ghost all year you're not adding him off of one very big ball game so no adjustments here on the king side other than to note Kevin herters little like three game hot run probably over you could move on their Darren fox really poor ball game here he has remember when foxes like number 12 I said yep that night he's number 405 because these things just they always loved off  he's having a great year and a lot of respects but the free throw percentage is still killing you field goal percent ended up being a negative as expected he's still over 33 is a game which that's remains somewhat surprising to me I think there's a chance that could still dip into the twos but you know you get a point on that one fox even though you ended up rank wise  right where I said  and then as far as the Hawks go  they ran a lot of a Congo in this game because capella was just getting run right off the court  and  so the problem of course here is that I'll Kong was not as good defensively as capella he is a much better offensive option better passer out of the short roll actually can space the floor a little bit he's not like a dead eye 3-point shooter but he can step out and and hit a jumper which capella very much cannot  but like if I want we all want capella gone from the Hawks we want him somewhere else so Kong who can run free and post massive fantasy lines the problem is that if the Hawks still have any intention of winning games they need to have somebody big they can throw out there and oh Congo was not that big he's big ish  Capella's big  and you need a dude to combat big guys so they tried nothing was really slowing down Harrison Barnes yesterday and nobody was really gonna stop him on his opponents who you know I mean to Capella's credit into the Hawks credit it's a bonus 21 rebounds but by all accounts he didn't have that great of an offensive game  what do the Hawks do if they run up against anybody with size and all they have is oh well they'll just get steamrolled of course the other side of this is  pull the plug and rebuild maybe rebuild around Trey young again sort of tear it down start over that's probably the smart move because they're 18 and 25 they're half game up on the Nets for the 10 spots those two teams that seems like are going to be the teams fighting for that last play in and it's like okay well anything can happen but can it though when you stink  can anything happen  you can't be in that middle spot  that's the worst  but are the Hawks willing to do it could you go back and build her on Trey young and Jaylen Johnson and on yeco Kang woo and could you trade bogged on both donate and Deontay Murray and Clint capela and who would come back in a situation like that and who would step up  let's just say this DeAndre Hunter is probably your best bet of a hawk who's currently not inside the top 100 that post deadline has a shot to be inside the top 100 because if they moved to Shante Murray or anybody else or a combination thereof then you look at a guy like Hunter who runs very hot and cold and suddenly 11 shots of games becomes 12 and a half some Small Bump like that but he's been relatively efficient and maybe 30 minutes becomes 31 so four rebounds becomes 4.4 or something like that these very little things 1.2 defensive stats goes to 1.3 and 15 points become 16 and a half and these just these little things add up and push him inside the top 100 he is not particularly heavily rostered  for good reason because he hasn't been that great this year but if anybody in the Hawks that's currently not playable every day has a shot to be playable every day it's probably Hunter  and now quickly here a couple piece is a news on the injury front from this morning Isaiah hartenstein his foot soreness has been upgraded or altered to left Achilles tendinopathy which you don't want to hear Achilles  uh yeah you want that at all  so they'll be cool there as far as the Knicks go like mini you picking up Jericho Sims for a spot start  I don't think that I would  but you never know  Tibbs loves his traditional big man lineup so it's possible  that Sims could be  teetering on some small amount of value when did that injury happen with that back on Saturday  that was back on Saturday in their win over Toronto right so Sims played two and a half minutes in that game  I didn't even say a hard time left a little more than halfway through  I mean they generally went small pressure to chewa is the other option there he had 18 and 11 in that game on Saturday but we've watched precious enough in Toronto to know that his Fantasy game has these gaping holes in it uh  all right so let's play this little game to wrap up our show today here is the precious Ochoa rundown I want you guys to look at his game log this is this is the best way to get a feel and look for a games where precious to a played 24 minutes and what he did 24 or more  and the answer was like 13 and 5 missed some free throws this is in Toronto five and nine with a couple of steals  8 and 8  like is that really a game changer is 18 points this year I think was the fourth time he's had double that's not true he's had like double maybe the 5th or sixth time he said double digit scoring but it was the the season high it's 17 and 10 against Charlotte with Toronto and you can do the same game for last year because there were more games actually was playing big minutes he had a stretch in in January last year in Toronto where he was playing 3536 minutes a game and it was still in that same neighborhood of like 17 and 10 with a couple of steals and generally missed a bunch of free throws and the field goal percent was better last year than previous Seasons he had had a nice uptick to 40 what is it 46% after being a 44 the year before that it's field goal percent is somewhat unpredictable is basically what I'm getting at his free throw percent has bounced between 59 and 70 we have no idea what the reality is there  you're looking at rebounds and Steals and maybe some points  I guess the question then becomes do we think it can actually play 30 minutes or is it going to be like 23 for a Chua and then a couple for Sims and like 15 for Julius Randle at Center  because if that's what happens then it was not even close  points you could you got a better shot at it because the free throws the turnovers for two are always too high for a guy who actually does what he does on a basketball court so points I'm okay with you taking a shot on it I don't think that I would use one of your four weekly moves on him but given the news here that art and Stein might miss a couple of ball games and you like all right well okay what am I looking at where is New York schedule land here can I wedge in a few ball games and the answer is sorta they played three times over the next five days today Thursday and Saturday and then they've got a four game week next week but I'm doing the next are hoping they have hard time back by that one so nine cat I'm not making a run at him nine cat if I'm hunting say free throws  maybe you got an outside shot  and points leagues I think you can probably say why the hell not  okay um  that'll be that  that was fun we did a recap we did a trade we did oh no wait the other piece of news which is not gonna have any bearing on anything Tristan Thompson just got suspended 25 games for violating the NBA's anti-drug program  um I don't I was looking for the press release  and he tested positive for  immutable Warren and sarm lgd 4033  I think those are  like HGH type stuff  um but I admit I don't know that's the first I've heard of beauty tomorrow in here a beautiful morning is a potent long acting orally active selective and non peptide Agonist of the gorilla receptor and a growth hormone secreted God mimicking the growth hormone stimulating action of endogenous hormone okay so it is a is a hormone replacement deal so that's that's sort of HGH adjacent it would appear and then sarm lgd that's what I mean now we're just making things up sarm lgd what the hell is that again draw  Androgen receptor um so that's all  to replace muscles so that's all so sort of regrowth thing this is bodybuilding stuff this is a performance enhancing drugs as opposed I know we've had some players suspended in the past for for performance de drugs  doesn't change anything it's just dumb  you know we move on but it is weird news for the day Chris Dunn by the way also downgraded to a questionable due to illness
