welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast good day to you all the music ran out on this one because I'm in no hurry at all it's Tuesday  February the 20th  still on the All-Star break so just floating along through these  few grueling harrowing days without  basketball to cover I  I hated man  I get to the I get to the end of the regular season and I'm like yeah okay finally I get to relax a little bit and legitimately  one week later I'm ready for basketball to be back one week  that's all I need I know the players need a longer off so he's in and plus we got the playoffs to  venture through  but I want fantasy to come back as soon as it goes  and such as the case here for the All-Star break I'm ready for games to be back I felt like I don't know something about last week felt easier I don't know why maybe it's because the game's you know they go to Thursday so I have plenty of content lined up and this week I gotta like  really dig in figure what the hell we're talking about without games going on but I thought and I have  sort of a two-parter today's episode this is the shutdown risk and sell High combo platter because it does all kind of roll into one and it Bend to some degree some of this is going to depend on whether or not your League's trade deadline has happened already so you know you got that to worry about but more than anything it's sort of things to keep an eye on and then upcoming show we'll talk a little bit about possible Silly Season winners which is kind of like the second half of this if somebody gets shut down there's probably going to be a silly season winner on the back end of that  but we're not gonna do that all in one show it's too much  it's way too much show if I want to do a half an hour show on each of those you guys know that I end up talking longer than I planned to  so I don't  I can't plan to go into a show with like a 75 minute outline because then it's bound to be a two-hour episode so you guys are busted into two halves welcome to Fantasy NBA Today everybody I am Dan Bass Pros d a n b e s b r i s s over on the Twitter this is of course a sports ethos presentation and as far as organization goes on today's episode it's pretty straightforward  this is a list of guys that have the potential to be shut down but before we even get to that because there's other fantasy stuff we need to talk about we need to worry or no worries so much but we need to just dig in a little bit on the concept of the shutdown as a whole  what does it mean  and does it happen nearly as much  as folks feel like it does  so the idea of the shot down and I think many of you know where I'm going with this  typically it is a player  on a team that has been eliminated from playoff contention or is very close to being eliminated  you know because mathematically like you're blurring the lines a little bit  that's been in the league for at least a few years typically  and kind of has no reason to play out the string  a perfect example of this and it's someone that will talk about again on today's show is Jeremy Grant  who has  been languishing on terrible teams  but basically forever since his nuggets run that was the bubble nuggets it by the way if I was ever gonna start a boy band we'd call ourselves the bubble nuggets  Jeremy Grant was a  well above average role player on that 2019 2020 nuggets team that really took a step forward during their playoff push  almost sort of a long side yoga kitchen Jamal Murray almost pushed them past the Lakers in the bubble and then when got paid a bunch of money to go to Detroit and got a bunch of money here in Portland  and over the last four seasons one of them of course was a 72 gamer that was the season immediately following the Bubble Run he played 54 games in that one missed 18 out of 72  it's about 25% or so played 47 out of 82 the following year  63 out of 82 last season on a Portland team that had  a column light aspirations until they went into a full tank late and he's at currently at 47 games played this year which is not an unhealthy number the Blazers played 54 so he's only missed you know a handful of them to this point but who cares about what he's missed to this point the Blazers are 15 and 39 there was really no doubt going into this year that they were going to be a tank team they're 12 and a half games out of a playoff spot so mathematically by you know the second to last week in March they'll almost be mathematically they might even be mathematically eliminated by that point  so maybe this is a thing that creeps up at mathematical elimination  but  the point is and and look we've we've covered this ground here on Jeremy Grant already so I don't need to sort of cycle back through it even though he's gonna be one of the first names on the list we talk about  this is an example of it happening  there are a lot of examples many of it not happening  and some of them has to do with  you know how we come into a fantasy season there's this idea of like oh well I'm gonna try not to draft players on teams that are likely tanking because then maybe I get screwed by that towards the end of the year but there's all these things that can happen along the way last year the Thunder didn't tank  they had every reason to to try to go get Victor or someone up high in this draft and they didn't do it  a lot of folks avoided that Thunder  last season  and they didn't take  last season it seemed like the Blazers were going to try to compete  and they did tank at the end of the year  they just called it  the Mavericks tanked at the end of last season  because they didn't want to make the play-in tournament and I think there was some draft Capital that was also on the line  I bring all that up because there's a difference  in analyzing the concept of the shutdown  on February 20th then there is an analyzing the concept of the shutdown on September 20th  because on September 20th you could  try to pick eight or nine teams that you don't think are going to be in contention but you just don't really know what they're going to be doing with their guys or frankly whether those guys are even going to be on the team the second half of the year  Terry Rozier is not on the Hornets anymore you may have avoided him because of a fear of a tank and now he's hurt and he hasn't been as good in Miami but  he's not shutting it down  little things like that happened constantly  the Spurs there may have been a fear of a Victor wembanyama shut down which doesn't really seem like it's going to be the case Spurs have been largely playing there I mean he's been on a minute's capacity took a few back-to-back odds back-to-backs off but by and large you know Wendy's playing games he's at 49 games so far this year he's you know right up there at a reasonable numbers Miss six that's not that much 10% of their games roughly 12% something like that  not a big deal  the Blazers to this point  have had a lot of guys hurt  they've been a much worse team the Grizzlies weren't supposed to be tanking at all this year new job was gonna miss 25 games with a suspension but you figure they try to stay afloat and then he'd come back and they'd make a run well they were terrible out of the gate Mark got hurt twice  Joc came back and then immediately was lost for the season what two and a half weeks later something like that Steven Adams never played a game to start the year  Desmond Bane got hurt mid-season he may or may not come back  it's very hard to know who was shut down player is going to be in September we're going to get a lot of those wrong and so avoiding the things outside of the extraordinarily obvious ones is a recipe for disaster  the obvious ones were  you know the Wizards were a pretty reasonable one you know they were going into a full rebuild so  yeah still worried about that  you might have thought the Jazz were going into a maximum rebuild but then they've been competitive again and they'll probably pull the plug on some guys here but who exactly  so that's what today's show is about today's show is not to try to convince you that a shutdown is something that you should be worried about long-term in fact I would hope that one of the takeaways from today's episode is that you should be feeling quite the opposite about shutdowns  in reality they're way less common  than  this like this time of year would have us think the problem is that we see them they're one of the last things you see before you go into the offseason and so it's one of the freshest things in your mind when you start to think about the next season oh I got burned by so and so not playing down the stretch well here's the thing I'll say it again before we get into the actual players on Today Show one head to head leaks and your season 3 weeks early this stuff becomes a much smaller deal the teams that are doing it right now most notably Memphis was not a team that everybody thought was going to shut down anyway  so avoiding all those players you wouldn't have done it regardless  Roto who cares pick up a weirdo replacement they do just fine  but far fewer players tend to shut down then people think at the beginning of the year everybody's got a list of like 30 guys there on draft night and then you get to late March and it's like six dudes  let's get into today's list and hopefully I can convey a little bit more about what this means  also will make it a little bit bigger there we go  first of all follow me on social at Dan best person please do

seconds and it goes a long way towards continuing the growth of fantasy NBA today and sports ethos as a whole  my list of shutdown risks are one two three four five six seven names that's it right now and there may be some other ones that creep in like you might see someone in Toronto  get a game off here and there you might if the Rockets fall out of contention I think they're gonna keep fighting as long as they can you might see that team possibly start to embrace it  I don't think the Nets get to that point not with the coaching change rock on getting fired yesterday so you basically got the Pistons the Wizards the Hornets who have already pulled the plug on everybody of name recognition in the Eastern Conference with us you know honorable mention to the Raptors the Grizzlies the Blazers and then sort of the Spurs but again they don't really have veterans left out there and those are the only teams you got to worry about now  and then even within those teams there aren't that many names left and in fact there's only one younger player on my list here and that players a guy who's been dealing with a knee issue all season long and again like they're so far out of it that yes they'd like to get their young guy more playing time but probably preserving his health is the bigger issue  Portland is probably the easiest one here because we've seen Jeremy Grant do this for three seasons in a row so this kind of no reason for us to think that he wouldn't do it for a fourth season in a row DeAndre ayton also on that same team who I would venture to say is a slightly lower risk of shutdown because he's already missed 17 ball games  so exactly how many more does he actually need to not play to feel like he's like well rested going into the offseason so I don't know that that's the thing that happens but you've got Jeremy Grant and you've got DeAndre in Portland for the team that if you had to guess will be mathematically eliminated with about well let's see what did I just say they were there 12 and a half games out now that probably gets worse before it gets better so assume their 14 to 15 games out by mid-march that gives you about a month left I don't think they do takes the whole month off  but it also wouldn't be that insane to see them just start to rest every other game and then when you get to about two weeks left and you see the plug pulled entirely  Kyle kuzma and tyus Jones on the Washington Wizards are the two names that I would be concerned with Denny obvious seems like he's having a grand old time who's has basically played any time he's been healthy enough to I don't know if Jordan pools gonna stop playing because I don't know if Jordan Poole ever really started playing this year uh but keep an eye on kuzma and tyus Jones in Washington as possible guys that could go on kind of that same like taking some days off starting by the middle of next month and then most of the days off towards the end of it yaka portal in Toronto  mostly just because they're probably going to be out of it at some point so you know the different thing with Toronto here is they're not as far away from it as everybody else Raptors are five games out so if you're talking mathematical elimination you're probably talking more like you know the beginning of April so if you're season ends three weeks early this might not be one that you even need to worry about it all  Cade Cunningham for the Pistons is one that I wasn't sure I need to put on this list but then folks were kind of yelling about it on Twitter and I thought you know what yeah like he's not at playing at 100% so why are they going to push him I know they'd like to go into the offseason with a little bit of sort of the better Vibes than what they've had in Detroit over the last little bit but at the same time Vibes are not all that important so why are we so concerned about it you can fix the Vibes by having a better roster going into the start of next year and then no one will even remember whether or not Cade played down the stretch and JJJ in Memphis is one that we've sort of been eyeballing for a long time I don't know if guys like Desmond Bane Marcus Smart they have a chance to actually come back in the next few weeks do they sort of squeeze their way back into a couple of games here and there could that then ruin whatever benefits you'd get to the Silly Season players by Jaron Jackson getting himself shut down  this is why the Grizzlies have been such a pain in my rear lately they're playing everybody like 25 minutes we saw you know JJ Luke Kennard gets some time off in one of the most recent ball games  and yeah you know you got like a better iteration of Santi aldama in those but what if Desmond Bane decides he wants to come back and play like 16 minutes what if Marcus Martin wants to come back and play 22 minutes something like that  um and so you know that's really the sort of like main list that I've been keeping my eye on one of the questions in the chat room right now has to do with Larry Mark and in the Utah Jazz yeah I think that's a possibility uh one of the reasons that I'm a little bit  skeptical of it is that marketing is only played in 46 games right now  out of the Jazz 56 so you know Miss 10 easy math there  wait did I say played in 46 is that the right number triple checking myself on that marketing has played and yes he missed 10 ball games and you can miss total of 17 before you get eliminated from all the various postseason Awards so depending on how many games he played over plays over like the next three weeks and  I'll admit I don't have the Jazz schedule right in front of me here but I can pull it up pretty fast if anybody's willing to wait on my computer to do that so the Jazz come out of the break  and they've got two games later this week three next week three the week after that if you plays in all eight of those games there's no back to backs in there now you're Suddenly at March 11th and he'd be at 54 out of 64 games so 18 left and you would only need to play in like 11 of those so then you probably see Larry take the back-to-backs off the rest of the way Utah has one two  three remaining back-to-backs so that gets him to 13 games missed and again we're talking about maximum of 17 and I don't know that marketing is gonna make second third Team all NBA whatever it is he's not gonna make first team and I don't know that he's gonna get on any of the you know watch more boards for whatever rewards but I do think that he wants to get to 65 to at least put himself in position just in case so if you graded on that scale and I don't know this to be true I mean maybe he could do something totally off the rails that has nothing to do with any of this  that would leave him only four additional wiggle room games  which would basically be like the other three games the last week besides the back to back and then the game on Sunday of the penultimate week  so I don't think that that's gonna happen he's having a strong enough season where he could get in the mix for some kind of a various award lists his Larry's a 23 and a half eight and points eight and a half boards 3 threes  49% shooting 88% from the free throw line or 89% sorry marketing on reasonably high volume  and you know that was one of the other reasons why I was talking about like DeAndre Aiden this guy was already missed a bunch of ball games I sometimes I feel like these guys when they've already missed a ton they're like you know let me play a few extra down the stretch so I'm not quite as bought in on it  but maybe it happens I to me like it's better to use our energy on  the guys that have played a pretty good number of games have absolutely no reason to play out the string like as much as I love tyus Jones he's played in 54  of the Wizards game so far this year which is all of them thought he was gonna miss that one after the ankle sprained and he played in it  so yeah like he's done his part for that team  Kyle kuzma as much as I don't like his Fantasy game he gets overrated because of the points and Boards element of it he's still sits at number one oh Nine and Nine guy he's late in 52 of their 54 games he's guys but been by and large a healthy there's just no reason for them to play Beyond 65 to 70 games and so the fact that they played in this many like I just don't see a reason why they'd want to play in the last dozen games of the year a little bit couple other questions coming from the chat room on names that are not on my board  Nick Claxton is another one that came up I don't think Brooklyn is going into shutdown mode they're 21 and 33 which is bad but they're only two and a half games out of a play in spot I think you'd have to convince a lot of guys to stop caring  and considering the Vibes on this team went from not great to absolutely abysmal when they were all told to take a day off due to fatigue  a tough sell to try to tell all those guys to take the last month of the Season off they're not gonna be mathematically eliminated if at all they could very well still pass the Hawks for the last playoff spot if they get like a Kevin Ollie coaching bounce or who knows the Bulls could also fall apart they're only four and a half games back at that one it's not like the Raptors who are already five games out that's two and a half games out that's nothing in 27 ball games left there are they at 28 games left that's nothing  so I don't expect the next to shut people down if at all and if they do it'll be when mathematically eliminated like they get wiped out with three four games to go yeah you'll see them sit everybody that last week except maybe mikal Bridges who played the first quarter and then rest the rest of the ball game so no I'm not that worried about a Nick klaxon shut down because I don't think that's getting eliminated early enough for it to matter in almost any format another good question from the chat room I don't understand why the Wizards would shut down tyus Jones he's not a Difference Maker and they're already losing  the shutdown isn't necessarily to make sure you lose more it's to get other guys  more playing time  and also I would contend that he is actually a difference-maker they got a lot but I know the Wizards are still awful they're nine and 45 but they got way more competitive when they started to let tyus Jones do more stuff I don't remember the year the beginning of the year when it was all Kyle kuzma with a smattering of Jordan Poole and they were not competitive blowouts they had blowouts in 11 of their first 22 games I think one of those was a win and the other 10 were losses they're still losing plenty but they're competitive with Ty is Jones in there he is a significant difference maker for what they do and again it's about getting guys minutes it's not about necessarily losing more games these teams that are at the bottom are already losing plenty all the same time there was a gonna want to make sure that they stay below the Hornets and the Trailblazers I don't think that they'll get passed by these guys in the losing battle but anything's possible so yeah it's like it's not about the guy that can score more points in these things it's about getting dudes playing time that weren't necessarily in there anyway  also another good point made by Tomas the Nets don't even have their own picks there's absolutely no reason for them to go shut down mode not that there was anyway I'm already arguing they're not going to because the Nets are two and a half games out of a playoff spot they're not shutting people down  if someone's not playing for Brooklyn it's because they're actually hurt right now they have absolutely no reason not to try to win they're just not a good basketball team but we've seen anything over the years it's when a team with horrible Vibes fires their head coach they often win one or two games right after so look for Brooklyn to sneak a couple of wins here maybe write out of the All-Star break you might see the sort of coaching balance they're in Toronto that's a winnable game they'll probably lose in Minnesota win in Memphis they got this road trip here look for Brooklyn to maybe win like two of their next three games and everybody can feel a little bit better  but here's the thing like I made this list and you guys added a few names to it marketing you know stuff with Utah they're a possibility because we know they're still sort of more in the losing mindset that the winds are a little bit more by accident this year and he was like oh well what's the point if you're not in the bottom three the point is you want is higher draft pick as possible and you want you know a 6% chance of getting in the lottery or in the in the top three uh instead of like a 4% chance your chance goes up a little bit every time you pass a team for a worse record so to speak so yes this could still happen with Utah  um  and Victor says I'm interested to see the players to Target because these shutdowns yes Victor that will be  probably tomorrow show Thursdays at the absolute latest this is sort of a part one of players to watch on the shutdown board and then we'll do a show on who could potentially win out  and that's I think probably the logic on the most likely shut down guys and again I don't think you even see all of these guys get shut down  this is like  I think relatively comprehensive at least in terms of guys that have fantasy value right now  I do want to quickly take like three or four minutes to talk about the some possible sell highs that are not related to this shutdown board but I want to get these names in there and just you know three four minutes on on what they mean sell High names on the Knicks Donte divincenzo on Isaiah hartenstein divincenzo mostly because of the absence of Julius Randle and OG anunoby  injury  so yes you can hang on to that one  and I want you guys to make sure you're interpreting this properly this is not me saying that you absolutely positively must go trade Isaiah hartenstein I just think if you could get like a top 75 70 kind of guy for him you take a small hit in the short term because he's rolling top 50 when he's playing sometimes even a little bit better than that but you're all so escaping the possibility even the chance 2030 percent chance whatever it is that Robinson comes back and you're left with the non-us player so that's the thought process on those guys  Jonathan kaminga in Golden state that regression has already begun to hit so it may be too late on this one but you know it's not like I didn't give you guys a thousand warnings that come and go was not going to be able to keep up high volume 60% shooting he's a 50 some odd like that's that's a doable thing but he's now outside the top 140 over the last two weeks because the shooting is back down to 54% free throws are at 78% of 90 he doesn't get that many steals blocks or threes it's mostly points with a smattering of rebounds and assists and a decent field goal percent he'll be fine but you're seeing the bottom come out a little bit  don't say I didn't warn you Cam Thomas is another one on the cell High board because he's is stat set is overloaded towards well I said one category but that's kind of being needlessly mean just to make a point it's really more about him being leaning so hard into the scoring categories that people that forget about the other stuff  the nice thing about campus at least right now is that he has the starter's job so a floor for him is more like 125 now where the floor Off the Bench was like 2:25  so if you want to hang on just like with kaminga if you want to hang on and just like play a guy who's probably gonna have some fantasy value the rest of the way that's fine but when he pops off and shoots 52% in the ball game and scores 29 Points with you know four boards and seven assists and a steal and 43 pointers that's your opportunity to go try to convince somebody that he's going to be a top 65 75 range guy the rest of the way and I know what you're thinking Dan you keep talking about selling guys for that 75 range is it even worth it  and the answer in my mind is yes there are a lot of pretty good guys in that 75 range that maybe are just not that exciting and maybe fit a team build better you know if you need Camp Thomas for his scoring and you don't care about the massive field goal percent issue he puts up fine  just dial them in the rest of the way  but maybe you want someone like a Mike Conley who's the most boring top 70 player in the NBA  but damn it he stops 70 and he has been the whole freaking year  good assist good threes some steals done really hurt you and in many places at all low turnovers Keegan Murray he's slumping lately number 66 overall  Alex Caruso number 63 does it with defense  I mean honestly after a big game or two from Camp Thomas I feel pretty certain you could get those guys  you might be able to get Austin Reeves if people were worried about what Spencer didn't we might do  I'm personally not but someone might be it and then the last is the last two names on the cell High border ones that you guys are gonna yell at me about and that's okay  but I talked about them on Fridays week review show and it's Trey man and keyonte George  the reason that  they sell highs is not because I don't think they're going to be fun to roster I think Trey man and keyonte George could both be kind of fun  but because of the buzz  because they went into the All-Star break with big ball games and that's all anybody's gonna remember tremens last ball game he shot the ball exceptionally well  that's awesome  that's a window of opportunity 54% of 13 4 3 pointers in three of three at the free throw line  career 40% are from the field 79% are at the free throw line  seven rebounds a game he's averaging for Charlotte right now  I don't even careful about comes back that rebounding number is unlikely to hold  I mean I know Charlotte's not the best rebounding team so he can get in there and scoop of a few but I mean we're talking about a guy who's six three of buck 80 soaking wet you don't think eventually that's going to catch up to him it will  the assist will obviously be better like we talked about the rate of assists will be better than what it was in Oklahoma City because he's playing a lot of point guard now for Charlotte but there's a lot of unsustainable stuff there and a lot of us sustainable stuff going on for keyonte George as well these guys are shooting over their heads  and  because there isn't as much of a sample size and it's the same thing we saw with Jonathan kaminga there's a much higher likelihood for other managers in your league to convince themselves that it's a sustainable number  when we all know it just isn't  we knew comingo wasn't going to shoot 65% on 18 shots a game long term or 16 shots again whatever the hell it was just wasn't gonna happen  we know keyonte George isn't suddenly a 55% fuel goal guy he's not guys get hot guys go cold it's just it's not about these guys even these two dudes in particular the reason these guys Treman County Georgia are on the board right now is because they just changed team or one of them changed teams the other one got submits opened up  he got the starting job and some guys got traded and blah blah it's because there's an unknown  and when you have an unknown people are able to convince themselves that anything is possible  when we know  when we know that anything is not possible  very specific Windows of things are possible  but people start to think outside that  they get this sort of delusions of fantasy Grandeur oh this is who they are now this is a guy that's gonna shoot 50% in his new role  this is a guy that's going to grab nine rebounds a game out of this shooting guard spot nah  it just doesn't work that way  so anyway that's the point on all this stuff and if you have me looking at this name again the cell High board one two three four five six there's six names here  Steven shenzo could possibly after this team is healthy he probably ends up in like the 125 range hard and shine if Mitchell Robinson comes back like leaf falls back towards the edge of the top 100 or a little out of it again don't know if he's gonna come back coming up probably stays inside the top 100 but we've seen the regression hit cam Thomas probably one 25 ish maybe a little better than that Trey man can't a gorge in my opinion likely kind of in that same range in nine cat so again you're talking about you know outside of divincenzo  pretty much all these guys could just be okay rest of season players  but you want to try to capitalize and get more than what you think they might be worth so if you think kaminga is going to be a top 90 either the rest of the way but he goes on another top 25 run you settle for something in between there if you think Camp Thomas is going to settle at 115 but he goes on a two week run of top 60 you settle for something in between there that's the concept of the cell High it doesn't mean that these guys are radioactive and you need to abandon ship it just means is there a discrepancy between what you believe their rest of season numbers are going to be and what the general public hell screw the general public just one manager in your league is all you need believes their rest of season values gonna be and anything in between there is a small to medium-size win for you so see what you can do  tomorrow we'll talk about some of the possible winners yes from shut down time or Thursday we'll talk about possible winners I've got two topics to cover over the next two days and I don't know what order I'm gonna do them in so sit back relax enjoy the Ballgame and on Friday we'll talk about the very busy Thursday because we'll be back in the damn basketball hopefully we'll have some time for a
