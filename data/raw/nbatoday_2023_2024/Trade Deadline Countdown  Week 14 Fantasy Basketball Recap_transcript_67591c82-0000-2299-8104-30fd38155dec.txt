welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast oh I almost didn't get in there before the music ran out that was close that was close realized I needed to  blow my nose and get some water because to no one's surprise  there's another cold going through the best for his house that time of year somebody said something about you know having kids in the fall and winter  I don't think that's a good idea  I think having kids this time of year might be a dumb idea  just loan him out until the illness is passed  well luckily it hasn't fully nailed me yet I got the sore throat and it's just starting to move into the sinuses so we can get through this show before it really comes in and knocks me for a loop  a loop that's what my brain is doing these days well anyway welcome to the show Friends confidence  acquaintances it's Friday's edition of fantasy NBA today this is your weekend review episode of the show I am Dan vests at Dan best briefs over on social media I know some of you have still not followed me over there there's a handful of you  I'll get you yet  I bet with my net I can get you yet  I think that's basically a line from The Cat in the Hat please take a moment to go like our trade deadline live show that link is in the show description we're up to 466 we've stalled out a little bit here  but look still got 13 days so I have all the confidence in the world that we can actually get those last 34 likes because I want to get to 500  I'm thinking you guys can probably help me get there  but let's go ahead and let's start talking about some stuff this is of course we can review show we will be covering stories from the past just say week but it's not really a whole week  it's like the last four and five days basically so mostly the the midweek because the weekend stuff we've we've more or less handled already  so let's start with the ads because that's what everybody wants first anyway ads this week Jonathan kaminga and he's the cover art on this one I have thoughts on comingo who's  just playing out of his mind right now and like look he's clearly better than Steve Kerr was willing to give him credit for being even as we recently like two weeks ago  but he's also not this good over the last two weeks John in the coming is number 14 in nine cat shooting 10  well effectively 10 for 15 from the field  over two weeks  this is you know better than Nicola yokich  level  field goal positive I mean we're like it's it he's gone completely out of his mind  I suppose it depends a little bit on what  site you're using to locate this stuff but either way we're talking like you know top 20 over these couple of weeks so I'd be a little bit stupid if I didn't say yeah I mean I need to be on a roster right now because he's  at kind of the Apex of hotness  you just don't get hotter than this 65.81 splits on almost 16 shots of ball game he's gone completely nuts he is out over his skis in defensive stats  he's out over his skis by a lot and field goal percent and he's just like he's gone crazy  and there's been almost no blip  the usage is crazy high  he's coming off a game where he shot 11 of 11 against the Hawks so like again it just doesn't get any better than that and he has four Steals and two blocks in his last two ball games but he's not really a big steals or blocks guy  all of that to say and I know No One's Gonna want me here this this is actually a cell moment for because a lot of people are gonna look at this and say oh my God we don't know what we're gonna get the magic of the unknown could this do be like on top 25 guy the rest of the year I'm here to tell you know  he's not gonna be a top 25 guy the rest of the year for whatever any number of reasons you know the three-point shooting is extraordinary of late this is a 69% foul shooter who's in the 80s  so he's like a low fit he's 51 5253 percent from the field so again like 65 is  outstanding but it's more about the volume that he's doing it on 15 shots a game  no it is career he's 52% but he's on eight shots per game so everything going up Steele blocks rebounds and it's not just because there's been more playing time he's on a bona fide lava hot like surface of the Sun type of heater  we don't know exactly what he's going to be  in the Warriors offense the rest of the way it does seem like he's gonna be giving a bigger role here going forward  I don't think that he's going to go back to what he was before so grading him on that scale is also not fair  but he's not going to be what he is right now and if he's going to shoot 65% on extraordinarily high volume and he's gonna have to find a way to get back down into the low 50s Not that he's trying to get there but that's ultimately what's probably gonna happen here you're looking at some point where there's going to be some pretty high volume and the percentage is going to hurt you and then you've got both percentages hurting because again I don't think he's just magically turned into it in 80% or better for you throw shooter  the last four to six games might tell a different story  but the leaps in everything right now are what you point at and go ah  I questioned some of this  well could you get back for him that I don't know and we it may require some work on social media to figure out what people think he's gonna be  but I can pretty much promise even if you guys are like nod and nobody's that excited about it I can promise you people are excited about Johnathan and for good reason he's putting up really nice numbers right now but people are going to get carried away it's just the nature of the Beast even if it's only 20% of people that are getting carried away  that's enough for you to go kick around in your league that's two or three managers in your league that are probably willing to part with somebody of sustained reasonable fantasy value again I don't know what that number is going to be but Jonathan McGee both an ad and a cell high at the same time because of how hot he is right now  I threw dream on Greenback on this list again I don't think that that was a necessary but he's ramping up you know he's a got into like almost normal apologies for the sniffles here I'm fighting through it in this last ball game he's on his way in the right direction again I don't know that he actually stays inside the top 100 in fact if I had to put a percentage on it I'd say 30 to 35%  meaning 65 to 70% chance that he falls out the top 100 and isn't a particularly exciting play but he makes sense in certain head Bales such as punts which is one you guys know I end up falling into pretty often he  has kind of a weird fantasy profile which is interesting and then again even if he ends up at like 1:20 that's still right on The Fringe of being startled in most formats so I don't know that I need to explain this one all that much but anyway but he healed as a starter you know a lot of League's people were sort of slow to drop him when he moved back to the bench and was horrible so those folks sort of caught a break here in that he then moved back into the starting lineup when the Pacers traded for Pascal siakam and some guys got hurt and so everything sort of was coming up buddy meaning you know he just needs to be roster now as long as he's starting Buddy hield needs to be rostered when he moves to the bench we've seen his value tank but starter iteration buddy hield is typically inside the top 80 sometimes with a little upside beyond that if things are breaking right and so he's a guy that needs to be on rosters duh and then I think the two new names I got on the list this week and unfortunately because we do this show on Friday you know having Brandon Miller on this list doesn't really make sense because he's been very hot for about four games in a row so literally a week ago Friday night he came back from being hurt for about two and a half ball game and he's been in Inferno since  that not Jonathan comingo level Inferno but not all that far behind because he had an 80 11 for 13 shooting game that one in Minnesota where Charlotte inexplicably beat the Timberwolves so obviously this dude is on rosters his Roster number went up from like 35% to 70 over the last seven days but again unfortunately because I do this week in review show on Fridays Brandon Miller was quite literally the longest possible time between when he needed to be moved into the ad board and when I was able to officially do this show not to say that  like on Monday we came back when I was like yeah you should be added because he had two good games over the weekend Friday and Saturday last weekend so it's not like I haven't said he needs to be added but that's why he's on an ads board where you guys like what the hell you doing Dan why is this dude on ads board he's obviously been an ad for a whole week well  it's a weekly review show  and then Santi aldama who's won that requires arguably the longest explanation of this group even if perhaps we spent more time on Jonathan comingo  I talked a bit about aldama on yesterday's show  and the good and the bad of Santee  now the good so we'll start with the good because these are the reasons that I think he probably should be on rosters the good  is that for whatever reason and  you know this is not what I expected so please try to kind of roll with me on this one  I didn't think aldama was gonna move into a larger role until JJJ started taking days off so as recently as even like two weeks ago  I was like I don't know that we need to do anything about this and then I'll dama was hurt for a couple of games in there and so it kind of bought us some time to think about it  but then over the last week what we've seen is that the Grizzlies have been  kind of moving in his Direction  regardless of what was going on with JJ Who currently by the way is still playing a bunch and seems like he wants to qualify for very legal Awards so keep a very close watch on JJ's games he's at 42  needs to play 203 more and they'll I mean they'll game out how he's going to get to that 65  and be prepared for it because you know contractually it matters and the awards Shelf at home not all matters as well okay but back to Santi aldama  the reason that I'm much higher on him  right now than I was even one week ago is basically because of the Grizzlies last ball game  and I know what you're thinking  aldama didn't even play in that game  you're right he didn't play in that game  but you know who did  Xavier Tillman  and you know who got crap minutes in that game  Xavier Tillman  so even though  bismack biyombo got released weeks ago and I'll Damas out  Tillman still didn't play that much  again a relatively strong Miami Heat front Court  the Grizzlies were willing to go very small  not very small I guess JJ can play center but he's not what you'd call kind of a traditional one he's not a particularly good rebounder  they were willing to go JJ at Center  for most of the game against bam out of bio  that tells me that right now Xavier Tillman is an afterthought he's a guy they're going to use only in games it seems like at least that's kind of the the hand tipping that the Grizzlies are doing right now the hand tipping suggests they're kind of saving a Tillman for specific matchups  and prior to getting hurt aldama was on his way to playing 30 minutes in that ball game  not the most recent one the one two games back  so it seems like they want to run some JJJ hit Center aldama lineups at power forward and that's what's been that I mean that was the starting lineup before aldama took a shot to the knee and now it was had to miss a little bit of time  and that's why my position is changed on this  because you know as recently again as a week ago I thought man Tillman aldama these guys are gonna be fighting for minutes around JJ and then all the sudden the Grizzlies like you know what JJ is the third one trip call Trip win a speed this up Jackson that's all so relatively quick  you go ahead you play center we're gonna we're gonna try all dhamma the four let's see what happens  and because they're in this let's see what happens mode I'm also in let's see what happens mode  they've put me in it  and when Adam gets 28 minutes 30 minutes or more he tends to put up pretty intriguing well-rounded fantasy lines the question mark see now we got to get into the bad the bad with all dhamma is that his percentages are not very good they were not break you numbers last year he was at 47 from the field and 75 of the free throw line those numbers are acceptable if he's gonna play starters level minutes because with starters minutes and all the usage that comes with them in a lineup or a team that doesn't have John Moran Marcus Smart or Desmond Bane  you know or Steven Adams but that's the whole damn year at this point  there are a lot of shots to go around so in addition to just minutes there are more shots on the Grizzlies this year in starters minutes then he had at any point last year  and that's why you and you've seen it you know last year he played 22 minutes a game took about seven shots this year he's a 23 minutes a game he's only playing about a minute and 20 seconds more but he's taking two extra shots so the usage is way up  problem is percentages are way down he's at 43% from the field 62% at the free throw line  those will hurt you more than his other stuff helps  but I'm willing to take a shot that Obama can creep back towards his numbers last year in percentages from an efficiency standpoint that he can get back into the 70s at the foul line and he can get back into the mid to high 40s from the field because then they're not so bad that they're impossible to overcome 4362 splits are impossible to overcome almost no matter what he does in counting stats those percentages will be so bad that he'd be a net negative but if you can get up to 4775 and then you start to look at the counting numbers 28 29 minutes you're talking about a dozen shots ball game in that kind of play right now possibly more depending on who's upright around him so now you're talking about 14 15 points you're talking about seven rebounds you're talking about two and a half assists you're talking about over a steel and over a block of ball game you're talking about possibly two three-pointers a night  that's enough to overcome 4775 splits it's not enough to overcome 40 through 62 splits  but I am willing to take a shot on all dhamma in the hopes that he can creep back towards last year's efficiency numbers because I do think the opportunity numbers this year are in the right spot  all right let's move on from ads to hold so we tend to go a little faster once we get past the ads board the whole holds this week Aaron neesmith who came back and looked real good and yesterday's ball game and he played in the previous one as well and honestly I think he actually is in a better position when Halliburton is there even if it means and you know one less two less shots or whatever but just to have a point guard that's gonna get him the ball in the right spot and I love his hustle stats  Dennis Schroder is it kind of on my my poop list right now okay so look he kind of has been on my poop list all year I felt very dumb that I thought I had completely whiffed on Schroeder I feel way less dumb now and he's been very much falling like a bolder almost in the first for five weeks of the Season he got to that super hot start he's down at 17 on the year now he's been outside the top 200 for the last two weeks  I don't know that he's coming back on a Toronto team that's moving a little bit more towards a rebuild now  could shoot her even potentially be on the Block  he's not a he's not a rebuild level guy and wherever he goes is probably not going to be a you know the prime scoring guard  so look he's a hold right now but I could have very easily put him in the I'm nervous list and I wouldn't think twice about it Derek Lively is a hold at least as long as the Mavs don't have don't pick up a center at the trade deadline I know he's splitting minutes with maxi Klee but now but Lively's the guy they can put up fantasy stats quicker  Max Drew is probably doesn't need to be on this board right now he's been much better the last week since he's starting to find his shot again Spruce inside the top 100 it hasn't had to take that many shots he's been in the Cavs have been in a bunch of blowouts so as minutes are at 27 and 33 or 34 but the percentages have improved over his last three ballgames and that puts him firmly back in start mode Trey Jones is a whole because he was playing really well before getting hurt you don't let you know this is a hold I don't think you guys need to be told that but I did it anyway and now here a couple of tougher names Blended in cam Johnson is a very hard hold right now he's been bad  he looks confused he looks like he's not really part of what's going on the good news is that even while he's been terrible he's still sort of sitting in that one 30 range typically because he hits three-pointers  that's like the reasoning for it but he's not shooting well he's only getting 25 minutes a game he's a hold at least through the trade deadline because if the Nets moved in witty or whoever whatever it might be Royce O'Neill and Dorian Finney Smith these guys are all on the Block John's would almost have no choice but to log some more minutes at a slightly larger position on the court  mostly because I don't believe that Ben Simmons is going to come back and be a factor if you do congratulations you and I disagree on that so hold cam Johnson at least through the trade deadline holding Walker Kessler I don't know that this one really needed to be said because he's blocking a bazillion shots at a time right now but his minutes are all so continue to bounce all around and you know if he has a particularly bad free throw week then you know he's not a 100 guy and if he doesn't take that many free throws then he very much is he's hovering in the 70s for the year which is not at all what we wanted out of Kessler but he's very much a start every day so don't even really think about it too much Dante even chenzo had a couple of quieter ball games and then he came back and had a better one the last time out so I probably didn't need to have him on this board but he has slowed he's outside the top one 50 over the last two weeks because he shooting 41% from the field and 63 at the free throw line that's the fear with him but the permanent production can continue to be much better this year than expected so presumably you know the percentages will bounce around hopefully they level off to something not too terrible it's kind of like the same  Wing in a prayer we have with Santi aldama so I'll stick with the Vincenzo a little bit longer here but again not indefinite I still have  medium sized doubts that he can keep up the permanent Pace he's had this year and if that falls off then it's just sort of not enough to justify a roster spot but for the moment they haven't fallen off just a percentage is here lately and those will bounce around a little bit and then Trey Murphy is the other name on the holds board he is outside the top 200 over the last two weeks because he's shooting 36% from the field and two out of three every night from the free throw line we know that's not gonna stick I get it  and it's hard for me to do this particular show  because  last year I took so much heat for being low on Trey Murphy from a fantasy standpoint and it wasn't even low it's not even fair  last year I took heat because I said dream Murphy needs to be started but be aware that I believe he's an injury feeling type of player not to say that like he's not good but just because last year he had all that extra usage with big names out  this year the big names are in so it's usage is much lower and that's why he's hovering in that 100 to 130 range most of the time because he just doesn't have the wiggle room he had last year  and I tried to say this all of last season and you guys all killed me for it but now this year I have to argue the opposite side which you know a lot of like everybody's coming at me they're like oh he's too boring this year I'm like yeah I tried to tell you this  but also boring Trey Murphy is still just barely good enough to start most days you know he's not gonna be 3667 splits he's a good percentage is Guy hold strong he is startled and most formats probably in that 95 to 125 range  but if that doesn't do it for you then I guess I get it but you know competitive to 12 team or that should be good enough  the I'm scared or nervous list Brandon ski I think can be dropped I don't think there's enough for him to do on the Warriors right now Jalen Suggs  probably droppable it's not a guarantee that he doesn't kind of get it going again at some point but we're talking about a lot of weeks in a row now where he's been you just not a fantasy asset you know 170 or deeper in nine cat over the last month basically  and I don't know that I see it turning around unless the Steels come roaring back but they've definitely petered out as the energy has petered out and unless he gets a big boost which maybe he does after the All-Star break everybody gets a week to sort of chill and get their juices back but right now it got no juice  and so I think you can probably move on from Suggs Spencer Dinwiddie is one that I know you guys are gonna level me about but I don't care because look I get it he scores and he gets assists sometimes  but overall in my eyes he's not a top 120 or better Nine category dude and we know he's on the Block so he could end up in a place where his role gets smaller you don't have to drop if you don't want you can keep him you know this is a board that I've called the I'm scared or the drop board and you can call Dinwiddie and I'm scared if you prefer I personally am fine with dropping him you're gonna look up and you're gonna see him have a 17 and 8 game at some point go oh no what did I why did I do this but then you're gonna look deep when you're gonna be like oh no steals no blocks 41% from the field no wait a minute that's 38% from the field oh I was hoping his free throws would be better here but he went he went for for six the foul line in this game I just didn't yeah so that's the thing Spencer did we use like the ultimate if you look between the lines kind of player you want to understand why he makes more sense on the points League side and why nine cat tends to be kind of hard for him  but the reason I don't know that so like the reason I got him sorted between drop and I'm scared nervous is what if the Nets don't trade didn't witty but they do move Royston Neil or Finney Smith or what if they move Camp Thomas or something like that a surprise move  what if Ben Simmons never steps foot back on a basketball court again that there's a possible path for him to sort of weave his way into that 100 to 120 range and then he'd be night cats start a bowl but barely and Xavier Tillman is the last name on the drops board because it seems like the Grizzlies are just deploying him in very specific moments and that's definitely not enough of a reason to roster someone in fantasy  hey this is a great opportunity in the middle of the show to remind you guys of our continued partnership with the great folks over at believe Sports thank you to the the believe

couple of watch lists names I don't know how Santi aldama got on here you guys can watch me take him off the watch list in real time he's a guy that I'm willing to again say is just an ad the other watch lists names are Andrew Wiggins  because you never know and I think he was actually kind of decent yesterday but the king's defense helps with that  Larry Nance Jr you know what I screwed up this watch list and a bunch of places Kelly oubre Jr is not a watch list guy he's a injury replacement Larry Nance Jr is on the watch list you know I I've played him in a couple of spots it's risky because he just vanished for a game but it does seem like if you give him a week two weeks or whatever 20 to 24 minutes a night he's in that 100 range which is playable John Collins is back to being a watch list guy he's cleared 30 minutes two times in the Jazz last six ball game which generally is not enough but he's permanent numbers are up the last two to three weeks  I don't know that I believe this is a thing that's going to hold all the way through  but I'll give John Collins a little bit of credit because he's doing more and his time on the court which wasn't the case in November or December again I also don't know that it's going to stick that's why he's a watch list guy and not an ad just like his teammate Kelly Olynyk also on the watch list because he too is putting up really nice permanent numbers but the minutes you know this is a math problem if you do if you have a good numbers per minute you have to multiply that by a number of minutes and if the minutes are not high enough then the overall result is not high enough  so I don't think you need to add these guys Harrison Barnes is on a two-game heater for the ages  and at some point he's gonna completely collapse because he had done nothing for like three months prior to this came out of nowhere  Jerry Vanderbilt is an interesting watch list named at least of all the names I've had on here so far I think Vanderbilt is the one that I'm really most interested in watching because it does kind of feel like you finally has his legs under him meaning does he get enough minutes to get basically enough rebounds and steals to be a Fantasy 9 cat guy cuz he's not gonna score very much his 3-point shot is a clanker he'll pass a little bit because lake has been using him to kind of flash towards the key when Defenders are not paying attention to him but his value comes in rebounds and steals so there has to be enough minutes and there has been enough opportunity for that so watch list him but he's very much been better and we'll kind of see how the Lakers deploy him over the next two to three games and make a call there and then Jeremy Sohan who had a couple of really nice ball games he was hot for about four or five games in a row cooled off a lot  in this Spurs last one he's a watch this guy for me he's a points League darling when he plays enough his nine cat game is blah and that's what we generally talk about on this show  here's the stream wall warm list I don't know if I had oh I added herb Jones to it that's the only but herb you could actually play nightly these days there have been enough of those big one off games that he's been playable throughout but I really feel like  you know he's someone herb Jones were talking about I think he's someone you could try to get cute with  because he's very much a boomer bust it's the Danny Green phenomenon where Danny Green would have an 8-3 pointer game and two Steals and four blocks and then he'd get nothing for three games in a row and people were like what am I doing here and usually the result was like look just look back at the end of the month was it fine over a month and the answer with Danny Greene for so many years was yes he was good for the month it was wild inconsistency throughout and if you tried to get cute with it you screwed it up you played him on the day where he was terrible and you missed the day where he had his giant mega game and that kind of feels like what we're getting out of herb Jones as long as Trey Murphy is healthy now and Trey is out herb is an easy play every day  but when Murphy is healthy  herb Jones has these water two or three very quiet games and then explosion or when traces out that it's explosion and overall over the last three four weeks  there have been enough of those explosion days for whatever reason that herb is I think top 80 over that month  but if you look at the game by game you're like oh no oh no oh no hell yeah oh no oh no hell yeah  how do we figure out when it happens well you again Roto you can get super cute play when somebody's out  but technically Head to Head you could play him every day and it would be okay  the other names on this list remain unchanged Bobby Portis not read Cola Anthony Kevin loved any of the Jordan Clarkson RJ Barrett and Kevin herder are the catch him on heater guys it's not a slight these are just guys that run extremely hot and extremely cold  and hurt her I think his top 75 over the last three weeks so  go for it RJ Barrett's been very hot since the trade for the most part Jordan Clarkson's been very hot of late had a few rough ones mixed in there  Kevin Love could probably come off this list because he's at a stomach ailment lately the key was like almost throwing up on the court two games back  yucky Denny obviously has been real good for a couple weeks in a row now he had that big start to the year and then cool off for a whole month call Anthony he's been awful for almost a month and a half now  that's who these guys are they ran hot and cold  and as you can see as this list continues to grow you know they're not they're not alone  here's the current injury replacement board as things stand as of Friday morning and obviously we'll get more news every hour here over the next few days Joel embed a knee if he sits out and he gains Paul Reed and Kelly oubre June where would be usable Cade Cunningham is very close until we get word that he's back Jayden Ivy and Alec Burks are your feelings there Kristofferson gets turned ankle so Al Horford may have a more than one game window perhaps we'll see Carousel vert Ford Darius Garland saddiq Bey for DeAndre Hunter slash Trae young these days  Nick Richards from Mark Williams Malcolm Brogden for shaedon Sharpe Vince Williams and when healthy Luke Kennard for Bain and smart John conchar for Luke Kennard who missed the last ball game it's a Russian nesting doll of fantasy fill-ins here Tim Hardaway Jr for Kyrie Irving and Russell Westbrook with his or flyer at the end of this list for Evita zubats  and a reminder on some possible possible yes that's right we're doing the rest of his show as Sean Connery  or Darrel Hammond's impersonation of Sean Connery on Celebrity Jeopardy which still to this day one of my favorite Saturday Night Live skits of all time  I'll take shorts for 400  stash name is that I'm looking at right now and this is this sort of luck in flux for me it changes daily the names that have been there throughout on Yoko Kang woo um  Bilal coulibaly has been there throughout Gary Trent Jr is a strong Maybe  man Oscar Thompson  who to me maybe more of a silly season guy these are dudes that have been kind of sticking throughout names that have come and gone a little bit anyway the other ones that I've got on the list right now I think Marvin Bagley deserves to be a stash because Daniel Gafford is a possibility to be traded Dennis Smith Jr Spencer Dinwiddie gets moved DeAndre Hunter I think would move from like King of the streamer value to startle if indeed he gets back healthy and Ashanti Murray gets traded  cooly I actually think two guys need to get traded in Washington because he not only needs the minutes but he also needs usage  Jabari Walker to me he's closed and Portland but I think he needs Jeremy Grant to get moved  Gary Trent probably needs Dennis Schroder and Bruce Brown to get out of the way because they need both the minutes and the shots and then I would assume it was the  he and Marvin Bagley are the latest editions to list I always looked really good for the bulls laidley with Zach LaVine out let's say Levine gets traded here at the deadline my question of course is who comes back anyone and then is there a possibility of the Bulls move both Levine and Alex Caruso because that would really unlock IO that's what you'd need there to Sumo is borderline with just Levine out you move one more guy out of the way and then it's go time and I hope I mean I you guys know I love Alex Caruso so so very much I really hope somebody unloads the piggy bank for kerusso because he is the kind of guy that could push a near contending team to be a contender he's just so good and he's kind of fixed his three-point shot this year too  man  love me some Caruso  all right that is effectively your weekend review show I don't see a reason to stretch it out all that much longer here right and we basically cover everything let me quickly check the chat room see if anybody has a name they brought up that I forgot to bring up on the show this is my  what did I forget is Marcus Smart worth a stash Head to Head honestly I think you're going to need that I else spot for somebody else but if you have like you know Yahoo public leagues where you've got three IL spots for a 13 role League then sure why the hell not but that's again very slot dependent  uh Austin Reeves the question is would you trade for or away Austin Reeves I I don't think he's going anywhere he is a good percentage is dude who doesn't get much defensively he'll generally hover in that like 15 four and five neighborhood which should keep him  kind of just inside the top 100 and you know I don't know that that's something you need to necessarily trade for or against he's useful he's a start in every format but he's not gonna blow the roof off the building unless Superstar goes down for the Lakers  heaven forbid  what else we got here um should I add Jalen green or Draymond Green in a category League it's gonna be Draymond there if it's points it's Jalen green but category it is Draymond should I drop cam Johnson for Santi aldama eight cat know I would continue to hold cam again you know you move one power forward out of the way and Brooklyn and they almost have no choice but to give them an extra two or three minutes you move all the power forwards out of the way and all of a sudden he's back to doing stuff and we saw how good he can be when he's actually feeling confident which just sort of isn't right now  is markelle fultz a watch list candidate yeah I mean I guess so he's a very difficult play in head-to-head because he's gonna sit every back-to-back and I don't I'm lower on faults I think that most fantasy analysts I don't think he gets inside the top 100 so for games cap Rodeo that's probably not going to be good enough  but doo doo doo doo doo doo  Papa yep that's it okay  40 minutes and we out that's cool efficiency I really still want to do a Bi-Lo show I don't have any idea when I'm going to find the time to do it just know
