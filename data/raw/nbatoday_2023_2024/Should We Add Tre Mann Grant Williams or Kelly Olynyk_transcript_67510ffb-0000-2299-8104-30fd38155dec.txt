welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right now at the song play to the end  of the the live side good morning everyone welcome to Fantasy NBA today this is your Tuesday edition of the show  February the 13th Valentine's Day tomorrow  what will we be  who will be our Valentine who will be our Valentine tomorrow question that only will be answered by the six games this evening  today on the show we're mostly going to be covering the Monday card we had a lot of games at 10 gamer to go over and he had a bunch of the recently traded fellows  playing many of them their second game for their new team buddy hield I think was third but how much do we need to talk about him he's absolutely dominating in his new digs I am Dan Vespers this is a sports ethos presentation about I got through that sentence at Dan best press over on social media d a n b e s b r i s folks here at the front end of the show I want to ask you kindly take a moment as we're ease and into the program hit that like button make sure you subscribe if you're relatively new to the proceedings here and you haven't had a chance to do it yet it's super easy I know that on the YouTube deal you can just hit the button right there on the screen I actually don't even remember how easy it is to subscribe on iTunes and Spotify but generally they make those buttons pretty easy to find if you have an opportunity to drop a five star review at appreciate that as well but again the quick stuff here a like a follow over on social a subscribe button let's bring you all into the fold with love for you to be a part of what we do here daily sometimes twice daily here on fantasy NBA today and sports ethos  diving straight into the car in Indiana and embarrassing loss  and embarrassing loss in Charlotte  my Indiana over bet is a little less safe than I would have liked Tyreese Halliburton being hurt eased back in Pacers being sort of middling lately their 30 and 25 trying to remember I actually probably should have had this  uh was the Pacers over I think they needed to be a 500 ball Club if I'm remembering right  was it 39 was a little bit under 500 I think at the beginning of the season if I'm trying to remember that I think Pacers was like 39 I lost the giant document I used to type all this stuff up at the beginning of the year that was my hard drive I don't know you guys remember my hard drive crashed in July I typed up right up on all 30 teams it was just gone  so upsetting  the current Pacers line is 44 and a half which is not with the season started with  the hell was it  was the Pacers number I don't remember damn it I think it was 39 either way  I mean you got what do you got 27 games left 500 Buckle they should still get there  if they're above 500 I think that one hits I don't know why I'm talking through this on air this is something Dan you should research this stuff before you go on but whatever it's a live show you guys get to see me my Wonder wander through my streams of Consciousness and then it's a bad loss Here Andrew nem hard right now has sort of the  clearest path of anyone on the team to picking up some of the Buddy hield stuff  but also Neymar doesn't have particularly strong Fantasy game he's generally assists only  yes sometimes they'll have a game like yesterday where he shoots five for seven and gets three Steals and everything looks gravy but it's not so nothing  Charlotte on the other hand requires a little bit of our attention I'm getting copious  yes that's right so many that they are copious I'm getting copious questions about who to add on the Charlotte Hornets  and I get it there were actually reasonable questions because Seth Curry Grant Williams and Trey man also vaccine finally had an opportunity to to triple check myself on that one vaccine  if you listen to him say he says it's so fast that it just sounds like vaste  the slow version is vasilia  last name is mitsch anyway feel good about finally being able to dig into the pronunciation guide on that one uh this is what I was worried about this is why I put them on the watch list on the last show I know a lot of folks had him as an ad and I said all right I mean okay if you want to get it super aggressive there but you know he shot the ball extraordinarily well there was almost no way he was gonna get nine assists per ball game and you know you started look at some of these players and you're like there may be a reason that maybe they're not getting like full starters run on other teams and it's not because they're not decent but it is because there's a big learning curve so  still watch list him it's it can still be on your watch list but  I didn't think there was a reason to go straight up and add and I still don't know  Seth Curry at 18 points in 19 minutes the minutes are what you're looking at there so he also does not need to be added but you can throw him on a watch list as well  Cody Martin is not one of the guys that got traded but I did get some questions about him and he's a low percentages guy I know he's got five for eight in this ball game but he generally doesn't he's a low field goal percent low free throw percent dude who doesn't do nearly enough in the counting categories too make up for those shortcomings so he can also stay on The Wire uh and that brings us to because look Myles Bridges is obviously a start Brandon Miller is a start Nick Richards is sort of your low end Center stream blah blah blah that brings us to Grant Williams and Trey man the two guys that I'm getting asked about the most I like to save that for the end when I break down these teams because these are like knock everything else out to the out of the way and now we've just got these two names that are sitting there looking Us in the grill and we're like all right what do we do with them  starting with the great Williams  first of all he shot seven out of eight at the free throw line which is unusual  six out of 12 from the field and so repeatable number for him he's actually kind of a decent feel goal percent guy for someone who generally  like sort of camps out in the corner and shoots three pointers he's only a 42% from the field so far this year  largely because of an extraordinarily poor run in Dallas they wanted him out of there I mean it was just like the fit was never quite right but with Boston he was more like 45 ish 40 for and change 45 he's been sorted slowly trending up here in Charlies at 48  through his first two ball games he's also attempted like we mentioned 10 free throws in two ball games which is just not at all something you're gonna expect to continue  and you know some of it is because and there's a few things at play here for one he's playing more you know he's averaging 32 minutes a game and his two games with the Hornets  after never getting higher than 26 and change in Dallas and never actually clearing the 26 minute Mark in Boston  he's also shooting 11 12 times a game took 11 shots in his first game with the Hornets took 12 in the last one that's a much larger jump than you'd expect when his minutes only went up by you know less than our about 20% 20% on added on to six point seven shots only gets him to 8 not 11 and a half  now obviously what you are all yelling at me and you should be yelling at me is Dan that's because he was playing with Luka doncic and Kyrie Irving in Dallas and in Charlotte he's playing with Miles Bridges and Brandon Miller who don't exactly control the ball the way that Luca and Kyrie do and you are correct so there is  a reasonable explanation for an uptick in field goal attempts  going from 6.7 to 11 and a half though is almost doubling he's added five shots a game over six and a half I mean we're talking about you know 80% jump instead of the 20% jump that is minutes took  that's probably not something that's going to stick  you know even when Kyrie was out or when Luke was out you still didn't see Grant Williams taking 11 12 shots of ball game you know he went from six and a half to eight or nine in those scenarios  so I think you're probably looking at someone who likely Trends back towards about nine shots per ball game we're also hearing on Grant Williams that he may be picking up small ball Center minutes because the Hornets don't really have a legitimate backup 5 behind Nick Richards we have no idea if Mark Williams is ever going to show his face again Davos Burton's can play some Center because he's tall but he's also not gonna get in anybody's way in in as much as at least Grant Williams who's not tall but is you know a bolder on on legs he can at least stand in the way of the rim and dudes can't just go straight through him  Nick Richards you got both he has he has strength Grant Williams has massive strength but no height of his hype but no strength  that's why Richard is still going to play the bulk of the center minutes and he played 26 of them yesterday which left about 11 for Burton's and Grant Williams picked up about another 10 roughly or somewhere in that neck of the woods  here's the other problem with great Williams don't eat like yes as a center that does mean that he has now a slightly better path towards getting rebounds because he's just gonna be closer to the rim  and he's at six rebounds a game in his 32 ish minutes per game and Charlotte but career wise right well he was not a great rebounder in Dallas this year he was at three and a half rebounds in 26 minutes and yes again I know some of that's because he wasn't playing Center and because Luca takes fit 10 rebounds a game out of a guard position even if you go back to Boston four and a half rebounds in 26 minutes per game if you add 20% to that and even then give us Center bump 4.6 is not going to nine or ten you could get him to six and change perhaps which is where he's at right now so is nine shots a game  and yeah look a lot of them are going to be three pointers so you know two  two-ish three-pointers a game two and a half if you want to go that high is two and a half three pointers a game and you know call it something like 11 points is 11 points two and a half three pointers and six rebounds is that enough for Fantasy value for a guy that doesn't get defensive stats really not many  half a steel half a block  could maybe Trend up to like point seven and point seven  he's a fine for free throw shooter but he's not gonna get there five times a game he might get there like one and a half to one point eight something in that neck of the woods my thought is that the answer here is probably know  probably not inside the top 109 cat and I I want to give Grant Williams credit that's why I wanted to really dig into this one and say is this a believable jump for him to get to where he's at right now and  my  like again and I can't know for certain all of this is just handicapping but like we can look at Grant Williams last year he was outside the top 200  in you know 25 minutes a game in Boston you can go the previous year 20 some odd minutes a game in Boston he was 100 and 188  so he just not that close  even if he goes from 25 to 32 and even goes in 26 to 32 minutes I just don't think there's enough to get him all the way to the top one hundred  does he get himself into a pretty reliable stream Zone yeah you know one 25 150 range is probably in the route I mean even if you said 100 was the best case scenario 100 to 150 range is probably I would say almost definitely attainable for him but that to my in my eyes is not a reason to go out there and dive in face first  now let's talk Trey man and I know I'm pausing on this team a lot but a lot of these other teams we can Blitz through pretty fast today so let's let's spend time on the stuff that really matters right now  Trey man is a very different discussion because he is going to get the usage categories he's going to take some shots he's going to have some assists because he's basically the point guard right now  while lamelo ball remains shelved indefinitely any grabbed nine rebounds in their game against Indiana yesterday don't read too much into that man is a is an okay rebounding guard but you know six and a half rebounds he's averaging in his  two and a half games and in or two games in Charlotte is  not likely to hold  because there isn't really anything that happened during his time in Oklahoma City that artificially depressed his rebounding and there's nothing in Charlotte that's gonna artificially raise his rebounding playing excited basketball right now is what's raising his rebounding number at eight defensive rebounds against the Pacers yesterday fairly certain that's a career high and we'll probably be a season high so don't expect Trey man to average six and a half rebounds a game that's absurd for is quite attainable four and a half even like he's not a bad rebounding guard he's six three so you know a little bit taller I guess than your average point guard or they're about but he's kind of a spindly fellow um  and as this as minutes start to wear on him a little bit the rebounds are they always trained down you just see that with these young guys that are finally getting a little bit more opportunity in the short term the assists are somewhat sustainable I don't know about eight per ball game but you'll see at least a chunk because he is basically the point guard right now so you know six plus feels doable he's also at 10 points in 30 minutes which feels like a number that could maybe go up a little bit not entirely clear 11 shots per game he's averaging fewer points than he is shots right now which is ugly but you know maybe gets himself to the free throw line a couple of times in that number goes from 10 to you know 1 1. 0 0 but and here's the big old butt yeah big butt just blasting things right out of the way here's the butt on Trey man  Tre Mann  is  not at all someone we're gonna rely upon for percentages  he's a career 73% excuse me 78.3% free throw shooter which as a guard  is a negative or it's a negative if you're anybody as a guard it's sort of a bigger negative because guards are who you expect to give you a free throw percent lift and then you sort of account for that by knowing you're gonna have a big man at some big man on your team is probably gonna be shooting in the 70s and at the free throw line and that's your sort of your small negative the guards need to raise it up so the big men can bring it back down if you have big men on your team that are extraordinary free throw shooting this becomes sort of like a reverse proposition  but it's not the way you can't handicap that way  I especially with the way that we have to talk about it on the show I have to treat this show as though everybody has a relatively average standard roster meaning your guards do your free throw percent work your big man bring it back down to earth a little bit and so there that's the rub with Trey man which makes him a very strong points League add so if you're listening to this show and you're playing points leagues  great gotta go at him because you'll get some assists you'll get some scoring you'll get a couple of rebounds here as we saw there's upside if he starts to actually lead into it or get confident or take some more shots points League yes you definitely want to get on board nine cat I'm very skeptical very skeptical  because his Fantasy game has these  absurd holes in it I mean this is a dude and like I get it you know you can't look at the whole season because he wasn't playing any minutes but even taking these hyper-inflated rebounding and assist numbers I would say in Charlotte  and combining the fact that he hasn't shot a free throw yet which once he does that will become a small negative that hasn't actually a card yet he still in 31 minutes a game outside the top one 50  meaning how many minutes do we need this guy to play to get to a top 100 nine cat value Asian  the answer is a number of minutes that are not readily available to most players in the NBA like he'd probably have to play about 3536 minutes a game to be a top 100 nine cat guy because we're going to need not 10 points per game we're gonna need more like 12 or 13 4013 points per game we're gonna need the eight assists to hold we're going to need the rebounds to hold over five  to cover up for the fact that and he's averaging one steal a game because he had a two Steel game and steals are probably be fine my guess is that he can probably push about one steal per game we don't really know I mean he had he actually has not blocked a shot this season so I think we can assume that number is gonna stay relatively low but steals prior to this year he's been kind of in that like  if you're saying 30 minutes a game he should be around one steal her ball game so that'll be fine that'll be you know average but big negative and field goal percent incoming small negative and free throws  probably small negative in three pointers or maybe call it legal average the assist I think come back down to a more reasonable number in the force or the rebounds excuse me the assists probably come down from eight to six and change  I just like he's I think right now putting up really good numbers in his first two games with the Hornets and he's still you know near the top one 70  and if you like Dan maybe the turnovers will come down from three if he's the point guard on that team I don't think the turnovers come down very far from three and if he's the guy that's initiating a lot of the offense he's probably gonna be between two and three turnovers of all game now so the way I see it I think it's going to be a really hard path for Trey man to get to top 109 category value I think he's very much a points League add and I'd be I mean I'd be happy to see improve me wrong but even if he does I don't think he's getting much beyond that Mark like in my eyes a perfect Universe gets him to like the 85 range in nine cat and a more likely Universe has him like we said more like you know 150 range guy bad percentages needs to do a ridiculous sum in the other categories and you know I think he might be pretty good and like one maybe one and a half of them  all right let's start with through the card a little bit faster now we spent like a solid 10 minutes on this ball game maybe even a tiny bit more but again like these are the guys I want to talk about Philly is an easy one right now you're starting the starters minus KJ Martin but plus to buy his Harris when he comes back so Aubrey buddy hield Paul Reed to buy his Tyrese Maxey  Cleveland you're basically starting the starters Max Drew's the only question mark there he had 10 4 and 4 he said to okay ball games in a row hard to trust the shooting but he is right on the borderline if you wanted to start him you start him if you don't you don't I don't think it's gonna make a difference either way at this point he's you know fringy 12 Timur but Darius Garland had his first good game since coming back from the Jaw injury that's gonna make the Bi-Lo a little bit harder but you know maybe you can still slip it through and I maintain that carry silver is a drop you finally saw the percentages here kick in a little  we move on  Chicago put up a buck 36 on the Hawks who don't much care about defense I owe to Sumo 29 Points on 18th Andre Drummond just 16 minutes he did have 7 points and 11 rebounds but no foul trouble in this one and I think what we're seeing is that that game where he got 30 minutes off the bench not the one where he started that was against Minnesota specifically to deal with Rudy gobert and Cat they went big front court but drama did have 30 minutes off the bench in the very next ball game in kind of a surprise twist  and then hasn't in the last couple one of them was foul trouble this one was not so my take here is that Drummond is probably not gonna be a 30-minute guy or even a mid-20s minutes guy he's gonna be 16 minutes and then if everything shapes out right excuse me shakes out right no I can't speak today then maybe he can get up into the 20s but in my eyes that's not enough reason to hold on to him long term I am dropping Andre Drummond holding to sunoo and hey um  I don't mean you guys were yelling at me earlier this year that that vouch was washed I have to like bat these things away on the show which is up to number 42 now by the way in per game that's a solid round and a half now ahead of where he was drafted he's in the 30s by totals because he's been pretty damn durable again and he's inside he's a second rounder over the last month so  you know just saying all so fellow old man on the Bulls DeMar DeRozan is up to 38 remember when he was in the 60s remember when both these guys were in the 60s and I said Buy Low  it hasn't been like this stunning Mega game turnaround they've just been quietly a little bit better every week for like the last eight weeks in a row and now they're both blitzing their adp's  yep wave the flag Atlanta DeAndre Hunter had 23 points in 28 minutes he is now almost ramped up to Full Tilt problem of course is that we needed one of the usage guys gone for him to actually be consistently producing at this level  and you know for that reason he's not an ad we've seen DeAndre Hunter go through these Lava Hot stretches where when he gets really really hot from two-point land he can be inside the top 100 for a couple of weeks and then he goes through a cold spell and he's back you know top 175 range the interesting thing about Hunter is that he's number one 13 on the season overall  despite what I would argue has been kind of an up and down years specially with the minutes being deflated at  there is a chance that the DeAndre Hunter ends up with fantasy value I don't think he's someone that you have to race out and grabs he's not a big Steals and blocks guy he's generally kind of a like good percentages  points some boards kind of nude  not an exciting fantasy line good for free throw percent we should throw that in there as well steals are a 300 a little better this year  he's just you know what Max Drew's is kind of a similar type guy that's probably gonna be hovering right on the edge of nine cat value and so do whatever the hell you want it's not going to change your team other than noting here that as he gets fully revved up  it could finally it could finally finish off saddiq Bey met could I don't think you have to drop him yet but he's been warm lately he was not quite as good in this ball game but he's been kind of heating up for now you hold Bay a little bit longer  Hunter keep an eye on it I mean this is a excellent ball game with seven for seven at the free throw line that really helped the 14 shots were useful as well if we see the field goal attempts get back up into that you know  not barely clearing double digits because he's a 10 and a half on the season right now but you've also had you know five six of his not that many games have been depressed by a minute's Capital One two three four five yeah five of them were and even if you call this last one sort of a minute's cap game but remember the beginning of the year he was getting double digit shots in you know three out of every four ball games basically and if that's what we can get back to he can sit maybe right near the edge of the top one hundred  banana  Victor  I want to say week do I always think of Young Frankenstein when I see the name Victor Wendy had a triple double it was crazy 27 points 14 rebounds 10 blocks two threes five assists two steals just in case you needed other stuff who cares about the seven turnovers this is an absurd basketball game Wendy's number 12 in nine cat he is really at this point like one good game away from passing Who the hell's right in front of him Larry Martin  he's probably too good games away from passing Kyrie Irving although Kyrie at least is is playing again I I honestly I'm blown away at how fast weapon Yama made the adjustment to the NBA game and he is tanking team which successfully pulled off the pre tank can now just sort of accidentally win some ballgames because the Spurs well there I mean that bottom three but they're not very far behind the Hornets I guess they don't want to win all that many but they accidentally won one here  Jeremy Sohan was a little bit better try to move him if you can after a decent ball game I'm gonna ride that horse until the legs fall off  but you guys don't care about this team Trey Jones is a whole nobody cares about Kelvin Johnson anymore we move on to the Toronto side  where there is some stuff to discuss yaka pel only 20 minutes Kelly Olynyk 21 minutes Bruce Brown 31 gradey dick 22  RJ Barrett 24 Gary Trent 22 Emanuel quickly 25 Scotty Barnes 30 in a game that was a blowout so the minutes were a little bit screwball also worth pointing out Scotty Barnes number 22 in nine cat right now Tyrese Maxey number 24 these guys that are gonna get loud as the best picks of the year have been kind of quietly trending the wrong way lately and by the way they are some of the best picks of the year but that guy that went in the 40s 50s 60s that hasn't completely fallen off yet is Chad home run oddly enough  and anyway back to the Raptors so I don't think we can take a ton away from this game because it was over early as evidence by the fact that quickly and bear it only got minutes in the mid-20s  but what I do want to point out is that Kelly Olynyk it is two games in Toronto has been a fantasy Force  and his minutes haven't been all that high yet  so there's kind of two things that I'm fighting with inside my own head  first of all before we even get to Kelly Olynyk you guys can safely drop Gary Trent I don't think there's going to be enough usage there so what's the point of pushing it  he'll be borderline at best  quickly you hold on to I took a lot of flack for saying that quickly was not going to be inside the top 75 with the Raptors and I don't think he is I think he's outside the top 100  the percentages he's not a great foul shooter so he's not gonna like really lifts you up there if you'll go percent is always been low it's lower than low right now but this is the stuff you're worried about like there was never guaranteed that he was going to just go get like 20 shots of ball game  that's why he was a cell High immediately after the trade anyway this is not what you guys you didn't come to hear me talk about that and Gary Trent was a name we were watching I think we can probably move on from here Turtle you're holding people were like what should I do you're holding because it's been two games with the new pieces and one of them was a blowout so if you're like if you really want the answer to that question you're not gonna get it in one and a half games of data with the new players into Toronto  Toronto played a bunch of guys that like the Deep bench in this one how many players did they use 15 or no one ever five six seven eight nine 10 13 they got 13 deep here my counting that right fast so Bruce Brown got 31 minutes I don't fully understand why he's not a fantasy add  which brings us to Olynyk as the will he or won't he you guys know my love for Kelly Olynyk Fantasy game is  on paralleled  it is unbridled I have there's no Bridal on my Kelly Olynyk love  especially on the Roto side  this is the this is the magic this is the magic of Kelly Olynyk he's played 22 and 21 minutes it is two games in Toronto and those two games he's averaged 14 points five and a half rebounds two and a half assists three steals half a block a three-pointer on 50% shooting and a perfect 100 at the free throw line  Kelly Olynyk and you guys don't need me to lecture you on this you guys know because we've like this podcast for years has been the Kelly Olynyk Power Hour and there's no reason that that's going to stop any time soon  he's a Fantasy monster when he's not being fully marginalized like he was in Miami basically and to a certain degree like he was in Detroit Utah let him be your Linux  Houston let him be your limit  Houston let him be Kelly plus there was nobody else there he went crazy Utah let him be sort of like regular version Kelly and he was good like short-term memory is is a mess these days do you guys remember that last year Kelly Olynyk was a top 100 guy in nine cat in Utah  we just kept thinking they were gonna fully pull the plug on him and they never did last season average 12 and half points six boards four assists a steal half a block one and three pointers on 5085 splits  he was good  he was legitimately good last year he was just inside the top 100  and he was like  average to slightly above average in almost everything  but that was also 28 minutes so that's the thing we have to sort of keep in the back of our minds this year Olynyk is playing 20 minutes a game and he's inside the top one forty  because he's shooting 56% from the field that's an unsustainable number if you bring that back down to 50 or even just lightly above 50 he falls back more towards you know top one 50 top 160 range so long-term or even medium term is 21 minutes actually enough for olenek to do the kind of damage we need him to do in Toronto the answer that question is no  much as I'd love to say that Kelly can average 14 6 and 3 with you know whatever he's at right now three defensive stats a ball game and perfect free throw shooting in 21 and a half minutes he can't  believe me I want him to I want him to average those numbers more than anything in the universe but 21 minutes is not going to be enough we need to find a way to get him to 24 or 25 because we can assume I think in Toronto that his job there is going to be a little bit bigger than it was in Utah  not by a ton he Toronto still has plenty of guys that are going to be doing usage stuff but he's effectively when he's on the floor for the Raptors he's kind of the point guard  like the fact that he's getting three assists all game in 20 minutes is not crazy and in fact you might even see that number Trend up a little bit you had extra Bruce Brown in yesterday's ballgame  Scotty Barnes point forward Bruce Brown Point wing and then Olynyk Point Center are kind of like the three ball movers on Toronto right now and I don't know that they want Scottie Barnes to have to be that guy I think they'd rather him just go be aggressive be aggressive let's sneak that in there  what am I doing get to the point Dan I'm speculatively adding him  I don't see the world's clearest path to 25 minutes for Olynyk  but it's not invisible  it's candy play alongside yaakov Pearl and Scotty Barnes  they could try it  how many minutes do the Raptors want to shoehorn into the gradey dick bucket  be careful Dan probably not wise to say dick bucket in a row on a podcast we're talking about a player here for free people don't be dirty  what about Bruce Brown I know it didn't move him how much are they going to play him  you know the 20 million dollar option on next year that  like what  I do got paid for being the perfect facilitator on Denver  so I don't know is the short answer to Is this gonna pan out but what I do know is that if it does I want to be there for it  the nice thing is on the head side a Linux not gonna hurt you  play me head to head even if he only gets 20 minutes in a ball game  still gonna compile you some numbers in you know five six different categories and not hurt you in the percentages which is all so lovely Roto against the games cap probably stick them on your bench  denim Milwaukee was low on fantasy story lines other than kcp coming back to early from his hammy he'll be out through the All-Star break now Jamal Murray left with tibia inflammation that's not a great sign he'll I'm sure be out through the All-Star break as well you know making any ads here unless you badly want to try to wedge a Reggie Jackson you know like 14 15 point four assist nothing else fantasy line into the brief period here before the All-Star break what does Denver play again tomorrow yeah they got Sacramento tomorrow high scoring game so yeah I mean Reggie might put up some numbers in that one but  don't blow a roster move on that on the head-to-head side and frankly I don't know that the Roto side is even worth it what you will get is bonus Nicola yokich bonus Aaron Gordon and bonus Michael Porter Jr for a game and that's probably the more fun actual fantasy  Fallout from those small injuries bucks side khris Middleton remains out Malik Beasley is your three-pointers stream I wouldn't go much farther than that Jae Crowder is in there and starting but he's a Fantasy disaster and then Pat connaughton is picking up some bench minutes but he's also a bit of a fantasy nothing so there you go Beasley if you badly need threes but

New Orleans Memphis herb Jones is hot ladies and gentlemen heating up top  he's warm  he's an ad what herb is warm he's an ad he's one of those really interesting fantasy players that when he's cold he is  like  it's just you can't even bear it but when he's hot holy mackerel remember the beginning of this year top 30 run  and it was like a month of that  if he's hot and now you got to make sure you're on that train  so pick him up  herb Jones is an ad right now get him not just because of this big ball game all Dice and Daniels torn meniscus out for a while he wasn't someone that you guys were starting but him being out means that they need Herb more so this actually does solidify his minutes a little bit in a way that nothing that they necessarily needed to do be solidified  he was gonna play a lot regardless but now I mean minutes even safer  Annie's hot herb is an ad Trey Murphy not really  not really  by the way this does and look like I'd be lying if I said that there were wasn't a certain satisfaction for me after spending all of last season trying to convince you guys on Twitter that Trey Murphy was a great feeling fantasy option and everybody was like shut up Dan  take them off your fill-in board that's disrespectful and I was like not really like we haven't seen him post consistent top 100 numbers when all of the big usage guys are healthy  he was top 60 range last year but Brandon Ingram's ion sometimes both were out McCollum was out for a while like the big Trey Murphy games come when he usage guy is out  or when herb is out and his minutes are just big enough to sustain it this year 125 range with the team healthy  I didn't tell you guys last year nobody believed me some of you believe me but like nobody I got yelled at so much for just leaving Trey Murphy on the injury replacement board last year because he still hadn't convinced me that he was a value when the team was healthy  so the Grizzlies are messy Vince Williams Junior is a play because he gets 30 some odd minutes obviously JJJ when he's upright he's a play  Scotty Pippin has the whole you know two-way contract thing going on he actually heard his back in this ball game when he starting Pippin is a play but he kind of have to spot play because you don't know when he's actually gonna use up one of his his two-way days and then Santi aldama is the only one in my eyes that's really all that close GG Jackson was out for this game for violating a team rule he's playable on the points League side I don't think Gigi is a guy for nine cat  aldama remains a question mark I remain somewhat hopeful but then he comes out and shoots two for nine like that's that's the that's the Rub With all dhamma we know it's percentages are not going to be helpful what we don't know is how unhelpful they're going to be  and I know I'm repeating myself I don't want to look the short version is if he's you know 45 and 75 his splits he'll be in nine cat play if he is 42 and 62 he won't and right now he's closer to 42 and 62  but also how many guys have his fantasy appeal and are suddenly gonna get 30 minutes a game out there not that many  also Grizzly's added Jordan Goodwin mentioned this on yesterday's podcast keep an eye on him in their next ball game  it's a 10 day or so it would be a short term thing at least to start but we know he has excellent Fantasy game so one eye on Jordan Goodwin  Dante even chenzo heard a hamstring why oh I don't know maybe because the Knicks have been playing everybody 45 minutes a game for the last three weeks Tibbs is breaking people man he's breaking with it he's breaking his toys  that's what he always does he's like that kid that just plays a little too hard with his toys  anyway you'll hold on to even shenzo until we find out how severe this thing is and plus you got the All-Star break coming up hold on Josh Hart hold on precious to chew a don't pick up Jericho Sims because heart and Stein is closed  Burks is a drop boy on bogdanovich probably a drop as we mentioned yesterday I called him a temple because I wanted to see what his role would look like with the team there if Stephen chenzo has to miss the next ball game you might be able to squeeze you know one good game out of book Nineveh even then I'm not entirely sure but he's going to Trend towards a drop at some point question is how long do you want to give him before you pulled the trigger on that  on the Houston side I'm in Thompson filling in for Freddie Van Fleet and as much as it pains me to say this and Dillon Brooks also filling in for Freddie Van Fleet Brooks is getting a lot of shots right now sometimes that's a bad thing for him but overall he's making enough of them in the Freddy Vande lead absence to be a fantasy stream so you've got two streamables in Thompson and Brooks until van Fleet comes back who will be reevaluated after the All-Star break Wizards hey tyus Jones career high 16 assists for sweet sweet tias  sweet sweet ties somehow he only stayed he didn't move up he was number 59 coming into this ball game and he left it number 59  it's harder to move up and down the board right now when we're this far into the season Marvin Bagley 12 and 13 and 28 minutes this is why we said to hold because there was just no way he was gonna play 15 minutes a game and they were gonna go all Deni avdija at Center because frankly there are some teams out there that are too big for that  Mavs happened to be one of them  so badly got almost starters minutes you guys know I hate his Fantasy game but if he's gonna get 28 to 35 minutes the Ballgame then he's going to end up being a start so hold on see what happens  again no guaranteed that it works but see what happens  give it a little longer  be allow know been trying to warn you guys about this for a long time Avia he had a bad shooting or free throw and turnover game this is kind of what happened in late last year but he's a hold right now because he is getting some small ball Center minutes that's good Corey kispert has cooled off you can go ahead and drop him I mean I like the fact that he's still trying to get 10 11 shots up per ball game that's good but his Fantasy game doesn't support holding on to him when he's cold to wait for the warm spells  Daniel Gafford PJ Washington both started for the Mavs yesterday PJ has clunky fantasy appeal so he as I mentioned I think is a drop Gafford 24 minutes  which I mean honestly could have been more but what am I gonna get greedy 16 points 17 rebounds two steals five blocks you can call it a Revenge game if you want but honestly he just fits with doncic and Irving he can attack the rim pretty similarly to the way Derek Lively can but he's a better Defender and he's not gonna make as many mistakes  so he got three guys you can start on the Mavs right now Luka Kyrie and Gafford those are your three  a lot of folks again this is another one a lot of people asking me on Twitter if I thought Gafford whatever start for the Mavs and if anybody watched my trade deadline show I said I thought he'd start almost immediately  well Warriors blew out the Jazz dubs are playing better jazz or playing worse Utah has again kind of leaned into the not that's not a full tank obviously because moving a bhaji and olenek is not like you unloaded your best guys but part of what made the Jazz so appealing when they went on that hot run was that they had all these different lineup combos they could use and a linik was a glue guy in a lot of them so they gotta find and we'll come back to the Warriors let's talk Utah first we gotta find the Utah Jazz do someone that can be a connector in that same way and I don't know that they have that guy  Chris Dunn is probably your closest thing but he's not a floor space her  so who's gonna be the point guard  is he gonna be calling Sexton because he's not really a point guard is gonna be George because he's probably too young to do it  I think you does gonna feel this impact well the good news is John Collins is going to put up numbers what neck right in this ball game it'll be fine Walker Kessler is going to finally put a big numbers enjoy this run Colin Sexton keep playing him Jordan Clarkson showing signs of waking back up again this could be sort of like the next little mini heater for him after that big downturn you're not picking up tht you're not picking up taeler Hendrix I don't know where that Taylor Hendricks Twitter stuff was coming from and then can't take George I've been out on for a long time you keep one eye on him keep one eye on Kris Dunn all so just to see if any consistency forms but there hasn't been so far so black over on the Warriors side we said hold Klay Thompson he bounced back hold Andrew Wiggins he's been okay hold Drake on obviously staff Jonathan kaminga showing signs of slowing down after his world beating three month long Mega heater that was just like the most obvious sell High moment on planet Earth he'll be fine he'll be a top 100 guy the rest of the way or maybe even a little  bit better but you probably could have gotten like a top 60 dude when he was really cooking at like a first second round pace for three weeks  now that'll be harder and then Brandon pajam skis the other one I think he's probably trending towards a drop in many formats and a lot of that's because Gary Payton came back and he's gonna ramp up because he's their best defender uh Wing Defender at least outside of Draymond who's you know he's always gonna be the anchor on that side so Payton's gonna get some minutes as his body solidifies and a bunch of other guys are gonna give him some of those minutes and some are gonna come from pajam ski who was close  now if someone is hurt like if clay takes a game off or if Wiggins needs a game off or whatever and he gets start in my eyes that's probably when it goes back so maybe downgraded to a fill in level dude  and that's probably why I leave it on Brandon  and the last one before we wrap it up for the day Minnesota blew out the Clippers in a game that had  this many fantasy angles  goose egg  these two teams have nothing if it's a zubats didn't have as many minutes in this one mostly because he was getting runoff the court not run off the court that's not the right expression you just get him played off the court by Kat and gaubert they were just better but he was still fine zubats belongs on rosters as a low end Center he'll be in that kind of Nick Richards department and otherwise there's just nothing Jaden McDaniels left early again think he ended up making it through but he'll be in and out of the lineup a little bit coming up here and you know Nas Reed Gets A Small Bump when he is out and slow mo Gets A Small Bump when McDaniels is out but nothing that like tips the scales so much that you have to act on it immediately  and that ladies and gentlemen is a show that took longer than I expected it too but we went super in depth on some of those recently traded guys I think that's honestly what everybody wanted me to talk about one question that chat room was about Payton on Denver he's a possibility to be interesting for a game yeah I mean I would consider it probably is that going into the All-Star break I don't know if he's gonna be good in their game tomorrow and it's not like you can say oh well maybe we like take a game and see how it goes and then pick him up because then they have a week off and presumably Jamal Murray will be back maybe kcp is back on the other side of that and then we've picked up a guy and didn't even really get to use him so I would probably watch someone like a Peyton Watson on Wednesday and then if we come out of the All-Star break and the same guys are still out for Denver then you maybe make that swap like next Wednesday or next Thursday morning or something but that's my hesitation to dive in right now that's a good question on on Peyton Watson  here's a fun question we can ask at the end who is the sexiest player in the NBA and why is it Davis Burton's I don't know man why is it Davis we'll leave that one for the chat room  is Davos love coming through  maybe it's the sweet like pseudo comb over thing for a guy who doesn't need to sweep his hair over like that just wait Davis you're only 31 the hair will continue to thin and then you can really bring in the comb over you know what maybe people like Davis bertans because he looks like what was that toy called was it called Willie Willie was that the toy where you could magnetize a beard and hair and like the easiest thing to do is always just to put a beard and then Loop it around at the top and that's what Davos looks like to me because he's got like the hair that goes into the fade and then comes right back for the beard so it's like hair knot hair hair  cartoonish  it is cartoonish  so yeah I think that's that 50 minutes feels like enough doesn't it  but but doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  I'll start break coming up what the hell are we gonna talk about over the All-Star break  I'm gonna come up with some ideas man but I guess you guys don't listen to  me talk through that on are I'm Dan Bass Pros
