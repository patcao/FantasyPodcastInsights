welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right let's get this party started  it's a pity party today news of the morning Karl Anthony towns has been diagnosed with the torn meniscus in his left knee and is out indefinitely as per the Shams charania tweet a couple hours ago this is  extremely unfortunate news  although  we need to kind of take it step by step  by the way this show is also going to be a Wednesday recap show so welcome to Fantasy NBA today I'm Dan Bass Pros at Dan West best little over on social media so please do find a way to go check me out over there  so immediately after the Shams tweet or a couple minutes later I guess I should say we got the watch we got a Chris hinge tweet about Ben Simmons not that anybody cared Simmons is out by the way for the rest of the year to nobody's surprise I mean we said five games he played a few more than that so congratulations I guess he hit the over on our board but a couple minutes after that  woge tweeted  that cat suffered a left meniscus injury but it remains unclear  about how much if any time he'll be required to miss towns and his team are working to get full understanding of the degree of injury and whether it demands immediate action  it would be  I think somewhat jarring to see cat play in Minnesota's next ball game they've already started to ask the players what they think about it  on the team and they're all talking about you know how they all need to step up and things like that  so that's I think a pretty good indication that they're expecting to miss towns for some length of time when we don't know exactly what that is perhaps he goes the surgical route which is month month and a half something in that range if he moves comes back quickly perhaps they go the rest and recover thing  so  what do we do  that's always the quick question what do we do first thing is you got to go grab NOS Reed  if he's not  already on a team  presumably he's already on a team because he'd been playing well with slow-mo had been out for a little bit in there and go bare missed the ball game and so there were these opportunities to pick up nazreen last week and it's kind of carried through he had like one quiet game in there but overall he's had more opportunity but if he's on the wire go and scoop him fast  if he's unavailable your other choice here is the aforementioned slow-mo  now I don't know that there's a guarantee that Kyle Anderson hits 12 team startable value he hasn't really had the role when we talked about this on yesterday's show he hasn't really had the role this season forget just a minute drop off because last year he played 28 minutes this year he's at 22 forget the minute drop off its the  what is he doing in his time on the floor in my eyes at least that is I must say more jarring necessarily but it's something like he's playing 22 minutes a game but he's not really being asked to do anything he's taking 5.2 shots three and a half rebounds the assists are kind of the only thing right now that's where you'd expect of him the steals pace is basically where he's been for the last three or four seasons but the block pace is lower  so the scoring is down because the field goal percent is down and does an absence of cat does that allow him to maybe take a few extra shots when he's on the court  uh  I don't know so I don't think that with Anderson he's someone that you have to go race out and pick up I think that this is he's a name where  I think that's one where if you're going and you're adding Kyle Anderson you're doing it because you feel like you need to do something with this news but the thing you need to do with this new is check to see if nazri is on a roster and if he is on a roster then you kind of just have to say oh well and move on to the next thing now if Kylie Anderson comes out in Minnesota's next ball game and plays 28 or 29 minutes to me that changes everything because even in a in a lower volume role that's enough playing time for him to be a workable fantasy asset in pretty much every format because he'll get you over a steel he'll get you close to a block we'll get you five plus rebounds we'll get you close to 5 assisted you about eight to nine points somewhere in that neck of the woods in 2829 minutes of ball game that's playable on good field goal percent not great for throw buddy done really take any he doesn't shoot the three ball either but that combination of assists and Steals and blocks and some rebounds that's probably enough to get him in the mix but again we're going to need full starters minutes to get him there slow mo in this lower usage roll  he's not going to do it in 24 25 minutes of ball game he needs to be 28 plus  so don't overextend yourself specially in a time right now where there are a million players popping up on the wire and we'll talk about them when we get into the recap part of our show here momentarily there are so many names out there of guys that might be useful over the next couple of weeks that special on the head side if you're blowing a roster move on this you know there's other considerations for head-to-head also which is Minnesota's terrible schedule coming up starting next week  if you're in a brutal battle right now you could pick up both Nas and Kyle Anderson because they go three times over the next four days that's great for head to head if you're in Roto it's only nazreen  and then if you're in Haddad you probably have to punt on a lot of your Timberwolves including guys that have been useful all year like a Mike Conley around number 70 if you're in a playoff week and he's got a two gamer next week  that's probably not holdable  so nasreen in college and definitely wouldn't be holdable next week  again Head to Head Roto such a different discussion right now most of what I tried to do and I should roll it back a tiny bit this is our morning show this is one of two shows happening today later on this afternoon we're going to show that just breaks things down from a head-to-head standpoint that's a schedule bass show because I'm assuming a lot of folks are in their playoffs right now this morning show which has breaking news today but is generally just one where we recap what's been going on this is more of a schedule independent analysis  either you don't have your playoffs right now or you're in a rudely or you're in some other format that doesn't have playoffs whatever it is a lot of what I break down on these morning shows during these weeks is geared more towards rest of season not schedule specific schedule specific stuff is going to be in our our second show our quick hitter our 10 to 15 minute guy that runs early in the afternoon so if you're not worried about the schedule nasri is very much a go for however long you need him slow-mo I think is a wait-and-see  what we're doing with this stuff  I'm not even gonna talk about the Ben Simmons news because he's been out anyway so it literally thank you Rob Lowe's character from Parks and Rec literally has nothing to do with anything that we're working on we had basically just assumed we'd been basically we've been playing onto the  overwhelming assumption that he wasn't gonna play anyway all right officially now welcome to the show again I'm Dan Bass Pros this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation please friends

express VPN  all righty let's see what happened yesterday shall we will try to move at a little bit of a better clip since we spent 10 minutes on the towns injury or Lando beat Charlotte this game was a closer  no Elena Washington excuse me that was the day before this game was closer than it needed to be or Lando resting Wendell Carter Junior so go go batsy and MOG split the center minutes like they did for that month and a half that Wendell was out and it went pretty much the way it did back then where those guys split them they were both kind of fringy assets and neither one is an obvious must play guy's specially with or Lando schedule getting kind of wonky here in the next few days  Jalen Suggs I think is the only name I really cared to mention he's been playing better of late um I still don't think I quite have the stones to place Suggs against a roto games cap he's number one oh five on the season over the last month he's number one thirty three after that hot start over the last two weeks he's Number 96 while shooting 58% so you know that's not a thing that's going to stick he's been hot of late can't rely on that so I still Teeter towards a no for Suggs for nine categories and then nobody else I think is really worth our time  over on the wizard side with Marvin Bagley out we don't know exactly for how long you missed this ball game you might miss another one was curious if they'd go small or big and the answer was small to start but intermittently to a tiny bit larger any of the start at Center in this ball game but we're Sean Holmes did come off the bench and play 25 minutes and historically 25 minutes has been enough for him problem is I have no idea if he's gonna get 25 minutes again he was playing well in this one so he got extra run but if we're Sean comes out and he's playing like weird molasses version Rashawn Halls where he's running underwater then he won't get 25 minutes and if badly happens to resurface here in the next game or two then all of this is sort of a moot point  so watch list for homes for now if we find out he's starting the next ball game let's say Washington decides to go to a baker lineup I think I'd probably drop him in there because you're guaranteed like 20 to 22 minutes which wouldn't be good but at least he would raise the floor up on a worst case scenario there and there's a little bit of upside built in in the meantime until we know what's going on with the Wizards next ball game and whether or not real Holmes is starting  uh avda is a big winner here Kula police started but I don't care bench Jordan Poole continues to do stuff so fire him up every place and then Corey kisper he started got into awful foul trouble early in this ball game managed to squeak out 19 kind of rough minutes if he starts again in the next one I would probably play him even though this one was an epic disaster  I don't expect kids to be in foul trouble in another ball game he's very he he's kind of been triggered happy here lately which is good for Fantasy purposes so start him if he starts if he goes back to the bench and Holmes starts in Stead then you kind of you probably just play a start the starter kind of thing between those two guys  the zombie Grizzlies were just a tiny bit less Undead yesterday Jaron Jackson Jr came back and played 37 dazzling minutes 30 points 11 boards six blocks for JJ  it does I think he's trying to get to 65 games I don't know these gonna qualify for any of the various Awards but it does kind of feel like that's where he's trying to get to I was surprised to see Santi aldama put up a really nice ball game here despite JJJ being in aldam was a guy that I'm only playing when Jared Jackson sits which means I missed out on a huge ball game but that's the way I'm handling aldama  so look here's what we're doing basically every time the Grizzlies play on this podcast we're just gonna Bing Bang Boom through the names on the board Vince Williams start every day JJ if he's playing start every day Luke Kennard if he's starting start him  and beyond that things get pretty complicated aldama in my opinion generally is tied to weather and Jackson's in so start as an injury replacement their Lamar Stevens not getting enough minutes John konchar is role is not secure enough because he refuses to shoot so he needs 32 ish minutes to be useful GG Jackson's know Matthew heard his obviously you know you may have noticed that Ravi is the one that I didn't bring up yet  Jake played 32 minutes yesterday and they were really really good ones  deep breath  we don't really know what's coming for him blur Avia in the next ball game he was 1913 blocks in two three-pointers here this is sort of I mean this is a delightful line but there's absolutely no indicators that this is the thing that's going to happen every ball game  he has double-digit rebounds in two consecutive games which is notable both wins by the way for the Grizzlies the zombie Grizzlies on the road 14 points 10 boards in the previous one 1913 and this one the three blocks did feel like a little bit of an outlier for him he's six seven kind of a stocky six seven type  he has had a couple other ball games where his minutes were higher February 26th and March 1st and those were separated games by games where his minutes were much lower in those he had 10 and 5 with a steal and 21 and 2 with a steal in the other one  so someone were to come to us and say hey I can guarantee you that  rabies gonna play 28 minutes I'd be like all right yeah I'll give him a shot  but it just doesn't there I don't know that we can  safely assume it's going to happen in the next ball game  and again this is scheduled Independence stuff Memphis is schedule is sort of fine over the next four or five days five five six days something like that so I you know I don't think that matters either way but in my opinion it's just it's too terrifying  I don't know how you drop him in against the games cap  if you wanted to if you were like I don't want to miss out on a on a radio Mega Run uh I mean okay you know you stick them on your bench or whatever and if you're in Head to Head  because the Grizzlies schedule is sort of fine starting they don't play today but starting tomorrow they go four times in six days you could just do it and hope for the best but I wouldn't use them against the games cap until we know for certain that he's going to be getting more playing time  Billy things are getting super weird around here this is a Tyrese Maxey concussion game two there hoping to have him back in the not too distant future because it was listed as a mild concussion whatever the hell that means  Jeff Dalton Jr had a really nice ball game Off the Bench but I'm gonna kindly pass on him Nick Batum was fine but I'm going to kindly pass there as well campaign at 165 and 4 but brutal feel goal percent and that's always gonna be the rub with him points League campaign is your filling for Tyrese Maxey 9 cat you're gonna take more hidden hit with pain then good you're going to get he will do more damage than good is what I'm getting at there for Philly their schedule is sort of also fine they go every other day starting tomorrow it's not a thing that you need to be you know reaching sort of reaching for  Kelly oubre is going to be great well all the usages out there buddy hield is going to be very good while the usage is out there he also shot the ball terribly but you know he did some other stuff that that pain is unable to do I would trust heeled certainly more and that one when everything levels off and then Paul Reed is kind of the question mark here because he's now slid back into the starting five Bamba has completely disappeared  and Nick nurse is getting a little bit silly with it all so no Kyle Lowry in this ball game another reason to kind of look at a guy like campaign or a Jeff doubt and say  because Larry's gonna play in all these other games when they're going every other day  so Lowry's the guy you're picking up to use against a game's cap  when he comes back just know that Phillies next back-to-back is March 24th and 25th so you'll have whatever it is one two three four five six seven about eight nine games of loudly before like the next rest day I don't really know what to do with Paul Paul Reed  be straight up with you guys I don't really know it seems like he's probably an ad again if he's back to starting comfortably but it could change in the next ball game for all we know  maybe the benching was him dealing with a little minor injury or an illness or something like that that they don't really want to go into or maybe it was just a wake up call  probably belongs on rosters is my take on Paul Reed I'd say probably an ad  I know really planted my flag in that one aren't I uh zombie Cavaliers these days so sort of they have Darius Garland they still have Jared Allen but everybody else has hurt seemingly George and yang got the start for Max in this one I thought it was going to be Sam Merrill so that one didn't work out at all and hopefully you guys saw the starting lineup and you were able to pull Merle I was too late to do so and that one really hurt whoever starts for Max Drew's is probably the guy you're playing there you know why we make this thing simple Dean Wade not good enough for his spots start Garland and Jared Allen obviously you're starting and so then you're making a choice between guys like niang Merrill and Charis Levert up you guys know I hate Caris Levert's efficiency issues but honestly there should be enough volume for him to kind of overcome those more often than not efficiency was awful awful awful in this ball game but I assume it'll be better in the next one so Levert is probably a start giving the current construction okoro is a start given the current construction and then if Meryl fills in for screws you probably start him if niang fills in for sure so I think you could probably start him neither one of those guys is super high upside they're both three points streamers so you don't have to please don't take this advice to say oh dance at I need to go start George and no you if you're hunting threes he would be a great filling if Meryl starts in your hunting threes then he would be the great filming but a coral and Levert are the guys you can probably go with kind of  whether or not you're you're  just trying to tick out one statistical category  as if we needed more bad news on top of the car Anthony Town stuff Jalen Johnson bad ankle tweak and yesterday's game for Atlanta he will likely miss a I would think at least a week maybe more from this one I mean I hope I'm wrong  but I don't think I'm wrong  piss is all I have to say about that  and now you know what I got another word for it not only do I say piss I also say farts piss and farts on this Jalen Johnson news  he's been one of the best fantasy plays and maybe the fantasy draft pick of the year but he did miss some time early and he's probably gonna miss some time now and that could kill you if you're in the playoffs hopefully you have a way to stick him in an eel slot When likely that designation comes down otherwise you're gonna have a tough decision to make click capella only 23 minutes he's still being what restricted I don't think they want to really run him up into the 30s because they think his body's gonna fall apart so he and Bruno Fernando are splitting the sentiment it's almost right down the pipe right now  in fact in this ball game  did they go exactly down the middle yeah right down the middle Fernando and capella someone I posted on Twitter last night when we were talking about the Jalen Johnson stuff I said something like we don't really know who's gonna step up right now  and someone asked if it was going to be brutal Fernando but here's the thing he didn't play power forward Bruno had a nice ball game yesterday  as the backup center  there wasn't really a backup power forward to deploy for this team  what ended up happening is that Sadiq Bay played about six seven extra minutes and dejounte Murray probably played two or three extra minutes and I would assume that someone like a DeAndre Hunter probably plays a few extra minutes when it's not I think this is part of a back-to-back right yeah you'll see a little more out of Garrison Mathews or probably see a couple extra minutes from Trent Forrest  you'll see a couple extra minutes from both on both basically all of the usuals  and the unusuals everybody is going to take like four extra minutes just across the board  so you take Jalen Johnson's 30-ish and you just split it like four a piece between seven guys basically thinking he's been playing what 33 minutes ball game without looking it up something like that that's the way it's going to shake out it's not going to be I don't think one key guy although certainly for a guys like saddiq Bey and DeAndre Hunter who already had all the opportunity in the universe with Trey young out they get even more somehow so the main guys capella barely a start Fernando you can look at but I'm not all that excited about him but Bogdan Bay dejounte Murray these are the guys that just and Hunter these guys just get to do a little bit more  no real notes on the Clippers Terrence Mann is still kind of in his little mini heater but all he did was hit five out of five shots or sort of nothing else there Norman Powell's the one you're sort of looking at and saying could  he sustained some kind of consistency with Russell Westbrook out in the answer is probably no  Houston not much to to shake out here either big game from Alpine good games from Freddy van Fleet in Jabari Smith Jr and the young guys are unable to do enough to stay in the lineup  sadly is a pretty good game for Kim Whitmore but again not enough I'm in Thompson not enough  I wish it was enough but it's not enough  Chicago barely hanging on to beat the zombie Jazz mostly because Alex Caruso is amazing four steals three blocks and three three-pointers oh Chicago why didn't you trade this dude and get all of the assets but either way you start the starters in Chicago until they play a giant opponent then you start Andre Drummond simple simple simple  for Utah no keyonte George in this one again still dealing with the after effects of a flu bug or a bad cold or whatever it is he'll be back soon in the meantime Kris Dunn has unfettered access to the point guard spot so he's a spot play with keyonte George out  John Collins free reign at Center because Kessler's out in a linen got traded so that's great  Jordan Clarkson 17 shots he was bad in this ball game but if he's taking 17 shots he's a start and a lot of that has to do with George and Mark an in both being out  there's probably enough usage for Clarkson even when keonte comes back but it'll be more borderline and then Bryce sensible come out of nowhere 15 and 12 game but basically nothing else  and you know me Captain buzzkill here on the podcast I'm just gonna let you guys know  when a guy has a really good game like sensible did I don't want to take anything away from his nice ball game but it's because he shoots five of eight from the field three of three at the foul line makes two three-pointers and just goes Max efficiency for a night which you got to look at is did he do anything else no steals no blocks one assist is there a way to float his value if he doesn't basically play a perfect offensive game  and I think the answer sadly is no  plus when keyonte George comes back you'll see Chris Dunn lose six minutes but you also see sense of Bob probably loose about 15 he's an interesting young basketball player I'll give him that but I don't think there's a guarantee that he's getting 30 minutes the rest of the way and even if he does get 30 minutes I don't know that there's a guarantee he posts value in them  I don't think you need to raise out and pick him up watch lists watch list on sensible guns the one where you could just throw him in there if we know if we find out keonte George is missing another ball game  the Thunder haven't had a fantasy note in how long is the season gone on now four and a half months yeah about that long Portland has plenty of fantasy notes though let's hover over the Blazers here for a moment  whoo boy where to begin all right so the Blazers have a lot of guys out right now but Jeremy Grant did come back and Anthony Simons was still in there  so let's just start at the core you can obviously start those two guys  great thumbs up terrific DeAndre Aiden was doubtful for this game coming in which many basically wasn't playing because what are the Blazers have to play for I do think we probably see Aiden at some point before this season's done  I don't know when  and in the meantime do I breathe is a very low end Center replacement because he's a center that shoots the three ball a little bit but doesn't really rebound or get many defensive stats  okay free throw shooter bad feel goal percent there's not in my eyes that really isn't enough good to outweigh the bad in Roto  Portland has a really good schedule coming up so again tweak all of this we'll talk about the Blazers on our second half of the show later on this afternoon but like for the is this someone that's good enough to to use against the games cap is this someone that I can pick up for a long-term thing  you know my cut off is  I'm not I'm trying not to use a games for anybody who's putting up numbers that are kind of outside that top 15 120 range and obviously in a perfect world I'd aim for anybody 99 or better  and I don't know that any of these guys on the Blazers is 99 or better long-term  to Monte Cara who still out with an illness is probably well Matisse probably your your next in line because if he's healthy he can put up a ton of defensive stats and that's enough to kind of carry him  but I'm not adding him in rodo I'm not adding Jabari Walker because his Fantasy game is super limited I'm not adding Chris Murray because his Fantasy game is limited I'm not adding wreath because his game is limited I'm not adding Banton because his game is limited  Camaro would be the one behind Bible where it's like all right well you know if we find out these guys can settle into let's say Matisse Place 2829 minutes consistently you only got 26 and this one but it was enough because he hit his threes  Camaro needs 30 plus Bible probably needs about 28 to get there and then you know Jabari Walker not only needs a lot of minutes but he needs more usage guys out of the way Reef no Benton no Murray know so that's the thing with the Blazers is that you've got a bunch of guys that don't have  particularly translatable nine category Fantasy game  although we did hear by the way I don't forget to mention this it sounds like scoot Anderson might be back by The Weeknd who  mind you is also another guy who doesn't really have nine cat translatable Fantasy game but if he happens to surface we get word that's like oh scoot's gonna play on tomorrow or they got a game the next day Saturday against Toronto  that would be a guy you probably pick up and just ride with it because Portland starting tomorrow goes five times in seven days on the head-to-head side so head-to-head he becomes very interesting but I don't know how you had any of those guys in Roto  they've all been nine category disasters  yeah I mean that's like  it's your you're reaching a little bit there  um hey this is a great time for me to remind you guys of one of our amazing Partners here on the show so  listen  I do want to quickly mention to all of you watching why it's important  to

today  let's finish up talking about some of these ball games Milwaukee  got smoked in Golden State Giannis came back it didn't really go as planned not surprisingly Patrick Beverley went back to the bench and also sadly went back to doing very little I don't want to take too much away from the Milwaukee side of this ball game one thing I will note is that while Malik Beasley remains a perfectly serviceable replacement for Chris Middleton and he's been kind of hovering in that doesn't matter Zone almost the entire season at this point he has and he's been on kind of a cold spell by and large so if he heats up you'd see him you know move from the 130 range to like the 80 range and back and forth  I give you all full permission to use your Malik Beasley roster side if you have him and  try out somebody else there's just all these things that are gonna pop up now during Silly Season that you don't have to settle for a player who's going to be in that doesn't matter group  meanwhile over on the Golden State side which was a little bit more interesting and all so more confusing Andrew Wiggins came back from his personal leave and only played 14 minutes  I'll admit I don't know what it means my assumption is that he's either mentally physically or both not all the way back  I do think that Wiggins has the upside and we saw it for a few weeks a month ish before he left the team for these personal reasons we know Wiggins has the individual per game upside to Walmart to roster spot in almost every format  so what I would recommend here what am I doing is usually the question is I'm stashing him on my roto bench I'll pick them up but I'm not playing him because he has better upside than a lot of the guys that are floating around on the waiver wire right now but you can't use them against the games cap until we actually see him play 27 28 minutes in a ball game will that be tonight against Chicago I don't know San Antonio on Saturday San Antonio again on Monday they don't have a great schedule so I had to headers you guys probably just have to let him sit  trying to put gemski played 26 minutes in this one I ultimately don't think he's gonna need to be rostered he's a guy that needs basically full starters minutes to get there especially when this team has their usage guys in  Klay Thompson's a whole he would have played more if this game wasn't a blowout Chris Paul it did a lot in a little he's a hold as well Jonathan kaminga better ball game for him he's been very up and down as we talked about but I'm assuming most of you are past your trade deadline but if not sell high on coming when he has some good ball games in a row  and then Trace Jackson Davis went crazy for 18 minutes he is not an ad  and finally wrapping up yesterday's card dear and fox boy does he love playing the Lakers but who doesn't if you're a fast guard  just cooking Lakers guards I mean this game was like the most prime example of how the Lakers Miss Jarred Vanderbilt and Gabe Vincent the only two guys that they have that can maybe stand a chance and Vanderbilt wouldn't be able to stand a chance because he's too big of staying in front of an offensive player no one else on this team ever stays in front of anybody  Austin Reeves started to try to do it in the second half but like  wolf  anyway as far as the king's go Kevin herder was was a disaster in this game Malik muck is is badly out playing him right now also again another fast guard just roasting the Lakers  Malik mugs been a head-to-head stream for about three or four weeks now this game obviously would have played on both head to head and Roto and I have explained it before but without going into too much excruciating detail why do I call him head-to-head stream and not a rooster stream is that for monk there's usually one or two categories where he's not good at all and so that pulls his value down but it's almost like an artificial sag on the value  if you're in any format headwear maybe that's not a category you're attacking he leaps into the must play territory so keep streaming monk herders dead meat trade Lyles played 30 minutes in this ball game kind of a weird twist they ended up going a little bigger but also Harrison Barnes I like  wolf  doesn't matter not much on the king's LeBron left this game late just a couple minutes to go Lakers were were out of it by then he was in the middle of a very nice offensive ball game he and rui hachimura were it's so weird I mean I know this podcast isn't the venue for me to vent about the Lakers rotations and and what Darvin ham does with this team but good Lord what a disaster  if LeBron has to miss a ball game really hachimura who already was putting up pretty big offensive numbers he'll be asked to do more  on the boards more than anything they'll go tell rui you got to go get a damn rebound which continues to be a massive issue for this Lakers team  Anthony Davis always struggles with the monastery bonus I don't know why they didn't try something different  like maybe play a big lineup see what happens there let's somebody else get beat up by sabonis and let add do some more roaming nope  just press the try it again button  idiotic  anyway he'll be fine as long as he's not playing it's a bonus again Dilo add LeBron Reeves those guys are playing but if LeBron sits out you'll get a lot of extra add d d low and reads and you'll get really moving more definitively above the cut line  and that's that meanwhile the only liqueur that I can find actually two Lakers had a plus one plus minus was Max Christie and jaxson Hayes poor Max Christie  what did he do to deserve this I do not know  and that's your yesterday ladies and gentlemen that's yesterday's card again I'm gonna take a quick look at the chat room now just to see if anybody brought up a point that I forgot to mention but before I do that I want to remind everyone once again  that after the conclusion of this show I'm gonna go take care of some various work stuffs throughout the day probably helping to promote that baseball draft guy again and come on give it a go yeah  yeah  and then after lunch we'll get our streaming show going  okay that'll be one the other half of that is so make sure you subscribe so that you can get alerted when that showed drops we do it with a couple hours to go typically before lineup block so you should have time to make your moves today if you want to make any but you're not going to get it in time if you're not subscribing so please take a moment subscribe however you take in the show like it if you're watching either on Twitter or on YouTube or whatever and hey I haven't bugged you that much I sort of say it in passing but like at some point here towards the end of this season I'm gonna start asking people individually to drop some five star reviews on stuff now it would be a perfectly okay time if you guys wanted to do that early pretty please  I would have got in the chat room who is a lot of chats today what do we got Delonte says I grabbed Lonnie Walker over Dorian Finney Smith and shortly after DFS got grabbed then Lonnie got ruled questionable oops that's a dirty word I didn't mean to put that on there sorry everybody we tried to keep this clean I didn't read the very last word of the post  um  yeah I mean not much you can do about that other than hope that Walker plays through it if he's out you probably get a pretty good Dennis Smith Jr game so keep one eye on that  a lot of chatter in the chat room which is I guess where chat happens chatter happens in the chat room  about the cat situation I think we covered that in pretty good form is DeAndre Hunter worth a waiver add I'm gonna say yeah  specially the Jalen Johnson out they're gonna have to give Hunter basically whatever minutes is legs can handle  for this current week only a coral or buddy hield  we do do I think they each have two games left right  give me buddy two games to two games  should I keep both even chenzo and Josh Hart or drop one of them keep them both until somebody comes back to the Nicks they've been great next got a good report today sounds like Mitchell Robinson is is ramping up that'll ruin Isaiah hartenstein at least that'll make it easier for us to part with hardenstein and is weird Achilles situation  also it sounds like ogn and Nobby is now just a week or two away so we may get some drops coming up for the next but not yet  is yaka portal is safe drop if your playoffs start next week basically um yeah probably  is Jeremy Grant for Kelly Olynyk a fair trade yes it is so I mean someone's gonna be like oh no Jeremy Grant is bitter here's the thing a Linux probably gonna be better from a per game standpoint and you don't have the quite as large of a shutdown risk at play if this thing gets vetoed it's because everybody doesn't want you getting a Linux he's the other way around but that's a fair trade  uh what else we got here anything else that is khris Middleton Trey man or Kelly Olynyk that's a linik  Santee or Domo or Luke Kennard  well Kinard has been missing some games so you probably have to go all dhamma if this is games cap you go Kinard because you just play them when he starts and if it's head-to-head you probably go Santee because you just don't want any zeros mixed in there guys I'm not gonna do the whole like rank six guys things I'm sorry that's just not a thing I can do live on air I can do these quick ones I can do a couple of names that maybe I didn't mention like we didn't talk much about the Knicks because they didn't play yesterday  um and you know if that gets into strategic stuff that's fine but if your question is like rank Five Guys  not happening you can take that into Discord you can hit the pros if you're on an NBA pass you have access to the premium Pro Q&A if not you can take it and go kind of crowdsource it or throw it in the comments section on the show after the fact here on YouTube that's all so a viable strategy if you so choose  by the way  what was the final total on games played for Ben Simmons this year  15  how many of those were after he came back from injury  because we said over under five he went over five  but it wasn't my much one two three four five six seven eight nine he played nine games after coming back from injury just barely squeaked out the over still I don't think I can count it because he didn't crack 24 minutes in any of those games  guys  if we've learned anything it's stopped dealing with Ben Simmons it's just not gonna be worth your time  go spend your fantasy brain space and draft Capital somewhere else  here's an interesting one who would I drop first Jalen Johnson or Marvin Bagley well  it's an almost impossible question actually because Bagley is day to day and I think Jalen Johnson is going to be more weak to weak but if you've got a stream right now it's badly because Jalen Johnson is so much better and we don't officially have a report for him on it  it didn't look good for Jalen let's just say that so on all likely that he misses more time than Bagley does but we don't know maybe Bagley misses a week and if that's the case then it kind of works out the same for you he doesn't it  so I think it's got to be backley  but a little boo should I drop buddy hield to add Nick Richard punting free throw percent  starting Monday ah boy Nick Richards is not very good but Charlotte does have a very good schedule starting tomorrow basically they go six times in nine days  oh you got four games in six days to start next week I have Nick Richards you only get three games in those six days out of buddy hield I think I probably stay with healed  I think three games out of yield is probably better than for out of Richard's  and is Malik Beasley a drop vinyl collector I talked about this earlier on the show by the way I think Malik Beasley is droppable because they're just a lot of really interesting players floating around right now  well I'll tell you whatever I did differently over on the way we're posting these shows on on social media these days my streamer says there's 720 people watching right now must be mostly over on Twitter I actually know what it has the breakdown that's cool about 100 on YouTube and 600 Twitter wow that's pretty cool  hmm all right I think that's gonna wrap us up we've cleared the 45-minute Mark oh a quick question here what do I do with Donte divincenzo when the OG comes back you wait and see I wouldn't do any pre drops there it might be Josh Hart that takes the hit or might be a two of it takes a hit and Dante was putting up pretty close to startle numbers even before all the injuries happen and he had to begin taking 20 shots of ball game so I would hold basically as long as you possibly can even gentle has been very good and could still post value even after guys start to come back  where is your hat from oh that's awesome ski bear that's asking Bear he's the cow mascot Cal Berkeley I'm a UC Berkeley molecular and cell biology grad  why did I go into baseball basketball broadcasting and fantasy sports a glutton for punishment I guess  I don't know in my eyes becoming a doctor was a glutton for punishment it's fine though I married a doctor so it worked out  so anyway go Bears  go Cal Bears I think they play Stanford coming up here so it's it's rivalry time for my California Golden Bears newest members of the ACC oh what's up Admiral Nita molecular biology there too what was your emphasis mine was Immunology  some people always like what do I do about this cold and I'm like I don't know man drink some OJ  was actually fun I still find Immunology extremely interesting but I just really didn't want to be a doctor and I'm a bit of a  well I just like the sound of my own voice I figured that was weird because people always like  everybody always talks about how they hate their own voice and so I thought well if I'm like one of the only people who kind of likes how I sound myself then maybe I should do something where I just  listen to my own voice all the time  and here we are  if you guys like the sound of my voice I will be broadcasting USC Trojans baseball all weekend long Friday Saturday night and then Sunday afternoon those games are available I believe on the I think it's on the ESPN Plus app perhaps or on the Trojans website you know either way get to hear me  shout into the void in another not into the void though there are people around me for that stuff all right we've lost the thread here on the show thank you again once
