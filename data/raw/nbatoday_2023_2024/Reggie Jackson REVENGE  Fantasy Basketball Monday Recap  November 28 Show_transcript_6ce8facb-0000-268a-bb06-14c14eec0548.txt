welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  all right guys I tried to take fewer medicines today we're gonna see how this goes on a podcast welcome  it's crazy Tuesday the final in season tournament evening  of qualifiers in the NBA this is fantasy and NBA today and we're gonna break it all down in just a matter of moments  thanks for tuning in everybody you those of you that have been watching or listening over the last  month  have seen me suffer through the throws of a violent cough  and then a sinus infection and I do feel like today I've made actual progress towards legitimate adult health  for the first time in  no that's not fair my cough did get better like three or four days ago it's not all the way better but it improved and now I think finally today the sign is infection maybe finally subsiding I don't know what happened to me guys funny thing is a lot of you that have been listening to this show for years remember when my first kid was like two or three I caught everything I was sick the entire year of 2018 and I don't know if you guys remember this either Brandon Marcus one of my good buddies fellow sports broadcaster fellow the host of our ethos Clippers show came on the show every Wednesday for one whole season and he brought by and sells to the show was fun it was wonderful we called it Brandon day and every Wednesday I was sick  and after a number of them Brandon finally was like are you okay dude like are you I mean no compromised you need to go to a doctor I'm like nah man I have it I have a 2 year old kid  and now he has a kid and he's sick all the time which is fun it's not shot and Friday for me it's just sort of like an understanding a certain you know your heart you feel it empathy  anyway my younger kid is three and a half now so you think I would have gone through some of this stuff but one of the weird things about and this is not fantasy but I don't care you guys get to hear a story every once in a while  the weird thing about covid is that even when we came out of the sort of big Pandemic part of it there was still masks and schools and lot of measures being taken just sort of stop the spread of General illness that have now basically gone away we've sort of just returned to normalcy outside of I think wearing masks in hospitals and doctors offices things are basically normal now which means now we're getting that whole what are younger one would have gotten when he was two when he's three  so we're just sick all the time in this house  except for our older kid knock on wood  apparently he had all these things and so he's just not getting him again  honestly I'll take it if the kids stay healthy in general and they can go to school and that means I can have time to do these pods even if I'm sniffling and coughing all over them  that's good news for you guys you get to listen to my mucousy face  all right let's do a show damn you've heard enough of this nonsense at the beginning I'm at Danvers over on social I hope you guys will find me over there please do like and subscribe or I don't care do it unlike if you don't want to hear me talk about my boogers at the beginning of a show I get it I don't want to hear it either but it's all I hear because it's inside my head  the boogers are calling from inside the building  well yesterday was Goofy wasn't it Monday was a wacko day mostly because Reggie Jackson went Buck freaking wild and we'll get to that ball game because that's at the end of the card it was a relatively short Monday but a few things that we want to break down here I don't know that this is going to be the world's longest episode a fantasy NBA today and frankly my voice could handle a little bit of a break because we're all going to do a Buy Low show later this afternoon that'll probably be coming closer to 130 or 2:00 later on today because I think through the scheduling of it you guys don't care just make sure you're subscribed make sure you know what you got alerts on and and when it pops up you'll get it and so far that one's been a pretty big hit in the community  Wizards were involved in another blowout which you know like  what do you want me to tell you at this point they either get blown out on the good side or the bad side  either way it's a damn blowout  Kyle kuzma continues to impress I maintain that I think he's a sell High guy he's number 60  he's kind of taking over as point kuzma  anytime ties Jones is off the floor he's the point guard because Jordan Poole has revealed himself to be  I don't know maybe the worst player in the damn NBA right now like Jordan Poole is absolutely atrocious he's number one in 199 in fantasy and it's worse than that if you watch it in real life  he's doing  like just generally idiotic things on the basketball court basically daily he's turning into a Twitter meme Knightley  I am so grateful that we dodged that bullet and the reason we dodged that bullet and this is not I want you guys to because sometimes people are like Dan the only part of your show that I don't like is when you pat yourself on the back this is not that this is how to interpret Lessons Learned  I dodged Jordan Poole in drafts because one of my strategies and drafts that we've talked about in more words than this but pairing it down to one sentence the strategy is basically don't draft somebody in the fourth round who could have the floor fall out from underneath them  even if there's upside and there was there was upside with Jordan Poole because if things clicked and he took 25 shots a game and he was scoring 30 points a night then the other stuff kind of wouldn't matter because you assume he shoots in the low 40% he becomes sort of a punt field goal guy but he's playing like 35 minutes and night and he's scoring high 20s with a bunch of threes and some assists and some Steals and great free throw numbers all that stuff doesn't really matter  but the reason that I didn't take the plunge on pool in any nine category league is because we've seen the bottom Fallout we saw it fall out last year in Golden state where he was getting a lot of playing time at a decent amount of usage and he was outside the top one 40 in nine category League's because his field goal percent was a drag he didn't block shots he didn't get that many steals his turnovers were high his rebounds were low his assists were fine his scoring was fine his threes were fine but it wasn't good enough to counterweight the damage he was doing  and he became more of a punt certain stuff kind of dude  and you guys know how I feel the about the punt certain stuff kind of guys  I try to avoid them at the front end of drafts it's it it  kind of pigeon holes you it's you get stuck in a tunnel  where as soon as you do one you kind of have to do the others  and then you get locked into this build that maybe you didn't even really want to begin with  it's why I didn't draft Kate Cunningham it's not because I didn't think these guys were gonna have like okay Seasons it's because  if you're only argument for drafting a guy is that he can get to his ADP if you're punting X  that puts him in a very tight spot  and I just tend to avoid it now some of the time the guys get there  okay this isn't like a foolproof plan it's just that if I need this certain thing to happen for my team build or whatever to get to a spot I'm probably not going to do it and how some of you probably look at that and they say well what about a guy like Freddie Van Fleet Dan you ended up with a lot of Freddie Van Vliet even though you said you're not gonna take a punt field goal guy ah I said I'm not gonna take a guy who needs to be a punt whatever to get to their ADP  Freddie Van Vleet  is gonna get to his ADP I still pretty firmly believe this  regardless of his punt field goal status  if you're punting fuel goal with Freddie Van Fleet he jumps well above his 80P  where is he now if you're punting field goals number 29 if you're hunting field goal which is in front of where he was drafted  that's the difference between a guy like van Fleet and a guy like say Jordan Poole where when we looked at him it was like okay if you're punting field goal  could he beat this 80P yeah maybe or Cade could he beat this 80P yeah maybe but if you're not those guys are gonna have a really really hard time getting there  and I get it a lot of you guys play head to head and our punting field goal  or turnovers or both  that's fine I don't have a problem with that  I just think you sort of bake yourself into a corner paint yourself into a corner trap yourself into a corner I don't know Daniel's got to work on his  idioms  they know the idiot  and you get stuck  so that to me is sort of the lesson learned there and look I'm gonna get a lot of things wrong I have a lot of things wrong right now a ton of them  but in terms of how I ended up not being on a particular guy if you look back and say okay well that I understand that that makes sense to me maybe that's a strategy you guys like to lose in the future I don't know you don't have to I'm just gonna yell things at you and you take what you take  anyway as far as the rest of the Wizards go Daniel Gafford continues to perform admirably even though he's not getting 30 minutes a game he's actually number 55 and nine categories and only 25 minutes a game  heaven forbid he actually plays 28 or 29 he just dunks his way through the league at that point but so he's fine he's actually ranked ahead of kuzma and nine can't believe it or not that's the magic of being a big time field goal percent and blocks helper uh and then tyus Jones who had actually got himself inside the top 100 after a couple of games where he played full starters minutes now he's had two games where he didn't and he's fallen just outside the top 100 again he's a much easier hold because he's been there he's been a top 100 guy for you know half a week so far this year I mean overall not I mean those those two or three games in a row he was much better than that but again all it takes is a couple of games with the Wizards are not in a blowout and he gets back in there Jordan Poole I admit as farther he is much farther away but you can't drop him  because at some point you still got to believe that he's gonna go full screw it mode or  the Wizards something gets shaken up maybe he gets fully benched just to teach him a lesson I don't know something's gonna have to wake his blood up and he's just not a guy you can put on the waiver wire  and then it was a good to see any of the kind of bounced back a little bit he does belong on rosters even though he had also like ties Jones Fallen just outside the top 100 I think those both those guys can end up inside it  there's at least a decent probability of that if  well we'll see  funny thing is that was the report on the winning side of this ball game because the Pistons have now lost a franchise record ah Deep Side Detroit fans 14 games in a row you guys might not remember this but the Pistons actually won two of their first three games to start the year  they beat the Hornets and the hapless Bulls  and they haven't won since  they lost to the Thunder to finish the month of October  they have not won a game in the month of November  yucky  they have two more chances  and they're not easy ones but you can bet they're gonna play like you know an animal being now hey I can get this metaphor right being backed into a corner they've got the Lakers tomorrow who are going to be pissed after getting completely warmed by the Sixers and then they got the Nicks on Thursday who I mean that team very rarely lets their guard down  the Pistons have a real shot  to go winless  for an actual calendar month  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game its neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends

that's dri z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations how she  in the good news Department Jalen Duren back in the starting lineup and despite the six turnovers and the two for five free throw shooting get up having a very nice ball game with a double and six defensive stats we'll take it us our Thompson had three defensive stats his percentages were a little bit better in this ballgame I do think that we've seen him level off a little bit he's number 76 and 9 cat right now  I'm a little bit worried that he's gonna continue to Trend down because it always kind of felt like the rebound number wasn't can be able to hold and then we knew the defensive stats were going to be able to stay as high as they were he's a fun guy to roster and fantasy but I think if you can get a 75 65 to 75 type guy back you might want to do it before the Dog Days take a bite out of a rookie  and then he'll probably come roaring out of it and like after the All-Star break but you guys know how that that rookie Hill goals guys tend to come out of his shoot with adrenaline and then it's like oh my Lord we play three four times a week not twice  rigors of an NBA season they tend to catch up with these young dudes  Jaden Ivy is  probably the most interesting story on the Pistons right now he once again made half of his shots from the field I don't know that we can confidently say he's a Fantasy asset he's been very good the last week sitting right around the edge of the top 100 despite a very bad free-throw output during that stretch but you know shooting 54% from the field the last week he's averaging like 20 points a ballgame Detroit's had a pretty light schedule over that span as well and overall he's looked I think better than any of us expected but this does all so kind of feel a little bit like one of those moments where you're like um  dude running hot I can't buy too much into this because  you know over his last five ball games he's shot better than 50 or 50% or better I guess I should say in four of them  and  this is a guy who shot 41 and a half percent last year  is there a chance to point percent took a flying Leap Forward  there's always a chance  is it likely  no  he profiles probably as a guy that you're holding on to and points to see how this goes in nine cat you probably ride the heater but just be aware that if and when most likely the bottom falls out it could get ugly quick because he's way over his head and feel goal percent and that's the number that's probably gonna have to level off the other note I guess on Detroit and I'm spending a lot of time on this ballgame so I think it's arguably the most interesting game fantasy Wise from yesterday  yes I know Reggie Jackson and DeAndre Jordan went crazy but I mean that that whole team was basically out for the ballgame  is boy on bogdanovich is the other note on this team there are some leaks where he's not being stashed right now we don't have a great idea of his return this is around when he was supposed to make his season debut  they got ruled out a day in advance or they who's they boy on got ruled out a day in advance still of this game against Washington so presumably he's still you know at least a week or two away but also  I was one of the folks who thought he would have a smaller role this coming season just because it's seems like Detroit had more pieces they wanted to work into things  more than we watched this piston steam the more you can point and say I mean like he's gonna have to play  and boy is not a well-rounded fantasy player but he very well could just step in and Scott start scoring 17 to 21 points of ball game for this team with you know three and a half four rebounds and a couple two two and a half assists he's not gonna get you any defensive stats so you're gonna need to rely and this other stuff but you know last year you sat near the edge of the top 100 and that was playable in all formats better and had to head because again he's a guy that's very good in a few things and very bad in others  I think he deserves to be stash at this point if we think he's within two weeks of coming back because  I don't see how the Pistons keep doing what they're doing right now they're gonna have to give him a try well aren't they like they're the worst team in the NBA right now  well you might disagree with that if you watched the way the Lakers played against the Sixers yesterday and the funny thing is that the Lakers offensively we're actually not that bad for the first three quarters and then they went to the you know the all reserves line up in the fourth and things turned sour Lakers were actually out shooting Philly for a while in this game and trailing by 18 points  and a lot of that because number one Lakers got obliterated at the free throw line and Joel embed and Tyrese Maxey again they get a lot of free throws some goofiness in this one  and admittedly I don't watch UMBC every single ball game but there was a play where he like literally just dove into Anthony Davis and bear hugged him and got the foul call so I can understand why some folks maybe are not super thrilled to watch him go on a day-to-day basis but these guys just ate the Lakers alive and kind of felt like the Lakers were feeling good about getting that win in Cleveland and then they sort of  must a half-assed this one but  it was kind of like they came into this game without all of their rotation defensive minded players and we're just like we're gonna have to get real lucky and as soon as the Sixers started burying every 3 pointer they took the Lakers just like all right whatever in any event I thought Taurean Prince would be a possible stream in this ball game because Gabe Vincent and Jerry Vanderbilt and really hot tomorrow and cam reddish all out for the Lakers and he was okay I mean he did all of his damage in the third quarter or so it could have been a whole hell of a lot worse but the ball game ended early and so that kind of put a damper on anything you might have done in the lake or side luckily for the Sixers they did plenty of damage in three quarters Tyrese Maxey ended up playing more I don't entirely know why because the game was out of hand early but I'm not gonna argue with it because you know Nick nurse is gonna give his guys minutes when he can you know worried about to buy his Harris he just had an off night  that's it and I think I said on yesterday's pod that this felt like a game where Nick Batum was gonna have a better one because the Lakers working to be able to rotate to him he was going to be able to do his sort of typical but tomb stuff and sure enough he did have a well-rounded contest Kelly oubre Jr is closed I don't know that you have to go down the bottom Runway here I guess if we look to see who are the Sixers playing over the next  I don't know two to three ball games they've got the  pellets  the Celtics the Wizards I mean the Wizards game is one where you might be able to throw a tomb in there that's on Monday  it kind of feels like you're reaching a little bit  anyway  nothing really nothing really on the Sixers side Portland beat Indiana this is a equal parts a good win for the Blazers and a bad loss for the Pacers who follow the nine and seven in a game where they probably figured they're gonna be able to waltz into a victory Blazers now a robust  five and 12 there obviously a lot better with Malcolm Brogden in there he played 36 minutes 24 and 7 he's on all systems go guy DeAndre ayton is sort of settling into more what we expected which was high percentage guy not that many defensive stats from the center spot but good rebounds and then Jeremy Grant remember when he was like number 150 and everybody was freaking out well  he's number 10 over the last week and thanks to that very large performance he's now number 75 overall on the year so he's worked himself back basically where we thought he would be with a little bit of upside beyond that this kind of feels like a reasonable spot for him so he'll level off the thing with with Jeremy Grant right now is like some guys are in that 75 range and they just give you 75 level production every day like a DeAngelo Russell he's basically just been in 75 range guy every single ball game click a Pella  they don't have those highs and lows Jeremy Grant has been very low and then very high but at the end of it all these averaged out to this spot that's what you need to try to keep in your head try to forget how we got there and just understand this is kind of a reasonable ending point  there's no nothing to do with this Blazers team right now I'm not gonna repeat my scooters and stuff every single day but if you haven't heard it before  he's a luxury stash until February basically  Jalen Smith had to get carried off the court for the Pacers and then they came out and they were like oh it's a heel contusion I don't know if I believe that initial report but we'll go with it for now  otherwise nothing but he healed was slower in this ball game and you know with Rick Carlisle the guys not playing quite as well they're gonna go to different faces and different places and  whatever he's a hold but he'll start starter iteration is very much a hold and there's sort of nothing else to worry about Bruce Brown is still just dangling right on the very edge of being a drop guy he's right at the edge of the top 100 in fantasy but that's good enough and then  Myles Turner has had his minutes kind of held in check so far he's only playing 26 and a half minutes of ball game but he's still number 35 despite that  which means perhaps there's a little bit of room for growth or maybe they're just trying to keep him healthy longer longer this year  either way it hasn't exactly opened the door for anyone else and so it's the same crap with this team where we're just waiting for somebody to grab some extra minutes and I guess the fact that buddy hield seems like he probably is in general  is about as good a news as we're going to get from the Rick Carlo rotation carousel  Pelicans lost it Utah again  unacceptable for a team that's trying to make the playoffs  Pelicans followed a 99 Break Even 500 after a couple losses to the Jazz who improved a six and 11 I guess maybe it's just a bad matchup or something  Dyson Daniels was very bad he only played 24 minutes in this game and CJ McCollum is trying to come back this week so we can go ahead and just move on from any of that stuff  I'm getting questions about whether or not to drop herb Jones I know he has slowed but we always knew this was going to happen  if you really want  you can bench him while he's in a little bit of a lull because these guys that focus on defensive stats they go through lulls and they're not gonna score all that much so in the points go away everything else like it kind of feels like it dries up with it  you're not dropping herb he's been he's inside the top 35 this year and even over the last week where he slowed down a little bit he's still number one 26 so if that's the bad and then the good is what we saw the first month it'll level off somewhere it'll be fine  he's not a guy you can sell I don't think because no one is going to pay up for him but you definitely don't want to drop him because he still getting big minutes  we'll reassess this when Trey Murphy comes back he does seem like a guy that could maybe challenge her for some of those minutes if there are days where the pals want to go a little more often so over defense  but for now  relax  Naji Marshall played 28 minutes all so he's been like schedules stream level over the last week or so it's not something that I'm likely to buy into long term but it's something that you could drop in if they have a run into a positive schedule scheduling spot should that occur I don't have that in front of me right now and I'm not gonna look it up because that's not what we're talking about and then Jordan Hawkins is a guy that I've been fading pretty much he had a couple of good ball games mixed in but overall he's been outside the nine categories Zone also more of a schedule level play and that's your Pelicans report Utah is kind of fun right now because Walker Kessler's back and finally we can all take a big deep breath I'm not sure I will because I might start coughing on the podcast but you go ahead and do it  coming off the bench still behind Omer yurtz event  for the second game in a row is not something to be worried about he got more minutes than Omar did in this ball game he has well he didn't double double here but he did in the previous one he got two more blocks he shot seven out of nine  he certainly looks healthier than when he went on the  men injured list or whatever you want to call it  so fire it up man Walker Kessler's ready to roll  kante Georgia had a pretty nice ball game this is some free throws and his field goal percent was kind of math but overall a lot to like their 14 shotts 19 points five boards three assists a couple of steals Jordan Clarkson actually ended up doing more of the point guard work in this ball game  Dan throws his hands in the air and confusion Clarkson is a sell High anytime he has a good fantasy line kante George is more of sort of the Long play here I still don't have the stones to start him in Roto formats I'm still mostly kind of squatting on him in those leagues had to head you're playing George you get what you get and you don't get upset as they say to the children around these parts and then Simone fontecchio he started these last couple of ball games with no Lowery marking and he's in there mostly for his toughness and does some ball distribution  but  I mean that's a play Only In a scheduling spot and then even then you gotta be a little bit careful because what if marketing and Pops back up and kind of screws it up  so I'm likely to die in that department and then John Collins just had a quieter ball game but you're not worried too much about that he's had a quieter week which should by the way surprise no one because we knew when the Jazz got their centers back he was gonna slide back more towards what he was the beginning of the year which was you know top 100 kind of Zone as a post to more like top 60 when he was soaking up Center minutes  say it a thousand times will say to 10001 I love when guys get minutes at the five that is the best you want to talk about bad losses yesterday forget the Pelicans at least they lost to a mildly competent Jazz team the Clippers lost to the Nuggets without Nikola jokic without Jamal Murray and without Aaron Gordon leaving the only two starters as kcp and Michael Porter Jr and they weren't even good  the Clippers got decimated By Reggie Jackson and DeAndre Jordan  now I don't take anything away from Reggie Jackson when he gets hot you can get real hot but this is the first time he scored this many points I believe I saw in seven seasons  I mean if you're the Clippers you just can't let that happen you got to be better than that  this is a this is a nasty nasty laws Clippers able to get a couple of wins against all right a tanking Spurs team say what you will that team is tanking and we know it because they've been playing Jeremy so on at the point All Season even though every metric says it's a terrible idea  so you know Clippers are starting to feel a little bit sassy they were up to seven and eight getting a little fat on a couple of wins and then they played a team that they should have been able to get fought against and they didn't regardless I would expect Denver to have their guys back for the next ball game and when I say their guys I mean yokich and I don't know about Gordon Jamal Murray does sound like he's close  and I'll remind you all that prior to this ball game Reggie Jackson was exclusively a points assists stream not a nine cat guy not a rotop play but if the whole team is out then yeah obviously you play the dude I mean you would have thought that kcp and and Michael Porter Jr would have big ballgames also but mpj had some foul issues he couldn't throw Stone in the ocean so you know whatever  even Justin holiday had an okay ball game filling in for Aaron Gordon don't read too much into this even if just joking comes back it completely flips the offense on its head  and then once Jamal Murray's back then  actually that that typically good for kcp because he does better when he's just getting wide open shots but yeah Reggie Jackson completely vanishes at that point and then DeAndre Jordan this is probably like the one bullet he had in the tank for I don't know a year  Clippers got a good game out of Kawhi Leonard and a good game out of Evita said everybody else was well I guess Russ was okay but mostly dog new Paul George was terrible James Harden was pretty darn bad Clippers shot the ball awfully they just had no offense I don't know what happened to the pick-and-roll they were trying to run but it certainly didn't happen in this one Hardin Falls outside the top 50 and I do think that we have opportunities for buys on some of these guys there's a fear that that's just where he's gonna be all season and I don't think that's the case  same story for Kawhi Leonard  who by the way is playing in back-to-back so far this year  kauai's percentages are going to tick up you might see free throws tick up all so  there's a lot to like their hardened you just hasn't even really gotten his job he scoring 14 points a game for the Clippers that's not gonna hold  6.2 assists I got to think that probably goes up to  there's just almost nowhere to go but up for a lot of these guys I don't Paul George is cool off after a very hot start to the unit the field goal percent wasn't going to stay at 50 he is now at number 14  I don't think you can quite buy low enough on Paul George yet maybe you can in a couple more ball games the other thing I was watching this game was Norman Powell and I wanted to see basically on a minute see God it was just 20 one and unfortunately in my eyes that's probably not enough I picked him up as a speculative and a couple of teams I'm now gonna move on from him in those same spots it's just the mission the minutes are not high enough nor are they consistent enough and so we'll go spend our roster slot on someone else folks before we get to the Tuesday lookahead want to remind everybody again to please do take a second to click that subscribe button if you guys have been enjoying these shows sometimes twice daily episodes here on fantasy NBA today however you take the Pod please hit the Subscribe button and do find me over on social at Dan best price d a n b e s b r i s we will see you over on social and for now let's go to  who's day in season cup night everybody  and I don't know like Brooklyn has something on the line and the Knicks have something on the line and the  Bucks have someone on the line the heat up something on the line and they Rockets and the Kings and the Warriors and will see if it matters to any of them that's what I want to find out more than anything but as far as like what we're actually looking for on the fantasy side of things  we're at us we're at the stage now and some of you guys have called it the great leveling after what I said I think last year the year before on the pot that's a fair way to assess it you're really we're just like in the season now we're in the season  uh we're you know 20% of the way in basically  which means things have settled and there aren't like five things to watch for on every basketball team anymore  and that's okay  that's okay we can laser focus on a few things which is good for us we can really focus on watching a particular game seeing how a player looks how does he fit these things that you can't get just from box score analysis now we can really do that because of the beginning of the year like  28 out of the 32 teams had stuff we wanted to pay attention to but just couldn't so you had to pick like our top four five teams to really focus on and then everything else you're looking back at video later you're watching bot you're checking boxes you're watching you're trying to check boxes every four or five minutes to see how numbers are progressing so it's kind of like watching the game but you can't really watch it to see all the other doing  why did I point this way to those that are watching that's where my television is it's that direction but you guys didn't know that so anyway now we get into this and it's like okay well Toronto  they really isn't anything  we've seen Dennis Schroder kind of taper off we've seen Scotty Barnes taper off a little bit we've seen the leveling take a place we've seen Yakima portal come back up where we thought he might be all these little things that are happening but it's not stuff that we need to pay hyper close attention to anymore  so we'll zip through that  Brooklyn uh this will come down I think to Nick claxton's status oh you just got ruled in hey right in the middle of the show Nick klaxon is in tonight so Dorian finney-smith and Royce O'Neill are back off the table as safe plays they are you know they're streamable and certain head-to-head format so I'm not gonna take that off the board but like when I say someone that is not a guy I'm not playing I'm mostly referring to what I use a game's cap on him and the answer is no with those dudes cam Thomas is still out cam Johnson is back in most likely he's he was President shoot around after having some cramps a couple days ago so I'm gonna assume he's playing but I guess we don't know for sure just yet  so if I fire up all of those guys and then Spencer Dinwiddie who won't have quite as much to do as their last ball game does seem to be a pretty safe at the very least points threes and assists guy he's been very hot the last week he's getting a whole lot of usage and he's kind of their orchestrator so fire that up while he's hot while he's shooting you know 95% of the free throw line and averaging 21 and 10 yeah you play it but just know that long term his Fantasy game doesn't usually translate to all nine categories and if kamit Thomas ever shows up or Ben Simmons ever shows up we'll reassess these types of things got it  good lamelo ball just got ruled out so Charlotte's going to be without their leader for at least one ball game I think it's gonna be longer than that  which means more Terry Rozier more Gordon Hayward more miles Bridges probably some more Brandon Miller  the list goes on and on with this Hornets team who would I start in Roto  obviously you start Rozier you start Mark Williams you start miles Bridges if you're of the teams that are rostering him again remember I just I just think I can win without him this year so I think that way I don't have to root for him and then I'm probably gonna start going to Hayward it almost feels like he has to be good enough with no ball like they're just gonna need somebody to do more of the simple offense running things  and Hayward is basically best suited for that because Terry was here we saw last year was not a very good point guard for that team so I'll probably fire up Gordon Hayward as well I have mixed feelings on brain and Miller he's been very hot lately which makes it seem like maybe you could fire him up in the minutes will probably be there but you know he's hitting all of his shots last three or four ball games and that's not a guaranteed to happen going forward so just be ready because when the shots stop falling you don't have a whole lot of other fantasy things he's doing yet Steals and blocks have been kind of low threes outside of the last week have been pretty low rodo side is a coin flip head-to-head that's fine you can start my head-to-head you know just get the game played out of it but  yeah I don't I don't think I'm going that far on the Roto side  the next I think we have a pretty good idea at this point Josh Hart not getting the full 30 minutes we wanted so he's out and then everybody else is normal Hawks Jalen Johnson out for a while I think you can probably start to Decay I know he didn't have a great first ball game without Jalen Johnson but  I feel pretty confident that he'll settle in and do enough in full starter's minutes to be top one ten or better and that should be good enough  Cleveland as far as we know their mostly healthy right now and lately that's meant that Charis Levert has actually fallen into head-to-head onlys territory and then everybody else has been as per usual  Chicago every day and new opportunity to blow it up Bulls stashing Kobe white play in The Other Guys Alex Caruso was we got an update on him he was present at shoot around I don't know if that means he's gonna play or not but it's certainly a good sign so hopefully we get him back in the mix and if we do you can go ahead and start him Boston know poor Singas so you know screw it I'm starting out Horford baby cheers to that this is just water don't worry  the Bucks  is Malik Beasley gonna have a good ball game  nobody knows  nobody knows he's been good the last couple of weeks but it could evaporate his Steels have been unsustainably high he's shooting threes at an unsustainably high rate this year  you guys know what that means eventually  row  I believe we heard that the heat are going to have most of their guys back for this ball game I'll triple check before I put out any you know streamer boards later today but if they do then you probably go bam Jimmy Duncan Robinson  if Robinson is out then you probably feel a little bit better about Kyle Lowry and I guess potentially you could start all of those guys even if they're all in  jacquez and Larry have been sort of right on the borderline when Robinson's been a healthy but  okay with it if you wanted to try  Thunder there's been no update on Josh giddey so you know same old same old  yeesh  timber wolves nobody's picking up any Jaden McDaniels fantasy value I know to kill Alexander Walker's playing in the minutes but he hasn't done anything with them so rumbling along Rockets basically nothing to watch fantasy wise there you know the bench players are not getting enough minutes starters have been doing it Dillon Brooks fell off the cliff as we knew he would just a matter of time there was no way he was going to keep doing what he was doing to start the year he's outside the top 135 now after a top 40 start to the year that's because he's been outside the top 200 the last week and a half and yeah I mean this is  probably not that far from where he ends up at the end of it all but then yeah you know we've talked about Freddie Van Fleet kind of slowly moving his way up the board I still believe that as we see the steals tick upwards he'll move up where he belongs which is probably another round above where he's at now but there's really just nothing to watch with the Rockets  Mavericks Derek Lively's health status is kind of the only thing to keep an eye on it sounds like he's getting closer if he plays in my opinion he's a goal you know he's top 100 so far this year and he's only getting better that's good and then the two superstars and that's as far as you go with Dallas  Warriors  Klay Thompson is getting feisty at press conferences which means he's pressing and Andrew Wiggins has been swallowed by a mysterious force that I can't explain  I feel extraordinarily fortunate that I have zero Andrew Wiggins on any of my nine fantasy teams I do have a Klay Thompson or two mixed in there  I've got to believe the field goal percent gets better I know he's not a big Steals and blocks guy but those should probably get a little bit better but more than anything like we just need him to get his confidence back and see the shot start to go and then you'll see more shots getting taken and it'll be this kind of positive feedback loop for him so I would say hang on to Clay if you're in Roto you can bench him if the field goal percent is is annihilating your team I'm okay with that but I do think he's someone that eventually gets a turned around I don't know that I feel that way about Wiggins  Chris Paul should probably take a little bit of a step down which is fine he's been running hot lately got himself up near inside the top 60 for a couple of ball games before it's got fostered him out of the last one or two games back whatever that was dream ones return is the reason I bring him up we knew we saw Paul do a little bit less when Dre was healthy but the good news is that I've said this before even as Chris Paul sees his assist ticked down you're gonna see the field goal percent take up he's not gonna shoot under 40% for the whole year I don't care how old he gets okay that's fine once he's like 52 he probably will but he'll he'll crack 40% at some point here and you're kind of see the two scales tip a little bit back and forth and that'll keep him from falling too far in my estimation and then what do we think we're gonna get out of Draymond well he was suspended so presumably he stayed in shape his numbers this year are weighed down by some injury and some suspension he's number one oh five but in only 22 minutes of ball game  you're not gonna be able to buy low because anybody that held him through the suspension is going to want to keep him there but just understand he's probably someone that's going to move up a little bit over the next couple of weeks not a ton because it's free throw percent is probably not gonna stick where it is but he'll move up a little bit at a time and you know obviously we've known this for a very long time dream on is one of those guys where you know the Vegas line doesn't move that much when he goes out but it should because the Warriors suck when he's not playing  they're still like they can win a game here and there because Steph is insane but everything they do is build around draymond's defense and his sort of short roll stuff on offense almost everything he's passing his screen setting and that is d  and when he's not there nobody knows what the hell to do  he's gonna make them very a lot better as a team in his return is what I'm saying and then the king's  Keegan Murray there's a key Murray was a weird thing because like he fully participated in practice yesterday and then we got a report later in the day that he was doubtful so I don't know if it may be locked up after practice but let's wait on later tonight he's someone that it feels like his dad could pop in either direction if he plays you play him if he doesn't  I mean we saw a little bit more for Harrison Barnes we saw a little bit more for Malik Monk  those guys are both kind of  kind of very dangerous Roto plays  and everybody keeps yelling at me about Malik monk but he's number one 55 in nine category leaks right now and I get it like if you want five assists all game and a positive for free throw impact guy okay fine but I can't do my analysis based on what your team build is  so far this year Malik Monk  through the ups and downs couple of good ball games couple of quiet ones has not been and every day nine cat player he just hasn't  the numbers say it  and it's not because like if you're punting turnovers that doesn't move him that much renting field goal it does move him a little bit okay fine but again I can't build my show around just assuming everybody's punting field goals and turnovers  that crap doesn't work especially because of all of you did it  then it be the same as none of you doing it  nonsense is what I say  I don't know how I turn this thing into a  44 Minute Podcast let's see what we got over on the question side not as many today because there wasn't a huge Monday to recap or anything I'm gonna try to find the questions that could apply to a number of you and that's kind of the way I want to do it going forward I don't want to answer every single question the chat room all though I do appreciate you guys coming out to hang out live oh this is fun I like this one a question on trade Theory okay Dylan day let's see what we got here  it's a points league but not all I'll talk about it in sort of the overall sense a trade has been proposed where I give Mark Williams and shaedon Sharpe and I get Brandon Ingram I have Simon's on my injured reserve I know Shades going to lose value slash be a drop soon and that Williams for Ingram would be a good one for one in favor for me am I thinking through this trade correctly also how to CJ's a turn return affect bright and Ingram what do you think all right so Theory wise you know I two for one is totally fine  if you can pull it off it's generally the best way to make a trade but they are harder and harder to do these days  in nine cat I honestly don't know that I would do this trade now that's because I don't value the categories that Brandon Ingram is strong at which is points  and sort of assists and kind of feel goal percent but mostly just points and I do value some of the categories that Mark Williams is good at which again so far this year he's been expecting very good excellent in rebounds field goal percent those have been his sort of two big big ones and then defensive stats having two ball game is not bad either because he's actually just sort of in good in both steals and blocks Mark Williams has been much better than Brandon Ingram in nine cats so far this season and the way that Brandon moves past him is if you are hard attacking points and you know maybe punting defensive stats so perhaps that's a thing now points League Brandon Ingram obviously gets a big bump because scoring rebounds assists those things are very repeatable  and you don't get those the big fluctuations now I don't Williams beating him and rebound brain and is sort of out there and he's getting usage and so that's an easier thing to do now as far as Theory goes I like this trade uh for your points League because Brandon Ingram is presumably better than Williams in your points format and again you get to bring a guy out of your ill slot in a couple of weeks that fills that other pocket now again nine cat I don't think I would do it because I'm not a big brand in Ingram guy but yes if you can pull off two for ones this is a great way to think it through  would you rather have Jaden Ivy Kobe white or a manual quickly  I'm gonna go Kobe White and the reason is because I don't think Jayden ivy can hold on to what he's doing right now so I can sort of Slough him off to the side real quick Emmanuel quickly is the other option because he's been kind of borderline fantasy place so far this year and if anything at all happens to a usage guy on the Knicks quickly gets a huge bump and becomes an easy play and that's kind of the same story as Kobe white because right now he's not a fantasy play every day but when he usage guy goes down he tends to move into that department and we know that that could happen for the season in Chicago at some point meaning someone gets traded and that's how Kobe white ends up with a bunch of value and it becomes a rest of season thing where with quickly it does still feel like maybe shorter term so I probably go Kobe white over quickly over Ivy and this particular sense just as I think through sort of the balance of short and long term it's safe to drop tius Jones for a forward this week I have Jalen Johnson out and I need to replace his production um I would try to hold on Ty's Jones I mean again every time the Wizards play two or three competitive games in a row ties Jones jumps inside the top 100 it's just that they just they aren't right now now I get it if your team is is is is just fallen off a cliff and you you can't take zeros  well then Tyas wasn't getting you a 0 anyway that's kind of the hard decision I I don't think that I can condone a tie his Jones drop unless you're in really Dire Straits and it's like that's the case you drop the guy getting you zeroes and not the guy who's getting you like top one 20  it's not that big of a jump to drop a top one 20 guy for a waiver dude big jump to drop a guy getting zeros  Let's see we talked about Andrew Wiggins there's a question about him but we talked about it already I'm not gonna do these three for three trades on here what to do  keonte for John oh this is actually a trade question but I guess we'll interpret it as a different one Kathy George or John Collins so I prefer John Collins here I just you know we saw keonte with a nice ball game yesterday I think we are as much as I like yachty George I do I think he's he has a nice and interesting profile here kind of going forward the one thing we need to remember is that he still has these big rookie issues he's dealing with  so even while he's playing 29 minutes a game lately last two weeks he's outside the top one 70 because his field goal percent is terrible as turnovers are high and the other stuff hasn't been good enough to outweigh that  the way they can't a George gets inside the top 100 there's a couple of them his shooting comes around the turnovers come down or he just gets a huge you should Spike which I don't think is about to happen anytime super soon so that's why I would prefer John Collins and that one of that that's why that I could continue to not start Georgian League's  okay he's the guy you seems like you kind of sit on their  and had you take what you take I guess and hope that it improves over the course the season but he is still a rookie ball handling guard and those that's problematic  hey Dan it's JJ a by low the answer is yes and I'm probably gonna have him on the Bilo show later today so sit tight we'll try to get you an answer on what to spend on JJ later on today you'll have to watch that other show it worth stashing Marcus Smart in a 14 team her  yes  someone dropped Jordan Poole in my nine cat Roto League how much Fab should I spend I only have 52 out of 100 left  honestly you might have to let somebody else do this one I'd say Throw 25 at it so that you have something left to work with the rest of the year but if you don't get him it's not the end of the world because things have been somewhat  gross  name five players that I can trade Lowry Mark into who could you turn Lowry marketing into basically anybody inside the top 25 no I shouldn't say anybody inside the top 25 I should say anybody between about pick 18 and about pick 30 you should be able to get so look at the board see if anybody jumps out at you'd see if you can go get him the answer is like 50/50  another question about buying low on JJ I see your question dude but again I'm gonna talk to JJ on the show later today so we'll get into the JJ valuation on our Bilo show up and as I take a sip of water I bid you all I do start for me to go do some other stuff today and then I'll come back around I'll see you guys in the afternoon Buy Low show coming up probably around 2 2:30 today a lot of stuff to do though this really really busy day for me I hope you guys saw
