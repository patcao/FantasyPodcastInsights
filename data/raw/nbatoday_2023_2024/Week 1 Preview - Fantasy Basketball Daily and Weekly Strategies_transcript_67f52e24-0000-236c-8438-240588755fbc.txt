welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast at some point I will shave my face  and go back to being like a like a smooth four and a half here on YouTube but for now I remain  poor of a hygiene such as this signs of the end of the NBA Fantasy Draft ramp up season  you know I might actually shave the second I get off air with this delightful razor from manscape but we'll save that promo for a little later in the show Welcome to the first edition of the weekly lineup show also known as the week ahead also known as a fantasy weekly preview whatever you want to call it we got the first slate of games it's six days of games this week Tuesday through Sunday I am Dan best purse this of course is a sports ethos presentation and I guess this is technically also still fantasy NBA today and I'm joined by the master of the week ahead who writes the incredible fantasy pass piece at sports ethos breaking down every aspect of the upcoming week that is Derek ball at d-ball b-ball what a lovely I mean kudos to your parents for giving you the opportunity to go with d-ball b-ball as a Twitter handle I mean I I gotta say dude I am insanely jealous because D beds basket best is does not roll off the tongue how you been man what's going on  good you are you're too kind you know what my parents they're just masters of branding they knew what they were doing right after that and you know I it was it was meant to be yeah no my parents really happened to be here my parents stunk at branding Never Gonna never gonna forgive them for this my middle name is Walter I don't know if that would go any better in any of this stuff probably not but I want to Dive Right In because first of all your your thread on Twitter excellent I hope everybody gives you a follow so that they can get this type of stuff it's out there right now it's like actually very useful if anybody wants to have kind of a short burst iteration of some of the stuff we're going to be talking about on this show again he is at d-ball b-ball on social but also the week ahead piece over on Sports ethos that has a whole lot of extra detail and all so some fun you know intro paragraphs I think everybody will get a nice little kick out of but I want to talk about a few things here because week one this will be a little bit of a different conversation between the two of us then week two three four and really when you kind of settle into things  streaming is different  this is not all about streaming we're making decisions in week one that could impact your team for an entire season so I know I'm monologuing here a little bit but then I'm going to be hitting you with questions rapid fire the point I want to make for the viewers and listeners is week one weekly preview  is  less about trying to wedge in every single game you can and more about this sort of broad picture stuff so Derek how do you approach week one from a week ahead standpoint because to even call it just like a week ahead kind of show Almost Doesn't do a service to what you're actually trying to do with the next six days  yeah absolutely I mean you hit it right on the head right at the beginning we're pretty much on an even playing field with every other team and our league and so what we're trying to do is we're trying to make quality moves and set of quantity moves as the season progresses and you're just trying to get raw numbers on the board yeah you know what you're gonna you're gonna start to shift your strategy you're going to look for more of a short-term game but right off the bat you know what there's every season there's breakout players there's always that player that slides in the draft that you know doesn't end up roster and some some opportunistic managers going to be the one to pick them up and we're just trying to be that opportunistic manager by you know by getting ahead of the trend this year  so how do you approach say  today tomorrow so I feel like Tuesday Wednesday is its own Universe compared to every other day of the entire NBA season because this is everybody's first game this is the moment we try to figure out was there anything we just totally didn't see coming going into your fantasy drafts well I mean first off you kind of have to trust yourself and the first couple of days not only because there's not a lot of opportunity opportunities to stream but you know what you drafted those players for a reason you kind of want to see what they look like in their first game before you start making major decisions now there's going to be some people like we were talking about off-air that you know maybe you've got someone with the store toe who's not going to be ready to start the you know the first game of the season you might be looking to the wire to make some you know some short-term moves but you know most things being equal you're probably not going to be looking to do very much on the first couple of days except see how you're drafting  and then as you start to get the results coming in you're going to react to it and then that's going to give you a lot more perspective on how you're going to build for the rest of the week and what your team's gonna look like moving forward I guarantee that there's a single one of us out there you know we all have 13 13 player rosters I'm sure we all didn't pick 13 players are going to finish on our roster so we're just starting the process of figuring out who's gonna be offered  I did manage to figure out a way to get your your your your Tweet thread on the screen here I'll try to make it bigger so people can see on YouTube some of the text on that  so let's say then okay well let's move apart past that very first element we're talking about which is okay how did we do research wise going to draft was there any massive surprise I'll be honest I can't think of like a massive massive surprise on opening weeks since Devonte Graham on the Hornets like half a decade ago that's like the last one that's in my head of oh nobody drafted that guy he wasn't on anybody's list and he came roaring out of nowhere to have like a top 70 60 fantasy season mostly the guys that are like even now the ones are like oh yeah he didn't get drafted those are guys that are generally drafted in intermediate and expert leaks maybe not novice ones so moving past that part of it which is basically is there anybody on these first two days that's just this Whopper of a surprise is there someone on your own teams that you're just like oh dude played four minutes maybe this isn't something I need to see through all that much I threw this tweet thread on the screen because you immediately get into  well what if I have a roster slot that turns into something that's kind of junk what do you do with it then well I mean if we're talking about right off the bat if we're looking at a Tuesday or Thursday which are both two-game days you really might not have that many options to go with because we're not just making moves for the sake of making moves like you said right off the bat there are going to be some names out there like you can see a Christian Wood on screen where you know what there is some upside and if you are in one of those leads where he wasn't roster you are gonna go for it but but ultimately like you're really trying to find a players that are going to get the minutes right off the bat so if you're picking a player and they're looking at having four or five six minutes and their first game that's not going to set the good tone for for the rest of the seasoning  and then you you know you talk about moving into a day like a Wednesday where you know 12 games are happening that's 2414 that are active you're going to be really lucky if you're going to be adding anyone off the waiver wire and they can actually fit into your starting lineup so again there's really not a lot to be doing in the first couple of days other than reflecting on you know how values are shaking out and maybe trying to be lucky and catch that Devonte Grant when they break out who are the teams with two games this week because that brings that it's gonna take me to my next question yeah exactly so we're you know if you if you're looking at the screen right now you're gonna see that LA and Phoenix are both active on both of those days being that they're the you know star-studded teams that the league wants to promote of course they're going to get all of the you know all the juiciest days and the first week of the schedule and then surprise surprise we're looking at Denver in Milwaukee for the other two so you know really we're talking about Championship contenders with really firmly established rotations really firmly established packing orders and you know frankly I think everyone knows by now that if you're playing on team with LeBron James a youngest antetokounmpo a Damian Lillard you know name a star Nicole yokich you're probably not gonna have a lot of bench players that are able to you know collect a lot of stats they've got to be the starters everyone knows about the starters and frankly they're all on rosters all ready what about going back to sort of the league as a whole what do you do so I'm gonna give away one little chunk because I mean this is the thing people could figure out if they really wanted to one of the things you break down in your week ahead piece is what teams actually have two three four and five games in a given week this this week everybody has either two or three right yeah so we're getting the Monday start so you know what that's probably where that poor game what if they didn't for a lot of teams but there are still you know even though everyone's mostly playing a three game schedule there are some that are better than others and you know if you're reading the article you're gonna find out or the thread you're going to find out a lot about why that is because not all game days are made equal you know what I was saying before there was 12 game day there's two game day if I'm the streamer I'm definitely looking at the game's with you know single digit totals because there's just more to be gained from a competitive advantage on those on those days to give you an example we're talking about you know my team of the week this you know this week is going to be the Philadelphia  76ers now anyone looking at the schedule is going to say oh well they don't start until Thursday but then if you look at the games they're playing on Thursday onwards you're talking about let me see here we've got Philadelphia playing on a two-game day and then they play on a seven game day and a six game day um you know among a lot of the other competitors at the three game at the three game Mark there's there's just not that kind of opportunity most of these other three game teams have a two-day rest period in between so it's special since we're talking from streaming perspective here or at least a short term ad there's not a lot to be gained  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't

differently if you have I am let me go back a tiny bit farther actually so yeah in my mind and you can tell me if you agree or disagree because you're the you're the stream Master here  in my mind there's like one scenario this opening week or I might stream a little harder and if I just happened to have sort of a heavy dose of the teams that only played twice which is a Celtic the Nets the Hornets the Mavs the Pacers the Bucks the Wolves the pells the magic and the Wizards if you're opponent this week  because I mean because there are a lot of three verses two situations you could end up with like a 7-8 game disadvantage it kind of feels like you need to make up for that because you don't want to just take like a 72 or 81 loss right out of the Chute then you're fighting to come back even if you like your team you're fighting to come back 100% you you're exactly right there and there are going to be some teams that find themselves in that situation and you know what I don't think it's the worst situation to find yourself in because you're filling up a roster on a day where most people aren't trying to fill up their roster which means that if you're looking at Short Term ads you're probably going to have your choice of the you know of the of what's available if you're looking at a 12-game day or you know 11 games being the two days that you were talking about there you're going to have that many more options to go for and everyone's got their favorite players that they like to add especially in the early schedule we're really just trying to pick out the guys that we think are going to have the best seasons and the guys that were most confident in are going to be the ones that we're naturally going to grab tape towards you're just going to have more options if you're in that scenario you know of course it's not ideal you don't want to be having your end of guys going against another team's you know proper starters but at the end of the day there are ways to navigate that and I touched on that in the article in the trades as well where you know what if I'm sitting from you know from behind the eight ball when we're talking about games played I'm probably not going to be making as much of an  effort to win counting sets I'm probably gonna be looking more towards high impact categories and efficiency which are things that I'll be able to address more easily from you know from the back of the Ross or we'll say I'm gonna pull the curtain back just a tiniest bit here for folks on YouTube this will be another reason for for folks to come over and watch this show instead of listening in the future this is actually a snippet of Derek's week ahead piece on Sports ethos this is technically behind the paywall so sorry that I gave a tiny bit away here but it's only a tiny bit this is just a small chunk of the overall page and here you've highlighted your favorite and worst schedule of the week already talked to our listeners and viewers about the Sixers being your favorite I see here worst schedule of the week is the Timberwolves can you talk us through that one  well you know what there's a lot of optimism around the world's right now so I think it's safe to say that most of their players are rostered but the one thing that really stands out to me as far as you know productivity is is who they're playing you know first off two game week we don't like that we never like a two-game week and any schedule even if the next step up is just or even if the you know the leading team only played three games you want to have more two is not a good number right but there's a lot of other teams that play on those same schedules the reason that I chose the Wolves is who they're playing other teams are playing some you know frankly they're not as strong defensive teams but if you saw that screenshot that you put up there are viewers saw that screenshot I should say you're going to know that we're playing the wolves are playing the Raptors and the Heat  now if I used to look at the list of some of the best defensive teams from last season the season before the season before you get my point  the wolves are starting their season against two of the hardest teams defensively to start again so you're talking about a team that's mostly expected to be an offense of jog or not become behind me Edwards and Karl Anthony towns they're going to have to work for their shots especially against you know those sort of targeted really efficient defense is that the Heat Raptors are known for putting out so I'm looking at the stars on that team struggling a little bit more I'm looking at them maybe having to take more shots or maybe just making less of their shots having to do more work for the free throw line and that sort of scenario creates a need for the ancillary players to step up the sort of players that really we Target in the week ahead you're talking about bench players you're talking about you know the sixth man you're maybe talking about the fifth starter who are you know going to be the ones that need to step up now in the article I kind of touch on this you're talking about guys like Rudy gobert Mike Conley Jaden McDaniels the other three starters who are all really more defense of players than offensive players and none of them are really going to go out and get their own you'd like to see it from some of them I'm sure there's a Jaden McDaniels fan out there I consider myself one we get to tell you that you can do that but you know what that's asking a lot for him you know if if he's going to go out and do that show that growth right away again two of the best defensive teams in the league and game one and two while he still shaking off the rust so you know what I'm not too optimistic about your options to add from from that starting lineup and then you can shift it towards the bench yes everyone loves Kyle Anderson everyone loves slow-mo you know we all know that Nas reads one of the best backup centers in the league but again you're kind of looking to be these people to give you an offensive boost in this scenario where where you're predicting that a defensive team is really going to kind of shut down your your potential to produce counting stats and I'm just not sure that those sort of players behind Anthony Edwards and Karl Anthony towns that can really go out and get their own if these guys struggle and so for me if I'm looking at adding a you know a player that could maybe give me plus value off the waiver wire I'm not looking at it guy who I think is in a scenario where he could struggle offensively  what are you looking for at this part of the year if you are looking for someone like you said that that can be a sort of a plus value add are you looking for someone that gets a lot of minutes is there a stat set thing what's the combination for you right now because again week one is a little different than every other week you know minutes is tricky because there are you know there are some players that are exceptions to the rules I mean everyone knows you should probably have a starter roster at the end of the day I mean if they play 30 minutes that's that many more chances for them to get stats but it's not about the minutes I've seen you tweet I've tweeted myself we've set it on are countless times about you know what there's a guy if you give him 20 minutes a game he's more than good enough we used to say that about you know Paul Reed who actually I think is probably gonna get a big minute boost this year yeah might actually finally get the 20 minutes finally get it exactly I mean there are tons of players more often Defenders than than anything else but there are players who even in small minutes can really be quite impactful even airline's Noel you know it's a bit of a throwback now but you know what you put him out there for 15 20 minutes game how many rebounds how many steals how many blocks that's a Difference Maker  if you're talking about offensive players yeah you want them to have 30 minutes I kind of talked about this in the article there's players like RJ Barrett who you know you need to put him out there for 30 minutes for them to give you some sort of account some sort of value because of the impact the efficiency that they represent and they kind of lack of around deadline that they give you really need to see scores out there for for high playing time and when you're talking labor wire players it's usually harder to rely on that sort of player  so I tend to Target when I'm going out to the wire I tend to Target things like three pointers steals blocks because I know that even the worst player on my team in terms of a scale evaluation if they're giving me a three a steal a block I know that that's actually going to be way more impactful on my my head to head at the end of the week then maybe 10 15 Point per game scorer about how many games or weeks into the season before you do pivot harder into the Strategic stream mode which again and before I before you answer the question I am once again kind of giving away a little bit of something for free here I hope folks will consider a fantasy passes they see the level of effort that goes into all the stuff in there this is just one piece out of many there's all these tools that are going on Andre as given me a sneak preview of the five in season tools that are you know through basically a one drive online kind of Microsoft excellus but not quite  these things are going to be amazing but back to the point at hand here  so there's all this stuff I'm going to take this down in a minute but folks can see on the screen right now that you've listed where the back-to-backs are where the positive schedule spots are you have all this work done for this week but it's seems like you're not actually using it that much for this week so when do you start to use this stuff more well I mean some people are going to be forced into it by injuries and whatever other things we can't predict now but if it's me once I start to get a feel for how the playoffs are going to shake out once you really do start to see kind of  let's we'll say a noteworthy Gap in the standings I can't really predict exactly what the gaps will be between first and eighth place and a lot of leagues but you know where you fall in those standings and the closer you get to the middle or the bottom the sooner you're going to need to start considering altering your strategy now if you're that team on top if you're that team that got Nicole kitchen with a couple of other you know early round players and you're probably just gonna cruise through the first couple of weeks because you won't need that extra boost from from behind but not every not every manager is going to have that advantage  and the ones that are going to need to take that risk it probably going to start looking at doing it let's say week three week four once you've seen a couple of matchups against a couple of different teams where they have different strengths represented and you really get a good idea of what your team is good at what your team is bad at and what could be fixed  my last question for you before I let you go is what if folks because I think sometimes and I'm extremely guilty of this I think that a lot of times I broadcast as though everybody listening is an intermediate or expert level player this is a really hard thing for us those of us that have been staring at this for decades to do but I'm gonna ask you to do it and apologies in advance if it kind of puts you on the hot seat a little what would you instruct someone who is more in kind of a learning mode on the fantasy side and and just getting into it how would you try to walk them through getting settled here on week one start all your guys just see what happens watch out for certain things follow certain people on so social like what's the path for you if you were going to try to almost Sherpas somebody part way up the mountain well sure I mean I was a law right over home plate for me who should they follow on social everyone with sports ethos in their tank  description  you see the new speed obviously yeah you know what you put that fantasy basketball hashtag into your Twitter or whatever search bar you're gonna see a lot of really you know really really good and sometimes mixed opinions out there find someone who you know who you think speaks to you know speaks the most reason I guess we'll say if you're someone new though and you're really trying to find out a way to make you know to really make a hot start for your league you're gonna want to consider screening you're going to want to learn about what it takes to stream you're going to want to learn about low value days and high value days and you know what that means you're going to want to talk about low value or low impact stats and high impact stats gotta touched on them a couple of times already you know what it's there's the analogy but too many fish in the sea or you know there's plenty of fish in the sea well there's more fish and some seas and others explain that sorry there's not a lot of players that can give you two blocks per game there's a lot of players that can give you 15 points per game there's not a lot of players that can if you two steals per game but there are that can give you five rebounds per game and that's the kind of thing that you need to be considering when you're going in there another thing you want to talk about too is you're not following the hype you know what there's tons of basketball coverage out there the guys on TNT the guy and guys on ESPN all these other content creators and every other aspect of basketball they do a great job of promoting the game they could do a great job of telling you about that guy that's on the hot streak they're doing a great job of promoting you know the guy that had to highlight dunk or whatever but we're not trying to get the guys to get the Highlights we're not trying to get the guys that have the flashiest at lines and the training stories we're trying to get ahead of the stories if you're hearing about someone it's probably going to be too late to make an impact by adding them in your league so what you're trying to do is you're trying to get ahead you're trying to anticipate who the next person is going to be and the best way you can do that is by looking at the schedule and seeing which teams play the most games which of those teams that played the most games played those games on the weakest days because that is where you're going to create a game played advantage over your opponent if everything is equal in both teams play the same amount of games and you're just waiting for the better players to win out and I can't guarantee that you're gonna have the better players that your opponent every week but what I can do is try to help you get more games played than your opponent and the more games you play the more stats you accumulate the same thing as we were saying about players with high minutes they just get more chances to do more things so you're looking at the most ways to have the most minutes the most games played and you're going to try to focus on impact categories by getting real  Specialists I guess we could say I mean you don't want to just get the guy who is getting good 20 minutes off the bench just because he's got a great reputation the PJ Tucker type for example I mean you know what you can really turn it up sometimes for the most part getting you know a handful of everything isn't going to do much for you you want  a bucket full of everything or one thing or two things I guess I should say everything's a little bit much yeah that's the world not everyone okay yeah go ahead I was just gonna say you know what it's all about just finding the guys who are going to win you a category two categories if you're lucky three but you know what you can't have the world you're gonna you're gonna step back in some areas whenever you add a player there there's no such thing as as progress It's just trade-offs so what's your trade-off and you're adding a player off the wire are you going to is it worth it for you to go up and blocks if you're going to go down in three pointers when you've got a team built around guards you have to know your team you have to understand your strengths and you got to understand the best ways that the players that are available in the wire can amplify those strings  hey I'm not a message your local Pros for advice for how to give it we love talking fantasy basketball man that was good my only regret on this whole segment is that I didn't ask you that question first damn it

the streaming side from my own weird brain basically reflecting  what Derek said which is I think a lot of folks and I've already had people ask me on Twitter and I with apologies to them ignored the questions because I don't think this is a great week for you to be out there going oh should I pick up Tori and prints and drop somebody that I drafted yesterday I mean yeah taurine Prince might have two or three three-pointers tonight but you did all this research on leading up to your fantasy draft weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks of research and you pick these guys at the end of your draft probably because you have some sort of faith that they have a shot at the very least of making it to a next level of providing a season-long boost to your team now I know a lot of people that actually drafted their 13th 14th player with the express intent of playing that player on opening night like they drafted Lakers and Nuggets and Sons and Warriors play tonight with the intention of dropping them after Thursday or whatever and that's fine but most of us with our 11th 12th 13th round picks we went out and we got guys that we thought  things break right this could be a top 80 per game player 14th round 15th round you start to get it you know 160 170 pics deep fine those guys maybe you don't really care that much how they perform maybe those guys are like 1% chance Flyers if you wanted exchange those dudes that's fine that's deeper rosters than most of these Yahoo public leaks have but for me unless something insane jumps out in this first game and it's not because somebody's out because like Bradley Beal is likely out for the sons and Booker's questionable that sounds like you want us to play and other pieces of news um let's see what what else is going on here Terrence Mann is likely off of the Clippers and their first ball game look at you just questionable  Jared Allen is out derry's Garland is questionable these guys are gonna miss games when their teams play there's gonna be that and you might see somebody fill in which we've referred to as a burger board player on fantasy NBA today before  this is not the kind of thing where you break the bank to go get an injury replacement this is a time where you play it chill  see how the guys do that you thought had a chance to be a full season play two days ago before you're just like  ah and you pull all the plugs out of the machine because one guy had a decent game because Bradley Beal was on the shelf or something to that effect so please do take it easy in that regard um  and that's my my overarching thought on that one another piece of information here for those that are making weekly lineup decisions is where you're generally looking at the players that are or are not injured right now going through some of the top names on the board Luca being questionable he's a guy you're starting  Darius Garland is questionable I would start him as well James Harden you're probably not starting would be my take because it doesn't sound like he actually wants to show up who are some of the other guys that are either questionable or out that are near the top Jared Allen your benching this week it sounds like he could miss actually the entire first week the season  Bradley Beal I'm probably playing you know it's it's a little bit questionable but they do have a three-game week so if we can get two out of him I think I'd feel pretty good about that so I'll go with a yes on Beal um Jeremy Grant and Anthony Simons I think are both questionable but I'm starting them kuzma's questionable Draymond Green is out I think I'd probably bench him because I don't expect him to be much better than top 100 play anyway and so if he misses another game now you're really going underwater there and then in terms of other guys that are right near the periphery Zach Collins is questionable  unfortunately you're going to have to make a call on him today I don't know that he's good enough to roll the dice if he only ends up with a one game week so I would probably sit him you're sitting Jaden McDaniels your city boy on bug zdanowicz because we got word that he's out for a month  and I think that's basically it for the guys that could actually move the needle a little bit for weekly line up decisions  let's get to some questions this is everybody's favorite part of the weekly lineup show if you've got a question in your watching live this is a great time to put it in there  if you're listening this show after the fact for first of all you don't have that much time to listen to it and then still set your lineup I would strongly recommend coming aboard and watching this one live as it's being recorded all the other ones  your experience is not going to be all that different this particular show where you're looking ahead at the week and an opportunity to throw some questions in a chat room that might get on air  here you go  I am not going to be answering every question in the YouTube chat I should also mention that because if you've got like an ah here's my three guys on my bench which one do I put in there this is more about me trying to find questions that apply to more than one team if at all possible some days that'll be two or three questions some days that'll be 15 to 20 today we'll probably keep it a little bit on the shorter side because it is weak one I don't know that people have a ton of questions yet but let's see what we've got as I navigate over to the chat room Nils know that once well this one's kind of specific but maybe we can talk about the players opinion on a tiniest Jones for Brooke Lopez and Jeremy Grant trade I like to sing his side he's Far and Away the best player in that trade package and typically unless you're in a very deep League you're looking to maximize the top players on the board we're seeing this is a top 15 fantasy player in Boston he might be more like top 20 Brook Lopez takes a step back he's probably the second highest ranked player on this board and then theis Jones and Jeremy Grant are a little bit of a wash frankly maybe Jeremy Grant's a little bit better but porzingis is so far beyond what you can expect from the other guys that in general A good rule of thumb is you take the side of the trade with the best player in the deal and just understand that you can work around the edges some other time those guys just move them needle in a way that the middling players or slightly later players don't  is Christian Braun startable not in 12 team members I don't think and this is the kind of stuff you're gonna we're gonna be looking for tonight because Bruce Brown is gone and Denver Christian Brown's gonna see some of those Bruce Brown minutes you might see just in holiday even take a few of those minutes I wouldn't start him in a games cap format if he's like the last player on your bench and you're in full stream mode here on day one  okay have at it if you want like he'll probably play 20 some odd minutes tonight and do something with them but to say it I'm expecting a lot would be I think a dramatic overestimate  life of cruise has the moment you realize you don't have any sons Lakers Warriors and 76ers players oh I have one team like that I actually do I'm with you life of of Coos notes or cuz like of cuz I have one team out of all of my cash leaks where I don't have a single one single player on any of those four clubs and so tonight is a little bit of a buzzkill for that league but this is why I mean so many leagues know that's not why  PS loving all the content you've put out Dan thank you that's very kind of yeah I've tried to do a lot like a lot a lot this fantasy run up I'm trying to do more shows and Twitter or shows and YouTube stuff this season then years passed I'll try to keep that going a little bit but at some point we will kind of dial it back a little  Cambria says is keep up the good work Mrs and Company appreciate the daily content you are welcome is there a way to access the past even for a different region I'm assuming  yeah the fantasy pass should be available for folks anywhere it's all just through sports ethos.com fantasy fast six bucks a month it's got all sorts of Cool Tools in it that we're going to be rolling out here over the next week and obviously it has all the the draft content in it as well so if you already have the fantasy pass then you already access to all this stuff that we've been talking about on on today's shows as well um  Samuel says Myles Turner and Keegan Murray or Kristofferson John Collins  see now this one's tighter because Myles Turner and Kristoff porzingis are kind of closer to a wash in fact they might be ranked right next to each other this year at the end of the day so then it's question of who do you like more Keegan Murray or John Collins I think I'd take the shot on the Collins side because I do think that he has maybe a little more per game upside if things break right  maybe with Murray you have a better chance of things of floor Murray's got the better floor Collins as the better upside I'll take the poor Singas and John Collins side  because frankly I think we're seeing some Myles Turner could be drafted almost interchangeably this year and they probably both end up around 65 games played  David says how do you feel about Kula believe  I've messed that up a bunch of times he seems really high um learning curve can I just say learning curve and leave it at that  I don't think you're gonna get much out of the chute  if you do get a bunch out of the chute  I mean I've been wrong before but that doesn't really hit until real NBA regular season stuff starts coming around the bend  Neil says I just finished my draft I landed Halliburton Kevin Durant what the JJ Myles Turner with my first picks God bless the ESPN draft board holy crap  maybe I should play more on ESPN  ousman says talk about the Euro MVP Sasha I think that's vest and cough on the Kings I don't think he's gonna play more than about 20 minutes a game to start so I wouldn't worry too much about it here in 12 teams Steven Vallejo says or buy a hole depending on if you pronounce it the Northern California way or the actual way should I give Roco one last go for the OM BS would be the old man best for Squad know the only way Roco has value I believe is if the Clippers have to trade all of their wings to get James Harden and then it's like a hardened Kauai Paul George vs zubats and nobody unrest and that's the entire team and then rokos like sit on the bench by himself with nobody else there but they have two they have too many damn Wings there will be days where he gets to play 20 minutes there'll be days to replace sick and I just can't trust the in between now if we see him come out on day one and play like 27 minutes I would do it but I don't think you need to do it before this season starts and I think that's where we'll leave it on the Q&A part for now because my voice is tired I did a hit this morning on vison this is my second part of the day and we've been doing one and one and a half to two shows every single day for a month and a half  late yes sneak sequent two questions got snuck in here right at the end my apologies fast already would you play kcp tonight in Roto  he's gonna be around like a 95 range guy so I think you could and it really wouldn't be the end of the world the question is do you think you get a warm kcp on opening night and usually the answer is that the shooters take a day or two to kind of get their legs underneath them from a rust standpoint but in that to that degree you're getting a little bit cute  I probably would I think he gets you a couple of three-pointers in a steal but I don't think he gets much beyond that so if you're looking at your team and you're like this team's gonna need steals in threes as we go then I would say yes but if you're in a roto situation where you're better picks your guys that maybe that aren't playing today or your top nine or 10 if you if that's all ready a strong team and steals in threes then I don't think I would blow a game on Casey p Chris bosom says any news on Jared Allen all we know is that he's out and the latest report from Chris Fodor mentioned that he is potentially out through the home games over the weekend as well so I think they're expecting him to miss a week that would keep him on my bench in any weekly league and I wouldn't expect to see Alan until next week so just start getting your expectations and check on the Jared Allen front and that way you're not disappointed when he doesn't play for three or four games  okay thanks for watching everybody this is Week 1 preview will be back with Derek for another one of these on Monday obviously I will be back with you tomorrow to break down the first two bucks scores of the first damn NBA slate which by the way Lakers at nuggets Suns at Warriors likely know Bradley Beal in that Suns game no Jarred Vanderbilt for the Lakers know Draymond Green for the Warriors so things that were kind of keeping an eye on tonight if you want to do this very quickly for the Lakers what is Tori and Prince actually going to be doing this season hard to know while Vanderbilt is out but that's something to keep a little watch on I'm actually most interested in D'Angelo Russell because they brought in Gabe Vincent but Dilo had a hell of a preseason he was playing a hard he played defense during the preseason he looked good he looked confident I think D-Lo might surprise some people but I am waiting to find out for the Nuggets it's about who takes the Bruce Brown minutes as a Christian Braun is more going to the starters off a championship run I don't think that would be a good idea do they trust the youngsters more does Justin holidays squeeze out a few  for the sons it's really about whether or not use of Norwich gets a full complement of minutes and then who can soak up some of the other stuff besides the superstars although I wouldn't make any large sweeping decisions while Beal is out and for the Warriors with no dream on we know Kevon Looney is almost a guarantee for nine rebounds plus everybody else and myself included with like to know what's going to happen with John and then coming to this year with dream on out he would seem to have a slightly larger opening here on opening night but I'm more interested in what happens with kaminga After Dream On comes back if Kim is a free agent in your league and he has a big game you kind of need to then add him just to see how it shakes out even though I would put out there that I don't think it's going to be a consistent Thing Once Draymond is around but you don't want to be the person with your pants down if he actually does start to put up a little more consistent stuff we'll start doing more of that tomorrow my thought in my mind and we'll see how this the schedule stuff actually takes place is that in the morning on most days will break down the previous night of games we'll go through the box scores any other pieces of news that hit if we have time in the afternoon specifically on larger card days maybe we'll even try to do kind of a nightly preview sort of show but that won't be every night I simply won't have time to do one of those every single day so there will be days where we started all together into one morning show they'll be days where we split it up depending on how much content there is make sure to stay tuned and you'll see it when you see it thanks again to Derek he is at d-ball on Twitter I'm at Dan best brisk you know you guys need to find us over on social because the season has begun and that's where the news happens to fastest like great subscribe tell your friends  see you tomorrow
