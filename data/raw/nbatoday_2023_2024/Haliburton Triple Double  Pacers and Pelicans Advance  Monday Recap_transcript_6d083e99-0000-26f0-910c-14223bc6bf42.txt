welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  all right second verse same as the first I think we're going now welcome everybody to episode 2 of the morning here on fantasy NBA today this is your standard recap show this one will be a pretty easy one actually just two games yesterday and from a fantasy standpoint I'll squeeze whatever I can out of it you guys know I'm always gonna wring out every ounce of Goo from a box score but the honest fellow Within Me  we'll tell you right now this show we can move through a pretty good clip I'm Dan bass I hope I'll see you guys over on social at Dan bastards please take a moment to subscribe to the YouTube page that is the big big thing like liking is all so cool so subscriptions are the number one and we'll tell you about manscaped as we work our way through this thing in a little bit so let's just go ahead and dive in because you know two shows and I'm just one man and frankly I'd like to do whatever else needs to get done on the day thank you to everybody that was in the chat room here that was helping me work through this very weird little technical issue with streamyard and it's like we're fine now so yesterday the ISP the n Season tournament also known as the NBA cup opened up its quarter-finals Indiana hosting the Boston Celtics everybody just figured Boston was gonna run away with this one I was really surprised to see Tyrese Halliburton recover from his illness as fast as he did but presumably it's not the one that a lot of these guys have that's like not going to dudes on their butt and Halliburton by the way it was fine 2610 and 13 a triple double I think that's the first of his career I might be getting that wrong though five three-pointers 10 out of 18 shooting this dude is unreal man this dude is on freaking real Halliburton is number three  in nine cat right now and he's basically neck and neck with Nicola yokich if you can believe that  wild he's ahead of Joel embiid they're all trying to chase down Shea who's at two and a half steals of ball game and that's been a big reason why he's as high as he is but man you got to put up some serious popcorn numbers to be at the top of the board  shout out to Albert and for doing just that and for being one of the guys that we are talking about targeting  remember right at the beginning top four and not that we were like all by ourselves with this one but yokich sort of the the obvious number one and not he's behind Shea but like you're not gonna feel bad about drafting yokich one and he's number two right now  number two I was like look I'm between embiid Shea and Halliburton there if you're worried about the health you go Che or Halliburton if you want big scoring you go and beat and now frankly at this moment if you've gone any one of those directions you'd have effectively the number two player in fantasy so so far so good on the top of the board handicap we'll see if it holds anyway the rest of the news on yesterday's game will Veer away from the guy who's 100% owned and 100% started and into the news which is that Kristoff we're singing This is hoping to make his return later this week for the Celtics they now don't play again until Friday which means he has another Well three days today tomorrow Thursday to recover and then most of Friday  presumably with a little bit of a whimper unfortunately this is the end of the road for the Al Horford feeling stream it was a lot of fun  and I got a clown on Yahoo or someone I think Yahoo gets their blurbs from Rotoworld I don't know but their last Al Horford blurred made me laugh and then cry and then laugh again and then understand why you and I you listeners me our friends are just destroying a lot of people in fantasy listen to this listen to this recap the advice I'm sorry I'm picking on somebody I don't know what like kid is learning how to do blurbs over there that I'm picking on here so apologies in advance I anyway the blurb says Horford's usage has spiked during Krista for singing this absence that's true but it's 10 year in the starting lineup has been Rocky oh has it now  through five stars he's reached double digit scoring only once  always that right even though there was a 20 and a 16 in back-to-back games  okay and if 15 rebound explosion against the Hawks makes his 7.4 per game rebound average more impressive than it appears  boy  boy  this is  I'm sorry like you know me I'm not out here to go pick on anybody but this this blurb  this advice being given to everyone who clicks the little button on Al Horford on Yahoo  is some of the worst fantasy advice I've ever seen what did we just talked about yesterday on our show what was Al Horford ranked since Chris stops forcing his went down before that last ball game you guys remember number nine  he's a first rounder since Christopher saying is went down who gives a crap if his rebounds were at 7 and change  nobody  nobody  because in his last six ball games which if I'm not mistaken I think poor thing is actually played in that and I I could try to do it I can try to get even more accurate how long has he missed we're seeing this is only missed four ball games by the way so what we should really be doing here is looking at last four games I'll do that basketball monster let's me do that on other side thank you BBM for that over the last four games you guys want to know what I'll hartford's rank is even after this quieter ball game 17  is that what you'd call a rocky 10 year in the starting lineup  11 points nine and a half rebounds one and a half threes four assists a steal two blocks on 61% shooting from the field and a perfect four for four at the free throw line that's Rocky  stop it  over these four games Al Horford has been one of the best injury replacement players in the NBA over the last half decade how many guys go from being outside the top 100 to a second rounder not many  that's brutal man that is absolutely brutal people are reading that and thinking oh yeah good thing I didn't pick up Al Horford for this terrible Rocky fill in it's been  good gravy even Yesterday by the way with a 2.4 like admittedly that's a that's a clunky game seven boards four assists and a block  stop it  you know I  I believe that fantasy sports gets more competitive every year but I'm a little bit worried that if this is what everybody's gonna read that they're gonna end up with a whole lot of points League type of teams trying to win nine cat  I'll Hartford in points lie yesterday that was a really bad line  but  I'm mean most people on Yahoo are not playing points you throw that blurb up on ESPN maybe to make more sense  yikes big yikes make sure to get your fantasy info from Sports ethos good Lord  other news on yesterday Sam Houser at 53 pointers nice little three-pointer filling type streamer ah Jaylen Brown had 30 we talked about him and fouled out on our Bi-Lo show just a few minutes ago but he healed another nice game in the starting lineup he's been top 40 since he moved into the starting five  Bruce Brown  is finally getting cooking and then Obi topping who look this is a perfectly fine ball game mostly because of the two blocks but the minutes are back down to 26 because Aaron Nesmith was playing really well off the bench and unfortunately that's just kind of the way that things go  in Indiana you're going to get hot and it is  and it works for him look like it's annoying it's not like I can say Rick Carlile you're a terrible coach because his Pacers are 11 and 8 they just beat a very good Boston team to advance in this n Season tournament the number six seed in the Eastern Conference  but from a fantasy standpoint it's extraordinarily annoying we would like them to just pick five or six guys to get consistent minutes and it's just not going to be the case we should consider ourselves I think extremely fortunate that they finally moved buddy yielded to the starting lineup and now he gets a more consistent 24 to 32 minutes but that unfortunately means that everybody else is splitting even fewer  shorter rotation in this one at least anyway as far as like in Weak streamer goes all of these guys are playable anybody that got more than 20 minutes in this game you can play for their next one on Thursday but you know nine cat Roto long-term type stuff top in math and Nesmith none of those guys actually makes any sense  and then remember the Celtics don't play a game until Friday so if you were streaming someone on the Celtics you probably want to get off of them now  other game yesterday was all pretty fun New Orleans beat Sacramento 127 to 117 herb Jones a giant ball game he's come roaring back after like two or three kind of quiet ones and again I'll repeat what I said on yesterday's show everybody in fantasy  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no terrifying isn't it  luckily

drizzly.com that's dri z l y.com today must be 20 one plus not available in all locations  with the exception of like the top 20 and even that's stretching it  has down stretches  everybody  herb Jones like the guys like herb Jones it's just going to be more obvious because they don't score very much  herb Nic Claxton is it 12 in some odd points per game Brooke Lopez is at 13 and some odd so when These Guys these are guys that are inside the top 30 when those dudes have a few games where they don't do a lot of stuff it's gonna be really obvious because it's going to be like a 6.2 rebound one assist one Steel game and you're going to what in the world am I doing holding onto this guy but then you have to remember averages just just yell that word inside your brain let it bang off of each corner of your Dome every time someone in that like sort of quiet but awesome nine Gap producer category has a quiet game just have your brain scream  averages  because herb this year is at one point eight steals 1.3 blocks 5288 splits  12 4 and 3 and that puts him inside the top 30  son of a gun set right ahead of Kyrie Irving right now and obviously a lot of that has to do with what your approaching but if you're thinking like oh it's because he's a turnover darling it's not it's because he's a percentage is Steals and blocks darling which are my four favorite categories to attack his nobody else pays attention to that  I was a lot to say that herb Jones was an obvious hold for a long time see Jim McCallum traveled for this Blog game that's nice to see so every day his little lung situation gets a little better  you're playing the starting five for the pals right now and you're also playing Trey Murphy who wasn't quite as good in this ball game as his first one back but honestly like it doesn't matter you can't worry about the game to game he's still 16 points in three threes even if he didn't really do anything else  I'm enamored with the 30 minutes and 13 shots that's more than enough to get Trey Murphy inside the top one 100 and that's all you should be paying attention to as well because everything else will level off if the minutes and the shots are there you have nothing to worry about for Sacramento the guy that we've been sort of quietly tracking all season long was Malik Monk and I just kept saying it over and over again through the first I guess it was like four weeks I can't put this dude on my fantasy team if he's playing 22 minutes of ballgame well luckily he ain't anymore over the last two weeks monk is playing 28 minutes despite Darren Fox being in the lineup he's shooting 48% from the field which maybe that doesn't hold and he's made something like 20 straight free throws which all so well perfectly hold but he is a good foul shooter 18 points 3 assists 1.3 Steals and three three pointers over that stretch yeah he's playing over his head but the 28 minutes is enough  Malik monk in 28 minutes is a top 100 guy with a little bit of room to grow over that depending on what role he has and then obviously a fox ever misses the ball game then his role leaps through the top of the building  but this is why we tracked him for all that time as soon as the minutes started a trend up he's a guy that needed to be rostered in every format and so you're playing him now  Kevin herder all so quiet play Keegan Murray is on my Bi-Lo board from earlier today he left and then came back in this ball game still kind of dealing with that back injury but again 31 minutes 11 shots for three-pointers as his percentage is level off you're just your golden demand is the bonus also jumped about 20 slots by finally hitting some free throws in this ballgame on his way to a triple double and then dear and fox had sort of points League Dr in Fox in this ballgame and dropped himself outside the top 25 because of it but you know they're in lies the rub with him he's gonna take a ton of shots he took 25 of them in this ball game  but if he's not making those you know the free throws are not going to be great the turnovers are high  he's gonna be awesome in a lot of stuff that points don't care about but he's a negative in all three categories that points League care about the turnovers actually haven't been that big of a deal for him so far this year he's gonna be fun I don't want you guys to miss interpret what I'm saying but when he was number eight it was pretty obvious that that was something that was going to Trend down  and anything else that we needed to talk about in this ball game  not really I mean that's the that's the two game or yesterday I guess you could point and sort of side I Jose Alvarado but 18 minutes ain't enough there  and yeah that's it for the recap from yesterday so let's just sort of

far as tonight goes I mean more than anything it's it's about streaming this evening and we can talk about things that were watching for like is Josh Hart going to get 30 minutes again is Bobby Portis able to do more than just points and rebounds for Phoenix can anyone make any noise besides the main three for the Lakers do any of those sort of fringy wing types  Elevate themselves Above the Rest but more than anything  not only are you trying to stream but you're probably trying to stream the guys that you think are gonna win so they'll play again on Thursday and you get two quality days out of one roster move so bucks favored by five Lakers favored by one and a half that second goal game honestly I think the suns are gonna win it Lakers have played pretty well lately but they've also beaten Phoenix twice already this season and now Devin Booker has a chance to sort of lean into this one  Milwaukee is going to be a tough one to be there on their home court but you know Nicks are gonna give it their all you know that's coming and they'll defend which Milwaukee has had a couple of problems with teams I can defend a little better  but again like if you're looking at for streams  unfortunately there isn't much on that Milwaukee Side pack content and would have been the guy but he's already been ruled out for the week so I mean what are we even trying to accomplish with them at this point like who's left  campaign he'll probably get about 18 minutes 19 minutes  marjon Beauchamp  bushong he might get 15 16 minutes bucks are gonna be a heavy on the starters and Bobby Portis  so aren't that many streaming opportunities unfortunately the next of the team of that first matchup that has the streaming list Donte divincenzo Josh Hart I don't think I'd go Quentin Grimes but Emmanuel quickly Isaiah hartenstein  not that these guys are going to put a massive numbers but you'll get something out of them in a way that I don't know that you're gonna get much from anybody on the Milwaukee side and then Lakers Sons I'd rather good a Lakers because they've got cameras they've got Tori and prints these guys are probably on the wire and streamable but I also don't think they're going to win this ball game so I'd be looking at the Suns and saying all right like is there a Gordon get a play what's the deal with Grace and Allen Joshua kogi is a maybe Jordan Goodwin is kind of a maybe if Eric Gordon is out he becomes a better maybe  so the streaming list is is before you all but we don't really know who's in who's out yet specially for the Suns more than anybody else she probably want to wait a little bit later into the day but if you wait later into the day to figure out who's playing for Phoenix you might miss your chance to get a liqueur so maybe the answer is just to go cam redish or Taurean Prince and hope that the Lakers can squeak one out here against the Suns  I don't actually have the answer to that question I know you guys turned to me for definitive like dig your healing answers on stuff but sometimes there isn't an obvious one especially at 10 something in the morning here Pacific when the games don't happen for another five or six hours and the late game for another eight or nine  such as life I fear at times where there's a gray area  but those are the names at least on the streaming board you heard them from Derek ball on yesterday's show and you know if you want to make your move this morning you might not have a choice but to do it so  you know maybe you just do it  as far as like what do we watching long-term for Phoenix in La pretty much nothing  maybe we get a sniff of Bradley Beal in the next week or two supposedly he's being real that you waited around now  let me triple check on that timeline I had a written down like three days ago but that note has been lost for the ages he last played on November 12th so the 19th the 26th a day or two ago was three weeks um last update we got why that was I think yesterday or the day before where still no real timetable on him so there's your three week Mark meaning there's really nothing you know Eric Gordon is I had to head your your praying that he has a better type night but none of these guys are rohto built none of these guys are rest of season plays on either team  especially as the Lakers ramp Jarred Vanderbilt up and ramp rui hachimura up and maybe eventually get Gabe Vincent back  he had a whole lot of Mac on that nightcap  but the good news for those of you that are hanging out with us here on the show is that because we have nothing else to talk about on the card we can do a few questions  do Wendy and shed we'll go straight to the chat room to empty and chat just get better as the season rolls on I in parenthesis I don't know how much better chat can get though LOL where do you think they land in rankings by the end of the season  is that good question actually so I think chat probably slows a tiny bit the 53  like 40 870 that those hold all season long but he was as you guys might recall the one truly young guy on The Dan Vespers old man squad because we knew that his stat set was going to translate unbelievably well for women Yama honestly I don't know that his game changes all that much in season he's gonna have to get stronger  I like the flexibility element but he's gonna have to add a little bit of strength and at some point this season's just gonna kind of worried wear them down a little bit same story for homegrown  so honestly I think chat you see settle back in Wendy this is you know not too far from what I'd expect from him feel goal percent and turn over are always going to be the things that we're going to limit him a little bit but these guys are putting up insane numbers and I think he probably just want to ride it out more than anything else not that anybody's trading either of them  if you could sell homegrown for you know top 15 to 20 guy you could do it I don't think that'd be the worst idea in the world but I also think you have just as much fun seeing how it goes  who's better rest of season Ogden and Obey or Derek white that's one that hasn't come up yet  interesting  let's see Derek white number 52 OG is outside the top 100 yeah even if OG catches up I don't think he passes him so we're going Derek White  I just traded Halliburton for hardened and JJJ the playoff schedule means a lot your thoughts on this well  my thought is that  we don't all have the same exact playoff schedule but if you're confident your team can get there and you're adding a whole bunch of games played it's not like it's not the worst idea in the world I just man I hate trading away a top three fantasy player that's that's a good player  and do the Pacers have a terrible playoff schedule I guess it depends on when they are there's like they've got a back-to-back three game or mixed in there I don't think that I'm giving up Halliburton I don't think I'm trading away any guys  unless they have a two-game week in the playoffs Minnesota the Lakers  Dallas and Charlotte have two game weeks kind of late in the season those are the four teams where you might be like maybe I move on from my favorite dudes on these clubs  even though that's so like four to four for some of them but that two gamer could end your season whereas with the Pacers  you get in three a couple of times out of Halliburton I think is probably enough for me how should I trade Zion or just hold on I wasn't drafting him to begin with so this one's kind of a tougher one to me because I'm coming from a place of I don't have him  uh but this is Zion he's a punt free throw guy I expecting anything different than what you're seeing right now is a little crazy like he was always gonna be a punt free throw guy who was pretty good at field goal percent which he has been he's scoring he doesn't get that many defensive stats which he hasn't before rebounds fine assist fine this is sort of who he is  if your team can't handle the punt free throw then get rid of him if you can  hold on  I traded siakam and Herb Jones for Jaron Jackson Jr can I get your thoughts on this  so I like the Bilo on JJ I'm not a huge fan of selling low on siakam  and herb is is ranked way higher right now and he's a little bit of a sell high but not that much I think  I just think I would have maybe found a different pair if possible like this could work out fine for you but I think it could have been done a little bit differently like you could have gone herb and maybe somebody who isn't a cell low but I guess I'm splitting hairs  I only have one move remaining for this week should I targeted player that plays Wednesday Friday or pick up an in season tournament player being you're the only person who knows how full your schedule is on Wednesday Friday if you're in overload mode then you definitely want to go with someone who plays in the NBA cup if you're Wednesdays and Fridays are not full yet then you can Max them out like if you have open slots on every remaining day this week then fine I just sort of find it hard to believe that your Friday won't be full because  basically everybody that doesn't play in the semifinals  is is gonna play on Friday  so we know the Pacers are not playing Friday we know the pals are not playing Friday and there will be two more teams that don't play on Friday but it's gonna be a 13 game day everybody else is going and more than likely that means you're going to be an overflow mode so I think I would probably try to Target in season tournament days but again you check your lineup and you'll know better than me both Josh giddey and Usher Thompson were dropped both are well outside the top 150 in points leagues are they worth grabbing and if so who do I prioritize and why I would lean towards Thompson I mostly I'm just afraid that some sort of news is going to drop on giddy although who knows Thompson is certainly the better Nine cat guy between the two players I do think he also eventually sort of rebounds up and gets to do more stuff  short term it's probably giddy for points leagues but long-term I think it's Thompson  points again Dan how would Anthony Simon's affect brogden's value in nine cat he's gonna take some away from him and then eventually that's going to be scoots job Brogan's not going to they're gonna probably try to move him at the trade deadline I would think  if I'm trying to trade Brogden who should I Target and what range I would think that Malcolm ought to be able to get you somebody between 80 and 100 right now he's playing well he's number one oh four overall on the year but he's scoring assisting teams love guys that scoring assist and his free throw percent will probably get better field goal percentage is questionable but I would think it would get better as well  targeting a big man  they really aren't that many around him John Collins is not a traditional big man but you could almost definitely get him maybe you could get Keegan Murray who's also not a big man but at least he's getting you six rebounds and some steals  I don't think brought against me gonna be enough to get you walk or Kessler I don't think he's gonna be enough to get you Jalen Duren I don't think he's gonna be enough to get you Mitchell Robinson but that would be one maybe you could try on if you're targeting a big man you probably need to add something else in if you're targeting a wing or another guard there are a lot of them around on the board just look at the board near Brogden and somebody will jump out at you like one of them names  doing two pods back to back is not surprisingly not great for the voice we're gonna do  a couple more questions not gonna get to all of them  should I stream Simona fontecchio if Larry continues to miss time or send he Alma I prefer all dhamma  are the top 10 or 15 days from Kyrie Irving officially done no I think his 45 and a half percent shooting is going to move up and I also think his Steals and blocks will come up as the season goes so no I think he I think he works his way back up into that range and at some point Lucas going to miss a couple of ball games you know Luca eventually runs out of gas Luca missed one last week and Kyrie was was trump it was troubling but Luke always gets out to these fast starts but then he ends up having to do too much in his body starts to sort of say decompose because he's young but it just  he wears it  he wears it and you see him wear it so no I think Kyrie's gonna be fine I wouldn't worry about it someone else asking about Zion we already asked that one nine cat dear and fox or Damian Lillard I prefer Dame and he's ahead of him now by six slots mostly because Fox is free throw number is come way down and then with Fox I think there's other stuff that might start to taper as well I just I don't know how I can take 2325 shots every game all season long maybe he can but if he feels like it's asking almost too much  would you say Mark Cal faults as officially a drop in 12 years with no more IR space and is no time table yes I think you can move on from him if you don't have an Irish slot and I are and Ill or an IR slot and the most recent news that they have no idea what he's coming back  can I drop khris Middleton and Jordan Poole to get Jalen Suggs and Derek Lively yeah I mean technically those guys have been better and if your team is is struggling you probably want the guys that are better  it's not insane  Middleton probably slowly continues to ramp up but I told you six weeks ago he's going to be one of the most annoying players to roster this year and he has been  our PJ Washington and I met Ikea droppable for a streaming spot I don't know  if you're an overflow mode this week you might not have a choice but if you're not and you really want to get some extra games in the answer is yes but overall I think these guys still have top 100 range in them because Tyler hero isn't back yet I know they were hoping he'd be back this week but it doesn't sound like it maybe we'll see but I don't think he traveled but I see you didn't travel hero and Bam didn't travel for their game  and then PJ Washington probably an easier stream but again you know your situation better than I do if you're in a game's disadvantage in a head-to-head weak against somebody else this week it hurts even more because they're just aren't that many games  would you hold Wendell Carter Junior or a drop for a streaming spot I would have dropped him weeks ago but if you all this long you you probably want to keep holding now um I haven't watched your Bi-Lo just yet who should we try to trade for Jalen Brown it's too late now he was on the Bi-Lo show from last week he just had a massive 30-point performance you're just not gonna be able to get him anymore it's too late now sorry I know bad news Dan what a bummer  uh let's see here I need to drop someone to activate boy on bogdanovich is it DeAndre Hunter Santi aldama Kyle Lowry or Malik monk it's either aldama or Hunter  it's probably Hunter he just has no ceiling  would you trade away Tatum and Catherine for deante  Bunker and cam Thomas know  didn't we or Gafford it points League oh that changed it it's Gafford and nine cat it might be didn't witty in points  you probably have to tell me what their average right now in a points League because I don't have that number in front of me  cat and strews for Dame Lillard  no that's an overpaid in Daymar 19 and 20 right now they're basically deadlocked  jet for Hardin  nah  like I'd rather chat  do you feel like what Max Drew's doing is sustainable so far  we're six weeks into the season now and every damn week he stopped 60 he's number 57 right now so I'm gonna continue to say yes until something tells me otherwise one of my favorite waiver wire guys this year  a lot of analysts said don't hold there and I said you guys are freaking crazy  I packaged Horford and Reese and I got Jared Jackson well done  that's a clean up right there  I have a halibut  I know that's Halliburton but I like that is nicknamed in this particular post is halibut everybody in the NBA needs a fish nickname halibut Cade book and keonte sir you need to check your autocorrect before posting these are these too many assists  I mean  probably  I don't know you know who you're playing against grave yourself against some of the best teams in your league make sure you can beat him in the playoffs and then you'll get your answer  I traded foxbank Carol aldama for Kyrie and Kristoff for Singas in nine cat who wins this one the Kyrie and porting his side and I don't think it's all that close actually is monkey must roster yes points League yes I'm looking for a CIS in Roto would you trade Away Jordan Poole and Trey Murphy for DeAngelo Russell honestly yeah I probably would  Trey Murphy might not be that far behind him but if you can honestly get yourself off of Jordan Poole I probably would do it  what to do if a player is too good to be but it doesn't fit your build and you could pick up guys from the waivers that fit it much better in this particular case this poster is saying I have Clay and Jordan Poole but I need a big man Mitchell Robinson Derek Lively Wendell Carter Junior all in The Wire  um look you know  you could try to trade clay and pool to somebody and try to get like a top one something thing back  but it's going to be tough nobody wants those guys right now so clay I think you kind of have to hold on to he's showing signs of playing a little better you might be able to move him for somebody inside the top 100 in a week or two pool he's just been awful  and you know Mitchell Robinson and Derek live a look awesome right now so I I know someone's gonna go pick him up when you drop him but also I don't think it's that nuts at this point  Sorry where this many weeks in we're six and a half weeks into the season  a lot of guys are who they are at this point pool will probably get a little bit better but will it be good enough should I add Chianti George and PJ Washington drop RJ Barrett and DeAndre hundreds points League um sure why the hell not I mean  I don't think it changes all that much for you know hold on to RJ Barrett I know his minutes have been lower lately but he's a points League Darlings so hold on to Barrett Hunter vs keyonte George versus PJ Washington that to me is a full-on wash  who has better Nine cat value between Trey Murphy and DeAnthony Milton it's probably Trey Murphy  kante's assists dropped for the past few games is it because Larry's out or the eight assists the beginning too high the eight were too high he wasn't gonna sustain a says he's still a rookie and he's not the primary guy on his team for the last two know like  eight or nine shows like a week and a half's worth I've been talking about George is an obvious drop in Roto had to head he's kind of like a luxury stash at this point because you're playing him because he's doing some stuff but he's hurting your team more than he's helping right now I have no problem with folks moving on from Georgia if they don't want to hold all the way to February to see if he starts to get the percentages turned around because there's at least like a 50/50 shot at never happens this year and so that's fine would you trade yakka Pearl and Mike Conley for OG that's an overpay you should be able to get OG for turtle by himself and even that I don't know if I would do it  Conley I think I probably would  oh the keyonte George question was a dynasty League yeah go ahead and hold on to George yeah I don't think he's gonna average eight assists but you know probably decent in the next year or two  but this one I think I'd rather have turtle that OG  Conley I would give up  can you please give a shout out to paper route Frank and send wishes for a fantasy league championship sure why the hell not good luck paper route Frank  that's hilarious  thoughts on Killian Hayes when he moved into the starting lineup last week I called him a speculative add and I will continue to call him that until we know what the hell he's actually going to be  would you rather have any goal or Derek Lively right now it's Derek Lively click a belly goes down obviously that flips but Lively's the starter he's playing a nice minutes his fantasy profiles not that dissimilar from like a nickname so Derek Lively and we're done under 40 minutes on this one despite the big question and answers session thank you for watching both shows
