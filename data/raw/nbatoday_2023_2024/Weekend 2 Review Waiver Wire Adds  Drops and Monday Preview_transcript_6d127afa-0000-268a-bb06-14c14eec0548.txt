welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  well I only one way to know if the voice is coming back and that's to test it this has been a raunchy cold  I can still feel it in my sinuses and you guys are probably gonna hear that those of you that listen or watch Daily just a slight change  but it is coming back little by little little buy baby little steps I still got the inhaler right over there for the Cog this has been a  what a hellacious man this is like if you're a broadcaster the things you don't want to get the short list is  a nasty cough laryngitis and this one had both  but we're coming around  thought I'd Rock a little Ace Ventura shirt today to  I don't know  personal pick me up a present from me to me as we engage on this new week of fantasy basketball we're into week three now  we're I think of visually in the grind  not I don't know I guess it's up to you if you think you're in the grind or not I think we are now we've got another weekend to recap  one thing I found that I still can't do is laugh if I laugh the cough is coming so no fun today on the show  make you one promise on today's program and that is we will have no fun at all  we have a lot to cover though and I appreciate you guys already getting questions into the chat room that's very cool those that are hanging out live I'm not sure we're going to be able to get to very many of them today or at least on this morning show because this is it is a two-show day  we  will have this morning one we'll go through the weekend in Reverse reverse chronological lighting round Monday well so preview the big Monday cars there's a lot going on tonight  and then this afternoon about five-ish or so hours from now I'll be joining up we'll be joining forces with the great ball to give you the week ahead show and that's what we're doing a few more questions so if you have questions you can throw them in the gyro I don't know if I'm gonna get to them today if I don't hit him in the afternoon will almost definitely get to those questions because that's just sort of a different format the show itself is typically quicker less content and then you can get to the questions faster or as this one we've got all 32 teams to cover going backwards we've got Monday of what do we have like it doesn't games tonight or something crazy so let's let's Dive Right on in first of all Hello everybody welcome to Fantasy NBA Today week 3 this is a sports ethos presentation and I'm your host Dan best briefs find me over on social at De n b e s b r i s very cool that we are actually approaching 19,000 Twitter follows 20 is going to be a big deal for me so maybe you can help get us there and and I'll start at the outset of the show by just requesting please everybody again find me on social but like rate subscribe whatever those little quick things you can do are pause your brain for just a moment and go find the Thumbs Up Button if you're watching on YouTube if you're listening on the Pod go find the Subscribe button let's keep growing this little sucker until it hits the Moon  for those uninitiated the reverse chronological  sees fumbles over himself reverse chronological lightning round is where we go backwards Sunday Saturday and then Friday sometimes if we need it to hit each team in the NBA's most recent basketball game just to get the most recent updated data and kind of reset ourselves for the week ahead I find this is the best way to do it just see what everybody's been doing what is every team in the NBA been doing we'll go from there  let's start at the top the Phoenix Suns gotta win at Detroit which you know that's one that they probably should get to Pistons are a little bit better this year than they were last season but they're still the Pistons there's still two and five and Kate Cunningham cannot stop turning the basketball over but as far as fantasy stuff in this game goes there wasn't a whole lot of it Phoenix still without Bradley Beal steel but without Devin Booker who came back for one ball game and then abandoned ship again this time for a calf issue so that's off to a bad start and everybody said no you can't draft Kevin Durant because he's the guy on that team that's going to be in the whole time and he's the only one of these damn dudes that's been upright so far  by the way kudos to KD who have with this gigantic ball game after kind of a weird start particularly at the free throw line he's back up to number 14 now so you know no problem and a lot of that is the four turnovers for nine cat and a lot of that is sort of small sample size theater where you know he's gonna be passing  DeAndre eight and much as I've enjoyed his start as the season goes almost definitely gonna see guys like Larry Market in fall back a little bit it's just sort of you know the again we've only had six seven ball games so little things go a long way and for for KD right now you know if you're for instance if you just punted turnovers he moves in front of most of those guys we just mentioned already  Katie's number eight in eight cat right now and I don't expect this turnovers to say that high but whatever you guys didn't come to hear me talk about Kevin Durant Eric Gordon is a reasonable stream when both Beale and Booker are out you just hope that he hits his shots and he did in this ball game and then over on the Detroit side Marcus Sasser playing his butt off so far this year 30 minutes in this one  who are the sort of Pistons losers in this well there was no Jane Ivy in this ball game there was no Alec Burks in this ball game so they were quite thin in the backcourt and you know Sasser  most definitely earned the minutes he got but it's gonna get a little more complicated for him when Burke's and Ivy are in there and that's why I'm not saying you absolutely positively have to pick him up I think you can kind of watch from the sidelines here plus he's not gonna shoot this clip all season long I don't care how good he is he's just not gonna hit whatever it is 50 some odd percent of his three-pointers all year and I I feel like you know maybe you get in and you stream it but by the time you do it's probably too late as our Thompson has been remarkable I I sat on a show last week that I thought we'd have to sort of suffer through some more rookie learning curve stuff to really cash in on the fact that his rebounds assists Steals and blocks are  barely I mean basically Elite for what he's at like this is a wing player who rebounds well assists well for where he plays on the floor seals and blocks are amazing percentages are bad right now and he's still a top 30 play to this point  is he gonna slow down a little bit probably eventually the rigors of an NBA season will take their toll but  I mean he looks like he may be the rookie steal so far and that's considering that Chet Holmgren to this point is a first rounder  I will remind you guys as much as I love old dudes Chad Holmgren is on The Dan bass for sold man squad  I'm feeling like I'm gonna have to say that a 1,000 times because nobody's gonna remember that I did put a young guy on there Killian Hayes know we're not gonna buy it on that you know this is again no Jane Ivy Jalen Duren got ejected for two flagrant one fouls in the same ball game one of them I know was undercutting it was invading Kevin Durant's Landing space on a three-pointer the other one I think he caught somebody with an elbow if I'm remembering right he'll be fine this was always to be expected he wasn't going to be a first rounder all season long after a couple of slightly slower ball games he's down around number 30 which is still very good but you're also seeing the blocks come down you know they were gonna stay at two per game turnovers should come down from here and then I think some of the other stuff can can more or less hang out where it was but you know we're getting whatever it's a great start  you never get first round you back for him in a trade I still think you could maybe Reach Out try to get like a top 40 guy back see what happens maybe nothing  done matter  this game by the way sealed the Fate on Isaiah Stewart who I just like I don't think that he's of standard League guy I went back and forth a little bit on this one and I'm I'm done with these number 158  actually been playing kind of okay so far ah doesn't get defensive stats and when Duran's out there he's not even rebounding as much as we need him to it's not worth it streamer level only  Raptors Spurs over time Scotty Barnes is out of his mind right now  and look this is not meant to rain on the Scotty Barnes parade because I didn't think he was going to take this kind of step forward  this is a sell High  even if you think he's going to be very good this year this is a sell High because right now he's number five in nine cat  what do we think is going to come down probably the 10 rebounds  six assists maybe that holds 3.2 combined defensive stats there aren't many guys in the NBA that hole that type of line throughout an entire year so expect some kind of drop off  it's also possible that he hasn't been doing this long enough this season for you to get proper value back on Barnes meaning you might try to go get a top 25 guy and people are going to rebuff those offers and then you might go try to get a top 30 guy and maybe you get a little bit of a sniff there but I don't think that I would sell him for top 40 I think you're better off just seeing what happens for another week or two because he keeps this up for another week then you could probably sell him for a top 25 guy and then you probably do because at some point this is all gonna level off but the question is to what point and then again if you're like he's gonna be seemingly he's going to be better than that that 50 ish 50 range I think where he was going um so you don't need to sell for that you can sell for a higher than that and every game he has a good performance people are gonna buy in more to the idea that he's a top 20 and that's where you could start to think about maybe cashing in a little bit  Dennis Schroder is just plugging along crazy yaakov portal missed his two free throws but with no precious a Chua he's certainly been a whole heck of a lot better he was barely playable for three or four games of the season last few he's been much better so fire up your your Yakko Cubs and Gary Trent who got 29 minutes in this game and did nothing with it remains outside the top 200 and with every passing day I put another you can drop him out into the universe and at some point everybody will and then we can stop worrying about it now if you're holding Trent you're hoping he gets moved because he gets moved to a team that wants him they'll probably let him have a little bit more wiggle room this Raptors team just has no no real place for him and what they're doing right now even with the minutes his place is to just space the floor it's not handling the ball at all so uh yeah you're talking luxury stash in kind of a best-case scenario  other side Victor wembanyama another amazing ball game he's coming on I think the I personally thought the learning curve would be more than a week but apparently no he's not 27 in nine cat right now  and there's gonna be ups and downs along the way but you're already seeing all the crazy things that a man of his size and athletic ability can do  enjoy the ride because you probably drafted him at 20  maybe sooner if it was right at the very end after those giant preseason games you might have taken him at 15 it's not like you're gonna sell for something more than that you just now you just do it  Kelvin Johnson's been surprisingly good so far I do still think the bottom will start to fall out on that one because I had killed in Johnson in a few spots last year and he wasn't this good  17 points two threes six boards four assists I mean the the boards the assist the steals are high the field goal percentage is higher than expected maybe he keeps something like this up but I just can't believe it so I would say sell high on Kelvin Johnson know Devin vessel sounds like he's not gonna be out quite as long as initially thought Malachi Branham came in and shot eight for nine in 25 minutes but that's not gonna be enough to get it done Zach Collins is rolling now he's gotten the turnovers a little bit better in check he's pushed himself inside the top 90s still because he's averaging three turnovers a game but everything else is wonderful for Zack so far in fact any Collins you drafted has been a pretty good hit Zach 14 points 7 boards almost five assists a steal a block and a three-pointer great great start to the year just ride that thing out  and then the other news on the Spurs is that it's possible and YouTubers are gonna see that little message pop up on their screen because we're floating over the basketball monster page that when B might sit out some back to back so keep an eye on that and we'll get our first data point if he does sit it out on who you might want to pick up on the Spurs as a future game replacement  oh so I'm very much not in the you need to hold Jeremy Sohan camp  I've seen some folks on Twitter say again that he's off to a good start this year with 9 points five and a half rebounds and five assists and 1.2 steals but I would remind everybody that that makes him a positive in two categories he's League average or worse in the other seven  that's not actually good  anyway  Cavaliers starting to look more like themselves here put the defensive clamps on the Warriors who just couldn't get shots to fall and when that happens they're not gonna win clay was cold Jonathan comingo took way too many shots he was also very cold Andrew Wiggins has been cold since the first moment this season began  and I'll say the same thing I've said in every show so we'll just make it quick he is both a bylaw and a player I don't want on my fantasy team  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no terrifying isn't it  luckily you

that's dri z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  an Unholy matrimony of thoughts Draymond Green 18 points 8 assists three steals a block he is basically up to Full Tilt now and he's amazingly inside the top 100 on only 26 minutes of ball game  the fear here of course is what does this do to Chris Paul who only played 25 minutes still can't get his shot to drop and when the other Warriors aren't shooting well Chris Paul's assist dry up  so this is a reason for concern I love to sit here and tell you that Chris Paul is just cooking and nothing can go wrong he still fine to this point number 83 in nine cat on the season  uh  that's a totals rank isn't it  but he's falling and the Draymond Green stuff is a pretty big part of it  but he's also shooting 31 and a half percent from the field so presumably as that levels maybe everything turns out okay I would be a little bit concerned with Chris Paul and I haven't been a lot of spots so I am a little bit because concerned with Chris Paul but you're not gonna do anything with it I'm getting should I drop messages after one or two bad ball games or Warriors are trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together let's also remember that the guys that are coming in after the fact which is CP3 on this club are going to be the guys that have to figure out where they fit schematically  and he's typically getting 25 to 31 minutes of ball game so I don't think we need a panic there 29 minutes for Chris Paul should generally be enough if any of his shots would actually go in  also worth noting Moses Moody probably gets a spot started if Klay Thompson sits there back to back coming up tonight capside we got a good one out of Max Drew's 15 points 33 is four boards for assists in a steal this was with the team healthy he also played a team High 36 minutes that's the number that I am grabbing onto is people are like why am I sticking with Max druce through the cold ones it's because he's playing 36 Stan minutes of ball game right now and it's not because once you guys are out it's because they just want to play him 36 minutes a game shooting 37% which is not that far off for him so it's possible could just have kind of a bad shooting year but I also have to assume that's going to get up to about 41  and if his role stays largely the same and you get the more like four plus rebounds for five rebounds and set of the lower number in Miami and the and the three assists or more because he's just out there so damn long that's how he stays as a fantasy value so I'm not moving on from him not until I see his minutes come down if that's starts to happen I'll change my predictions on him and then with Charis Levert  this is as close as he's been to efficient which is crazy because he's still shooting 40% from the field and 63% of the foul line but he's been kind of fun dare I say he also got 32 minutes off the bench calves have gone to a little bit of a tighter rotation he says while also noting that Tristan Thompson played 11 minutes in this ball game but some of that is Jared Allen still kind of getting worked up to his full bore I just I like I like that the calves are going Tom Thibodeau with their main guys these days if you're healthy and you're upright you're probably gonna play 35 minutes a game  sweet  lamelo finally woke up 30 points 10 boards 13 assists 5 3 pointers of Steel in a block it's not nearly enough to get him back where we need him to be but he's now up to number 70 and 9 cat  and it's shooting percentage is up to 34 but he was in the high 20s so this is a step in the right direction people are saying you could buy low on the Mellow ball I don't think you ever could buy low on lamelo because somebody drafted him at 11 what do you think they're gonna sell him for  now you think you're gonna go get him for a top 50 guide that was never gonna happen you have to understand how the person's brain works who drafted this player and reasonably so if you drafted to do the first round I don't think let me know is a first rounder unless you're punting field goal and maybe all so turnovers but somebody wants him for their team billed and they took him at 11 or whatever it was so they were gonna give up on him because he couldn't shoot because they were worried about that anyway  in any of that no real fantasy news in this ball game other than Terry Rozier sitting it out dealing with an injury Brandon Miller got the spots start and struggled against other teams first units but he'll be okay you're not gonna punt there he played 36 minutes that's again opportunity that's the number you're looking at  Kyrie's starting to wake up kind of coasted through the first couple of ball games then he had an injury now he's back and he's playing better he's up to number 27 per game and night cat he's still shooting just 44% from the field  but he's getting those blocks from the guard spot like he always does the threes will come up the field goal percent will come up don't worry about Kyrie how about Grant Williams though how many podcasts or feeds were talking about Grant Williams after his first two good ball games he's number 58 in nine cat right now which by the way look all I'll admit he's not gonna shoot 5 0 6 0  so we were kind of out in front of that one although I admit I was hemming and hawing on whether or not I actually wanted to make the move and hopefully some of you guys did it because he's been awesome lately  Derek Lively has also been awesome lately some of it  correlating to the injury to maxi klebba when kaliba comes back we might see Lively's minutes drop back down into the teens and 20s sometimes but right now he's vastly out playing Dwight Powell just on a what can he do out there with Luca and Kyrie basis and you know just from a fit standpoint it makes more sense  Tim Hardaway Jr the cooldown has come he still hit four three-pointers in that game yesterday but as the field goal percent starts to fall off a cliff you'll also see his role shrink a little bit  it didn't in this one but he's also shooting uh  what is he  15 for 15 at the free throw line so far that's all so coming down  we know what to expect with Tim Hardway I don't know why we do the dance every year people have been asking me on Twitter why aren't you higher than Tim Hardaway well because I've seen it  we've all seen it 30 times more  you go on a heater you know he'll 73 pointers a game for a week and a half and then he'll hit two a game on like two for 15 shooting  and it levels off to generally a little outside the top 100  Chrisley's finally got a win Desmond Bane ladies and gentlemen if you're wondering why I always high on Desmond Bane particularly while Jazz out it's this he's number 15 and nine cat right now and the Steels are probably a bit unsustainably high but the usage ain't I like it  no Xavier Tillman with an injury bismack biyombo played 26 minutes he's always a bit of a crapshoot now he was good in this one because you'll get blocks you'll get rebounds but he's not that great a field goal percent sort of a weird thing with him he's a bad finisher has been throughout his entire career but he's very good rebounder  good rim protector and Memphis may just sort of give that a shot he was a plus 18 in this ball game but you know who had the best plus minus on the whole Grizzlies  the guy we've been secretly watching out of the corner of our eye Luke Kennard  he was a plus get this  30  in 31 and a half minutes  it feels like he needs to be out there I know he's not a great defender  but  he has such a quick trigger from three and he is a top five three-point shooter in the NBA  that's just a guy that needs to be out on the court now what I don't know and it hasn't been all that clear is whether they've been in kind of ramp up mode for him or whether this was more of a spot play kind of thing but his minutes have gone up in every game he's played so far this year he played 15 in the season opener got hurt missed three ball games  then played 21 against Utah 27 in the first one the loss at Portland and now 32 in this one maybe some of it has to do with whether or not is shot is going down but a guy that if he plays 30 minutes a game he's probably gonna hit three or four three pointers a night so don't write him off I don't think you need to pick him up because nobody's gonna be  fighting you to go get Luke Kennard right now but just know that we're watching it and if the moment hits we want to be ready  Robert Williams heard his knee over on the Portland side that's why you was done after 11 minutes so let's hope it's not too bad but it is the one that wears a brace and I think that's the right  so not that DeAndre 8 and needed necessarily more opportunity at the center spot but now there's legitimately nobody coming for his minutes there's there's like no backup in Portland they may run small from time to time I mean they have to because they didn't play 48 minutes a game but so far this year 8in who was number 19 by the way is playing 30 minutes a game you could very easily see that get up to 32 or even 33 depending on how long time lord is out and how much they want to play Aiden who still not taking that many shots but 13 and a half rebounds a game I think does that lead the NBA right now he's behind us but that's second in the NBA and that's the number that maybe could even go up if his minutes increase otherwise I don't think we have to worry about much with Portland it's sort of the usual  crowd  and now we've gotten through a whopping 10 team so we better hustle a little bit if we're ever gonna get through this show we talked Phoenix already we'll be back towards Saturday hey while we move back towards Saturday quick reminder everybody find me on social media at Dan best briefs d a n b e s b r i s and if you're joining us late and watching live and many of you did please do take a moment to like  that's it just take a moment to like  ah first coughing fit of the show please take a moment to like  if you have a feel so inclined to subscribe and those listening on pods please all so do the same and I'll also remind all of you guys of our buddies at manscaped in a moment here but we're not gonna do that just yet I'll probably do that  maybe when we get through Saturn days game  yeah that makes sense I like that plan you don't like that plan too damn bad  so Philly now we got a couple of things here first of all rob Covington did get up to 18 minutes but we also just found out that Nic Batum is likely to make his Sixers debut tonight so what does that do to everybody  we don't know exactly  that actually playing relatively well right now which I kind of thought would happen this sort of magic of getting the hardened stuff out of their hair  Sixers are four and one  think I actually set on a what's I would vesin yeah I think I was on Vincent with Jill that he was like who do you think is gonna surprise in the east south like I think the Sixers are actually still gonna be pretty good  one thing I don't like on the Sixers right now is Anthony Melton's minutes which are not at all where we need them to be 25 minutes a game is enough for him if he's a big time usage dude but not if he's you know third fourth fifth sixth option type which is what he's generally gonna be in Philadelphia  steals are still fine but he's also shooting 28 and a half percent and that to me is why we need to hang on a little bit because it feels like once that number starts to get back up into the 40s which is where it is usually low 40s for him that everything else is going to be okay but he's ice cold he's forcing it things are not dropping so guys like Pat Beverley are getting more time Covington cork maaz all of these guys are getting opportunity while Mountain starts to sort this thing out but he's the starting shooting guard he's the guy that they want to be functional he's just been bad so far  Dr Charlotte already Indie what a pain in the ass Indiana Pacers are such a pain in the ass I don't know that there's a nice way to put it halliburton's gonna get his Myles Turner's gonna get his I believe Bruce Brown is going to get his his minutes are gonna be fine but you're gonna see the fantasy stuff sort of Bounce Around Just because like their days where he's gonna take more shots  one thing I think we do see out of brown is more rebounding and assists this season goes he still hasn't blocked his shot on the year so a lot of things for him should slowly tick upward and his opportunity is fine so that's where I'm not really concerned on the Bruce Brown front what I'd love to see is anybody else play themselves into a very consistent role now buddy hield is someone we've talked about as kind of a  playable stash because some games he is good and some games he's just sort of non-existent but the Pacers have made a pretty clear he's not part of their future there so the best thing we can hope for is a move for healed instead you know this was a better ball game for him great the next one might be good again  I don't think bennedict mathurin is a nine cat player nothing I've seen this year has may have had me move off of that position from last season  and then the hope I guess is that someone like maybe Jalen Smith can overtake Obi topping and get 2526 consistent minutes but nobody is so far and so it's just headaches City  Atlanta New Orleans this is a Jalen Johnson start we got some word  that the matchup like you if we're looking at the jail and Johnson said Nick bathing on a day-to-day basis it is pretty heavily built in who the opposing Wing is so they want Jalen Johnson to guard other teams better offensive players and Sadiq Bay then comes off the bench is more of a 3-point gunning specialist so in this one you had Brandon Ingram you had Zion on the other side to worry about so Johnson got the start  the Hawks tonight I think they play a team that doesn't have a great Wing well we'll get to that in a minute so maybe this might be a deep bass Dart night either way you're still holding both just to kind of see how this goes because again we're only two weeks into this thing they got off to a really good steals start but we could maybe even see us threes inch up a little bit Jalen Johnson has just been amazing no matter where he's been so there's obviously no move coming there and nothing else really to talk about because on Yakko Kangoo is great in limited minutes and I'm so sick of people asking if they should drop him he's number 50 guys in 22 and a half minutes a game in nine cat  five zero that's the rank white now he's not even he's not even blocking many shots yet  news on the Pelican side is unfortunate CJ McCollum has a small numeral thorax which is when the lung partially collapses due to air in the internal body space that then creates pressure against the lung this is something he's had before actually had one in Portland early in the season when he was traded to the Pelicans and he missed about a month and a half if I'm not mistaken what is this mean well it remains to be seen because when Brandon Ingram was out we saw some good games out of Jordan Hawkins then a bunch of guys were out and Dyson Daniels actually had the better ball game McCallum is the de facto point guard on this club so maybe that means Dyson Daniels gets the better shot at it but also does he get to take any shots what's his job gonna be out there just to hand the ball to somebody and get out of the way I need to see what these guys do minutes wise fantasy-wise before I make a move I don't have two roster slots to spare on Hawkings and dice and Daniels for a week while we figure out which of them if either is gonna be worth rostering so I think we can probably just watch one more game  this also helps herb Jones by the way while we're waiting on Trey Murphy  Lakers Christian Wood played 29 minutes in this game all the everybody of note on the Lakers was out as evidenced by the fact that cam reddish was starting Christian Wood and Max Christie were basically the only bench players that did anything at all jaxson Hayes played 11 minutes but he sprained his ankle sounds like they may get Taurean Prince back for the next one  but it's a it's an injury mess for the Lakers depth right now which isn't exactly what they wanted because that means they're going to have to play LeBron more at add Moore and the main guys are gonna have to log heavy minutes not good for their long-term Health but good from a fantasy standpoint because Austin Reeves woke up ads the number one player in fantasy basketball and you know LeBron's been playing more than they were hoping he had to which again I think is a number that probably starts to taper off if the Lakers can never get fully healthy  what does it mean for Christian Wood well he's a hold right now even if he wasn't as good in this ball game the opportunity was there and I think they like the big the twin bigs lineup most of the time  magic are an interesting sort we all collectively thought that moving or would have a better opportunity with Wendell Carter Junior going down but it was actually go go badass who played 26 minutes and at 10 points 10 boards and five blocks here had a good line in 19 minutes off the bench but 19 minutes isn't enough for us to reliably say he's going to be there  I think tonight is going to give us a pretty good answer to what to do with this club which might be nothing by the way because in this one go go got extra playing time because the Lakers are Big Anthony Davis is Big Christian Wood is Big LeBron is Big you know you need that size to deal with the front Court fogner Tough by the way but he's gonna get roasted on defense by some of those dudes in a way that may be baton they can kind of hold his own a little bit better against a team like the Mavericks however  that's a team that's just going to space it out the center is a rim Runner Luca Kyrie those guys are going to get you in a pick-and-roll out at the perimeter over and over and over again  do we see the magical small do we see Wagner and batad Zay splitman it's a little tighter this game I think is gonna answer a lot of questions on which of those players is the play if either  during the Wendell Carter Junior absence  Paolo said a couple of good ball games that's fine not a guy that I'm dealing with in nine cat Jalen Suggs 9.6 boards five assists a steal a little block if ever a shot could fall for him he'd really move up in the boards and I'm still very much into the Jalen's experience so far this year so I'll keep her eye on that one Cole Anthony  figured he would do a little bit more with Mark hell fultz still out and Gary Trent all so out but it just sort of  I don't know you know me I can't really bring myself to trust Cole Anthony he's a better head to head guy because he can score a bit and he can do a few things okay but just not enough things and then Anthony black was actually the point guard who got the start in this one but I'm gonna need to see more than that in 30 minutes if I'm gonna start getting excited about him  Boston the only note on this ball game is Derek white missed this one for the birth of his second child and Al Horford got the start  that was fun good to know by the way because basically that's telling us that if anybody misses the game for Boston Al Horford is the next man up  so be ready  to throw big owl on your big burger board  no Ben Simmons on the Brooklyn side this is a back-to-back they were just giving him a night off they're trying to keep his his actual back say back as many times I can and that sentence from getting messy this season otherwise no massive surprises we did get word over the weekend that Nick klaxon is dealing with a high ankle sprain they were sort of a little bit Coy about bringing us that information until they had to which means you can get more out of Dorian Finney Smith we thought this might be you know a week week and a half type of thing maybe it'll be a few he's been a really good feeling for clocks on the fantasy side I see no reason why that should slow down anytime soon so Neil got the fill in for Ben Simmons here shot the ball horrifically but if someone's when I should say been Mrs is next plan to day I think you can probably assume royale's the guy that gets the spots start for that one as well and cam Thomas warmed back up a little bit for this one he's a hold I do think everybody's job is going to change a little bit when cam Johnson comes back but I think we can also probably kind of cross that bridge when we get there  I kept saying that I believed in Malik monk over Davie on Mitchell As the deer and fox replacement Mitchell had a good first game with fox out but it was indeed Malik monk here who put up the big line so that's where I'm gonna continue to focus my efforts  Sacramento got blitzed in this game so probably just sort of throw the rest of the box score out and if your guy if you're King survived this one call it a baby size win for Houston the starters with the exception of Jalen Greene all put up nice and easy lines again Jalen green is kind of the one starter that I don't really trust on that side Dillon Brooks remains a crazy sell High I mean everything he's throwing at The Rim is going in right now good to see Barry Smith Jr he's been starting to get going a little bit  I still have trouble kind of trusting him on the day-to-day basis but also repeat the same thing we've been saying which is that his game does translate pretty well the fantasy if he can make a shot  Freddie Van Fleet had two blocks in this one I don't know when he's gonna start getting a whole bunch of steals because that's probably why you drafted him he's averaging only points 6 ball game that's a number that could go up by a full steal before this season's done what does that mean well so far so good really  for a lot of these guys  wear shengwen at 56 in nine cat Freddy's 52 but the steals haven't been there yet  shengwen is 56 but the blocks haven't really been there yet  who else who might forgetting well Dillon Brooks is  the Dillon Brooks thing is beyond absurd he's number 34 nobody's gonna fall off a cliff harder when he hits it steals will come down field goal percent comes down threes come down scoring comes down free throw comes down it's all a matter of time and you probably can't get much for him because everybody knows it so just ride it out man  Walker Kessler only 22 minutes against Rudy gobert and Karl Anthony towns that's a really big disappointment I thought this was going to be a game where he could kind of get loose a little bit he's number 155 in nine cat luckily still blocking Two Shots a game because that's the only reason that he's inside the top 200  I think you might be able to get Kessler for a top 80 type player right now and if you can I very much would Taylor Horton Tucker is torturing me because all I want to do is drop him and then every time I get really close to doing it everywhere he has a couple of decent ball games in a row people are very excited about him  I just can't get over the percentages man he has to be so good in other things to overcome the terrible shooting and bad free throws and while he's doing fine in steals and assists it's not enough  it's not enough to overcome the bad stuff so I have no problem with folks moving on from tht number 138 in nine cat the reason you would hang on is the expectation that at some point the Jazz are just like whatever tht do whatever the hell you want and then things get Wild and Woolly form and that would be a good thing  I feel kind of the same way about Jordan Clarkson  now you guys know that already  slow mo Kyle Anderson finally had a good ball game that got him back into the conversation now number 94 in nine cat and this is why you hang on because the minutes had been their stats just weren't right  everything else pretty normal I think Nazarite is a play by the way I think he's an ad in a play if I haven't said that or I haven't been clear about that before and I was read as a play  he just racks up fantasy stats and he does it so damn fast  the Bulls are in trouble  the Bulls are in trouble they're two and five  and I think I said it throughout the damn draft season is that  the one thing that scared me the only thing that scared me with the bulls  was them getting off to a terrible start  even an okay start would have been good enough but they have got to a terrible start  fantasy stats have been like enough to survive not great but like tomorrow is 71 because his shot isn't dropping and Levine is 120 because his shot isn't dropping and which I think has been the best of the three  no 76 he's right next to Damar basically because his free throws aren't really dropping all the vouchers has been fine by and large and a lot of the guys in front of him will kind of slowly start to fall back the fear is that this thing gets blown up early  of course on the other side of that like where is where do we think Demars gonna go where he's not gonna get to do a bunch of stuff so I'm not that worried about it like somebody trades for Hooch he's gonna get to play somebody trades for tomorrow he's gonna get to play same story for Zach LaVine so don't panic on these guys probably a Buy Low honestly not even just that they're gonna stay on the Bulls but like  they're not gonna shut these guys down in November  is the fear that the Bulls are awful all year nobody gets traded and they get shut down in late March because that's a long time from now  think you can probably Buy Low on some of those dudes  Denver we do have a storyline for the first time in a while and that's Jamal Murray with a hamstring pull Reggie Jackson immediately picked up his minutes he had 16 points and three assists the question of course now is can Reggie Jackson's Fantasy game translate to nine cat because this historically the answer has been not really unless he's been the focal point on offense which hasn't been the case since his early days in Detroit  but we've also seen having Nicolas as a teammate makes everybody good at Fantasy because everybody shoots freaking you know four five percent better when yokich is just getting them completely wide open looks all the time  see Aaron Gordon  c k c p c Michael Porter Jr see everybody that he plays with he just makes them so so much better that maybe we get an efficient not efficient but like less not efficient player or version of Reggie Jackson ah you pick them up in points leaks because he's probably gonna get some shots I don't know about nine cat I think you could wait and see how this next ball game goes for Denver before making the move there but you know if you really wanted to do it I sort of wouldn't stop you  and now let's play the game we play every week which is who played on Friday that didn't go over the weekend Cleveland we talked about Indy we talked about the Knicks and the Bucks there we go there's a couple of clubs we haven't talked about Josh Hart filling in for RJ Barrett played 36 minutes I'm more interested in what Hearts gonna do when he's back to coming off the bench  because he hadn't got up to 30 minutes in that role but if he does that he is an auto ad because we saw last year in New York Josh Hart and 30 minutes off the bench was like a top six top 65 kind of dude  and that's probably not somebody you want to leave on Waiver Wires especially now while he's collecting these fill-in minutes  so if you have Josh Hart try to wait it out if you don't he's probably worth sitting on again to kind of see how the RJ Barrett return goes for him  if you're hanging out with a manual quickly I don't think he's worth holding in nine cat Rodeo if you're in a head-to-head build where the stuff that he doesn't do at all doesn't hurt you as much meaning like usually a field goal percent negative doesn't get steals doesn't get blocks doesn't really pass all that much for a point guard type rebounds have been higher than expected if that type of stuff doesn't sink your team okay but you can probably find somebody better on the wire in most category League formats  I don't have too many questions about the bucks these days khris Middleton slowly ramping up the minutes  Dame bounced back Giannis will eventually get it figured out as well the big news was of course Brooke Lopez getting an eight block ball game on Friday and basically rehabilitating his fantasy value overnight he's up to number 73 and that's shooting 40% from the field which is the number we assume is probably gonna come up everything else for him feels mostly repeatable  I mean I have seen the rebounds come up from four also I just I think Brook Lopez is kind of near his floor right now  they did by the way switch up their defensive scheme in this ball game the Bucks went back into a drop that's really good for Brooke because that means everybody's coming right at him and he's gonna block a bunch of shots with that going on what other games who else didn't play over the weekend the Thunder didn't play over the weekend also the Wizards the Heat  and that's it all right let's get Thunder Wizards heat and we'll get this thing wrapped up  Chad holmgren's been amazing Lou Dort was the guy who got the extra stuff with SGA sidelined yeah you're not gonna shoot 75% on 63 pointers so no I'm not taking the lewd Dort plunge plus Shay actually got upgraded from out to questionable this morning so good news on the gilgeous Alexander front you may not have to lose him for another ball game which  I have a bunch of Shea shares in fantasy and that would really be helpful if he came back early  Washington sucks I mean they really really bad they're one in four so far they're offense has no flow there's no ball movement I don't know how they're going to fix that unless they let tyus Jones run the offense but guys like Jordan Poole  aren't I mean you know he wants to just have ball in hand now the pools credit he did have six assists in four steals in this game and he shot the ball better he was also a minus 21 the starting unit in particular was just getting throttled because they're bad  Daniel Gafford played 20 minutes heard his ankle again yeesh  you know the funny thing about Gafford is that everybody had sort of pegged him as being a injury-prone do but he played and I think 77 games last year and then he immediately gets off to an injury prone start to this season  hang on he's had some stuff sideline him ultimately I think his minutes do get up into that 25 to 28 range most nights and he just hasn't really been there yet so give it some more time before we Panic on Gafford  getting a lot of Denny Avia questions he actually left this ball game with an ankle tweak all so as you can see on your screen if you're watching with us he's been better than expected mostly because he's turned the ball over less than expected last year he had more ball handling duties at the end of the year and he turned it over at a ton so far this year is at 13 points 6 boards three assists but only one point two turnovers that's the good news for him I'm not really sure which direction OBD goes  I'm not big into Denny  despite being a fellow Hebrew I'm not that big into Deni avdija I need to see a like a sustained fantasy performance out of him who's been kind of impressive so far I think his efficiency probably comes down from where it's at which is and we have to go based on what we know in the past  I just need to see this team not look so clunky  and I guess the heater and okay defensive team but geez  on the Miami side I'm keeping one eye on Josh Richardson but maybe we should keep one eye on Duncan Robinson also because he had 18 points and three pointers so far this year Duncan's just been a 3-point streamer so far this year Josh Richardson has not looked healthy enough to be a pickup but if they kind of turn things in his Direction maybe he becomes an interesting play because you know historically Josh Richardson has a pretty good fantasy game  all so no Caleb Martin and Kevin Love was a healthy dnp so I don't know what the hell's going on with the heat front court maybe they're just sort of leaving it open for a hot hand thing is it going to be what I Smith is it going to be  Duncan Robinson  right now as long as it's not any of them consistently then we don't need to have any of them on our rosters consistently and that is your look back reverse chronological lightning round Style let's quickly take a look at what's going on tonight on Monday it's a lot by the way one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve game Monday holy sweet merciful Heavens that's a lot and you thought my voice was tired before  I do have to keep my voice in check  so there's a pretty real chance we're not going over the one hour mark in this show and I appreciate you guys all understanding but I'll probably do is zip through the chat room to see if there are questions that are broadly applicable as opposed to this sort of everybody gets their one question about their own team stuff  if you have questions about your own team that I'm not able to get to on podcasts  come hang out with us on Discord did I fix that by the way anybody that's in the chat room right now or even after the fact you can let me know that I fix the link in the show description finally  I try to I kept replacing it anyway I'm gonna throw the the link to our Discord in the live chat right now so anybody that's watching now or after the fact you should be able to see it I'll put it up on the screen as well that's a free Discord but again if you want questions answered you want the premium Discord which is actually the same link so I sort of a weird way for me to present it but you do need to get a fantasy pass and then let a mod know that you got that fantasy pass so that starts to just six bucks a month if you get the fantasy pass you let him out in Discord know they'll turn on the hidden rooms one of those is a 24/7 live chat where you can ask all of these questions  so fun fun fun for a tan tan tan they're Hungry Hungry Hippos I am at the end best person on Twitter so please do find me over there before we get to this Monday recap or Monday look ahead I should say and now let's plow through this and see if we have time for a question or two tonight what are we watching for tonight there's a lot going on this evening I'm gonna speed through it for the Wizards Daniel Gafford Danny abdiel we just talked about that for the Sixers were watching about new guy inclusion and the minutes for D Anthony Melton and again we just talked about a lot of this in the weekend recap but I just want to make sure everybody knows kind of what my eyeballs are on Mavericks Derek Lively he's having a party right now with no Maxi chleba Grant William's also he's been terrific but it does feel like that field goal present has to start to come down at some point  for the magic Jalen Suggs the mob Wagner Goldberg's they stuff going on Spurs not much really maybe can anybody step into the Devon for sale minutes but it's really a lot of like when can we get our Bi-Lo on the efficiency stuff  Pacers I mean we can just continue to hope and pray that eventually someone settles into a role but not yet as my kids like to say  for the Warriors does clay sit out the back-to-back so that would be a Moses Moody Burger board night  by the way Burger board that's shorthand for injury replacement streamer  fight isn't it more fun to say Burger board  Andrew Wiggins Draymond and CP3 that's the other stuff there for the Pistons Marcus Sasser Alec Burks all that stuff I don't I think Burks was doubtful last I saw for this one maybe he gets upgraded as we go so keep an eye on that  the Clipper's did we got the Clippers didn't play the whole weekend so we don't even need to talk about them but James Harden likely to make his Clippers debut man you talk about burying the lead on this show James Harden likely to make his Clippers debut this evening  hmm  that's a story and a half and it  Knicks we talked about Josh Hart Lakers it's Christian Wood heat Josh Richardson oh is Jimmy Butler still a Buy Low  I don't know he still ranked in the 70s so by that count he should not 62 by the way but he's only shooting 40% so you know that's coming way up the assists are gonna come with it so I would think the answer is yes to a Jimmy Butler by low but I I don't know what it would take to get him  I think if you can get Jimmy Butler for  maybe someone who you think is gonna finish like near 40 but is over performing  maybe that's the path there  kind of need to think on that one not a great discussion to have in your own brain in the middle of a live podcast  oops  bucks nothing Nets nothing Kings  you know the fox feeling stuff but I do still think it's Malik monk Rockets nothing Celtics if Derek white is back I think we just saw that he wasn't at shoot around but that might just be because he's traveling  hopefully nothing going on with his new kid you'd think that that would be the only reason that he would have to stay back with family but assuming Derek White's back then Al Horford is  back off the board Timberwolves we got a good one out of Kyle Anderson pushing him inside the top one hundred also Nas Reed has been inside the top 100  I you guys know that I'm high on the Wolves this year it's a weird way to phrase it but I did it I just think they're I think they're gonna have a really good season the Anthony Edwards growth cat being healthy just a year of like guys learning how to play together and I just I just feel like my calmly not that his fantasy value is gonna be amazing but I just think calmly provides exactly what that team needs from a stabilizing standpoint  for the Hawks nothing beyond the you know the typical Jalen Johnson saddiq Bey watch Thunder  no I guess whether or not SGA is going to play  that's the obvious one  the Jazz Walker Kessler the question I have on Walker Kessler and I typed this on social is is he an extreme by Lo meaning like could you get him for top 80 top 90 and then hope for top 30 or is he only kind of a medium sized by low which is could you get him for 80 or 90 but maybe his Target is only like 60 or 70 instead  either way I think he's a Buy Low the question is how far do you think he goes forward from where he is right now and then I'm just gonna keep fighting this mental battle with myself on whether Taylor Horton Tucker belongs on my fantasy team  I still think the answer is probably no but  we will see a Chicago nothing really they just I mean very few teams need to win more than they do Pals who steps up for CJ McCollum in game one that's a big one to keep an eye on Dyson Daniels Jordan Hawkins is it just more for herb to keep him well above the cut line what is the CJ Fallout because we're going to have a month plus probably to work on it  and hopefully we get a nice data point tonight and then the Nuggets we just talked about Reggie Jackson that's the that's the one lingering thing on that side  so that's your Monday look ahead that's your weekend interview we got about three minutes I'm going to scroll up to the top of the chat room and try to find holy moly there a lot of questions here I'm really sorry guys in advance letting you know again we are not getting to all of these questions because I need my voice for the second show I actually have my first play-by-play gigs of the basket ball season later this week so I just can't cook myself the way I did last week  so it's not gonna be great podcasting here for a minute but you guys are gonna watch me scan the live chat board for questions that I think apply to everyone here's a good one midsole good question do we expect Nick klaxon to miss another four weeks if yes is he a drop in a league that doesn't have an IR spot the answer is no to the drop part Nic Claxton was a top 30 fantasy player last year he's only played one game I think the expectation for me is that he does Miss probably another three or four weeks but you got a hold because top 50 players just don't grow on trees and typically the rule is if there's a top 50 player out there you stash for six weeks more than that you think about dropping because it could break your team but you gotta find a way to just hold on here and hope for the best  do I have any faith in Gary Trent for the rest of the year not as long as he's on the Raptors  what else we got here you guys again you're going to listen to me scanning  dead let's see do you drop Xavier Tillman in a points League or give him one more shot I'll do you one better Delonte I think I drop him in All formats  now that they have Beyond bow who they kind of trust and Obama's back I don't think that Tillman's gonna get minutes except against very large big men and all so when he is healthy  I'm thinking of benching D Anthony Melton until he plays better or should I drop I would prefer a bench on that one is Derek Lively worth a number one waiver claim  I don't know how many of you guys are dealing with this same problem but I'm going to say yes  I'm not gonna get into straight trades right now either but this is Jordan Poole for ogn and Nobby and and I would go OG on that one you guys know I'm not a big Jordan Poole guy  let's see here what do we got boop boop Badoo Max streus or Bruce Brown who do I prefer um  I'm gonna go through by a know so I think they both could end up in the 90 range but it does feel like Max could maybe push a little farther forward than that  let's see here what else we got in the chat room do do do do do do a lot of chat is Cam Johnson coming back anytime soon I would just set your mental clock to cam Johnson  coming back in like a week and a half  I mean set your mental clock to two weeks say expect him back by like a November 20th and he's back sooner than that then you just feel like you won all right let's see what else we got that could apply to everybody  um what's the outlook for tyus Jones on this very bad team that's a good question the hope is that they start to let him do more because he's the only guy that can actually distribute a basketball  my target for him is no longer top 50 with as bad as that team looks my target is probably more like top 80  so that's where we'll put that one  um do you prefer Keras Levert or Kyle Anderson in Roto that's gonna be Kyle Anderson  that's gonna be to Kyle Anderson on that one  Kyrie or Cade Cunningham this is Kyrie and it's not even in the ballpark  is Jaden McDaniels worth an ad and a 120 range last year which  if he gets fully healthy that probably is startable and head to head probably not in 12 team games cap rodol oddly enough it's like right on that area where the head-to-head you can extend your rank board a little bit farther so I'm going to say yes for head to head and no for Roto would you do quickly for CP3 yeah I'll take I'll take Chris Paul on that one Trey young or Tyrese Maxey rest of season this is very format dependent you know if you're head-to-head you're probably looking for those all those assists  for me personally we're going vacuum I prefer Tyrese Maxey I'm not a big tray young guy but there's also a little bit of sort of like a Bi-Lo sell High thing going on here because Trace probably not also gonna be outside the top 60 he will shoot better than 35%  so do they come together like Trey young somewhere near 40 and Maxi somewhere near 30 and 9 cat  that's why I think you're probably going kind of team build mode you might go trade and then he goes on one of his Mega heaters then maybe you try to move him for somebody that's even better  see if I can get water two more questions here  how do you feel about RJ Barrett I think he's horrible for nine categories and I think you should cast him off into the sun points you can hang on there's a second after this question that says should I drop him for Derek Lively category League's yes  coughing fit number two in the books what's a realistic expectation for Jalen Johnson rest of the season um  I mean you're seeing it man he stopped 70  he's terrific  it's amazing athlete and he's fitting in great better than I think we ever expected for right out of the Chute here  should I trade Kyrie Irving for Damian Lillard I would like the Dame side there's just a safety there that damn is gonna try to play anytime you can and I just don't know that that's the that's the truth on the Kyrie side  are there any good resources for how serious player injuries are well it's all about kind of reading the tea leaves because teams are not very good about reporting injuries these days basketball monsters player page you saw it as we were going through some of the box scores they'll give  educated guesses on how long they expect guys to be out but it's all about just following the beat reporters and team feeds and and understanding how long guys tend to miss with certain things so that's the best bet you got there  how are we feeling about Dennis Schroder I'm feeling that I completely whiffed on him he's number 51 in nine cats I fully expect his 3-point shot to fade on him but also his free throw percent is going to go up can the average nine assists for an entire season  questionable but he's very much a nine cat start all year long and I didn't know that he was gonna get inside the top 100 so  I will promptly eat this hat after the show is over  hey Dan it's Jordan Poole a bust wasn't he on my bus list or was he just on my I'm too afraid list  he's not gonna I don't think he's gonna get anywhere near where he was drafted I also think he's going to be better than he's been so far because he's shooting 75% at the free throw line and he's typically a very good foul shooter I also think you've seen a lot of blowouts artificially depresses minutes down to 17 and a half 16 shots a game was probably gonna go up to eighteen as the season goes so he'll be better than this but I don't think he's gonna be top 40  let's see anything else at the end here that applies to everybody is Robert William's a drop with this injury man if you don't have an injured list slot you might not have a choice let's wait until we get an official word on it and and then we'll have the last thing here's an interesting question at the end  oh wait let's see what about Trey Murphy well he's very much a stash now with the CJ McCollum stuff my big fear for Trey Murphy was that he'd come into a team that already had all three Gunners there but if one of the three usage guys is down that opens up you know Trey Murphy gets now eight to 12 shots instead of like six to nine that's a huge difference  and I think that might have to be the last one because I gotta save some voice for later and those are sort of the big broad questions hey come join me and Derek in the afternoon get your questions in that chat room we're gonna be covering weekly lineup stuff we're gonna be covering injury we're gonna look at streaming schedule this coming week there's a lot of really good stuff coming up on that second show today a lot of you guys joining us this might be one of the biggest live viewing audiences we've had outside
