welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  and to finish my coughing fit before I can start the podcast because I'm eventually going to die from this cough I feel pretty confident in that at this point  good Tuesday to you all I my voice is coming back it's getting there  I don't know maybe I'm a little uh  a little hyper critical of myself on that front most of you guys are probably listening and thinking he sounds fine  but I don't think so I I could hear my voice crack a couple times during yesterday's show which is just  incredibly embarrassing because huberty is hard to deal with  come hang with us in Discord by the way I think I'm going to finally get a live Discord Q&A going today  because I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do like an hour and five minute show today and do all the questions and so forth I really got to get my voice to come back all the way and at some point I'm gonna have to just take my foot off the throttle here because you know I did a show on Saturday I had four basketball games that I broadcast last week  the kids birthday stuff so you're like constantly yelling at both grown ups and children alike at some point I gotta just rest my voice a little bit  but I don't want to and so it just gonna continue to sound terrible forever  any who welcome to Fantasy NBA today I'm Dan bass thanks as always for hanging out with us  I got I think all of the stuff I wanted to get out on the socials before we went on air today so we got the the look ahead for tonight which is a big one 10 game Tuesday  yesterday just a four game Monday not a lot of stuff that that sort of broke the bank on yesterday's card but a couple of things and we'll go through that and then we'll kind of check the time see what's going on chat room is open for those that are watching live with us here I would encourage anybody to use that if you have a question if we have time we'll try to get to it  like computer just made a very loud noise that's  distressing  I don't know something feels different about today's podcast is is I I can't put my I can't quite put my finger on it but maybe we'll figure it out as we go I just I feel something feels weird today oh well I guess the only way to get through the weird is to just start talking about fantasy basketball that makes sense right let's  let's get things cooking here Boston beat New York 114 to 98 that's the way we get the party started this ball game was actually closer than this for most of it Nicks were tight until like early fourth quarter so that's why you saw kind of normal starters minutes for Julius Randle played 38 Jalen Brunson 39 Josh Hart played 43 minutes in this ball game which is notable  but also like sort of the opposite of notable because RJ Barrett was out with my grain so heart stepped into his starting spot and had a really nice fantasy line that's that's what Josh Hart does if he plays 30 minutes he posts fantasy stats 16 points 339 rebounds three assists one steal  but what we still don't know about the Nicks is and we've had like one game out of their last five or six were RJ Barrett has both been healthy and the game has been competitive and so I just still have no idea if Josh Hart is gonna play 30 minutes off the bench when the Knicks have a competitive game and RJ Barrett is healthy I think in the one game where those two things were the case Josh Hart did did play 30 minutes  but every other game it's been either a blowout so hard didn't get to 30 minutes and I don't know if that was the reason why honestly but he does tend to close games so he wouldn't get the last few minutes or RJ Barrett's been out and Josh got the start and then he played big minutes and we didn't have to even think about anything so  my take on this is heart you kind of have to hold for now  it might not be a long-term thing I didn't even think it would be this long but because of this run for the Knicks of non-competitive or non-bearing up taking longer to figure out what the hell Josh Hart's going to be this year then I expected it would I mean where three weeks in and we still sorta don't know  all so notable Emmanuel quickly quieter games kind of alternating good games and bad games which in my mind makes him a head guy you could probably play but I would not use him until a nine cat because there are too many negatives  that outweigh the few positives where on the head-to-head side if there's something that you're punting that he's not good at then he very easily makes the cut for someone you could use that's the difference really between the two formats in my eyes in addition to the whole like injuries don't hurt you as much in Roto in terms of guys you're playing you know quickly is an easy one like if you  if you're punting blocks his value goes up if you're punching steals his value goes up if you're punting field goal percent his value goes up all these little things that you can tweak on the head-to-head side that don't really creeped in the same way with Roto you're generally attacking eight or nine to oftentimes at this point in the year I'm attacking all nine categories and just kind of seeing how it's going  Head to Head perhaps not so much  so quickly to me doesn't make sense in Roto and  make sense in some head to head builds not so much in others  on the boss inside  basically nothing we've seen Derek white cool off a little bit after his Torrid start he was a top 25 guy after the first week and a half now he's at about top 50 because not surprisingly the scoring has come down we knew that wasn't going to hold all season long not with the amount of guys they've got there but he's still averaging two threes a steel and a block so four of what Brew calls cash counters the counting stats that are really cash in because they're the low volume ones where each one is really critical  he's I mean he's settling back probably towards where he was going to be so I don't think we should be too surprised Sam housers been on a ridiculous 3-point tear he's hit like 65% of his threes over the last five or six ball games I forget the exact number on Hauser but right now he's a very good threes streamer because he's averaging basically three a ball game and after a slow start to the year where he hit zero one and two he's gone 513354  and he's shot under 50% during that stretch one time  it was the game actually where he had three three-pointers was not the one where he hit one  his minutes I don't think we're ever gonna be high enough for it to really count and you know he's not gonna shoot 60% from downtown all year so know the answer is like should I start this guy daily know you shouldn't and unless somebody gets hurt like Jalen brown or Jayson Tatum goes down then you start to think about all right maybe there's enough there for him because Boston's going pretty tight rotation this year he only played eight guys yesterday  then if he could you know creep up into that like 26 minutes per ball game you'd say oh well now I'm getting reliably three plus three pointers I don't have to worry as much about the sort of random fluctuations also if he gets cold this is just something to start a file in the back of your brain for later you don't have to worry about it right this second unless you're in a tight threes battle and you want to throw Boston players at your problem  Wizards and absolute tank job yes yesterday they LED this ball game by a dozen points with about four minutes to go and they got outscored 16 to nothing down the stretch and it was a total throwaway because  the Wizards just didn't put the guys back in the ball game that had built the lead tyus Jones didn't get bonus run he was having a really nice game actually but 31 minutes for him they decided to just go ahead and let Jordan Poole continue to Chuck away Kyle kuzma  is very much a sell high so someone was asking me why kuzma is a sell high and it's because  he's shooting 49% right now  on 20 shots of all game if that number starts to Teeter the whole thing goes right down the toilet and historically he's been a lower field goal percent guy and free throw percent his numbers are just higher than you'd expect now do I think he'll be better than he was last year yeah by a little bit because he'll be doing more this season and he's another guy where head-to-head makes more sense than Roto but Roto he's an easy sell high and he's already down to number 83 so the the shines coming off a little bit but after a 34.9 you could probably get something for him I think if you can get top 80 back for kuzma I would do it  maybe you could even aim a little bit higher because he's scoring a lot of points  Jordan Poole I mean at least he had four defensive stats in this ball game so that pushed his season mark back up to number one and 164 but he's not even making his free throws right now  and he's acting out in the Huddle and  is Turtles are high is the cysts are not he had six yesterday which is better but four turnovers that's just one and a half to one sister turn over ratio least he got 16 shots up so that's something  but they left all these guys in the ball game that were just getting roasted by Toronto down the stretch and they didn't put the guys back in that word that were dunking in this game Denny avda should have played more ties Jones should have played more Daniel Gafford really should have played more  Gafford and tyus Jones were the only write regulars that had a plug positive plus minus in this game by the end why do we think that is well because they weren't there went Toronto was going on a crazy run she was just like ah whatever  by the way  let's talk about  kulele  and I looked it up and I listened to it and I checked myself about 15 times on this and I had it right yesterday  pronunciation guide best briefs  and shout out to Josh Lloyd who  um hit me up via DM he probably didn't want me to talk about this but I don't care maybe he doesn't carry either so Josh hit me up by by DM after the show was just like you had it right like okay yeah cuz like I Googled it and I tripled my self  and the issue is  that his last name is getting a merkin eyes  which tends to happen so a lot of people are calling coulibaly which is not the French pronunciation that's more of an American thing cool a bali is how we do it here in the States but in the Wizards media guy the accent actually is on the last syllable believe it or not so it actually could believe is the correct pronunciation of his last name now that's impossible to say a bunch of times on a podcast so we're just gonna call him Cooley you want to really americanize it that's Cooley  that's my guy Cooley  and people are giving me a hard time I call them a speculative add after the weekend which apparently was not enough  uh juice  I mean the word ad is right there in it I know I said speculative  but basically that was just my way of saying I'm not sure that this sticks throughout the entire season he's a good steals Guy we know that about Cooley I'm not I'm serious I'm gonna call him Cooley and it's gonna drive people insane and that's kind of half the point  because again could I believe is gonna be kind of hard to say a bunch of times  but  first of all he missed his free throws  the rebounds were good I don't think the scoring is going to be all that much I just I think we're getting wrapped up in this idea  that he can average like three steals a game which just doesn't happen  his steel rate is going to be very good I think we can safely say that he has seven and his last two ballgames where he's played like starters e minutes and then earlier this season he had a few games where he played starters he minutes and one steal and then three Steals and then zero and that's just the thing like  what happening one time we get sort of lost I think in the clouds about what could be  and that's why I said speculative  because I'm not convinced that he's going to be able to do enough nightly on this team to Warrant a roster spot now you guys know I love steals I mean it's why I always into Dillon right who's gonna be out for a little bit and that's part of the reason why  Cooley is getting a little bit more playing time these two ball games it's not coincidence too long right goes down  below gets more playing time  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the

y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  okay fine let's we can even ignore that for a minute if you guys want  20 points the last ball game how often do you think he's gonna hit the 20 boy barrier this year  three four times maybe the whole season  10 feels more attainable that's what he got in each of the two games around the 20  but that's just the thing like  if we want Dylan Wright that's probably our Target  but I don't know that this kid can shoot free throws he's at 53% so far  he shouldn't 50% from the field and 44% from downtown which I don't know I mean I'm gonna go ahead and just take a wild stab in the dark and say 44% from downtown probably also doesn't hold there's kind of a magic of small sample size things going on here where he's I think you the numbers right I think he's nine for his last 15 from 3-point land and because he just hasn't taken that many that's weighing heavily on the overall numbers so I get it there is an appeal  because the defensive stats could be really interesting he's averaging almost two a game about 25 minutes per ball game maybe that holds all year maybe he really does hold close to two defensive stats per ball game  is there going to be enough of the other stuff to get him over the hump maybe but I really don't think it's nearly as locked in stone as some of the folks on Twitter are yelling at me about Dan you need to be yelling about you need to be yelling a lot about  you need to be louder  I actually don't think I need to be louder I think I'm exactly the right loudness quotient on this because I think there's a chance that it works I like defensive stats you guys know that about me I'm a punt Points Guy in a lot of ways and so he could fit in a build like that but do I think he's gonna be inside the top 1 0 9. 0 0  so that sounded like I was sort of talking down on the whole situation no I'm just explaining why I had the word speculative in front of it because I don't think it's guaranteed some of these times it's like look I think we can start this guy like today  and then I want and that's not a place where I'm gonna put speculate that's an ad and start  googly I don't know  I think there's a there needs to be a little bit of a of a slight hesitation at the very least  Raptors big come from behind win against a team that was actively trying to lose the ball game I am  a little bit worried about yaakov pearly at 136 and 5 and only 24 minutes pressure is a chewa is back he played 19 minutes  which I mean he's probably gonna get at least that most ball games  they were trying different lineups a little bit here trying to figure out what was going to stick turtle was a minus 14 again I know it's just one ball game but yaakov is having a very bad season so far he's number one and 160 some of that's because he's shooting 41% at the free throw line but a lot of it's because you only playing 24 and a half minutes of ball game instead of high 20s like we were hoping for so the blocks are not even at once steals are at 0.6 those are numbers that we need to get up for him really need that free throw to come up from 41 to get back into the high 50s something like that so it's not quite as brutal  would I buy low I probably rather just leave it alone and if I have Turtle which I do on one or two spots I'm just gonna sort of ride it out and hope for the best  also I feel a little bit less stupid right now because Dennis Schroder is coming back to Earth he's still very much a roster and start guy so I don't want this to be like it's not like a rubbing salt in a wound thing  but a lot of this stuff with that was sort of over his head you know two plus three pointers per ball game one and a half steals per game that's stuff is all coming back down to more like what we expected the assists are still at almost eight  I maybe that holds all year you know even in a bad ball game yesterday he still had six assists his team shot the ball okay so it's like you could put it on that  the turnovers were all very low for a guy that was doing a lot of ball handling I think maybe we're getting closer to where he's gonna end up  15 and 8  could probably still come down a little and so top 50 Schroeder is probably done and that was when I was like oh my God I really missed on this one but as it turns out he is now slowing he's down to number 84 in nine cat and if he ends up near the edge of the top 100 I would still say that I was too low on him but at least I wouldn't have missed by very much at that point  Bulls lost to the Bucks 118 109 the final score there no Jay Crowder on the Milwaukee side for a while now we'll start on that side because there's more news on the Bucks Crowder being out the question was kind of all right where does this extra run go and yesterday's ball game and went to Pat connaughton and a little bit extra Bobby Portis  that was sort of the let's say the more significant differences but yeah slightly more significant difference is  I don't know why the Bucks can continue to start Malik Beasley other than like this idea that they need more floor spacing  that's something that maybe could change over time  because he was all a net negative in the starting five was particular was kind of bad and yesterday's game Dame was in that negative all so he was terrible coming back from injury what do we do about this information I think you can probably add Bobby Portis and the nice part is that it doesn't have to just be because Brook Lopez is trending down because Brooke was actually okay he missed his free throws in kind of a weird twist and yesterday's ballgame otherwise you mostly got what you wanted to out of him which was a couple of Threes three blocks better field goal percent and then  where the missed free throws came from I really have no idea but now he's shooting 67% at the line and still only 40 and a half percent from the field Brook Lopez let me just staring down the numbers it's a pretty clear by low  do I think he's gonna get into the top 20 top 25 like last year no I never thought he was going to do that I we all figured he would take some kind of step back but right now again if you just adjust for the percentage is even if you don't ratchet up the usage he still jumps 2030 slots and gets himself pretty far out in front of ADP so I like Brooke Lopez if you can get him for the right price which probably anything beyond top 80 would be right price for me I think you should add Bobby Portis if he wasn't at it already it does seem like he's gonna be a bit of a winner in this J Crowder thing Pat connaughton not I don't think I'm doing the pack content in 12 team I know he had eight boards five assists that was nice but I just it doesn't feel like he's gonna get to do enough every ball game he profiles probably more as a 14 or 16 team where guy right now I have them on my 30 deep team so that's been a nice little bump here with the Crowder situation which I needed because Alex Caruso's got a mucked up till but that's what's going on in Milwaukee what's going on in Chicago is almost nothing DeMar DeRozan and Zach Levine had terrible shooting games and when they do that together there's just sort of no chance Chicago's gonna win Levine shot 26% to Rose and 21 those guys combined for 31 points on 33 shots why  much had another good one though and he got 24 Shots in that ball game you want to talk about being excited about a vooch usage rate he's inside the top 40 now after a slow start so all is right in the universe I guess if you want to put it that way let's keep moving here oh Kobe white at 16 points he only played 26 minutes though and Patrick Williams had a good ballgame but I don't care right now Cleveland in Sacramento as we come to the end of our four game Deal Max Drew's 195 and 4 with a steel 5 3 and 7 out of 12 shooting number 55 in nine cat leaks as his field goal percent now trending up to where we thought it would be he's now at 43% for the season which I think is kind of around what we thought it would be overall he continues to rebound he had five more yesterday he continues to get assists just by being on the floor he played the second most minutes on the team again just behind Donovan Mitchell  what's not to like  me while Jared Allen is on a minute's cap which is super annoying I mentioned on a previous show that maybe you could  buy low on him but all so it would be complicated because we don't know how long he's going to be on this minute thing  so and I could be two weeks it could be a month it could be whatever  that makes it a little bit of a nerve wracking Buy Low and the shame of it is is that I did draft him in a couple of spots because I figured you'd get Jared Allen like 55 or 60 that's kind of a no-brainer but if we're going to lose the first month and a half to minutes crap  that's really annoying  so we're gonna need to get him going here in the next little bit I don't know how long it's gonna take but he's outside the top 100 right now and presumably that means you could get him on the cheap because nobody knows how long the minutes cap is Gonna Last and then Darius Garland who I mean look he's gonna be better than he's been he's number one 23 mostly because he's at almost five turnovers a ball game but also  he was probably a guy that was getting overdrafted this last year just because he gets a sis  you know Garland was fine last year I wouldn't call him special last season  22 points 8 assists is pretty good it's pretty darn good 1.2 steals two and a half three pointers on 46% like all that stuff is decent  his deals are actually really high right now but the scoring is down by four the assistant down by almost two  he's he's three-pointers isn't dropping yet which is notable but like here's the important part  I don't really know what people thought was gonna change with Garland he was number 50 last year it felt like that was just gonna be his role you know I played 35 and a half minutes of ballgame 22 and 8 like what was gonna improve for him as long as Donovan Mitchell was there so this is a guy getting drafted in the mid-30s mid to late 30s  that didn't really have much of a chance of getting to the mid-30s per game without some sort of weird you should twist  so again if you want to call it a Buy Low I'm good with that  but you got to be able to get him for something deeper than top 50 like if you can get Darius Garland for a 75 range guy you probably do it  anything cheaper than that you definitely do it but just understand where a guy is likely to get to  now the good news is that he's been bad so far to get to the top 50 he's going to have to be better than that for a while so I mean maybe that means he isn't he doesn't even get all the way to that range  maybe you just get top 50 ish like from that from whenever he turns it on to the end of the season  so overall rank word and reflect that but maybe you'd have him for that good part so to speak  Carousel bird had 21 and was pretty efficient actually in doing it I continue to be very surprised by this but he's inside the top 100 and he needs to be started until further notice and last week  seven days ago five days ago three days ago whatever you want to call it I yelled and yelled and yelled about Keegan Murray being one of the biggest bios of the early season and now he's not anymore so two gigantic ball games he can marry now launched himself up to number 50 overall in nine cat he was at like 120 while shooting 34% or something silly like that  I don't know that 2.2 defensive stats holds all year I don't know that the big rebounding numbers hold all year but everything else with him is pretty repeatable  because it does feel like he's going to score more it also feels like the field goal percentage is going to continue to tick up  when it all levels off could he end up between 50 and 80 yeah absolutely so the Bilo went to his shot we missed that one if you didn't do it already we had our brief chance to try and and  now that's over demonic bonus continues to have a really weird free throw shooting star to the year I doubt you can get him for cheaper Than People drafted him but you should think about it Kevin herters on a little bit of a mini heater right now this is gonna be the herder path he's number one oh seven while he's heating up he'll go on a stretcher he's top 60 for a couple weeks and he'll go on a stretch where he's top 150 for a couple of weeks we saw it a lot last year and I think he ended up somewhere like near 90 something my guess is that he ends up a little bit back of that this season some of these early season numbers I know Darren Fox is back for this one but his early season numbers have a little bonus usage because Foxx missed whatever it was a week and change with with his injury so herder  ride it I guess ride him while he's hot and then maybe try to sell the end of the heater if you can figure out when that might be easier said than done or you just treat him like Tim Hardaway Jr and  kind of go add drop mode or start sit mode you get my drift Malik monk was still decent in this one minutes are going to Trend down now with Fox back in monk wasn't playing 30 minutes a game when when Darren was in the Ballgame he did enough here because the the turnovers were low and he hit his shots and his free throws I am skeptical that monk can be a top 100 play when this team is healthy number 136 on the season overall right now  and to me that feels like much more reasonable Target for him so games cap that would be a tough one to drop in the mix but again like these guys have certain head-to-head skill sets like monk if you need assists some scoring typically is a really good foul shooter  you can kind of wring that out of him even if again if you're attacking all nine categories should probably doesn't make sense  and that's yesterday which again just a four game cards we were able to move through it at a slightly better rate before we get to tomorrow I got to tell you guys about some of our partners on the show and I've done a better job now of keeping oh the lawn mower is just Out Of Reach hold on I think I can do this without really disrupting the podcast too much hold on hold on oh okay I think I got it this is bad for folks that aren't watching it's bad for folks that are watching it's really bad for folks that are listening this friends is the lawn mower 5.0 Ultra box that it comes in and it flips open like this oh yes the front flips open revealing the lawn mower 5.0 so Sleek so futuristic here's some here's some brushes that come with it that can the for trimming this we see if I can pop this out that's just actually converts it into a an electric razor so if you didn't want to get the handyman which I showed you guys last week you can do it with that and then you guys can see it on YouTube but I'll explain it for the listeners there's this little flap here  you pull it up and it reveals what's going on underneath which is the charging implements and on the back of the cover a travel bag look at that that all comes together in this lawn mower 5.0 Ultra and I think I mucked up the things I'm not sure I can put it back together here oh there we go I did it a lot more 5.0 Ultra  body hair trimmer  they make such a deal about saying groin it doesn't have to be groin it's just a body hair trimmer and it's great and here's what we got going on in the back I don't know if you guys can see this on the YouTube screen or fiddle Focus tight enough but  it's got a two  click LED light built into it it's waterproof ah  60 Minutes of runtime a travel lock so it doesn't use up all of its batteries when it's in some in your suitcase or whatever  it's got this constant RPM Motor that helps the blade from slowing down as the battery drain so it'll just hit and then it'll go so you don't get that like at the end which pinches and

subscribed yet also chat room is open if you want to hit it I think we'll probably have some time for questions  because they just weren't that many games to go over yesterday  here's what's coming up tonight a lot of things actually to go over tonight by the way again you can find me on Twitter at Danbury what's going on tonight the Pacers  well I continue to have a fever dream that the Pacers will give anyone not named Bruce  Tyrese or miles consistent minutes but I'll know that they almost definitely won't  for the Sixers I I got out in front of my skis on Twitter and I was like oh boy it's Nick boom time and then I remember he's out for the front end of the back to back hopefully he's back for the second half its listed as personal reasons right now not rest maybe they had to do that to avoid any kind of fine  I have no idea but but tomb looks amazing with the Sixers they seemed thrilled to have him because they haven't really had a glue guy like that before and with Kelly oubre out for a while which again sad story but  anyway um  but to him seems like he's in a great spot oh by the way before we get to the rest of this stuff coming up tonight we did have some news from earlier today Devin Booker is expected to play tomorrow for Phoenix as is Bradley Beal so they'll have all three of their guys for the first time this year Trey young is out tonight we'll get to that in a minute Gordon Hayward just got downgraded to questionable tonight due to a hamstring situation Brandon Miller on Charlotte also questionable this is all Breaking by the way while the shows going here and as of about 25 seconds ago keldon Johnson and Trey Jones on the Spurs each ruled out for the Spurs game in Oklahoma City tonight so that's going to create a weird little pocket  and I am very curious to see what happens when certain guys are out on the Spurs because I don't like the efficiency from a lot of the main dudes but there are guys waiting in the wings that are a little bit better from that standpoint so like if trade Jones is out does that mean we finally get it onto Graham sighting does it just mean more Jeremy Sohan at the point Kelvin Johnson being out you know we saw with the cell out that was Malachi Branham time is that going to be a thing I'm probably not gonna play anybody but it is a good thing this is the time of year where we're collecting all the data to use later on these we call him Burger board streams but the injury replacement guys all right let's get back to this thing D Anthony Melton feels like he almost has to be productive now with no oubre and batam out  like how could he not be useful in this one for the heat Kyle Lowry I'm assuming he's back here because it's not a back-to-back right he don't play tomorrow Miami plays tonight  whoopsies let's get this real quick yeah they don't play tomorrow so I'm assuming Kyle Lowry's in and so now the question becomes is it Lowry is a Duncan Robinson is it Jaime hot guys who picks up for the Tyler hero stuff I would lean to Lowry but you know like I guess we can't know for certain on that front Hornets miles Bridges was going to be the main thing here but now with Hayward and Brandon Miller game time decision he type of stuff there's a whole lot of stuff to keep track up with thorns that we simply can't know the answers to in the morning which is when we're talking right now  for the ox Trey young being out for personal reasons I believe it was the birth of his second child if I'm getting that right Deontay Murray should go pretty big Bogdan book zdanowicz is someone that I was expecting to drop off but this won't be the day that it happens now and that's basically it for the Hawks or the Pistons I have a number of things I'm wondering about so Alec Burks Jaden Ivy came back immediately Marcus Sasser and Killian Hayes became not playable but how does that whole thing shake out do any of those four guys stay above the cut line is it out of four is it one two out of four seems like Alec Burks is gonna have to be the guy because they badly need somebody to score not named Cade Cunningham but we'll see  I believe Jalen Duren was already listed out for this ball game and if that's the case Isaiah Stewart typically moves above the cut line even if he's still playing power forward it's just that now he's alongside Marvin Bagley who's not an all-world rebounder instead of Jalen Duren  Bagley is not someone I would stream in Roto you could probably do it and head-to-head if you really wanted to but like you wouldn't be that upset if you missed it  Spurs was gonna be nothing until we just had trade Jones and Kelvin Johnson ruled out so put that again roll a decks it it's under my guess is that we're running out of time to sell on Lou Dort because they're just no way he averages 2.6 defensive stats on 582 splits  I guess the free throw is good stick but he has at least three categories that are about to plummet and when that happens it's going to be a precipitous drop so just make your move if you can  or Lando I feel like I need to put Jalen Suggs on every list but at this point he's way inside the cut line so just roll their the real thing with the magic is does Jonathan Isaac ever get near 20 minutes these gotten as high as 17 20 is amazingly enough for him because his Fantasy game is about as good as anybody on the planet  but his body is about his terrible as anybody's on the planet so we got to see if his body can withstand 20 minutes and we talked about this with Alex Caruso he's very different very different basketball player very different fantasy stuff when he plays 30 minutes he gets hurt sure enough he played 30 minutes in the Bulls last game and then he missed or three games back or whatever it is and then  swamp womp womp  they Caruso gets moved we'll see what happens with Chicago be nice if he got moved to a team that would play him a whole bunch but it feels like he just have the same role somewhere else anyway  Nets not much really here it'll Ben Simmons is out but the Dorian Finney Smith fill in for Simmons was not as fun as the Dorian Finney Smith fill in for Nick Clacks and so I think we can probably leave that alone  Mavericks I really just want to know if Derek Lively the second is going to have enough consistency to remain on rosters like should we hang on and see how it goes all year or is it gonna bounce around so much that  it's gonna be more ahead bigger headache that it's worth that's the direction I'm kind of tilting right now but nothing is set in stone there Pelicans I need to know if herb Jones is getting back in there I don't think we have an update on him yet  if he's back in that changes a lot for the pals because with him out Dyson Daniels has been getting starts and he's been very good in the starting lineup  I've cooled on Jordan Hawkins I think he's more of a schedule stream kind of play but I'm also saw herb Jones get dropped in a few spots maybe because folks didn't know how long he was going to be out but he's available in a couple of weeks I'm in which is really surprising given he's number 51 in nine cat right now I would say pick him up he's questionable for tonight is the latest news on herb  it's really weird I know I don't know what the hell he's doing on some Waiver Wires but folks get frustrated fast and I guess that sort of the only answer I can come up with their  for Portland Skylar Mays for talking about streamers for the Jazz I you know Rodeo I don't think I would start a George head to head you can but he does belong on rosters right now to kind of see how this thing shakes out there very much a better ball Club when he's running Point as a pose to whatever the hell you could call Taylor Horton Tucker doing out there a Clippers same stuff Harden how do they settle how long is this this chemistry thing gonna take  but it's been real bad so far  and I'm almost now the problem is that I have a number of Clippers on my roster already but  I'm feeling greedy so I kind of hope that it sucks for like another week because if it really sucks for one more week in clippertown you could probably get hard and Kawaii  for crazy discounted rates and then I would end up with them on every single team I have that's one of those ones where I would like pause my family life to go buy low on dudes if they're terrible for another week and you could start getting hardened and Kawhi Leonard for like outside the top 6090 like 60 and one of my last drafts that one I don't think I could ever get him any cheaper than that but like Kawaii you probably had to take in the 20s  maybe he fell near 30 in some spots  if you could get him cheaper than that right now I mean  good grief nuggets Reggie Jackson's the only thing to track their Timberwolves nothing at this point I think we basically know what they are warriors I mean that whole team is got off right now besides Steph Curry and that just can't last all year not all of these guys just magically turned terrible overnight someone's going to bust out of a slum I have no idea which one it's going to be but like right now no one on the Warriors can do anything  Clay is shooting 42 and a half percent and his usage is way down Chris Paul I think is under 40% right yeah is it 37% that's got to come up he's pretty damn close to being fantasy valuable even at 37% and then Andrew Wiggins is off the map he's been so bad  someone has to get better  but who  Grizzlies you know what I haven't mentioned is Jerry Jackson Jr by low at number 46 it feels like he probably is  his scoring is up with no jaw but his defensive stats are like half of what they were last year and feels like that's going to Trend in the right direction  I am trying to remember I think I got some questions about  the hell was it on Memphis uh Jacob Gilyard he played 24 minutes in the last ball game I I'm not yeah  show me like a consistent 301 minutes and maybe I'll think about it but even then it's this is all time stamped to Jaws Return  do we dare try bismack biyombo against Anthony Davis that feels like a bad idea Lakers it all comes down to whether or not LeBron plays these questionable right now  this is an in-season Tournament game so if he's good enough to go I assume he'll go  if LeBron goes I think you probably leave all the streamers alone if he sits you could probably try really hot tomorrow or possibly cam Johnson or Cam reddish or maybe even both  so it all comes down to Braun in that one  it's a little bit of good news in Lake town yesterday it sounds like Jarred Vanderbilt his ramping up towards a return I don't think he needs to be rostered for Fantasy purposes  I guess you never know a bunch of other guys get hurt and that would change but he'll slot in and and make the team better at the very least  and that is your look ahead for tomorrow so that means at 42 minutes again I said I'm not going to an hour we're not going to go to an hour and Today's Show I'm gonna try to lightning round these questions as best I can so folks sit back relax it's 9:57 a.m. Pacific Time right now if you're questioning is in the chat room I might try to get to it if it's not in the chat room right now I don't think it's going to happen  okay okay  by the way please do come find me on social at Dan bass press so that we can hang out even after the show is over yes that's very important like subscribe subscribe subscribe grab that so important forget the liking I need the subscription that's more important  points League Maxi your dear and fox give me Tyrese Maxey  choose two out of Levert Melton avdija keyonte George I think I answered this question on yesterday's show or maybe it was a slightly different smattering of humans  Melton and what did I say yesterday Melton and  melting off give me about the out of those guys  Franz Wagner and Jaylen Williams or Jared Allen and Clint capela  boy that's very different skill sets  my strict ranking  I think I'll go France and I think Jalen Williams gets a lot better as the season goes we haven't seen him get any steals yet and that's still gonna happen but this I mean this is like relatively close because I think Jared Allen probably gets up inside the top 50 Clint capela is  pretty close to top 50 already right yes 68  think he might be the highest ranked if anybody on that board I'm not a big France Wagner guys number 98 I don't think he's really gonna get a whole lot better than that this year but I am a big Jalen Williams guy so that's maybe where this thing screws it up he's eighteen point eight steals I think that gets up to like one point three one point four everything else has been great for Jalen to this point um  yes it's too it's too close to call too close to call  go with the stats you need  Bradley Beal or Tobias Harris  not a question we thought we were going to be getting before the season started I believe it or not think I'm going to bias Harris he's number 32 he was a top 40 show but hardin's gone now  is Jonathan Isaac a speculative ad looks like he'll hit 20 minutes tomorrow or the next game does it look that way though because we have no idea at these actually gonna get over 17 minutes you guys know my take if he hits 20 I pick him up on the spot  cam Johnson and Jordan Pooler on the waiver wire who would offer a better return rest of season Gordon Hayward would be the drop I like cam Johnson better but between those guys just safer  need to point guard while Jamal Murray is out should I go Jalen's or Trey Jones Trey Jones Is Now hurt so that made my answer a lot easier give me Jalen Suggs who's not really a point guard though Trey Jones will beat him in his assists but just like General overall ranking and opportunity right now you're going sucks  would you drop Derek white from Mitchell Robinson I would not  would you trade yakka Turtle for Wendell Carter Junior in a points League I want to stash Wendell and I are to pick up  Cooley  ha  also we're very about turtles minutes so points League yes I think you can go Wendell in that one category League know  should I drop any of the following for Cooley Ben Simmons Derek Lively the Anthony Melton Gordon Hayward Markell fault so I think you could probably get away with dropping Derek Lively  Scotty Barnes for Giannis well um  this was pretty straightforward are you punting free throws because if so then this answer is a resounding yes  and if it's not then I think this answer is a resounding no  I'll write now Scotty Barnes is better than us even if you are punting free throws it just feels like at some point you honest is gonna pass him in that format but if you're not then Jana says almost no chance of catching him  analysts keep saying Dame just needs to get adjusted more and I agree in some ways but he just can't shoot it all at his confidence on the ball it's just gone I'm sad  I don't think it's confidence is gone I think he's playing a little bit hurt and he's trying to figure out how he fits here but you know he's not gonna shoot 37% for an entire season so I'm inclined to agree with the the analysts in this one the place where I disagreed with analysts is that people like always just gonna do what he did in Portland there's just no way I mean he was a one-man Wreckin Cru last year there was nobody in Portland to help him for long stretches and now he has Giannis and like Middleton isn't even healthy yet so his usage is always going to take a pretty big hit he's probably gonna end up in the second round if I had to guess on a per game basis but if you have him you just hang on it'll be fine it'll be it'll be a better  it's probably not gonna be a MidFirst probably not even a late first at this point but  he'll be all right  do you think Dilo can maintain 14 field goal attempts in six and a half of assists where do you rank him rest of season and what about his minutes  well we've seen as minutes come down a tiny bit in the last couple of Lakers games largely because they've gone to more defense focused lineups late in the ball game like with Portland Russell played 32 minutes but he didn't play down the stretch but he got a lot of his minutes before that so my answer is basically yes with with a caveat because right now he's playing 33 minutes a game I think probably that comes down a little bit with it once Gabe Vincent comes back because they'll lean more in defense in those spots  but also I think he's like he was getting drafted after 100 and I think he beats that so maybe not 14 field goal attempts but six assists is very doable he's actually building chemistry with Anthony Davis seemingly every ball game so I would definitely not panic on him  who would you rather have in eight cat damn Nick klaxon or Daniel Gafford that's Nic Claxton  is Mark Hill fultz a drop do we think this knee issues gonna be persistent all through the year back to bats blah blah blah he's 25 with a bum knee that doesn't seem good enough to be held  I'm gonna hold him a little bit longer see if he can get back from this I admit he's been the most annoying player in fantasy to roster so far this year because he missed three games and just when we were able to put him on an eel slot then he came back played one game and now he's missed two again so he's been basically dead weight but I gotta let him try to settle I'm gonna give him at least some number of games when he's healthy to see what happens after that he could end up as a drop you know he was a guy that was you were drafting in the 90s those guys end up drop sometimes if he doesn't pans out doesn't pan out but I don't think I would do it yet should I trade Michael Porter Jr for Brook Lopez uh no stick with mpj is Evan a really good season I think you can maybe even get more or you can just ride it out  is it time to activate cam Johnson yes who is my drop out of tyus Jones shade and sharp Jalen Johnson or Daniel Gafford oh  sadly it's probably as Jones  should I trade John Moran for James Harden  yeah punt free throw build  I'm gonna say yes  Kauai for Myles Turner um  I think I'd probably rather have Kawaii but you go either way out that one's that one's  pretty close either way probably prefer kawaii for me but if you go miles that's that's actually fine too  thoughts on Ben Simmons is there any hope there's hope but I've been saying he's his career is over for about three years  he's just not fast anymore his body is is broken I think the best we can hope for is what he's done so far this year which is top 120 and that could go up a little bit of his free throw number wasn't 25% but the other stuff is probably not going to change all that much and then you just have to pray that he gets healthy a handful more questions here and then we're wrapping it up  who to drop if something comes up on who's my drop between Gordon Hayward tyus Jones Derek white Markle faults faults is the drop if somebody pops up  I said tyus Jones and Andrew Wiggins for yaka Pearl was that too much I mean that's a you sold low and bought low  I think Ty is should have been enough to get him solo but I don't mind you getting rid of Andrew Wiggins so that's fine  I sent away gobert and kuzma for Jimmy Butler and ogn and Obby yeah it's a huge win  a huge win  kuzma's on his way down Butler and OG or great gobert is much better than expected but like you know he's not Butler  and OG more than covers anything else you might have lost their  should I sell low on Clay when he has some name value he looks washed maybe depends what you can get if you can get a top 90 guy back I probably would sell on Clay because I don't know how long it's gonna take him to get going if at all but you definitely not dropping their  I managed to trade Away Jordan Clarkson for Keegan Murray last week well done sir that's how you do it hey Dan Pat connaughton or Nic Batum in an 18mm I'll go but tomb although constant probably here while Jae Crowder's out might be safer because I don't think he's gonna take rest games like Nick might um but overall for the year I probably go probably go but tomb  is Trey Murphy a stash yes because the Pelicans cannot stay healthy to save their lives so I have every reason to believe that someone's just going to be hurt at all times on New Orleans and that means trade with slot into their spot easily and  that's that by the way I told you guys that if you got your questions in before 9:57 they were getting answered people keep writing them in there but sadly I don't think we're getting to those  Max Drew's Jordan Poole or Cam Johnson rest of season I'll go cam Johnson in I just think he's although the health thing does bug me a little bit but cam Johnson per game is probably my pick their  Dan at this point in the station are you stashing guys like Bilal who has potential rest of season or keeping guys like Skylar Mays for the next two to three weeks  probably more like a maze thing right now because I don't know how long it's gonna take for Cooley to actually get value and I frankly I don't know that he's gonna have nine cat value all year anyway but we know Skylar maze is gonna have some value here for a week or two so I'm gonna I'll just cash in on that Jalen Suggs or Jordan Hawkins definitely Jalen Suggs  Kevin Durant for Anthony Edwards I'm gonna go Durant because Durant has actually been  like weirdly not amazing so far and he's starting to get there but he's down at number 20 while not hitting his free throws at the normal clip like normally he's at nine some odd free throws a game and and like 90% And he just got up into the mid-80s his turnovers are all so super duper High because he hasn't had anybody on his team and he's had to do a lot of the passing Edwards is it 26 and I feel like Aunt has kind of maxed out on ranking  so I I prefer Kevin Durant although I get it like maybe you prefer Anthony Edwards because he is more a safer health risk there but I like Kevin Durant on a per game basis  Trader hold Kawaii poodle and tyus Jones Kauai is a buy he's a Buy Low puddle is probably a weighted out and tyus Jones is also probably a weighted out  another tie is Jones question is there any hope you reckon the Wizards or cooked yeah there they are they are cooked man I don't  they might be doing a little bit of pre tanking here just to like make sure they rack up a ton of losses  and then perhaps you see some of these guys they'll actually let them play a little more in the middle of the season so I would I would say hang on because we we see the outlines of it like we've seen yesterday he looked pretty good until they just yanked him around  you're not dropping let's just see how it goes two more questions because those are the ones that got in before my 9507 butler is Herb Jones better than Jordan Hawkins yes  should I trade hardened for cat  yes I'm good with that because you probably hard and probably got drafted later so some degree you're sort of like  going and moving up the board and Cat Just much safer shots starting to come around he's number 47 but he's not shooting well yet so that's a number that should probably go up I mean maybe you get to a point where Hardin is better than him per game but it ain't happening yet and I think that's it for the questions I know people through some some other stuff in there but sorry guys you were technically after the buzzer this one asked somebody asked me if I'm a big pizza guy and the answer is no I'm lactose intolerant that makes it harder there's you know they make like a vegan cheeses that don't have lactose but they're kind of gross and then Pizza without cheese is also a little bit gross but you know I'll do that in a pinch so there's your non-basketball question there hoping to do a buy sell show later today we'll just kind of see how timing goes I'm also completely exhausted from All Things life but again it'll it'll again sort of come down to daily timing things like that so stay tuned we might have that going on please subscribe that's the way that you would get alerted if we do
