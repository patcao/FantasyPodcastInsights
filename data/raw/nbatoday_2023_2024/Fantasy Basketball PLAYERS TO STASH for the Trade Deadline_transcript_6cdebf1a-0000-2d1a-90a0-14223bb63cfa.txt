welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  here we go guys it's trade deadline stashes  parenthetical remark  Maybe  because let's be honest here right at the outset as fun as this concept is of a trade deadline stash  the magical sometimes almost mythical player who you pick up  I guess now would be about three weeks depending on when you watch the show might be a little bit less than that before the trade deadline  who steps into a monster role afterwards  once in a blue moon this works months in a blue moon last year Mark Williams was a pretty good example of that all the then Charlotte went into a rest  one Center every game out of the three that they had so even that was a little bit iffy  but you look at teams and you say all right who's the guy  oftentimes on a crappy young team waiting in the wings  who needs a veteran traded out in front of them  and last year you look the Mark Williams there well Mason Plumlee gets out of here Mark gets to play and then he played in the nick Richard played and then  I forgot the third Center was on the team at that point but  sometimes this works  and the reason we're doing a show on it is because a lot of you on social in the chat rooms any place you can get a hold of me have said  who are you stashing for the deadline  the simple answer is nobody but that's not fun  so we're doing a show today on a few names that might be worth stashing some of them closer than others and we'll try to break down who has the best odds from among some of these names might you they're going to be some other ones that pop up out of the blue this is not a comprehensive list not by a long shot  but let's talk about a few of them see if we can isolate a name or two that might step into some better value first of all this is Dan

on Thursday February the 8th that's Pacific Time way before the start of the actual like ramped up to the trade deadline will have the whole morning together to go over that stuff and click like just a quick thumbs up on that bad boy we're almost at 260 right now  pre like before the show those are so critically important because when I hit the go button on that show on that Thursday February 8th morning if we already have five or six hundred likes on the show before it even starts that's how we jump out in front of everybody else that's just getting started and how we hit the YouTube algorithm and make it the best damn day the best damn day ever that link is in the show description it's also on your screen if you're watching with us here on any of the visual elements of our show  but let's go ahead and make the stashes graphic here that I provided a little bit larger and let's get into the first name on the list and that first player is Gary Trent Jr who I've talked about on this podcast a little bit and the reason he's a stash is because well number one we've seen him put up fantasy valuable before that's  I guess part of the story the other part of the story is that the guy that right now is kind of battling him for playing time and shots and usage is Bruce Brown who we've heard the Raptors are considering trying to move along to another location they feel like maybe they could get perhaps a first for him or something good young player whatever because contenders are all going to have a space for Bruce Brown he's a wonderful connector type of piece very good defensively he's improved from 3-point Land good passer good rebounder for his size just an energy guy who makes the right plays someone's gonna want that dude and if the Raptor is move him out that opens up presumably 25 to 30 extra minutes and more than anything just an opportunity to have a few more shots and be more of an Engaged participant because Gary Trent played 29 and a half minutes in their last ball game but he only took eight shots he had six points two boards and two assists that's not all that close to Fantasy value  so what's the downside here well the downside here is that even if Gary Trent gets dirty minutes plus there's no guarantee that he gets enough shots to make Headway this is even if Bruce Brown gets out of his way because Scotty Barnes is going to be the lead dog RJ Barrett in Emmanuel quickly are the sort of secondary dudes on that team which pushes even a best case Gary trench you and you're down to the fourth offensive option  that usually doesn't mean more than 10 or 11 shots per ball game and for a guy who relies on threes and Steals and then consequently points to make his fantasy Headway I don't know if ten of shots a game is gonna be enough  so he's Gary trying to guy that could step into a bigger role yes is the role actually going to be big enough the answer is still probably know but that's why he makes the board as a possible stash candidate because there is a pathway to him getting enough minutes and there is a pathway  it's gonna require some adjustments and he's gonna have to just get more aggressive and a little bit wacky and wild to him getting enough shots to post some sort of fantasy value so he's the first name on the list but again great of salt because in all likelihood he doesn't get to actual fantasy value anyway but he's a guy to think about  onyeka oh Congo was the next name on the list and he's a guy that's kind of in an active Place Dash slash stash all year long anyway  he's number one in 112 while largely playing the backup role to Clint capela who's only missed a handful of game so far this year and that's been a little bit of a downer when it comes to Hong Kong will cause I think Hong Kong was only played one game more than capella this year meaning they're just hasn't been that much of an opportunity for him to thrive with Clint out and that's what your banking on now which is that can capela get moved at the trade deadline  have the Hawks hit a point where they feel like they could either recoup some sort of assets and I don't know do you say go into a little bit of a sale posture we know that Deontay Murray's on the Block so why wouldn't Clinton capella be on the Block he has only one more year on his contract that's to that's next season 22 million dollars which is not nothing but  this the rest of this season is fairly affordable he's a very good traditional center rebounder around the rim shot blocking type and you gotta figure that there's some team out there that could use him that probably would prefer him as more of a rental so the fact that he does have 20 some odd million on his contract for next year does make this situation a little bit more complicated but the reason that was on the board is that it doesn't really hurt you right now to just have him on your roster  he's good enough right now to be a guy you can play in almost every format as someone who's ranked between 100 and 125 he sort of right on that Fringe line for 12 teams but competitively he's a goal and now you're at an opportunity in the reason why call him a stash here is maybe you could buy on him pay a little bit of a very tiny premium maybe a tiny bit more than he's worth right now on the chance that capella gets moved and Hong Kong would become a top 50 guy that's a big leap for him to possibly take he's one of my favorites on this board because the downside is super low the downside here is that capella doesn't get moved which by and large is still the more likely scenario I want to try to  like buffer each of these conversations with the idea that like most of these stash ideas don't really make sense just from a like should you use a roster spot on this guy but for because you'd be using a roster spot at a guy you can actually start in most formats it doesn't really hurt you very much so that's why I think I like him as maybe my favorite on this board because the downside is minimal the downside is he continues to be a fringe startable 12 team or the upside is through the roof  but I guess you kind of have to think about where cappella would go the Mavericks would be an interesting team because they've got Derek Lively who they like a lot but he's still a rookie makes a lot of sort of say dumb mistakes but rookie mistakes you saw him pop up in that Laker game a bunch of times the maps I'm sure would love to have a proven viable Rim Running Center who doesn't make those kinds of mistakes and that's a guy like capella  and the Mavs have some assets they could send back so why shouldn't a thing like this happen for the Mavs linked to Daniel Gafford  for the Wizards why wouldn't they be linked to cappella as well well it's a little bit more expensive I guess but  you're looking sort of at the same general idea of what they're trying to accomplish  next name on the list is us our Thompson who has been in and out of the rotation he's coming off a big ball game basically the morning that I'm recording this show he played 32 minutes there was no Isaiah Stewart for the Pistons in that game this is really about a team that is going to be I mean for the Pistons like they're pretty terrible already  but would they then finally just lean into the youth situation we saw what Thomson can do at the beginning of the year when he was cut loose  and he had all the adrenaline and energy in the world and now we've seen what the middle of a season can do to him wow where the long arduous grind of an NBA campaign has basically taken the legs out from underneath them  this one is not so much a deadline related stash it's not like we think a bunch of guys are going to get out of the way but yes Alec Burks is a candidate to get moved boy on bug zdanowicz is a candidate to get moved they pissed have a couple of veterans I think they want to keep them because the rest of the team is so damn young they need some sort of Veteran out there to try to lead the young guys in some kind of meaningful way and just a mentorship role  so I don't know that guys necessarily move but I think what you might see happen with the Pistons is that they just take the veterans and instead of playing them 30 minutes a ball game they just slide them to the backdrop  and say look your job now  we're terrible we're gonna get a really good draft pick your job now veteran is not to play but to coach I need you guys coaching these dudes down this I need you to coach up as our tops and I need you to coach up Jaden Ivy and Cade Cunningham and get the young guys figuring out how to play basketball in a more meaningful and and  productive way  just a way that leads to wins decreased turnovers decrease mental mistakes better your defense somehow  and Thompson feels like a guy that the Pistons are going to want to develop during that part of the year  along with Jalen Duren and Kade and Ivy and I guess you could kind of say those four guys are the young core for the Pistons now so  is there many reasons not to turn Thompson loose down the stretch not as far as I'm seeing someone in the chat room saying I really doubt the Detroit trades Thompson that's not what I said they're trading guys that would be in front of him  this is not he gets traded these are trade deadlines stashes guys that could see a benefit based on things that happen around the trade deadline so it's a situation where guys that are in front of him might get out of the way whether it's by trade or just team saying okay you know what it's time for you young guy to play  but I think we may now get a sense after February 8th or maybe even a little bit after that of what we saw from Thompson early in the year which is more like in inside that sort of 60 to 100 range depending on how much the percentage is hurt you during that stretch but better rebounding better defensive stats and just frankly the ability to go out there and play untethered  because right now the tethers are ridiculous on Thompson he's not getting run unless he's playing nearly Flawless basketball because the Pistons want to be competitive every night and I get it they've lost so many ball games that they just can't get blown out right now will be too detrimental to their mental state but Thompson's a guy that would benefit from the team saying you know what doesn't matter down the stretch we get blown out we don't get blown out there enough other teams that are going to be sort of throwing it to the wind play our young guys will be competitive just by playing guys that you know want to be out there fighting on a nightly basis and Thompson is a guy that I think is gonna want to be out there and fighting on a nightly basis  fourth name on the list Bilal could be worked very hard to make sure that we get that French pronunciation right coolie as a game that's starting in a matter of moments as I'm doing this podcast but here's the thing  I have said four months on this show that I didn't think below was an ad  and I continue to maintain he's not an ad in the traditional sense because in 26 minutes a game this year  he's number two and 230 in 9 cat 8 points 4 boards to assist a little under steal point seven blocks in the three-pointer  of that for him is playing generally blowout minutes meaning he gets his minutes they bump up during the games with garbage time  the Wizards at some point after the trade deadline and this one may be more of a silly season discussion but if it could tie into the trade deadline because we've all heard  that tie his Jones is one of the most likely players to get moved at the deadline he's had an outstanding season for the Wizards there are a lot of teams that could use  maybe the best last year was the best backup point guard in the NBA and maybe teams want to turn him back into the best backup point guard in the NBA  all that to say there's a very reasonable market for tyus Jones a super efficient guy who can run an offense without turning them all over and shoot it at a good percentage  the Wizards would be nuts not to try to get something for tyus back in a trade and that is not I don't know that we can say it unleashes coolie because he also kind of needs Jordan Poole and or Kyle kuzma not to necessarily get traded because I don't think the Andis might get moved I don't think there's any market for Jordan Poole right now but if one of those two guys gets moved then we're really in business and frankly you could throw some other Wizards on the stash board although it a lot of those guys are actually kind of all ready rostered like Denny Oviedo would be a guy who'd get a pretty big bump  but you could see Corey kispert get a lift if Kyle kuzma gets traded  this is all sort of secondary because we know the main guy that they would kind of shoehorn minutes to  is cool to believe and the problem of course is that his Fantasy game is not all that robust yet he doesn't hit that many three-pointers the Steals and blocks are decent and he doesn't really want to shoot the ball all that much so that's why we not only need Tice Jones to get out of the way but we also need just like generalized usage of available we need cool ability getting 10 11 shots of ballgame where we said that wasn't enough for Gary Trent that actually probably would be enough for Kula believe because he does other things  in addition to just scoring the steals would be good if you was getting 30 some odd minutes he'd get more than one steal a game he might even get a block of game in 30 minutes a night  he might be a one and a half threes one and a half steel on a one and a half maybe 1.2 Steals and point nine or one block that's a pretty damn good starting point  the free throws have to get better the field goal percent asked to get better which I probably won't happen this year but you get him out there taking ten shots a game instead of six now you're talking about a guy scoring 12 13 points instead of eight  or 14 even now you're talking about I in an extra four five minutes of ball game getting five and a half rebounds and said of four getting two and a half assistance of one point eight everything floats up and you just pray that the percentages don't destroy you because they still could  and I did want to throw one honorable mention name on the board and he's not necessarily a trade deadline name in that Santi aldama who I think is maybe more tied to silly season but if we're talking about stashes he probably fits under the kind of stash header which is when do the Grizzlies shut down Jaren Jackson Jr I don't think it happens until March which it probably will happen in late March we're talking about one two two and a half weeks left in the season kind of thing but he might get some games off here and there and the guy that benefits from that is aldama because he's the guy that was slot in as the power forward next is Xavier Tillman at Center who would also by the way get a bump if JJ gets gets knocked out for the rest of the year for some reason so Obama's a guy but that's a longer look ahead  trade deadline from the time I'm doing this show the trade deadline is like just under three weeks away that's pretty damn close but mid to late March that's two months still so I can't recommend stashing somebody for two months that may or may not step into a larger role that's why aldama is just an honorable mention he's not a trade deadline stash he's more of a silly season stash but one that could really pop off in a big way along with many other names that maybe we'll do a show on as the Silly Season gets closer so again to recap here on our trade deadline stashes list my favorite of the bunch probably on Yoko Kang woo because he's good enough even without a move getting made my second favorite is awesome Thompson who I think ends up playing a whole lot more for the Pistons down the stretch my third favorite is Gary Trent Jr because we know he's done it before he needs shots and it's possible that he gets more aggressive if he knows where he's going to be post deadline so possible that Trent gets moved somewhere where someone gives him more shots that would be another win he could also get moved somewhere where he doesn't that would be kind of a wash and then my fourth and least favorite from among these names is the guy that probably sees the largest actual bump but does it actually get him inside the top 100 I still think probably not and that's Bilal cool to believe those are the four names on your
