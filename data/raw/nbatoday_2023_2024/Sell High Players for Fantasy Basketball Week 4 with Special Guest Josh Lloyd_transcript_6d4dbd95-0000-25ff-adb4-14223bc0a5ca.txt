welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  hey what's happening everybody welcome to this little bonus episode of fantasy NBA today it's a so high or stay put Edition  the first one of those I think that we're doing because last week I mushed it all together into one episode this week I split them up into two and for this one I am thrilled to be joined by Josh Lloyd welcome back Mr at Red Rock underscore b-ball sporting a delightful stash I can't believe I didn't see that yet that thing is amazing  Stan I screwed you up there I had your microphone turned off on my end and no one got to hear what you said about it oh I said I just said a cracking joke it was a luxury stash oh  sir I don't have I don't have a rimshot sound effect on this thing I like that a lot I asked you before we went on air how long it would take you to get a stash of that thickness from scratch and you said two weeks which feels that feels abrupt like that could sneak up on you yeah it's um  it's I am pretty hairy it does grow pretty quickly like I didn't grow this from scratch I just shave the beard off around it but it doesn't take that long for me to get her suit that's nice I like it well welcome aboard I hope you are and actually I think I'm fairly certain that I saw Twitter confirmation that rides are available right now yeah correct that we are we we are selling those tickets to for once at the moment yeah oh and a deal no less oh my God be still my heart I have Dan Bass Pros this is fantasy NBA today he's Josh Lloyd I got a list of I think I said six right yeah six players that are off to pretty damn fast starts and I just thought of these are you know out of the blue weirdo name but I think we could go through a few of them possibly all actually and get your thoughts Josh on whether these guys are so high so or whether you think this is sustainable sound all right  so it's good to me all right why the hell not so let's get into the first one the first name on the list is and I'm actually working down the board in terms of overall rank right now the mighty Tyrese Maxey who's off to an impressive start this year 11 games in he's averaging 38 minutes of ball game that might be the most impressive number of all 27 and a half points 3.335 boards almost seven assists almost a steal a block 49.95 splits and only one and a half turnovers per game Josh what do you make of this start from Maxi is this a sustainable beginning and if it's not I feel like there are sort of like a little bit of a gray area there maybe even if it's not fully sustainable is something near it sustainable  well there are obviously bits and pieces of it that are and that aren't I think the one that stands out is the block numbers I could just probably not going to be at that level what did he have last season like 10 he said I had eight blocks last season this season already so like that's probably not gonna hold at that level but the minutes will I think the usage is fairly consistent he also has done the shade good as Alexander where he's gone from a good free throw shooter to Elite he's jumped 10% each points so does that hold doc 85 is great 95 is amazing so which one of those is real like it's probably going to push back a little bit there but you know the assists the rebounds the threes he's at least three point shooter for three years like I'm Not Really Gonna count on that to fall back too much the minutes the usage that's all fine it's probably just a little bit on blocks maybe a little bit on free throw percentage is it a sell High sure what I do it I don't think so like well for like you're not going to get a top seven player back you know that's not gonna happen right No One's Gonna Give You Halliburton or Shea or let's say Luca or yolk or indeed it's not going to happen no one's gonna do that so what would they be offering to Kevin Durant and no thanks I think I'll just stick with with maxi in that spot like you're not actually going to pull this off for someone who is of commensurate value and how far down is going to fall not that far will be my guess yeah you kind of answered my follow-up question there which is what would you consider taking back for Maxi right now is there anyone on the board you're thinking maybe I could get that dude and it would actually still be worth it because it feels like you know you get kind of close to it being worth it with Kevin Durant is there someone near him that you think you could get back and you'd actually want  I don't think so that's that's the thing I got who am I getting like Durant old obviously hasn't played with Booker and Bill who knows when that's gonna happen yeah that's been fun so far and yeah oh yeah awesome and the difference between them is it sizable maybe maybe it's not we also have to just think that maybe this is sustainable maybe he can be a 94% should from the line maybe maybe because it's not like he's averaging two blocks again right he's everything less than one per game maybe he can do that I don't know that it's not like it's coming on ridiculous numbers it's not like he had one seven block game and then 0 for 4 in a row it's look at it here it's one one two one three one zero he had one block and his first four games so maybe that's more realistic but you know in the end even though he's elevated to first round because of this increase in blocks you don't have Tyrese Maxey for blocks these are such small numbers anyway this is a three blocks a week four blocks a week doesn't matter I again if I unless I get a top six player back before just roll with it just holding all right let's go to player number two on the list all so way up near the top and I did a show on him this last weekend but it feels like need more needs to be said and that's Scotty Barnes who's currently ranked 10th in nine cat 35 and a half minutes per game he's at 21 points two threes almost 10 rebounds a game a little under six assists 3.3 combined defensive stats I will say that in three damn separate words of its the last thing I do 47 and a half from the field 76% at the free throw line we've already seen some slight erosion out of him not much she was sort of MidFirst now back into the first hair splitting 101 here but where do you think Barnes is headed over the next say three or four  weeks can the defensive stats stay that high is that where people should be worried should they not be worried at all and is there anyone out there you think you'd take back  this is an interesting one because like I think most people I was not this high on Scotty Barnes I was probably low with the nearly everybody else because again I just wasn't impressed with what he did last season I was with you by the way so just if you're going to knock yourself you can knock me too I was not very high on it folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no

nobody should have expected that I also didn't think that Paschal siak will become a 20% usage play which is what has happened all of that sort of been a little bit over the place now the thing with Barns and I you know because I am a professional broadcaster day and that's sort of I alluded to earlier in terms of averaging two blocks per game with maxi like Barnes it wasn't going to keep that up and  he has three blocks total over his last four games so that was coming down he also didn't even hit 20 points in three of his last four games  I The Slowdown has started here  so when you look at what's happened over the last three games 195 with 2.3 steals 0.3 blocks 45 and 78 that's completely reasonable and you might add 5% onto that so would anyone give you a top 12 player back almost definitely not but if they did I would 100% take that because I think we've started to see how the numbers of barns will be impacted when things normalized and but in a lot of these cases just roll with it like I'm not taking a top 30 guy back I'd rather just see where this goes but if someone wants to buy into him getting back to being a top 10 player or consistently being that guy then I take that now I'm in a split some hairs what if somebody offered you say like a top 20 types so when you feel relaxed and when I say top 20 I think you and I both sort of know but I'll explain for the viewers someone reliably in that range not someone who's either hot or cold or on like a one week heater someone that we all feel consensus is that kind of guy is that high enough to pique you on a Scottie Barnes train  for a top 20 guy yeah probably I think let me have a look at where I've sort of got his numbers projected rest of us I've got him around that Mark yeah but that's that's because I've got him their sitting at one point five blocks which I'm think I'm probably going to have to reduce I'm not sure he sticks at one point five blocks and that's really gonna be the sticking point to me because obviously don't buy the shooting numbers that he put up early on and that has pulled way back but to me it's just it's gonna be determined by these block numbers so top 20  I don't know in a general rule down with a trade unless I know that I feel confident that I'm getting a pretty sizeable win I would rather just stick with what I've got because we have seen it we have seen in produced at a high level we have seen it drop off a little bit but there's no reason to can't push back up a little bit so unless I'm getting something where you know in 80% of my simulated brain outcomes he's going to be I'm gonna win and I'm not gonna do it so could he foreseeable b top 20 sure could he forcibly be topped in know so if you give me a top 12 sort of guy back I'm okay with the top 20 probably not  by the way can we start can we acronym simulated brain outcomes to just sbos going forward is that its be always sounds very very good I see how often I cannot remember getting that in there but yeah its sounds good to me yeah we're going sbos from this point forward third name on the board Chet Holmgren who everyone will be very excited to remember was the Lone young person I did have on The Dan Bass Pro sold man squad I have to give myself at small pat on the back because every once in a while I do Venture into the youth  this was one but this is that's gonna get you know watch list again oh yeah man I listen you gotta fill out a bunch of forms before you move it so why we just stay in one apartment our whole lives here the what should I joke about that oh well no it's fine I think everybody knows where do I have to do this thing like you say we're joking obviously everybody knows we're joking this is not it laughing matter  I didn't think it was gonna be this good a homegrown is currently ranked 15th obviously a lot of that is tied up in 2.2 blocks but overall he's really been fantastic 16 points almost eight rebounds I guess seven and a half around it up a steal 2.2 blocks 53% from the field 90 at the free-throw line I think he was a 55 590 guy before the last two ball games or something crazy like that I've got to believe this is coming down a little bit Josh and but where do you draw the line with Holmgren what kind of player would you take back are you like would you only sell them for somebody that all so is a second rounder I'm like I want to give myself a bunch of credit but I also think that this is probably one that comes back to Earth a little bit where do you stand on him  yeah look there are certain things here there's just no way right like do we buy him as a 90% free throw I don't think so I think it was 75 or 74 at Gonzaga maybe 77 but it wasn't even 80 I know that much and that's a big big lake right he's good you might get two or three ninety percent free throw shooters in the NBA you know season so I'm not gonna buy that he's one of those yeah I'm not gonna buy that he's a 46% 3-point shooter and we've already seen 209% over the last three games that's gonna fall back but in China over the last three games is at 1.3 Blocks he's very easy to me at 2 to 250 blocks player so it sort of sits in the middle there  I don't buy them as a second round guy I think in the late 20s mid-30s at that sorry late you know later third round sort of his own is probably more fair with some expected regression in 3-point shooting which is already happened in free throw shooting but maybe a bump there in block numbers I don't think there's going to be pumping 35 minutes a night into him  he's playing 30 at the moment that seems about reasonable so look if I'm getting a top 20 guy back absolutely more than happy to do that sort of a trade with him but I think more third round maybe even ends up as a early fourth is where we can look could you would you consider someone maybe in the 25-30 range like an early third coming back or is that not enough of a profit to say I'm moving off of my guy yeah look what's what's the purpose is that just to trade to do a trade like what a little bit yeah are you getting because what we know with rankings Dan is that the difference between 25 and 28 know it's one block every three weeks like it's not it's not a big difference it's it's shooting it's shooting one extra three across a month or something like that like these differences are so small that when we gonna split hairs and think that these players I love this word that someone told me earlier in the offseason it's the ordinality of rankings where we look at 25 is the same difference between 6 to 27 because they're ordinal numbers when that's not how it works that's not how these ranking values work and none of it none of it is like that and you know the guy who's 29th is not yet three spots better than the guy who's 33rd  it doesn't work in any degree like that so if I'm getting such small return on that now I drafted checks I like him I don't that's why I assume my draft anymore I like what he did so why not why I just hold unless I'm getting tremendous value and someone wants to completely overreact and just hold on  yeah and then you know you look at it from sort of a player fit standpoint as well which we obviously can't we don't know your team did you draft jet because you badly needed those blocks did it turn out that now those are Superfluous then all these things add up to you can probably figure out better than we can if they small gain like that going from someone who may be number 32 to someone who may be 29 but maybe you need more threes more scoring more assists whatever it is that you're hunting for with that move but yeah you're right it probably is a trade to make a trade but I guess I could probably maybe I'll play devil's advocate here what if you could do a trade to make a trade and turn Chat into the guy who's 24th and then turn that guy into the guy who's 21st and turn that guy the guy who's a team this may take you for years but maybe he turned you got a pencil and turned into a house yeah basically I think it is that story that's right I don't know how much time we have sure look who's got the time and energy to to work that I'm sure you could do it right just swing a guy every single week but eventually I reckon you like mates are gonna get pretty annoyed with you trying to swing a trade with him  every five yeah five minutes and so there is a level of diminishing returns of that people got bro look we just did this right look what are we doing we're not doing it again because we are dealing of course with humans and not like in a completely void scenario where we just dealing with numbers like people are going to get annoyed if you're just constantly flipping on that's how I mean if someone's like every day sending three trade off to you I'm just like no like even just out of principal get now I'm not not mate like come on what are we doing if you're doing this all day we're not going to keep going along those lines yeah all right good point and this is the kind of thing where if you're in more than one League you simply don't have the time to do it anyway next name on the board herb Jones who's a very interesting case study because I like many folks thought that he was coming into this year as Steals and almost nothing else and so far this year he's been a lot of steals which is not a surprise but some other stuff also both percentages have been good so far this year he's blocking a shot and a half I know CJ mccollum's out that's been so much helpful but overall he's just been better than expected can it hold I am skeptical where do you stand on her I think you should be skeptical actually did some research on herb earlier today for something that I was looking at I was adjusting some of his projections when oh my God like these numbers are insane like so I was like how am I that that wrong on her but I'm looking at him as like you said a steel specialist look how was I was like that wrong and then I'm going to look at his numbers and he's sitting 84% of his twos over the last four games he is hasn't didn't miss it too in the last game but is it 69% last seat for this season he's at 54 last season on 2-pointers he's the shop blocking is huge maybe that sticks he blocked point six per game like do we expect him to have jumped up a full block per game as he changed that much in terms of shop blocking process I don't know he's good Defender but that's not gonna hold but then everything else  okay he's usage is actually down from Mars season he still playing dirty one minutes he still like he's free throws are so like 12 percentage points higher I don't buy any of that stuff so while he is rolling at the moment he's putting up amazing numbers it's on the back of  last four games 3.3 steals 1.8 blocks 61% from the field and 94 from the line I've never seen a big red flag for aggression in my life like it's just there's absolutely no way I could just not going to stick what do you think you could get for him right now that's where I've been getting stuck on her well that's the other thing is I went to look like that's why I came up so I was doing my show on terms of streaming he's only roster in 64 percent legs or 62% of leaks how I think not much because if the if they're still like a large percentage of people not even bothering to grab him and maybe that's just all the points League guys maybe that's stupid he is absolutely rolling at the moment in terms of production and still hasn't even cracked 70% that makes me think that nobody's buying it and they shouldn't because you shouldn't buy these numbers so it's not because it's not even like a well of course he's getting this big boost because CJ is out he's not it's 14.7 usage over the last four games that's nothing he's not he's averaging assist I know two and a half he's just into a really really amazing Zone in terms of getting defensive stats that's all it is and and shooting the absolute lights out which is just  it's not gonna hold like there's just no way so could I get any if I could get any top let's say 80 player back I would do that because there's just I don't see how so much of this or maybe even though let's say top 70 I don't say any of this stuff holds that's what I was saying earlier today about Lou Dort do you have the same feeling like he wasn't on my list for today but that's like the same idea of if I can get anybody in like the seventh round or better I'm doing it yeah the little ones I was applying to a comment on someone today's the man Josh always hates the door but every year he produces I could know he doesn't know he doesn't he does not produce ever apart from this seven-game run like he's not he's like a 38% she's like Ark I like to call him Midwest Dillon Brooks like he's just bad so many different things like he's on fire to start this season Elite shooting numbers and for some reason he's just cranked the steals up to 20 which again as a good Defender he never brought them in that in that  quantity in the past so yeah it's a very very similar feeling for me on Dort and Jones yeah I didn't mean to have Dort get hit with a stray there but it just hit me like that's like the range that I'm looking to try to get back if you can lock in something I think folks should do it here's an interesting one Bogdan bogdanovich he like and I'll wear this one he almost wasn't even on my radar coming into this year I know his steals rate is high but it feels like a lot of the other stuff isn't that crazy right now his numbers on the season 15 points roughly 3:33 only three rebounds only three assists the Steals and blocks are high he's at two combined defensive stats which admittedly good and only 26 minutes 44% shooting he hasn't missed a free throw yet but I think he's only taking 12 of them so far this year is anything besides steals about to fall off a cliff with Bogdan or is that the one area to be worried or like I didn't I mean I guess I may have just not looked hard enough at him  he was a guy that I was looking at maybe like around 12 sort of an area but I wasn't you know not a huge Target guy I was just talking with Dan Titus about him earlier today you're right the steal stuff is is very high but it's not it's not outrageous like he averaged 1.1 steals in 2122 and 1.1 steals the year before that is it 1.5  and 0.4 steals per game Dan is yeah it happens like what is it one extra steal every two and a half games I think that's how that we worked there as I do my sbos on that one I think that's I think that people already forget what sbos were is my great fear oh well I kind of was it simulated Branch output something like that he was um yes so it's one steal every two and a half games like that's that's not actually that hard to get that number and steals as I'm sure you're aware Dan at the most variable stat Game Boy game week by week and year by year  so guy that averaged 1.7 might average 1.2 they might have one point six it's all over the shop that's that we get that that's that's fine so  that's up but it's not sitting at three it's sitting at one and a half yeah so that that's actually okay you're right the free throws he's not he hasn't missed one but that will come down all good everything else for me looks like relatively sustainable except and this is a key to a lot of people we look at you look on your app you look on your Yahoo hopefully you don't look on ESPN you look on fanfics whatever and you see the player stats and it gets presented to you but they don't show you what the two-point percentages and that is usually like over 50% of what the fuel goal equation is  and Bogdan is shooting 63% on twos and if you're 51 last year 51 year before that 52 the year before that so that is a 16 to 17 percentage Point drop that is coming and even if he improves to 56 or 57  it's a double digit percentage drop that is coming at some point and that impacts so much of what he does now could you improve his 3-point shooting from 35 yeah maybe he gets 38 39 but that is such a gigantic drop off on that Tuesday is probably going to stick like 63% from two is like Mark Williams Ranger what's actually not willing to but yeah Robinson or Mark Williams or someone that is such a high high level miles gonna see my real Michael Williams is like a thousand right now so but that's not that's 60 plus is yeah very good or it's like a center like that's basically what it is and that is holding that because you look at these field goals he's sending 44% of his field goals like that's not a high number but yeah because he's he's being really being buoyed up by the fox he's taking a lot of Threes tone of them and they're coming through with the normal level but that 2% drops he becomes like a 41% shooter doesn't impact these overall effectiveness because we know that field goal percentage is not a great indicator of players efficiency because of the way threes are included but in fantasy that doesn't matter but that number is actually being held steady by a 2-point rate that won't hold how far do you think that would push him down the board and maybe the more important question is would you consider trying to squeeze like that same top 80 range guy that we just talked about with her out of him or just see how this goes for Bogdan because it does seem like they like him  oh they do he's really useful he's very key to what they do but  he's got that knee problem that I'm pumping in to him consistently  you would I take a top 70 guy yeah would anyone offer it almost definitely probably I don't think anyone's gonna do that but I would take that yes  would you take top 85  no I don't think so because like I said look the two point is my come down but phrase could come up he could be a 40% 3-point shooter instead of 35 and that balances it a little bit and with these increased volume there that's solid so you know if he could be around 100 and what's the point of getting an 85 player there like a top 70 it's a big win yeah all right well well said let's do one last name and that is RJ Barrett who I never never thought I would come to this but someone on Twitter did yell at me guys can change guys can change he can magically become a vastly superior shooter to anything he was in the past like he hasn't been in the NBA for like kind of a long time already okay I'm in a frame this question differently because just asking is he a cell High isn't isn't even doing users a service at this point the question is how high of a cell high is RG is like do you just ride this and see if he stays hot for other two weeks and then drop him when it happens or do you try to squeeze  out like even a top 100 would be worth it how bad does this get because we've all watched RJ for a while and it didn't for category it can get real bad yeah so this is you're right like I be I've been yelled out about this before I put a little clip out saying look it's going to fall back and said someone could not man he's definitely improved you're lying you're just being a hater guys can improve they said the same shit I go that's all well and good alright guys can improve totally if everyone improve yourself it's a great part of that's right self self improvement betterment that's a big that's that's great good advice literally nobody is a 50% 3-point shooter nobody nobody nobody is including this man who was 31 last season nobody should 50%  so you want to talk a decrease as he improved short maybe he's a 37% shooter 13% each points that falls away has this man jumped up 10% each points on his free throws I guess it's possible but it's also in probable so both those things drop off and he still he's actually worse in rebound city was last season he's doing the same with his assists and he steals and blocks a point seven point three it is the same RJ except that he's hitting shots at a level which has zero chance of sticking so everything else is literally the same and he's only playing 31 minutes or not  it's not like he's getting 36 37 minutes it's not like he's pumping in gigantic usage is the same as it's been in the past this just no way that any of this sticks he is ranked really highly at the moment if I got any top 100 player I would happily do it understanding that this might continue for a week or two if a continues for a full season Dan I don't know what I'll do something pretty outrageous but there is absolutely no way that it finishes this way for the entire season understand that I will take hits on this when he shoots 50% from three for the next two weeks which could happen could happen but then it will shoot 10% for two months like it's just there's no way he is not a 50% 3-point shooter because literally nobody is you and I yeah you and I need to figure out what absurd things we're doing if RJ Barrett shoots 50% from three free I might just light this board on fire behind me do it do a show engulfed in flames that's my that's my promise as I I mean 50% from three RJ Barrett is now Luke Kennard ladies and gentlemen it's even Luke doesn't hit that no even Luke Kennard and that man has laser sight Josh I think I promised I would get out in 20 and it's more like 25 so it's time for me to let the great Josh Lloyd go let me close this window out so that not everybody is just staring at a weird board in between us the look at that okay technology at its finest or not so much Josh is of course at Red Rock underscore b-ball locked on fantasy podcast locked on fantasy
