welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast sup everybody Welcome to the io hour here on fantasy NBA today how good is that kid and he's been impressive I know I know Dan take it easy filling in Patrick Williams yeah I know I know  but here's the thing  many think it can happen at a trade deadline  I am here  you remember do you remember those of you that have been listening to show for a long time you guys remember when I used to start the show and I just I yelled something like let me talk to you for a minute about  X  oh whatever it is  thing thing let me talk to you for a minute about thing  and then I'd rant I'd have a rant that would go on for I don't know how long because it was like the the Counterpoint to everybody that was like Dan you talk about too much random crap at the beginning of your show so today let me talk to you for a minute about Ayo dosunmu who I am  a weirdly excited about and I get it all of the  setbacks they are all there uh but here's the thing and you see this with a lot of guys who finally get a chance to actually shoot  because like and we've been talking about Kula beliefs since November  when everybody's been yelling at me oh he's a stash he's a statue stash like okay maybe like if you're willing to stash for three months we'll guess what now it's like a week and a half and three months okay  there's a thing that happens and I owe by the way is is a much more polished basketball player than than be loud cool to believe because I always been in the league for whatever it is third year or something like that  the thing about the sooner is that what we've seen from him  is translatable  he doesn't get enough credit for the fact that he's actually a good percentage is guy shoots 50% from the field and 80% at the free throw line which is like kind of a new troll but still again like a working progress he doesn't really take many but regardless and he hits a three-pointer on 38% so he's a good percentages guy  that I don't think gets credit for being a good percentage of guy because he doesn't take any shots  that's been the nox so far or at least the fantasy knock but that's because Zach LaVine was around for a lot of these games DeMar DeRozan  Nikola boots  Kobe white this year obviously with way more of the usage  Patrick Williams not a big usage guy but was kind of in front of him here and now what you're seeing is that with Levine out who we know is still on the trade block I'm gonna earn much about it in a little bit but you know his like ankle reevaluated in a week thing suddenly as like well we evaluate him on February 8th in the afternoon  and then you got Patrick Williams out as well and so all of a sudden now and it's like night and day kind of stuff with the Moon  when two guys are out he takes double digit shots when one guy is out he takes single digit shots when nobody's out that it's like low single digits but that's the difference for him between being a fantasy asset and not being a fantasy asset and I know what you're thinking Dan over the last week he's shooting like 65% that's not sustainable you're right he's not gonna shoot 60% long term but we have seen that he can be near 50 which is still pretty good  over the last week he's number 51 you know small sample size 59% from the field 2.8 combined defensive stats but there's a lot to like about the  it's no longer the outlines of a fantasy game over this stretch since he's been taking 10 to 11 shots per game instead of like seven he's hovering between 50 and 705  because he gets steals he gets blocks from a guard spot which is unusual and we should appreciate that when we see it happening  he was at a half a block in 24 minutes a game this year which again you extrapolate that to 303 which is what he's playing lately and not surprisingly the blocks are closer to one  I don't know if that would stick maybe you're looking at more like points 7.8 but it is a reasonable thing and 9.4 points becomes more like 15 points because everything for him is going up by not just a minute's jump because his minute jump with everybody hurt is like more like 30 to 35% the production jump is more like 50% and some of that it's a the sort of hotter than usual running on but a lot of that is because his  usage has gone up faster than his playing time  it's a very good starting point and I have lectured about this on the show countless times when you're looking like at the end of a draft let's say for instance you're in like round 12 round 13 of a fantasy draft it's a really good idea to look at somebody you'd think is gonna play a bunch of minutes  that's a really good starting point but you also need to find somebody who's going to be involved in a team's offense what they do in some way some  small to meaningful way can't be  it can't be like what could be was the entire season up until we saw Jordan Poole out yesterday we'll talk about yesterday's card we'll move through a pretty quick because they're actually wasn't that much earth-shattering stuff so that's why I wanted to talk about December here at the front end you can ignore the those that are watching the box score that I have sort of floating around  in small font you can ignore that right now  is the Sumo guaranteed rest of season guy no absolutely not there's no guarantee of anything here uh but let's assume that someone's getting moved on Chicago  it would be  organizational malpractice to just sit on the roster they have the Bulls are 23 and 26 and find you know they're closer to a 500 team lately than they were at the beginning of the year  but that's not a championship Contender what is the point of just pressing forward with a team that sometimes wins three out of four games but then immediately loses three out of four games on the other side of it there's no point in that  unless you're like  you know there's there's no point there's no caveat to that any other team that's in that same bucket is actively exploring either trading for a superstar or unloading won Lakers are on the other side of that they're a team that wins three and then loses three and verify 500 team but they're trying to add a whole bunch of stuff  the Rockets are trying to add the Warriors are trying to shake things up  the Rockets are trying to add because they want to be at the front end of an upswing the Warriors and Lakers are trying to add stuff because they know that their time is limited by LeBron and Steph's greatness and so they they have no choice the Nets we know our sellers it's the same thing like there's just  so I'm going to assume and this might get me in trouble  but I'm going to assume that the Bulls do the right thing here and that is Shake It Up  somehow  bring in somebody crazy send out somebody crazy whatever it is and at the end of whatever that  Cyclone is  does Iodine who have value I think he's worth holding on to through February the 8th and then I think is you can play him through then because Patrick Williams is out and Levine is most likely out so you're gonna get nice production make sure to soon move is on your roster or someone's roster in your fantasy league  because he's on a really nice run and you just never know with a guy like that could he fall into a more permanent good spot post deadline  Maybe  I know  Furious approval you were looking for but you

free shipping ethos 2-0 is the promo code over there let's talk about yesterday's games because we talked about IO and he is he was actually on the screen I don't even realize that he was actually on the screen  he was particularly awesome last night 16 points 6 assists three steals a block two three-pointers on seven out of 10 shooting Kobe White had 35 Caruso at 10 5 and 3 with 2 threes and three blocks 22 and 12 with two blocks DeMar DeRozan was able to sleep walk through this one a little bit but whatever whatever cut the handsome slacky didn't have to be good so screw it  screw it this is the magic of playing the Charlotte sorry you know what I'm calling him the Bobcats until they actually started trying to win some ball games again  Myles Bridges uh yeah I mean he's put up gigantic numbers this year and ignored every single one of them because I wasn't a player that I really wanted to root for now obviously he's numbers are inflated by the fact that Gordon hayward's been out and Terry Rozier got traded and Mark Williams is out and lamelo ball is out this team is The Walking Dead not quite Mavs level but or Grizzly's but there up there what do you do  well you're playing blind and Miller you're playing Nick Richards you're playing PJ Washington you're playing miles Bridges  I've got a lot of questions about whether folks should sell high on Bridges and my answer the entire year has been yes but it's a little bit but again that was more of a I just don't really want to root for him now it's could he get moved to the deadline absolutely he could get moved to the deadline some team out there is going to be like what ever don't care about all the stuff he's bawling and he'll make that team better and that teams fan base is going to be sick to their stomachs about it until he has a really good ball game and then they'll probably just forget such as the world  for right now those are the four guys you're playing with lamelo ball comes back I'm not sure PJ Washington continues to hold value because he's really only been good since he's been able to get 15 to 20 shots of ball game  but he's another name PJ we're talking about he's another name where you could make a very reasonable case just hold him through the trade downline because if Bridges gets traded and we know Gordon Hayward wherever the hell he might be right now is very much on the Block  this could just become a situation where Washington gets to play it out and play a bunch of minutes so hang on tight will we ever see Mark Williams again I don't know  Clippers blew out the Wizards no problem there Hardin and Kawaii I have multiple Roto teams with both of those guys needless to say my teams moved up in the standings last night don't care about anything else that happened in this one Norman pallet 14 and 7 with no Paul George but you know whatever  wizard side Dana Gafford a steal and five blocks he's been so good this year he's number 33 in nine cat 33 people in 26 minutes a ball game  Jordan Poole was an insanely late scratch he was actually a scratch after the official start time during that nine minute window between when the game is supposed to start and when it actually starts he got wiped out tyus Jones had a bad game but you know don't don't worry about that there's plenty of other stuff to worry about with Ty's Jones notably the trade deadline  and we wait we lie and wait because the Wizards are  possible stash City you know kuzma could be traded so then you'd get bonus Deni avdija and you'd get way more shots for cool little league you get more shots for Ty's Jones V still there you'd get more shots for Jordan Poole if he's still there you might actually get enough of Corey kispert to put him on radars you might see tyus Jones get moved which I don't know that there's like a one-to-one thing there but it's possible Delon Wright could actually end up playing a decent amount more if cool beliefs up and plays a different spot on the floor  but  if Gafford gets moved You're Gonna Want to Jump On Marvin Bagley  there's a lot going on with the Wizards I don't know how you  make a good case to squat on all of these guys cool believe was the one who we were watching yesterday because  you saw him get a chance to actually take some shots  that's always been the thing we've talked about that at 1000 times on the show The steals the blocks are good he'll hit a three-pointer the percentages have been generally pretty bad for him  but six seven shots of ball game isn't going to get it done  if you're not a big time assist guy and if you're percentages are not like you got to find a way to rack up some kind of counting stat and yesterday he took 16 shots he just took the Jordan Poole job and it looked good  this is why I think he probably needs two guys moved he or maybe not too maybe just cuz kuzma would do  everybody's looking at tyus Jones is the guy that needs to be moved to unlocked Bilal I think it's actually cools because I think we need 20 shots back in the pool for everybody to pick from and then could you sit on Bagley I guess you could sit on Bagley if you wanted to I don't know if Gafford gets moved but he's on a relatively team-friendly contract and he's a very good Center that a lot of teams could use  gets depends on what they get offered back for  I got  I got chat room folks asking me to do an impression again from of Herbert from Family Guy you know what I'll do did the Pelicans play last night they did all right we'll just any time we come to a player whose name is her well we'll try to work that in there Detroit was able to hang in there with the Cavaliers who were working pieces back in bad game for Max Drew's I am going to call him a tough hold right now Karis Levert is about to fall completely off the map because his percentage is always weigh him down and now derry's Garland is back in there his minutes are going to rev up that'll just mean less and less for everybody else same story for Evan Mobley who was all on a minutes count  is Isaac Coral still played 30 minutes I expect that to drop Sam Merrill hit three three-pointers but only played 16 minutes okay George and yang 4 to 5 and 17 minutes all right screw still played 31 minutes in this game that to me is I think the thing you want to grab onto and you like Danny took six shots yeah that's because Garland took a dozen in 20 minutes and Donovan Mitchell took 25 which I get you know again that's not too crazy because they needed it the calves were kind of out to lunch in this ball game  particularly the Darius Garland minutes it was like oh let's try to get him back involved let's get their legs underneath them at the same thing with Mobley they were bad when those guys were on the floor and then they took him off and these guys that have been playing together for a month and a half we're like okay let's just let's settle in now let's dunk on people and then they did  mostly down the stretch  Detroit side Gallow had 20 points you can ignore that cayde okay good Jaden Ivy shot the ball a little better but I have no desires to hold on to Jaden Ivy in nine cat he's points legal only Alec Burks she played 30 minutes but I don't trust him with with Kate back it's for me it's Kate it's dirt and it's booked on itch in 9 and you can add Ivy probably to that if you're over on the points League side  and again as far as the Cavs go I again I think Levert is the drop to me is a very difficult hold right now while they all kind of settle back in but it's gonna be bumpy for the next couple of weeks so just a shame because through was just finally getting his shot back oh well Keegan Murray had a monster game for Sacramento remember when he was like outside the top 100 and we call them the easiest Bi-Lo of all time and now you all know why  he's number 52  now you knew why a long time ago Kevin heard her as a play these days he's playing 39 minutes he deserves to be in lineups Harrison Barnes cooled off as we all expected Malik monk is barely playing right now the bench for the Kings has been atrocious of late  I don't know how they Rectify that I have I've dropped among you know he there he had a stretch in there where he was a you know a standard League guy but by and large he hasn't been this year monk is ranked 100 and 150 on the season per game  that's not an everyday start  he had a stretch where he was he had like a three four weeks stretch where he very much was an everyday guy but more than not this year he hasn't been  Josh Richardson exploded for the heat I don't care you're playing the four usuals  only really a footnote that I wanted to bring up on my Emmy is that Jimmy Butler has been a first rounder now since coming back from his injury I think that's nine games ago and he's pushed remember when he was number 49 and I said this is a very easy by low well guess what he's number 28 now so look it's not freaking rocket science with some of these dudes this was Jimmy Butler you knew he was gonna be a lot better you just didn't know when and now he's 1.7 steals a game since coming back from his injury that's the big switch for him  not a first rounder number 13 sorry he's effectively a first rounder butt Butler's fine  hey go New Orleans bead used to 11099 I guess I can't do the voice because her Jones didn't play  so he  trained Murphy he's a start when herb is out  no Zion Naji Marshall actually was the guy who picked up most of the slack there but he did it on four shots so pass  pass CJ Ingram JV Trey Murphy those guys were the easy starts I started Larry Nance in a league and I feels very stupid about it because he played 15 and a half minutes I want Nancy to work so badly and sometimes I let my heart get in the way he's he's not safe he's not and if I say he's safe again just remind me of this moment  Jalen green is on a heater from another planet right now no matter what he does he can't get himself  inside whatever he still like even over the last month he's outside the top 100 but over the last two weeks he's gone completely Buckwild he's number 27 over that stretch  friends this is not going to stick his steals are way above average is rebounds are way above average his field goal and free throw percent are way above average  this is a prototypical cell High moment because someone out there is gonna look at this and say  well who's to say that he can't just do this the rest of the way  the law of averages suggests that he can't do it the rest of the way at some point he's gonna level off  I you know maybe he did take a small step forward overall but we're talking about a guy who was outside the top 200 and you know step forward when it levels would be still probably outside nine cat territory but like look right now you could probably trade Jalen green and get somebody in the top 75 80 range  right now because of what he's doing which is much better than that right now so go see if you can get D'Angelo Russell somebody's freaking out about d low or like go get Zach LaVine leading up to the trade deadline or go get freaking  I don't know who else is in there that people are sleeping on his teammate Jabari Smith Jr number 86 he's safer I don't know who else you can get in there  I don't know who else in there you'd want Chris Middleton Maybe  that might be a reasonable move  feels lateral but actually a little bit of a bump  zombie Mavericks obviously lost this ball game Rashawn Holmes got the start and played 30 minutes I can say with every fiber of my being I had no idea that was about to happen I thought for sure they'd start either Dwight Powell or Maxi Cleaver and even if they started Rashawn Holmes I didn't think he would get the Lions share of the minutes but  burp here we are  um  Derek Lively could miss another ball game or two I just I like I  even if they were Sean is starting the next ball game I don't know that we can trust he's gonna play 30 minutes could we possibly he basically hasn't played the whole year  I'm gonna say no two risky  Tim Hardaway Junior's basically the only guy you can stream when Luca and Kyrie are both out  I'm assuming they're gonna try to get Luca back in for the next ball game but who the hell knows and just leave the rest of this decrepit graveyard of NBA players alone Mike Conley was back for the Wolves that's the only footnote there Nas Reid got a little bit of bonus run here in the blowout we move along  Jalen Suggs had four steals for the magic he's trying to convince me to pick him back up again and I'll tell you he's doing a decent job of trying to convince me of that now grain of salt this was against the Spurs so I don't think I'm re-adding him yet but I'm watching Subs very carefully and then Jonathan Isaacs is someone we probably need to watch a little bit of he played 20 minutes plus for a couple of games and then came out and had an eight minute  Duty Fest which was I think part of a back-to-back for Orlando and they were like yeah yeah we're gonna you know keep as minutes in check but he played 23 on the front end of that back-to-back and then eight on the second half of it and so over his last four games it's 22 23 8 and then 18 and in the three games where he's played 18 to 23 minutes he's basically been a roto guy  or cusps Rodeo guy in those three games he has six blocks only one steal only one three-pointer  at him I saw him at in a bunch of spots which to me is people getting way out in front of this thing I don't know how you could possibly add Johnathan Isaac first of all I had to head League where you know he's gonna have games where you play seven minutes and if it's Roto even if you start him or even if you pick him up I don't think you can start him right now I think you just have to watch markelle fultz was fine this is sort of like a best case scenario type of game for him which to me puts him I see faults as like a 115 to 145 range dude so eh  window Carter Jr same story for me kind of an ah  I'm not that excited about most of them I feel like Franz frogner is really the only nine cat guy on the team these days  on Carol obviously points league but  anyway Wendy 30 minutes  those who have rostered one banana are pretty excited about the whole his minutes cap is Shifting Jeremy Sohan bounced back I was very worried that he was starting a long downward Trend but he's hanging in there and it'll shout out to Trey Jones at point guard for getting guys the basketball on the right spot the team is much more competitive when he's on the court and you know they pretend we've talked about the pre tanked so many times on this show  bad teams lose games early in the year so they don't have to worry about being awful down the stretch they can actually develop guys the second half of the Season without worrying about winning a couple of ball games by accident I still think Sohan is more of a sell High than anything else I don't think he's gonna be inside the top 109 cat the rest of the year but it does seem like he's just generally better in this lineup configuration  and we've seen the Spurs stick with this line of configuration for longer than most which is a good sign I think  it's possible that Wendy might have been like you know enough you got to give me a point guard  so we start Trey Jones start vissel start Sohan  had to head you definitely start rodeo still kind of nervous about it probably get away with it  no yolk it for Denver so they lost Peyton Watson actually got the start they went small with Aaron Gordon at Center and that was good for Gordon because he got four blocks but overall bad for the Nuggets because they lost  you know you're not picking up Peyton Watson he didn't play enough minutes Reggie Jackson had the better game but you're not picking up him either so leave it alone and then Chet homegrown who we had on our Bi-Lo episode earlier this week came through with a big double-double five blocks and three three-pointers  that's enjoyable let's keep going  Phoenix beat Brooklyn this is the Kevin Durant returns to Brooklyn game he had a big one to know one surprise KD remains at number nine in nine cat  Devin Booker  was a cooled off a little bit I guess didn't really cool off just didn't have to take as many shots nurk was good in this one  Bradley Beal he'll be fine you know whatever slower ball game Eric Gordon is The Fringe player on Phoenix right now who got a bunch of minutes in the last two games with Grayson Allen out  and you guys know I cannot stand Eric Gordon's Fantasy game and the only reason he had value in this one is because he shot six out of 10 and 5 of those were three pointers but two boards four assists one steal as not gonna get it done if he's not raining in threes so  I don't want him  pass you guys go ahead if you want I pass I kindly pass on Eric Gordon  cam Johnson's warming back up again that's a good sign though his line was not that dissimilar from Gordon's two steals in a block though is is a pretty good size difference  the way we'd be a little remiss if we didn't mention the fact that Ben Simmons was back out again this wasn't a back-to-back or anything and it's not his back it's now his knee  I thought he played five games the rest of the season he's out one so do we get four more this year out of Simmons  they were certainly better with him on the court  so Spencer Dinwiddie I'm sure was thrilled because he got to be the primary point guard again cam Thomas still starting he had 19 shots  people are going to see the 19 shots in the 25th and they're gonna be like cam Thomas he's gonna be top 50  guys  friends of all shapes and sizes  that's just not how it works campus is number 167 on the year in 17 shots per game so I don't know how many more shots than that you think he's gonna average the rest of the way  but the problem is of course that he's going to be high volume low field goal percent he doesn't rebound pass steal or block shots so you need points you need threes and you need free throw percent and it's gonna have to be a lot  to counterweight the other stuff and you're like but Dan doesn't that sound a lot like Gary Trent know because he got steals when he played a lot  listen don't get me wrong Camp Thomas is fun he's you know he can come out you can start he can come off the bench and when he gets hot it's ridiculous it's actually cool to watch from a reality standpoint but fantasy wise his game doesn't translate to nine cat all that well so when he goes on these little runs that's when you should be like oh I can convince somebody that he's shooting 52% right now and he's not gonna go drop him back to nothing or if he has a game where he gets a couple steals like this one  you try to pawn that off same thing you just did with Jalen green go try to get somebody in the 80 range and I promise I promise you'll be happy you did because then you dodge the crazy ups and downs  Lonnie Walker had a big ball game  again kind of out of nowhere no Dorian Finney Smith that certainly freedom things up and then no Ben Simmons so there was someone was gonna have to do something else odds are it would have been Roy so Neil but they didn't like what he was doing so they went to Lonnie Walker see if he could score them back into this ball game but you know one enough you're not picking him up that's the that's the short version of that one and then Portland beat Milwaukee in the Damian Lillard returns home game took a lot of shots to no one's surprise he missed most of them which I think all so shouldn't be that surprising and Portland actually did something really smart young team made a smart play down the stretch they doubled Dame on the basically the last play of Regulation forced him to give it up so that he couldn't beat him with the last second shot I think Brooke Lopez ended up shooting it and missing it and Portland beat him  smart that's a smart play  I don't know you know coaching staff probably said it but the players had to execute they did it  kudos  so Doc Rivers is oh and two including a loss of Portland you  be careful what you wish for Bucs fans Brook Lopez though so far seems quite happy to have Adrian Griffin gone  he's out there just chucking away right now rolls back up to number 25 in nine cat scoring a bunch  go figure  as far as Portland goes I don't know if I have to talk you guys down again on Jabari Walker who was fine yesterday but he played 16 minutes unlike it was foul trouble either they just went another way  because right now they're only down shade and sharp and we talked about this over and I know over and over again and I don't want to do the whole spiel but for Jabari Walker I really do think he needs another guy out of the way  and I feel like I need a name for these players because we've talked about three of them on today's show hula blee  I would assume oh who started the show with these are the two ways  they're two ways  to believe needed Jordan Poole out  I guess that was it yesterday  so not a two-way he's a massive usage away basically in that one which for a lot of teams is a two-way Jabari Walker two away sharp needs to be out they need one more guy out so that he can go take more than four to eight shots a game  it's not a knock on the player it's a knock on the opportunity  these players IO Jabari Walker Bilal when the team is mostly healthy they're taking 678 shots a game it's just not enough unless you're at Absolute defensive wizard  your average like three defensive stats okay fine you can take eight shots a game see her herb Jones basically who I think is even more than that himself he's a know he's at exactly shots a game this year good example Dan wait to pull that one out of your rectum  that's what it takes he's at two defensive stats again and good percentages in both that's what it takes to be an eight shot of game guy and Herb Jones's number 81 in nine cats so if you're like I guess maybe I could hit that point I mean maybe herbs a better free throw shooter  and probably a better shot blocker long term  but when you look at a guy like Jabari Walker who doesn't get defensive stats in fact sort of notably low in those and you're like well what is this guy do he can rebound rebounds have been pretty good when he's getting minutes this year but not gonna score very much unless the bunch of people are out of the way  and so now you're talking about rebounds  and  so it's a tool away it's a tool away if you want to squat on him to the trade deadline have at it  because we think brogden's on the Block although it came out yesterday was like I love it here I'll stay okay fine whatever but Portland again you're in rebuild you got to get something you I know you want the veteran leadership but hopefully Jeremy Grant and DeAndre and can provide some of that maybe not as much as Brogden  yay he'd probably be good for the Young Guy's but even if they don't trade him I got a sue me doesn't really play that much down the stretch  and sharp is out already but sharp is ramping back up to a to a playing so you need Brogden traded and you probably need Jeremy Grant traded  sorry and scoots gonna get to do more down the stretch all so all right let's do the our ritualistic chat room check here as we get towards the end of the show and it's a little quieter chat room today that's okay reminder everybody you can throw comments in the comments tab after the show is posted  I actually typically get  an alert it's not it's not the simplest one and it doesn't show up immediately so it can be a little bit of a pain in the butt but I try to sweep through and check out the comments at least once every 24 hours so feel free to throw something in there I as far as the chat room stuff goes here what I like to try to do for those that are joining us for the first time perhaps is just bring up stuff that maybe I meant to cover or forgot to cover during the show or a good point that comes up if someone is throwing like their own trade in the chat room I generally don't do that outside of a more traditional mailbag episode but there's a lot of you watching live now that weren't earlier so I don't want to remind everybody please come hang out with us in our Discord it's a lot of fun I think a couple of you actually went and found the link here in the last 20 30 minutes so while we were on are welcome that's in the show description I did my tweet storm in their last night I've done a couple of like half tweet storms in there over the last week I'm gonna be doing more in our Discord probably not a ton of Q&A stuff in there but maybe we'll throw one of those in as well so come hang out in the sports ethos Discord that's in the show description and our trade deadline live show six hundred and forty one one of you did it while we were on are likes on that thing right now I don't know how high we can get it but obviously the more we get between  now and deadline day a week from today the faster that show hits the masses and then it's gonna be like on all the suggested bars on YouTube because we're starting super early and I'm very excited about it so whatever you can do to help pump that up I really appreciate it  and of course a reminder here before we take a look at the chat room to please find me over on social at Dan best briefs d a n b e s b r i s  I do a lot a dumb level on social media and I hope you guys will join me over there for that so let's take a look at the chat room now see if there's some players there that I didn't talk about again apologies if you're asking me about like  who you should trade I'm not covering those on these shows these these regular recap shows if we do a male bag someday that's when you can get those in there or throw them in the comments after the show  here's one shining Knight IO or Caruso is an interesting discussion so right now both our fantasy plays Caruso does it in a different way you know over the last two weeks he's actually ranked higher than to Sumo even though he's scoring a lot less cars out 11 points four boards three assists a steal two blocks a game and two and a half three pointers  like I would if I was a contending team I would legitimately empty my coffers to get out Alex Caruso and for the Bulls I think they know what they have it sure seems like they they talk about him like they know what they have so I love both those guys actually Caruso's the safer play though because even when guys come back and take usage he still can post value here's one question about Donte divincenzo we didn't talk about him today because the Knicks didn't play last night does Dante have rest of season value in nine cat Roto  I'm gonna tentatively say yes and probably more like top 100 but again we still don't have a timeline on Julius Randle and all those shots are available so  possibly higher than that if Randall's out for like a month  a month and a half you can go even higher  he's obviously doing even more right now because ogn and Obi is all so out for the next  but for me the great out on Dante is like the team gets healthy in two weeks he probably plays out the rest of the season as like between 100 and 140 if Randall's out for a month he probably stays inside the top one hundred the rest of the season all rolled together and if Randall misses more than a month now you're talking about a guy that could go 876 rest of season just because of how long he'll have that extra wiggle room and then it's like well how would you compare him to guy like Michael Porter Jr I think I would prefer mpj just because you're not relying on someone being out for Michael Porter Jr to have his value  thoughts on Desmond Bane so that's been coming up on Twitter I think I think Josh may have been talking about him a little bit on a show based on what somebody was replying to me on social media and like I think we basically see eye-to-eye on that one because people kept asking me should I drop Desmond Bane and I was like  I don't know man like it depends on when your league ends if your league ends three weeks early  you probably could drop him because I don't think he's back for another month basically maybe even a tiny bit more than that and then they'll bring him along slowly because they're a horrible they'll be a full tank mode by then so they're not gonna like Rush him back into 35 minutes of ball game but you know final few weeks of the season two three weeks he might be going full bore and playing like every other or two out of every three games or something like that so games cap Rodeo  I'm definitely holding him  head to head playoffs go to the end of the regular season you probably try to hold him and for me the only way that I was definitely dropping him was if my playoffs if my league ended three or more weeks early  and that meant that  your playoffs start six weeks from the end of the regular season which is basically like a month from today basically give or take and so that's like when Bane might come back and so then you're like okay now this guy's a huge headache because he's gonna probably not play back-to-backs at that point he's probably gonna play 20 minutes when he comes back and then 24 and then 25 and then 27 and whatever and you're getting these like partial Bane games where he's you can't stash him anymore and you want to be able to move you can't take zeros in your postseason  and so that was the only time that I was like yeah you probably move on but even in the comments I've had people ask me questions on these shows have you dropped Desmond Bane and in the league where I have him I have not dropped him  I dropped him Marcus Smart instead  because I was like well even a smart comes back what is he a top 100 guy if Bane came back in time to be a factor he's better than that  do you believe Herbert will be traded  make sure you stretch out those screaming hamstring know I don't think he'll be traded I think the Pelicans would be insane to do so but they got to at least see who who they could get back for him and a lot of teams will ask on herb Jones because he's good and he's Young who is streaming for this Grizzlies back-to-back oh lord well we gotta see who's playing is sort of the thing  if Santi aldama just got downgraded to questionable by the way so it might get even worse we don't have the morning Grizzlies injury report but when we get it we'll talk it through over on social media so there's a really good question but we don't have enough information right now and it's you know 10 in the morning Pacific so we got what do they they play  five they're home game central time I think so we got seven hours to figure this one out let's let's not do anything right this second  Aaron Wiggins question mark well so the the Thunder were down a couple they were downloaded yesterday and I said Joe I think was all so out if I'm remembering that right  Aaron Williams played 25 minutes that ain't enough like I don't know Dora was in so sorry door played yesterday was questionable he and she both played so I think it was just Isaiah that was down nah  nah  Thunder don't trust any of their guys enough to just roll them out there every night so that's a no that's that's gonna be a no for me  let's see here anybody else that I forgot to talk about  do do do do do do do what's happened to Terry Rozier settling in with a new team he'll be fine they'll figure it out these things take time we always like and it's partially my fault so I'm like oh it's gonna take a week or two to settle in uh sometimes it takes a month sometimes takes six weeks to settle in  stick with it he'll be okay probably Buy Low honestly because someone might even be thinking about dropping him you might be able to get Rozier for like a top 100 Guyanese  should we be optimistic about Dennis Schroder no ish no ish  he's been very good with no quickly know RJ Barrett and no Yakima Turtle but more so the first two guys being the the big factors there Bruce Brown Mike get traded to the deadline I don't think they're moving the other guys in the on the wings or in the back court  so he'll be better than he was when the team was at full strength like a week ago but I wouldn't be optimistic because when quickly and RJ Barrett comes back through goes back to unfortunately not doing as much but maybe that gets him back to like the 100 to 1:40 range instead of outside of that does that count as optimistic the  any news on embiid yet no not yet  still waiting on the MRI results which were supposed to be yesterday the fact that they didn't say anything actually makes me pretty nervous  about embed I'm thinking he's out weeks and not days and I'm hoping I guess it's only weeks and not months but that's my guess is weeks right now  do you think there's a shutdown risk for lamelo ball and Victor wembanyama I mean we're already kind of seeing the lamelo ball shut down he's only played in 22 games again this year but I don't think they're just gonna pull the plug mostly because he's only played in 22 games I think you'll see him take days off periodically but I also think that they would like to get him some actual run because Mr lot of last year and  then I'm not gonna push him through anything but I don't think they're gonna  shut him down completely well Jarred Vanderbilt at the start for the Lakers soon if they if anybody over there has half a brain the answer is yes now I want to defend this is gonna seem dumb because overall I think their coaching staff is revealed itself to be wildly over matched this year but when Vandal first came back from injury he was moving horribly it's only within the last week and a half two weeks that he started to look like himself but that should have been the moment they should have been like all right you're ready get the hell in there and they still haven't  Scotty Pippen Jr needs to be rostered get him off the waiver wire um yeah I mean again it'll depend on who's in and who's out but it does seem like there's probably enough guys out that piping Junior could be started at least on the head to head side I don't think I'd use them in Roto what about GG Jackson  head-to-head yes Roto know I'm not comfortable enough the Aaron Fox retirees Maxie 9 cat oh it's got to be Maxie by a lot like by a lot Tyrese number 17 Darren Fox number 44 unless you're punting free throw that brings him a bit a little bit closer together  and now do I prefer Austin Reeves or Jalen green rest of season probably gonna go Austin Reeves there  so that's an interesting possible sell bike combo  all right that's enough that's enough we talked about everybody even guys that aren't playing yesterday although Lakers are playing tonight I'm hoping I can get a showdown this afternoon I gotta it's pouring in Los Angeles today which of course is the day that I had set myself up to run a bunch of errands God help me everyone we'll see nobody can drive in this city when there's whether it's one thing that I'm very grateful I lived in Northern California for six years I lived in Michigan for two and a half years I learned how to drive in the rain I learned how to drive in the snow and I brought these skills back with me to Southern California but not everybody here has done that  it's it's hectic man it's chaos in La when it rains but I got to run some errands I badly need a haircut can you guys see the big the big like fluff out here in the back I've tried to hide it on the podcast as best I can but there's a lot going on back there so hopefully I can get a show going this afternoon I'd love to do one more stash show a week from the deadline as kind of like this is the final list  ish  that's my goal tomorrow we'll have our weekend review show  big announcement  I don't know why I waited until the end of the show to bring it up so I'll bring it up early at tomorrow but we are about two weeks from the baseball draft guy dropping at sports ethos if you have the all sporty pass that'll just get dropped right into what you already got Bing Bang Boom sweet stuff so you can just let that ride the baseball fantasy pass will have its own option as well or if you wanted to actually the real key here let me tell you guys a secret sign up for an all-sport fantasy pass  in like  three weeks  no that wouldn't get to their like  early March  and that'll Carry You Until the End NBA draft guide comes out and then if you wanted to you could actually cancel right at that moment but that would be a really sweet way to get both  just trying to help you guys out where I can I think those are like six for individual passes and the nine if you roll them all together because I have football in it too in the All Sport anyway we'll do some more baseball promo on the next one we'll have Joe Oracle on the show at some point he can tell you what's going to be in the draft guy we'll do just like a quick Baseball hit and that'll be a lot of fun  yeah we're done okay see you guys later bye weird ending oh well oh I'm the best that's how you end the show I am Dan Bass Pros for Fantasy NBA Today sports.com presentation at Dan best results over on social I'll talk to them see that's how you would
