welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  my last track of the day's I was about to say hello and welcome to  Thursdays we got it  oh geez I'm out of it man I'm all out of sorts  I got no excuses I'm just tired  generally  things are looking up on the best for his household front yesterday the kids were off to school today they are off to school again  I still have like one on my phone have expecting  that call that's like oh yeah he had to come get him  so and so poop their pants  no  so you want to have kids  let me talk to you a little bit about something  all right so we got a big Wednesday to recap actually not that big I think it was what nine games yesterday not overwhelming  Thursday coming around the bend Morning News  there is one piece  and  but the biggest thing as I embarked upon today's episode  is that  I have now officially set up the page  for our trade deadline live show  I bring this up because I need your help  that's the link to it I'll throw it on the screen to those that are  listening after the fact I will make sure to have it in some sort of I think it's I'll put it in the show description trade deadline live show  you know go here whatever the reason I bring it up is because I actually need your guys' help and everybody's Collective effort on this one  I need you guys to go to that link and click the thumbs up button on the trade deadline live show  anytime between now and three weeks from now because believe it or not the trade deadline is three weeks from today  jumped up on us a little bit didn't it  the NBA season is you know what rumbling along we're halfway through guys most teams have played about 41 ball games so for heads where you wipe out the last three weeks and your playoffs are three weeks before that we're pretty deep into this thing  what are we about 12 I've lost track of I've lost track of what week we're on I think this is week 13 now no that's not right is it  is this week 13  does anybody know what the hell's going on yeah it's week 13  so you're not six weeks out of that thing  you got six weeks probably of regular season left and two of those are gonna be mushed together for the All-Star break  so headley's you're kind of coming down the stretch a little bit Roto you guys got till the end long way to go yet  all that to say trade deadline shows coming up I need you guys to hit the thumbs up button on that show before it starts because when it starts and we're going at 7:30 a.m. Pacific time that day 10:30 a.m. eastern time which is a full  four and a half hours before the actual deadline  so we're gonna be rumbling man we're gonna be rumbling for a long time any trades that went down beforehand will break those down including we'll go back and talk about this see I come deal of a much better idea what the hell it actually meant and  the key here is that if it has a lot of likes on it right when it comes roaring out of the Chute on that Thursday morning three weeks from today  it'll get into the algorithm it's our biggest show of the year it's when we try to rack up a lot of hits and new followers and it's sort of like this big blowout event I'm gonna be getting all of our guys that are interested in being on camera we'll get them all in here we'll get fantasy takes across the board  I'm gonna be sitting in a chair for four and a half straight hours I'll probably be dead at the end of it I need to figure out how to have a ball game that day  oh of course I do yeah I got a basketball double header I'm doing play by play of later that evening if you're looking what am I what's Dan looking at right here why is it like Dan's looking at a Clif Bar package it's because I've ridden down all the days where I might have played by play on the back of it look at that that's all class man  you guys are following me  obviously not for my ability to have a professional environment because you know Big Board behind me and dates written down on the back of a cliff Bar Box  wolf wolf  so anyway those that are watching that link is right on your screen it's in the chat room if it's easier to just click it over there please go to the trade deadline live show please hit the Thumbs Up Button I'm gonna bug you guys about this every day and it's gonna slow down how fast I get into fantasy chatter unless you guys actually start to do it but you waited long enough so let's get into fantasy chatter now  and we begin Minnesota beat Detroit  honestly it took a little bit longer for Minnesota to wake up and do this that it probably should have  we got one of our Jaden McDaniels wake up games it happens  once a week or so which is a shame because we know he has the ability to be a really interesting fantasy player  always a one-on-one guy last year he's not at one one one this season and ramping up the minutes over the last little bit when he gets going he can be a lot of fun  but he gets going so damn rarely that all we can do is look at it and go  if only he was in a scenario where he wasn't like the sixth option on a team  but he is to the Detroit side where Jaden Ivy went nuts 32 points for board 6 assists 4 3-pointers  on good percentages and the big question mark with Ivy that we've talked about over the last week and a half with this with Cade Cunningham being out is could the good outweigh the bad and a couple of games it did a couple of games it didn't this one it very much did  but you kind of have to look at the whole body of work right now which is incredible popcorn numbers over the last two weeks he's averaging 20 points for five rebounds six assists two threes a steal and a block per game  but he's doing on what's basically a punt free throw number  five free throws a game at 62% that's Rudy Gilbert land three plus turnovers at night and high volume 46 which is not disastrous but high volume 46% from the field largely because this field goal percentage has been better I think the last two ball game but certainly much better and this one  so we started our Jade and Ivy discussion by once again saying this is a guy who is Taylor Made for points League because then you don't care if he has the ball game where the percentages are a freaking train wreck but every once in a while here he'll go ahead and he'll just give you nine cat stuff  I personally don't have the stones to start him in Roto against a game's cap I value percentages way too much you guys know I love to attack those categories I think that they're an easy way to rack up points Roto points wins whatever you want to call it when other people are completely ignoring them but I mean obviously this is a massive line so you kind of have to balance two things in your head at the same time  can we start Jaden Ivy and be comfortable with an idea that oh what if he comes out and he puts up 25 and 5 but he does it on 20th throws am I okay with that I am not in Roto I probably am in head-to-head because you know you catch lightning in a bottle for one or two games and he's a big boost to your team for three games in a row  then the next week it's possible he takes your team  and that's one of the issues I see with the way folks are playing head-to-head right now we've gone the pendulum is swung too far in the direction of  who cares about percentages at all they fluctuate too much from week to week that point inherently is true but if you're planning on using a player on your team for multiple weeks eventually what they are is what they are you know like  short-term if you just used Jaden ivy for the last what two games where he shot 50% or better  outstanding he's been well he went four for seven at the free throw line and has seven turnovers in these two games but whatever like  the last two games for Jayden have been much more good than bad  the games before that there was I would argue maybe more bad than good debatable but it's closer certainly the last two the good has outweighed the bad so yeah someone I've actually I've had this happen to me a number of times and I get it the argument of well like who cares if you catch him on the right week  like even if you have a good field goal percent team on the head-to-head side you're going to have a bad week and so maybe it matches up but all of this has to be calculated what are the odds that Jayden Ivy has two positive impact percentage weeks in a row what are the odds that he has two negative impact percentage weeks in a row it's bigger that second thing I was talking about the odds of it being negative impact stuff in the points League categories again than the odds of it being positive  people have gotten so caught up in this idea that oh you have no idea what a guy's gonna do week to week that you can't worry about it on the head-to-head side you can worry about it because over some length of time if you're thinking about Jaden ivy for three weeks or four weeks or whatever  those numbers will catch up  guys will be who they actually are  I think we're putting too much stock in well you might just dodge the bad week or like what if his bad week lines up with other guys bad weeks on your team anyway and it's like well I was gonna lose those categories regardless  if you are punting a category that's its own discussion fine if you're punting free throw percent  Jaden Ivy gets a bump if you're bunching field goal percent Jade and I gets a bump if you're bunching punting turnovers Jayden have he gets above there's no chance I would argue that that is 100% right  he is much better if you're in a points League or if you're punting one or two of those points specific categories but if you're not punting those and you're just like I expect these things to be so Random in their fluctuating that I can't even worry about it you are basically describing punting without actually saying you're punting  so if you don't care about those  you can't have it both ways  you either punt in it or you're not  if you're in between eventually the percentage is going to break you and you're not even gonna realize it's happening because you've convinced yourself that you can't game plan for it  that's just not true  you can game plan  we need to make sure the pendulum gets to the middle  because for a long time and I'm very guilty this because I play in a lot of Roads so I want to take responsibility for a long time  you can worry too much about percentages and on this show I probably have worried too much about percentages because I love to win them  but now we've gone so far the other way where everybody is punting a field goal or free throw or a turnover or some combination of those that now everybody's doing it  and so we have to find the midpoint  the midpoint is understanding that math works out in the end  so someone like Jayden Ivey you can say oh well like look we had a really good ball game here percentages we're good I can play him in Head to Head even if I'm not punting and it'll be fine it might be for a game or two but eventually it's gonna be what it's gonna be and it's going to if you're not punting hurt more than it helps in certain spots hopefully that made sense  I wanted to spend some time on him because I thought he was interesting by the way I'm still screaming Alec Burks I don't know why but I am because he's generally been scoring a lot for this team so I think we can continue their  Milwaukee Cleveland you can throw this one out there was no honest and then obviously a 40-point game so just Roll Along one shot out to George niang who had 33 points and 14 shots he went 13 for 14 just an unbelievable game for in Yang everybody loved it because he's beloved but doesn't matter let's keep going  you know you just ignoring that game throw it out  Houston has fallen on hard times now and for a while it was because they're depth was being tested now I think it's just because the the grind of an NBA season is finally kind of taking its toll on this team that came out of the Chute and they were red hot and they were sort of the upstart team and now the league is figured him out a little bit so now it's time for them to make the adjustment I like to think of these types of scenarios as like a you know pitcher breaks into the big leagues but nobody really has the book on their stuff so the first time they faced everybody they get them out but the second time they faced everybody Big League heaters are like yeah I seen your slider now and that's kind of what's happened here with Houston teams have sort of seen their slider so now it's gonna be up to the Rockets to make that counter adjustment  they're the pitcher all right what do I do do I work in a change do I change the sequencing for basketball it's what how what can we come up with now offensively that gets us  a little more  creative how do we use our pieces a little more creatively because right now they're basically only down tari Eason  they've got their starting five from the beginning of the year these are the five guys that got them off to this hot start with very little bench help  I do think there's fatigue setting in to some degree  you've seen shango's percentages of slipped a little bit here over the last couple of weeks he went on that big heater after his coach called him out played 40 minutes in this game so it's not like they're like short on energy but I think you're seeing some of these guys get a little stuck in the mud Jabari Smith Jr has slowed Jalen Green's been kind of terrible and he had an Instagram post that of a guy looking at a sign in a window that said you're so deep in your own head or something like that Jalen green is way deep in his own head and I don't know that that's gonna just break out at some point soon so what are they gonna do they don't have other pieces there about to just throw in there for more they got to find figure it out internally fantasy wise I don't think you change anything Freddie Van fleet has been very good after a slow start I'll print shank bun has been solid all year he's in the 50s right now pretty damn close actually to where he was drafted  Jabari Smith Jr has been generally pretty okay Dillon Brooks you're not playing and then if you can sit on Easton you do but we don't really have a great idea of his actual return timeline so I get it if you cannot  for the Knicks this was the game where Josh Hart out played Dante even so at some point that was going to happen we just didn't really know when  stick with Dante for now I don't only I would make any moves off of Steven chenzo until this I don't say until but unless this becomes a more consistent thing where heart gets 30 minutes and Dante gets 20 it had been more like both guys getting you know heart was like 25 and even Chen's it was 25 but Dante's per minute production continues to be very good and that's why you stick with him over heart even though Josh is coming off a double-double  Toronto Blue out Miami I think the one thing to take away on the Miami side is that you're basically done with streamers Caleb Martin was fine Duncan Robinson was fine but these are that's not good enough fine is not good enough the only one you're considering still would be I may have kids Junior who was out right now with an injury and he's probably the starting powerful word when he gets back but if I mean I still don't know that it guarantees him 30 minutes and I don't know that it guarantees him enough stuff with Butler hero and Bam all healthy so I'm actually I think probably in favor of just moving on from heat streamers but if you want to wait it out if you can stash jacquez in an injured spot then you know have at it feel free I like that I just I don't think it's key I don't think he's gonna be amazing enough per game for it to really matter all that much  this was the Toronto roster without Bruce Brown and and without Yakima portal who's out but not traded and I want us to remember what this looks like because there is a very real chance that Bruce Brown gets shuttled along to another team he's a very movable contract and a player that a lot of teams are gonna want there's all a shot that Yakima portal could get moved on from although I don't know that that's necessarily the case they may want to have just some kind of big man because without hurdle their options Etc are dismal now especially without seeing him in town johnte Porter started played 18 kind of came in its but then that young played 28 Off the Bench and you just don't know who's gonna do what on a given night so probably leave that situation alone I mean how even Chris Boucher got 18 minutes yesterday the I thought the note to watch was Gary Trent Jr who slid into the starting lineup here pre Bruce Brown and had 28 points in almost nothing else but still 28 points and eight three-pointers does get your attention on a big on a hot shooting night  that's not a repeatable number but the thing about Trent is  he needs usage and unloading siakam freed up a lot of usage  a lot because the OG trade made it tougher they sent out some amount of usage in RJ Barrett in manual quickly came back and actually took more than what oh gee had so life got tougher for the other guys this siakam trade likely bringing more usage back to the pack  the reason I bring up Gary Trent and the reason I think you probably need to just add him and kind of see what happens is again trade deadlines only three weeks away if Bruce Brown gets traded and it's mostly for additional picks  Gary Trent Jr is probably the starting shooting guard the rest of the year at that point  he's got added a lot overnight and for good reason because he made a ton of shots yesterday and again you look at the sort of the rest of the fantasy appeal for him and it's almost exclusively threes and steals  but if he's out there for 30 minutes  and there's no see a come around he's gonna get some shots  he got 13 of them yesterday I don't even need him to make as many as he made last night just give me 13 14 shots of Gary Trent like actually involved in the offense  and he becomes fantasy capable at that point  Dennis Schroeder's minutes were a little bit lower that's a spot where maybe you see it tip back and then obviously if puddles around how does that does it create a log Jam as you push everybody a little bit farther down the board  um  all of these things are possibilities but  I just I don't see that many people out there right now on the wire where you're like oh this guy's been a top 40 dude in the past and no we're not gonna get that iteration of Gary Trent again this year but could he be a top 80 90 guy sure and again those guys are not out there right now so Adam see what happens over the next couple of weeks  because presumably Bruce Brown's gonna come in and play and then Gary trans gonna be terrible during that stretch so you're picking him up here mostly as a stash I say again mostly as a stash Spurs got blown out Wendy's gonna sit the back-to-back so that'll be good for guys like vessel and I mean I guess keldon Johnson who's  really fallen on Hard Times you guys remember early in the year when I started to get worried that I had totally misrepresented keldon Johnson  I don't feel dumb anymore on that one he's down to 128 he's been falling falling falling falling falling falling falling falling Trey Jones is the guy you're holding there obviously women and then vicel who  he's fine I'm you guys know I'm just not excited about the other Spurs the cells number 75 though that's not bad he's behind his ADP but he's doing fine  this should be a better game for him coming up  I don't know if this person has ever sort of take the the handcuffs off of weapon Yama this year I mean they're in full tank mode so why would they but anyway as far as this Celtics go this was a two-players out scenario no Kristofferson is and no Derek white so we knew Al Horford was gonna get a start and we'd be fine from a 9 cats standpoint what we didn't know was who the other guy would be and at some points it had been Sam Houser this year we'd seen Payton Pritchard pick up some slack and he actually did Off the Bench and this one but it was Luke cornette the green cornet  who played 30 minutes as the starting center had nine boards four assists a steal and three blocks and even really worse scoring at that point I cannot in my wildest dreams nightmares imagine that this type of thing happens more than maybe one or two additional times all year  but we should be aware of it because if they're like look we're gonna start  Luke Hornet here and  you're looking at it like well  I would say against terrible teams blowout scenarios maybe you are better for you in that but no you're not adding him right now we move along  Orlando's a mess luckily the Atlanta side of this game has basically zero fantasy thoughts of any kind it was nice to see Clint capela and on Yoko Kong will play side by side that was good because that's good for a Kong woo otherwise you know no news at all of any kind for Atlanta  or Lando  all right so let's just let's just work our way through these guys first of all chumo Kiki is feeling good for Gary Harris right now but you're not making an ad there Caleb Houston is feeling in for France Wagner and you didn't make an ad there either so let's throw those names out of our of our minds Cole Anthony is not hot right now he had three blocks which is notable but overall he's a guy you're only playing when he goes on heaters so that's not now  Anthony black didn't play at all so that's an easy one Jonathan Isaac played 10 minutes so that's an easy one now let's get into the tougher stuff  Jalen Suggs 28 minutes did have 16 points in four boards with three three-pointers on a good shooting evening  but the Steels have dried up  and I was always a little bit of a fear because this is a guy that hasn't really made it through a season of healthy yet  so the question hanging over Suggs was  with him playing at the energy level he was playing at to start the year  could he maintained that for an entire season and it just kept going and going on I thought all right well maybe I maybe he can I maybe my reservations are misplaced  well it's it between injuries and just general mid-season fatigue you're seeing kind of a steals lull for Subs  here's what I would do  if you can play him through this say Roto stash or Head to Head sort of like active semi stash I think I would do that because I do believe that at some point here he's gonna get a burst of energy and then you're gonna see those steals come roaring back in a way that they have been down lately I don't know when that happens might be after the All-Star break some of these guys get like an extra deep breath of energy when they can see the finish line so yeah you might be looking at like another month of kind of diminished Suggs and if that's not gonna be good enough then you move on that's okay  markelle fultz I think is an ad he played 30 minutes off of the bench I don't know that his Fantasy game is gonna fully translate this year this would be his best opportunity because because Franz Wagner's out and moving is not even playing so no Wagner's are in there right now or Wagner's  but false playing 30 minutes is notable  so pick him up see what happens he's more of a speculative add similar to Gary Trent I guess speculative add  but who have those if someone's like well which one of my what I go with between those two guys I'd probably go Gary Trent just because his Fantasy game has actually worked out better in the past than false  unless you unless you're putting threes and which then you flip it back the other way  the center position is the other question lingering here with Orlando and right now go get to say and Wendell Carter Junior each played exactly half the ball game down to the second 24 minutes apiece Wendell Carter Junior had three defensive stats three three-pointers in shot six of seven in this ballgame and I'll give you guys a nickel if that happens again this year  meaning six cash counters  and 86% shooting I'll give you all a nickel a shiny nickel  Wendell Carter Junior in 24 minutes is not going to be good enough good enough in nine category leaks he has a chance at points League value kind of an outside chance but a chance nonetheless  but today in 24 minutes is closer and he's still starting  for how long I don't know that might flip in the very next ball game but I think as long as goes starting you could treat him a little bit like a Nick Richards type in that he's probably never gonna be better than like top one hundred but top 100 big man who gets you some boards some blocks and you know okay field goal percent there is a usefulness for that in most fantasy formats or most category leaks I guess I should say so I'm okay with Goga as kind of like a low end plotting streamer you just can't expect much like you got to double double and three defensive stats that's the best you can expect he's not gonna blow the doors off almost ever  and you just want like easy quiet reasonable plotting center lines every night that's what you want if he loses his starting job though  send him into the sun  poor Charlotte they're so terrible  they really really terrible they're eight and thirty obviously losing lamelo for two months really set them back but they're not even winning with him back right now they're still down what two three regulars at this point  but at least you've got like four guys that you can reliably start Rozier ball Richer's miles Bridges people keep asking me when I think Mark Williams is going to be back I think it's in the next 12 days I don't know why I'm picking that number the problem is and everybody's like Dan you were you nailed Zach LaVine coming back and you nailed mellow ball coming back and you nailed Bradley Beal coming back and I was like look here's the thing about these  here's the thing about those  those were  ankle leg foot type of stuff and like with Levine we had a general idea of when he was gonna get re-evaluated and lamelo ball there weren't any updates on him but when he was out for five weeks and we didn't have an update it was like look the longest is dudes gonna be out is eight so yeah like this is the time to go make a move on him before and update pops up Mark Williams is weird because he's just had this back thing all season and as someone who has some back problems and we've seen it in the NBA Brooke Lopez there was a back problem then all of a sudden it was like oh he's out for the year and then Michael Porter Jr was always you know for the year  these types of things they don't go away they don't heal the way that a foot or an ankle generally does they're just more unpredictable  back is I guess not technically like a core injury but it has that same thing where it's like I don't want an oblique is gonna get better I want one of these guys it just gets used so much and it's so easy to yank on it that like if Mark Williams goes out there and no he's going for a rebound and he lands leaning with his weight backwards that might not come out for another month and a half  so I think he probably does resurface here and then the next couple of weeks but I don't have even close to the same level of confidence in that statement as I had on those other guys coming back from their ankle and foot injuries  if you want to stash Mark Williams I think this is a reasonable time to do it it feels like after the All-Star break would be kind of like the latest we'd see him but it's a little more risky because the Hornets are terrible so this sort of no reason to push him back in and back stuff is strange  I don't want to repeat myself too much on the Jonas Valanciunas thing but with Larry Nance around JV is more like an 80 to 120 range guy now instead of top 50  just  click the knob over on your board make sure you understand that's where he belongs  Lakers played well for this second game in a row they played well they got I think they got lucky or now the Mavs had a lot of trouble hitting three-pointers until pretty late in this ball game  but I will give the Lakers credit they actually guarded the three-point line better in this one then they had  maybe all season they have still had a number of open looks so I mean look Luke and Kyrie are going to get some other guys open but Tim Hardaway Jr was was absolute trash  total garbage  and a lot of that was because the Lakers actually like stayed on him  there were there was a contest on some shots it's amazing how much that changes don't  what does that mean well I bring that up because first of all Derek Jones Junior was back for this ball game Grant Williams was in for this ball game know Dante Exum and nobody for the Mavs had value outside of the big two plus Derek Lively at Center  and that's kind of where I'm sitting right now I know Kyrie had a bad ball game he'll be fine obviously but right now for me the only Mavs I'm playing are Luka Kyrie and Lively and I'm not sitting on exim because I don't know when he's coming back and I still think he's due let me like the guy was shooting 70% for two and a half weeks there he's obviously do for a mean reversion to hit hard  I don't think you need to hold on any of those wings  and then for the Lakers  I just like I can't believe how many people gave up on D'Angelo Russell  and we're just like oh yeah surely the Lakers are gonna play cam reddish big minutes for the rest of the year  Lakers were finally playing their guys that can score and then and against the Mavs team that's not very good defensively and has kind of know size on defense all the maximally was back for this ball game somebody to keep an eye on but I wouldn't worry too much about it the Lakers just took it right to him every time guys were wide open on every possession life just wasn't that complicated when you removed multiple non-threats from your lineup  no Lakers oh Lakers  Brooklyn's terrible Spencer Dinwiddie at least bounced back I can continue to be very worried about dinwiddie's fantasy value  he's technically a whole I don't I don't even want him on the Roto side like to me he's just he's not even all that close he's number one 52 in 31 minutes a game on the year  going into last night's game I think Spencer did he had the lowest field goal percent of any qualifying player in the NBA I think he may have moved in front of  someone with a better shooting game yesterday but that's just I mean that's just not a guy you can use in rodo  cam Johnson was a little bit better Michelle Bridges was okay I mean this team is just bad  blow it up Brooklyn blow it up  we know Dorian Finney Smith is on the Block we know so Neil is on the Block  blow it up  trade somebody relevant  trade didn't we so we can get you know 28 minutes of Dennis Smith Jr they're not gonna trade Nick's Claxton so let's not get too crazy about that but they could trade they could trade Finney Smith and or Royce O'Neill of course if Ben Simmons comes back then there wasn't a there wouldn't be a big winner there I think the guys are watching on this team are you know what if they move a ball-handler and then cam Johnson gets to take a few more shots what if they move Dinwiddie and then Dennis Smith Jr gets more run what if they move someone that allows Camp Thomas to get back into the starting lineup and take 20 shots of ball game there are a few weird little paths to back up having value but not to a point where I would say oh you need to sit on Dennis Smith Jr right now because like what are you gonna do with 14 minutes in a bad stat line and Rodeo is that your best stash opportunity out there no definitely not  I think I'd like to do a Stash's show at some point for whatever that's worth and then on the Portland side and before

mean well probably a little bit more Jabari Walker who got 30 minutes but didn't do a whole lot with it Malcolm Brogden is seeing nice minutes right now because Shane sharp is out for a couple of weeks Jeremy Grant had himself a game-winning offensive putback and poor DeAndre ayton got trapped in his neighborhood that was iced over in Portland couldn't make it to the Ballgame even though he was finally probable so do up wreath got one more stream game but that's likely done now you can almost definitely drop wreath because Aiden's gonna come back and frankly giving him an extra day or two to get fully healthy means they can probably give him a better workload so make sure eight is ready to go eaten Brogden Simons are the only three Blazers you're starting night tonight scoot is your is I guess technically a trade deadline stash because not that like something's gonna free him up but it's at some point I mean Brockton is definitely on the Block for the Blazers butt scoots gonna just get given the keys at some point here and you're going to have to deal with the good and the bad  well you hope the good outweighs the bad that's kind of this whole thing  he hasn't really shown any consistent signs that he's figuring out NBA game speed yet and that's why back in November when people like what do we do about school I was like well  if you can wait for him to be okay until February or March have at it I can't I'm not a long-term stash guy in any format I know I had to head it's like well maybe I can survive it without it and I get this big bump going into my playoffs  there's no guarantee you get the bump anyway  I know fuddy-duddy best briefs back at it again  but I'm just not in favor of stashing super young dudes and hoping that they figured out part way now it is mid-January so you're kind of looking at it like well can I make it to the all-star break  three four weeks sitting on him  bad  he's hurting your way more than these helping almost every single night so I had to head he's losing you stuff wrote oh if you want to just plop him on your bench okay  that's fine I guess that's okay I'm okay with that but again there's no guarantee that he just comes out of the break and understands NBA speed  a lot of young guys do start to get better during those last few weeks but not all of them  let's very quickly look at the five games tonight since it's such a short card I and we have a minute or two here to briefly dive in on it what do we watching for tonight Washington is at New York Daniel Gafford isn't concussion protocol so my assumption is that he's out for this game I don't think it's been made official yet but presumably that's on its way someone asked me if I'm picking up Marvin Bagley I mean you know one day ahead to head stream you could there's no guarantee he gets more than 22 minutes though anyway so I'm not too risky  for the Knicks I don't think you're making any real adjustments here we mentioned earlier in the show the whole Demon chenzo versus Josh Hart thing  still on team Dante right now  Chicago start the starters these days Toronto is do we see Bruce Brown we don't have a ruling on that as of this morning so keep an eye on that if he's in he probably ruins whatever we were getting out of Gary Trent I still think that Trent is worth holding  probably now through the All-Star break just to see what happens because I mean it might not take until the full three weeks for the Raptors to move Bruce Brown somewhere else or they might not at all a lot of times the stash stuff doesn't pan out a lot of times like 80 to 90% of the time or more it doesn't pan out but that's one that could and would be good Oklahoma City I I just I feel like she needs to take a game off but it doesn't seem like he wants to so this should be a fun one up in Utah Salt Lake City Jazz have been rolling you guys know I'm playing three guys for the Jazz until someone changes my opinion on that maybe call it three and a half because Jordan Clarkson is sort of a play while he's hot nude and he's been hot lately so you can play them but Kessler for all the blocks so many blocks and then marketing and sex in the two very clear place for the Jazz Memphis is in Minnesota this could be ugly if the Grizzlies are if the Wolves I should say actually take this game seriously do these this  like a lot of drum of young guys in Memphis do they finally get it handed to them or and this will happen a lot teams are not going to take the Grizzlies seriously because they're not a serious team right now they're down the entire organization like minus JJJ who's still alive so teams are gonna be like look we're going we could beat this team going at 80 70 60  most times veteran NBA players would rather just Coast for an entire game then play really really hard for two and a half to three quarters I don't know why my guess as someone who is not in the NBA is that it actually takes more energy to go really really hard for a third 25 minutes than it does to go math for like 33 even though it's five to eight additional minutes if you're just kind of cruising it's just not sapping their strength the same way so you probably see a lot of that and Minnesota did a little bit of that against Detroit and there's kind of no reason why they will crank it up here back at home against Memphis  so do I think the Grizzlies weirdos have an okay game I think they do um I'd like to see Xavier Tillman and Santi Elders lines that's something I'm watching closely also Vince Williams he's been good lately GG Jackson he's gonna blasting out of nowhere what is he doing this one  a lot of these guys are gonna fall on their faces at some point soon because again you know the grind of an NBA season but we're still very early in the oh my goodness who were they phase so enjoy it it sounds like Pasquale's not ready to make his Pacers debut tonight is he's targeting tomorrow so no Bruce Brown Nesmith is questionable he's a game time call Halliburton still out so you probably get a pretty decent line from TJ McConnell you probably get an okay line from someone like a Jalen Smith and you probably get a very usable line from buddy hield I'm sure is gonna want to stick it in Sacramento's I which means he's gonna take 20 shots he might miss 14 of them but he'll taking usage is a heel that you'd want to start and I'm gonna assume that if niece Smith is back out again then buddy would all be starting but you're gonna probably wait on line ups for the late game to make that final call and that's for Sacramento Kevin heard her I think is the only note there he is notoriously one of the streaky shooters in the NBA that no one talks about being super streaky because with apologies no one really cares in  the fantasy space about Kevin herder because most of the time he's Bland and annoying to roster but when he gets hot you get like two weeks where it's useful last year Keegan Murray was not aggressive enough as a rookie so herder was able to stretch those hot streaks longer because the Kings just didn't have an option they had a better option but that better option didn't want to take control Keegan Murray's more willing to take control this year so that's why I heard her is hot stretches are much shorter why he's not a rest of season guy but you can play him when he's running warm for three four five games and then as soon as you see little that shoes on the way down  when it drops get the hell out of Dodge  and that's your Thursday morning show whoops I almost ended the show by accident there without saying bye bye please don't leave me yet I haven't finished I do want to take one quick look at the chat room here see if anybody brought up a point that I didn't address during the program good question here from Denver if Bruce Brown ends up staying in Toronto through the year do you think he plays starters minutes I do think he plays starters minutes my question for Bruce Brown is does he get to do what he was doing in Indy or closer what he was doing in Denver because in Denver he was basically the backup point guard in Indiana they have three point guards they had Halliburton nem hard and teach him a kanal Toronto  doesn't really have any point guards  per se Emmanuel quickly is a scoring point guard Gary Trent is a shooting guard  Scotty Barnes point forward okay but  Bruce Brown's role in Toronto might a little bit more closely resemble what he was doing in Denver to what he was doing in Indiana and so that's a reason that I'm a little bit more interested in Bruce Brown now than I was pre-trade because it did seem like he wasn't gonna get enough boards or assist in Indiana to be fantasy relevant you know don't need him to shoot a bunch and he's not gonna shoot a bunch of Toronto either but if he's more of a ball mover orchestrator you know get a team into their offense a little bit like for Denver he basically did that one Jamal Murray and Nicole yokich were resting last year that could be what he ends up doing in Toronto are you gonna be running a little Point getting quickly and bear it and barns and whoever Trent the basketball okay well do we see an uptick of like one to one and a half assists don't think something huge is not gonna jump by like three but one to one and a half actually makes a difference for these guys that are hovering in the 100 to 140 Reigns one and a half assists and a couple extra minutes a game or a couple extra touches that could be enough to push a guy inside the top 100  and I think let's see that I'm doing a quick scan here I know this isn't the best for audio only people  someone asked if I prefer scoot or Nesmith Nesmith by quite a lot  um do do do do do are we expecting a shutdown on Terry Rozier know I'm expecting him to get traded  he's a very much a trade candidate  there are a lot of teams that could use a scoring guard who can also run some backup point and I think he'd be rejuvenated getting the hell out of Charlotte numbers would be worse but I think you'd get a motivated Rozier so that  you know he would take a hit fantasy wise  but I wouldn't be I think they move him for something like a holding on him for Charlotte right now is is flat out nuts unless they're just like oh we're gonna magically be good next year  if I think Mi bridge is becomes a free agent and you know that the Hornets are a mess a couple of stash related questions keyonte George know I don't think you I think Utah's making a run at a play in spot so they're gonna play everybody just the way they have been stash Brogdon know his his situation likely gets worse he probably goes to a contender to be a backup point guard and you know looking at low to mid-20s and minutes on such a team you could think of a lot of teams that could really use a guy like Brogden to come in and and run a second unit settle things down I think of the Rockets actually as a team that could badly use another offensive weapon and is and has no offensive depth of any kind you know he'd have enough of a role there but he is his role would not get better than what it is important right now while one of the key guys is out now the thing that could happen if he goes to like the Rockets or and the same person in the chat room asking if he goes to the Heat or something like that  there's probably not quite enough for him to do but here's the thing about Brogden you're playing him right now because shaedon Sharpe is out for one and a half to two more weeks so this question is a little bit loaded in that you don't have to stash him because you can start him  if he was if Brogden was behind everyone in Portland like say sharp was healthy and Malcolm was playing 14 minutes I'd say no um but the nice thing is  you just get to play them  he's an active stash right now and now shark sharp comes back like seven six seven days before the deadline then Sure hold on to Brogden because he might get traded in four or five days from that point  so absolutely at that point but this is sort of an interesting timeline question you have to think about the fact that he's actually useful right now  it sounds like Tyrese Halliburton actually has a chance to play tonight we don't have any finality on that but that would certainly ruin any of the other point guard streams in Indiana I don't there's nothing settled yet but he has a shot we're at we're at we're at has a shot right now so keep your eye on that news as well and the other news of the day is that the Mavs Warriors game tomorrow has been postponed to a later date as well due to the tragic passing of the Warriors assistant coach we talked about on yesterday's podcast so I said absolutely some sad news  so that ball game is postponed the Warriors will eventually have a very loaded up schedule here when they reschedule the two games that got pushed Mavs and Jazz are the other teams that have been impacted this by this so far so they'll also have kind of a revamped and somewhat overloaded schedule later on that's actually something to think about  I don't  I don't  I really don't want to get into it now because this is such a fresh and tragic occurrence  but there will be at some point down the line and opportunity to try to get warriors on your fantasy team if they now have two one two three however many games end up getting postponed here additional games down the stretch but it really don't want to get into that because this is this is pretty fresh and pretty sad and I I just I don't want to get too much into the fantasy ramifications because that's callous and  yeah it's just gross let's wrap this thing up we're over 50 minutes in thank you to everybody that joined us live thank you to everybody that
