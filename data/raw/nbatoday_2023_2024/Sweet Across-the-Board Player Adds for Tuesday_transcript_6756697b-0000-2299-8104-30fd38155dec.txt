welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast warming up people  Springtime springtime's here actually I have no idea if it's warming up another parts of the country but it's pretty warm in Southern California today  73 outside right now but to check the oil  weather yeah there you go  78 wow that's the daily High that's that's toasty man I'm not ready for that but you may know that notice  if you're watching that it's t-shirt Dan today not hooded sweatshirt Dan hopefully we've retired hoodie Dan for the foreseeable future  this is Tuesday's edition of fantasy NBA today I'm your host Dan Bass Pros same as usual  this is a sports ethos.com presentation and we have nothing to recap  which  guess we ought to get used to that because starting on well I mean  okay you know what that's not fair because  I was gonna say starting on Monday we have nothing to recap but actually starting on Monday we have a whole frickin season to recap  it's not really until like June  that we run out of things to recap around here which is what I want to start the show with a reminder to please all of you that have been listening at any point this season if this show or I Sports ethos my Twitter whatever it is if any of that has helped you this season please subscribe to the podcast please take 20 seconds to drop a five star review on it  I also put a tweet out and  you know what screw it I'm gonna I'll throw it up on the screen it is 100% self-serving 100% there's no sugar coating that it's like that's basically all that it is right now but there is a point to it  this is the tweet that I'm talking about for folks that are watching live I asked anybody that I had helped and I guess doing this when everybody's kind of tuned out on fantasy NBA wasn't the greatest time stamp for me but it's still got over 400 people replying to it so that's kind of cool if anybody that if I've helped you please go find this tweet and please go like it  not because I feel like I need you guys to tell me that I'm doing a good job I actually don't care about that part I like to continue to win but it's it has nothing to do actually with knowing that with me feeling like I need you guys some sort of  push it's actually because and you can see it in the message I plan on dming every single person  that likes that tweet  to ask a very small favor as we head into this offseason and then rolling kind of towards the beginning of next year I threw the link to the Tweet up on the screen for those that are watching I don't know how I would do it for you guys that are listening after the fact I could try to put it in the show description I guess maybe that's the way to go  yeah you know what I'm gonna do that right now while I'm talking to you go here's the tweet I was talking about that's what's going to go in the show description  there we go easy peasy it's saved it's gonna go in there no problemo  please do drop a like on that because I'm gonna ask you guys a favor and it's gonna be a big one to help the podcast so that's why and it's a small favor I've certainly asked you to do it already you guys know what it's gonna be but this way I can kind of Reach Out Shake some hands say hello to people one-on-one if you guys have questions or whatever it's not gonna be easy to keep up over 400 separate Twitter conversations but I'm gonna do my damn best as far as today goes and and the reason that I'm feel comfortable kind of starting slowly on today's podcast is that we don't have that much stuff to talk about today we have an upcoming card a 14 gamer where we will obviously look at some of these kind of replacement guys and who's been a big jump up over the last couple of games and what that means for tonight and frankly for the rest of this week  it's also worth mentioning here a little schedule of thing I did that show yesterday that was all about the the week ahead which is basically tomorrow and Thursday it was the only two days that matter this whole stinking week you know what ever  but this is how we carry ourselves to the end this is how we get to the end of the line  I will also of course take a look at the chat room because again when we have these shows where there isn't a whole lot on the docket  we got a chance to do a couple other stuff um first thing I want to talk about is the schedule because I know we did a show separately on that yesterday I don't know how many of you guys managed to watch that one but if you didn't the point of the schedule discussion was just to point out the fact that first of all today's 14 games so you're overloaded so that you should definitely not be using any moves today you want to be utilizing for head-to-head you want to just make sure that you get 10 active guys and your lineup however that requires you to juggle players in and out depending on start times and stuff like that  tomorrow there are four teams  or remember Wednesday and Thursday that don't play the Pacers the Lakers the Sixers and the Wizards if you have any fringy players on those teams in a head-to-head format Wednesday is when you abandon ship because after that point you're on all overload days meaning you might not get to use them anyway  you can also take a player that doesn't play on Thursday  does play on Wednesday doesn't play on Thursday and swap them out after Wednesday for a player that goes on Thursday because everyone that plays Thursday plays Thursday Friday Sunday  that's kind of all you need to know about the schedule this week basically you should be using all of your weekly moves on Wednesday and Thursday again if you have any of those four teams Pacers Lakers Sixers Wizards abandoned ship on Wednesday this is a head-to-head discussion not a rotor discussion just for a moment here on the show and then let's say you have one guy there you'll use a move on Wednesday you'll use another move on Thursday so that's two of your four weekly moves and then if you have two guys say that go Wednesday but not Thursday swap them out on Thursday for two guys that go Thursday Friday Sunday those are your four weekly moves Bing Bang Boom each move you make should get you one additional gameplay this week There's no way to do better than that you're gonna have to just take my word for that or go back and watch our second show from yesterday where I explained it in excruciating detail and that's how you stream the final week  honestly the most important thing you do this final week is probably gonna be watching your game time decision dudes today Friday and Sunday  because if you tune out like thinking about the schedule today which will throw it up on the screen for everybody to see  you can see that there are three games of start at 4 Pacific time to start a half an hour after that five that started a half an hour after that which is kind of like your big initial wave that's 10 of the 14 ball games going to either four four 30 or 5 and you got an hour layoffs to the Mountain Time game in Utah and then you got another hour layoffs to the three Pacific Time games in Portland Phoenix in Los Angeles what does that mean well you know you really have to be locked in for that first hour and five minutes basically from 3:55 to 5 p.m. Pacific time you want to be in front of your computer because any of those guys get ruled out on your team and that's going to be the bulk of your dudes playing tonight go to your schedule if you don't believe me unless you the rare team is probably gonna be like one out of every 15 16 teams that has a bunch of guys going late most of your guys  are gonna go between four and five pm  for instance and this is a team that actually is I would say pretty heavily West Coast base I have looking at the team now I have how many one Clipper two sons on this team  and a blazer on a 15 player roster like I got four Pacific Time dudes on that roster and still when I look at my guys let's see one two three four five  six seven  eight nine ten of the 15 players I can see two of them are on the injured list kawaii being one of them those guys are going early  so like there's a possibility that I could fill up all 10 of my starting slots between four and five pm and frankly there are arguments to be made to do that if the later guy isn't a bona fide Superstar because again the worst thing that can happen to you today Friday and Sunday on the head-to-head side is accidentally getting stuck say  you know if you're not watching and you play an early guy that's out crap you can't get him out of your lineup or waiting on a later guy who gets ruled out later in the evening  you just don't want to take zeros  that's the big thing  so in addition to using each roster move this week to gain one game so there's your four games you could lose four games in a night if you're not paying attention to who gets ruled out  at 3:55 and 425 and 4505  specifically  and then okay fine like you know you want to do a quick check-in on that Utah Denver altitude game but then you want to make sure you're sort of reporting back in at 6:56 5055 something like that for the late one  and it's a pretty similar story see if we can get back over to Friday schedule here it's a pretty similar story on Friday where you've got 15 games and 11 of them go well there's that Detroit Dallas game that goes at 5:30 10 of those go between four and five PM Pacific Time one half an hour later so if you can extend that window and then you've got sort of an even later chunk of Sacramento the Clippers the Lakers don't have a home game that day but if they did they would also started at 7:30 instead of seven so it's the same phenomenon  Sunday is different because it's Sunday and the games were broken up into the eastern and western conference start times all the Eastern Conference home games start at 10 a.m. Pacific Time all of the Western Conference ones started 12:30 Pacific time because they want to make sure that these teams can not really watch each other they want them all to be as competitive as possible and honestly it's a good idea so Tuesday Friday in particular Sunday is an easier one because you just set your watch for two different start times make sure your guys are healthy and in the lineup  let's play it back to Tuesday because now the main part of today's discussion if we can call it that in addition to take checking out the chat room is talking about some of the players that have popped up over the last couple of days so let's just go through the calendar of the game tonight and will mention any players that I think have a really interesting shot at value  and I spilled water on my keyboard again I don't know if I can do anything about it because if I hit a button and accidentally turn off the broadcast we're just gonna have to let that water you know what we're gonna tip the keyboard sideways right here on are you guys can watch me dump out the water off my keyboard  we'll just hold that upright well I do the next part of the show I know  a little bit  struggling these days Detroit right out of the Chute is a great option  and you guys know I've been pushing me to down your throats for a couple of weeks now and he's really coming into his own over the last two weeks  over the last two weeks made two is a top 40 fantasy asset in 30 minutes of ball game is averaging 11 points 6 boards almost two assists two and a half steals Point 8 blocks on 53 and 100 splits with just one point five turnovers per game and if you're like gay and that's not sustainable I will say to you you're absolutely right but you know what doesn't need to be  it doesn't need to be did Detroit has four games left this year that's all you need from sustainability you know I don't need to go  I don't need everything to be local I was gonna make a sustainability joke but I'm too busy trying to clean water out of my keyboard I don't I don't need me to be good for a month I need him to be good for a week  heaters last longer than that all the time Jalen Greene was hot for the entire month of March  not so much here in the month of April by the way  what about you over the last seven days he gotten better gotten worse better it's better he's shooting 67% over the last three games  unforce deals per ball game okay yeah obviously he's not gonna keep that up but he's been really good  and provided Detroit doesn't try to throw him at Joel embiid which is a possibility but hopefully Jalen Duren and James Wiseman were both there to absorb a lot of those fouls made two should be playing Power Forward dealing with the likes of Nick Patton or Toby's Harris if he's in there  not a guy that's gonna foul him out  in half a ball game  we hope  so met you an awesome awesome choice right out of the Chute again I don't think you can expect him to be a you know second or third round guy  but there really is nothing that says he can't post a second round line in this next ball game like the last ball game is as good as it gets he went nine for nine shooting 20.7 boards three assists three steals two three pointers you've been amazing but this Deal's number is all by themselves have really lifted him and the fact that he's been in double digit scoring in two of his last four the rebounds are up at six now  and change instead of slightly lower than that the minutes have been trending up there's just a lot of stuff to like  failing nobody really that you could scoop up Indiana you guys know I've been pushing TJ McConnell for a while he's in a steals rut right now which is kind of weird because that's been like the thing for him and yeah I still don't really care because even with the steals completely abandoning him he still inside the top 25 or top 125 excuse me over the last two weeks he still taught 90 over the last one week and that's with one steal over that week  because she's shooting 69% from the field and he's averaging 15 and 7  field goals don't come down steals will come up he just been chucking sort of  trucking along here for a month now  there's just there's just a lot to like about it we're one or two big steals games away from us looking at these numbers and seeing that this is crazy I think that my camera may have glitched out I don't know if that's actually the case but we're gonna keep talking my computer did a weird reload thing while I was talking just a minute ago and I I think the camera may have chunked out if you guys are watching and you have access to the chat room please let me know if indeed the camera has gone on the fritz  I think it has and I don't really know what to do about it  technical difficulty day here on the broadcast that's for darn sure all right let's get let's get everything back up on the board where we were looking at before I had to do a quick reset of the old web Camaro so yeah not a whole lot in Indy outside of the McConnell thing that we've been talking about for a while Toronto is mostly the main dudes I don't think you want to go too far beyond them all we do know that they're going to be resting guys in the back to back I believe we've already  is it quickly that's out on the front end of this back to back do it double check on that so make sure I'm giving you guys the right information yeah manual quickly is out on the front end of this back-to-back RJ Barrett is in Kelly Olynyk is in there you go all right so those are your guys I I don't think you go really beyond that and a good thing you can check out too is as you're looking back through some of the numbers you can just go to these teams most recent ball game and take a quick peek and say all right I did somebody deserve another look and the Toronto's last ball game you can see very clearly that quickly a linik and Gary Trent were the three guys that needed to be played and so if Trent is in then fire them up you know and bear it is a points League guy you're not gonna go any farther than him nine cat you're not using RJ Barrett anyway it's not like you're gonna play a bogey you're not playing Bruce Brown you're not playing Grady even if you play so that's where you're at with the Toronto Raptors a Dallas nobody really um you know you're going with the main dudes now if Kyrie gets ruled out you could probably throw Tim Hardaway Jr at this but you kind of have to wait and and feel that one out Charlotte's been a really interesting one lately Grant Williams would be the guy that I would say is worthy of frankly all formats games cap I throw them out their head-to-head I'd throw them out there over the last week since he's basically been become the center and Nick Richards was back in the last ball game and still came off the bench Grant Williams is shooting 52% from the field 86% of the free throw line two threes 14-5 and 8 assists over this stretch points 7 steals point seven blocks that's never really gonna be the thing for Grant well Williams you just kind of hope that if he plays enough minutes he'll find his way to a steal but getting threes on a high percentage with rebounds and assists it's really hard to turn down so I like Grant Williams a lot for Charlotte right now Treman vasilia said those guys are probably outside on the Roto games cap  form of things but they each have their kind of head-to-head targets and that's basically as far as you go on the streamers there Boston is a team where we should be watching for possible rule out so we know they're going to be trying to get everybody rest here and my Hope was that by the time we did this show that there'd be a little bit more injury news today but there hasn't been outside of the Thunder really that's been kind of the news of the day and we'll get to them a little bit later on so Boston keep an eye on the situation like if Al Horford gets an opportunity or if a backcourt players down you can go with Payton Pritchard Milwaukee nobody Miami nobody they've got their main dudes back Atlanta nobody  Washington is interesting um if kuzma is out you're going Corey kispert I'm still not quite comfortable  going Beyond kispert with the Wizards we had to just left the window up on that Washington Toronto game since we were just talking about Toronto Tristan vukovich excuse me is questionable with knee soreness so we don't even know if he's gonna be in there or Sean Holmes has been questionable for two weeks  he could reappear Patrick Baldwin had a good ball game last time out but that hasn't been consistent Jared Butler was bad last time out but he was good the one before that honestly I just need another guy out for Washington I would love it if we could get Rashawn Holmes back in the mix I would love it well Denny obviously a start and Jordan Poole's a start if he's playing and kiss Birds it's hard if kuzma's out if pool sits I think Jared Butler would be really interesting but we haven't really seen any information to suggest that pool is going to sit so I don't know why I get so caught up on it I just want to see Jared Butler  Minnesota Nas Reid has been rolling for a while I don't know that you're going  I don't think you're going Kyle Anderson outside of you know category hunting next heaven and Obey back so that knocks out the deuce McBride stream so your back to kind of like the main dudes there Chicago if anybody's out on Andre Drummond is the play will see what the deal is with Alex Caruso having gotten in a specific update on him just yet but you know Drummond would be a rebound stream even if they're healthy the nice thing there is that if somebody's out then he becomes just sort of like a generalized play Spurs are a fun one because you've got Julian champagne who has been very good lately and kind of frankly built in the same fantasy structure as metu who we just talked about but hasn't done quite as much of that stuff but champagne over the last week he's number 42 in nine cats 78 from the free throw line so met whose percentages been better over that stretch but champagne has been beating him in blocks in three-pointers still when you compare this this stat line of these two guys they're they're remarkably similar over that strike in that they tend to be decent at percentages maybe not you know World beaters fluctuating between not hurting you all that much and helping a little bit  champagne is going to win the three-pointers game they're gonna be very similar in points boards in a sis Matthew has been ahead and steals champagne he's been ahead in blocks but like  these are guys that fill in a lot of gaps in lineups  for Roto you're getting  big time wins in the defensive stats you're getting guys they can give you League average to to I mean for champagne he's basically been almost right on League averaging points boards and assists and then pretty close to Lee averaging field goal percent ever so you below it and free throw and ever so slightly above it in three and then a winner in steals blocks and turnovers up that's like we talked about if your league averaging everything you're like a 70/75 range guy and the fact that he's above it in you know four categories and only below it slightly basically in one yeah I mean that's a guy who's better than 75 and I know people like Dan what if I you know what if I'm category hunting does he really helped me all that much the answer is well it depends on what category you're hunting yeah you're gonna find somebody out there who can probably get you more than three assists of all game but you're not gonna find many dudes out there that can get you three assists per game  or more than three assists per game that aren't hurting in a couple of things that's why the math works out  and there's been so much discussion this year again about what is a rank even really mean the rank is telling you okay how does the math work out is the good better than the bad for this guy and if the good is better than the bad there you there sort of top 75 or higher  and then there's this window of guys where the good and the bad kind of cancel each other out and that's like 75 to 125 and then you get into guys where the bad kind of outweighs the good  this time of year sometimes you can play a bad outweighs the good guy if you badly need the one category they're good at or two categories they're good at and the ones they're bad at don't really hurt you but that's only because the last two to three weeks of the Season you can create such a laser focused hyper punt which is like I'm hunting six categories right now you know which doesn't mean that you're only trying to win three but in Roto or head to head sometimes that's the way you can play it you could say look I'm so far ahead in two categories that I can affectively punt those on whatever my roster moves are it's not a team punt it's a moves punt  does that make more sense  like in the beginning of the Season you can put one category in Roto and maybe get away with it better to not to but you could head to head you could punch two sometimes even three and get away with it  and at the end of the year the guys you pick up the players you stream you could punch five six things because the rest of your team and this is easier to visualize I think on the Roto side but you can visualize it for both if we really sort of extend our free our minds as cuarto taught us in Total Recall  so take it wrote an example  you know I'll just go across the board saying field goal free throw percent in threes you're so far out in front of the teams behind you you don't even have to be in first place you just created like a buffer window where if you did a lot in those categories you still wouldn't catch anybody and if you did almost nothing in those categories nobody would catch you  they basically don't exist  you're gonna get nine field goal percent points and six free throw percent points and 11 3 pointer Point whatever it is and you just not gonna move the last week of the Season no matter what you do you're not gonna move  effectively that means that for the next six days you can just punt that category  or all three of them  okay and then you look at some of the other ones and you're like all right well you know these two are ones where I can gain some ground if I hyper focus on them  and all of a sudden now you'll find categories  I guess you have six no sorry let me do the math here all right so you've three where it doesn't matter to that you're attacking four more that are sort of you're competing  so that's six effectively that are still relevant but two that are more so so what you want to do in a situation like that is figure out how important those four other ones are  but that's why a guy like champagne makes a lot of sense because he's decent in a lot of this stuff you know I'm gonna worry about him hurting you  what happens if you get hurt in those other categories now it becomes this Roi play okay so I want to gain ground in points and rebounds those are the ones that I really want to focus on but I want to make sure that I don't lose any ground and assists and Steals and I have some wiggle room in blocks and turnovers or something like that so  you're out there and you're just hunting for a player who's very good in two things and not awful in two things and then you don't care about the other five and so you've effectively now made a roster move with a five category punt  that's what you can get away with it this time of year  I don't know why I ended up talking about this when we were on a Julian champagne cake but basically just like where math no longer matters is where we're at right now so guys ranked 170th might actually make sense for your team but you can find a guy ranked 45th in all likelihood he's probably gonna be more useful for your club like you know 99 times out of 100 except for the very rare occurrence where you're like no I don't need anything that he's even decent at I only need the categories he's terrible at so or not great at so for champagne it's like if you were a laser focused on free throw percent then obviously yes that's not  anyway uh Memphis this is the game where I want to see who plays because I think we're probably gonna see the same Grizzlies lineup the rest of the way and the last one we saw them put together you know we got like six new faces out there  but  it's a little bit in my eyes kind of nerve-racking to say yes we need to immediately go use those two because number one they're probably gonna get blown out by most of the teams they play  but number two like some of these guys are not even on a regular contract  zavier Simpson just signed another 10 day  Pereira his 10-day expired I have no idea who's gonna play for the Grizzlies I would assume that Brandon Clarke is gonna get 20 to 25 minutes somewhere in that neck of the woods so he's probably playable  Trey Jamison I think there's better guys out there if you're looking for points and boards GG Jackson is is an example of a player we just described which is like do I just want points okay is he gonna be good enough in the other stuff probably not  the guys that I would want to play in Memphis would be Jordan Goodwin and Scottie Pippen Jr those are the guys that I'm looking at for the game tonight again I don't know that I'm playing any of these dudes other than maybe Brandon Clark because I really want to get a feel for what they're going to be  now if I think this ball game tonight is gonna give us a whole lot of information on the Grizzlies and I think we're gonna get to use that as this week kind of muddles along especially because they play again tomorrow so for the head to headers that makes a lot of sense because you could get a boring or a quiet game day out of Memphis but I would say let's not overextend ourselves yet  or Lando I don't care Houston nothing really there Sacramento you know whether or not you want to play key on Ellis for a few boards a few assists and a good shot at defensive stats okay Thunder they've got some news this morning and the news is that shade just Alexander is off  the injury replacement or the injury list huzzah Jalen Williams was also a participant in shoot around so it's possible that the Thunder get both of their studs back uh  great that means we don't have to worry about the fringy guys we don't have to worry about Lou Dortmund have to worry about Josh giddey if those guys all come back go back to playing the usual dudes Denver no Utah look man Utah so rough right now  Collins Sexton is a jazz you can play  and that might be it  keonte George has been so bad from an efficiency standpoint he hasn't been playable Taylor Hendricks has not shown a consistent Fantasy game yet so he's not playable Omar Yurts event was the one that I thought might be playable but he only got 19 minutes in their last ball game and kind of got played off the floor but he would probably give you field goal percent and rebounds at the very least and then you're kind of watching Johnny juzang who had 27 points on 73 but he didn't really do anything else right sensible Bob mostly a score also they're just hasn't been a guy that's popped up on Utah yet where I've been like oh that guy can do a few things  most these guys do like one thing and that's why I've been watching Yurts event because at least if he gets 25 minutes he could probably do two or three things but I would watch the Utah game I don't think I want to take the plunge there Pelicans nah Portland I think we have a pretty good idea lately it's DeAndre ayton and Delano Banton as the only two guys that have been consistently playable for Portland been just because getting enough usage where  it overwhelms the efficiency stuff  keep an eye on Jabari Walker he's a rebounds stream right now screwed Henderson is an assist stream but both those guys have these big gaps in their Fantasy game that they haven't really shown signs of overcoming this season but they're more specialisti than anything else Clippers nobody's replacing Kawhi Leonard these days Phoenix has their starters Warriors I would assume that Steph is back I don't know about Andrew Wiggins but I'm not taking the plunge on any fringy guys there and then the Lakers likely to have their main dudes back which means is really playable maybe yeah probably and that's okay  that's your card for tonight you guys probably where to put the the pieces together on which of those dudes I like the most but metu in Detroit is one I like the most and these are these are the low roster ship guys obviously there's dudes in between that I kind of like as well deeply you'd go Marcus Sasser by the way I didn't mention him before because he's not very good but deeper leagues you go that way Toronto you're just going with the main dude so Olynyk Trent points League giggle Barrett Charlotte there's that's a fun one I like the Grant Williams stream right now Boston if you've got a fill in that would be a good spot to deploy it  Washington keep an eye on things but kiss Bert with kuzma out is worth the play drumming could be a fun one in Chicago champagne and San Antonio oh Dan you didn't talk about Malachi Branham is what you probably should have said yeah he's really just a points League guy for me or if you're stat hunting scoring basically Grizzlies I really want the data from this ball game Utah I'm still waiting  Portland maybe somebody emerges and that's kind of the spots where we're at for tonight tomorrow we will do our best to recap a 14 game card so buckle up for that one quick check of the chat room here since we're about half an hour in and and that means I've got you know five to ten minutes to spare I need to bench one today any thoughts Brook Lopez versus Boston window Carter Junior versus Houston TJ McConnell versus Toronto Kelly Olynyk versus the Pacers or Trey Jones versus the Grizzlies who are you benching well I mean you've got some pretty different categories you're looking for like if you need blocks you can't bench Brooke Lopez but if you don't then he would be a pretty easy decision as I would think the guy to bench um if you don't need boards you could probably bench window Carter Jr if you don't need to sis you could probably bench McConnell or trade Jones I don't think there's any way benching a Linux because he's been too good at too many things at this point  to me it really just comes down to what stats you need  if you're just looking for like who's probably gonna have the worst game of this Bunch it's probably either Wendell Carter Junior or TJ McConnell but like  what they do is so different it's so different hey Dan I ended up second in my league over the weekend thanks for the content all season I've been here since early on Switched from Josh to you appreciate your grind this season you're welcome bud happy to have you born  should I bench herb Jones to activate SGA off the IR  I mean her really your worst guy  obviously you need to get Shay back in there so do something um  but  be ashamed of her was your worst  do you think Kauai comes back is it safe to drop him I mean you got a hold Got a Hold he's he's aisle eligible  and even if he comes back for part of the week  James Harden by the way didn't participate in the Clipper shoot around either I  maybe they're being Coy and maybe he's badly heard and maybe this is like end of the line for Kawaii but I can't Advocate dropping a top five player  it's five games in a row though whoo  so today's the front end of a back-to-back hopefully we'll have more on Kawaii tomorrow he was almost definitely not gonna play in this back to back anyway with the playoffs approaching he played in a bunch earlier this season but there were no reason to do it now uh you know I think if he gets ruled out tomorrow then I would probably be okay with the drop but I don't think I would do it today because it's an overload day anyway like you don't need to pick someone up today  stream which guys for the next two days Nick Richards trade Jameson Malachi Branham  needs and threes boards and threes huh  I'm not sure any of those guys give you that right combination of things  Malachi Branham is your safest bet at threes at the very least not I don't know that either the two guys other two guys is all that safe bet on boards  so it's probably Branham  Jameson would be my second choice  super low gamecap this week with the two off days sit or played any of the today with a tough matchup I need boards and while I'm trying to maintain over some field goal percent at least probably gonna hurt you and turn over his and maybe her chin field goal percent but he's gonna probably have a pretty big game because the Wizards just like they don't have anybody left these days oh Fiddlesticks  uh I'm not good with the DFS calls this is basically a DFS call  I think I play him and assumed the Wolves don't take this game that seriously  the only way I can lose is if my opponent sits all their players on the last day and I start mine but if I don't start mine I will probably lose how do you navigate that what  I presume that means that you lose  if you lose turnovers and the percentages  I mean couldn't you just start some of your guys on the last day the ones that are good at percentages and maybe aren't going to have a ton of turnovers  it's an impossible question  to sign I add toes on for the quality game the guy was rolling and now he has a g League of assignment  do I think he plays tomorrow oh place Thursday sorry I missed I read the question wrong I think he plays Thursday yeah I do  but I don't know why you added someone that plays Thursday today Thiago you really needed to wait on that don't ever add a guy super early on the last week of the season ever  in fact no one should have been making any moves today at all  unless you have less than 10 guys going but there's like no reason that should be  what about Javonte green on the Bulls um I have no trust there at all specially if Caruso plays so I wait and see if Caruso gets ruled out if he gets ruled out you could maybe go jevonte he's not gonna be as hot as he was his last two ballgames  I don't have full trust their  huge fan Dan thanks Patrick definitely gonna stick around for the offseason and you all should can't wait to see what you're going to have for us so I'll be honest with you guys some of the shows are going to be really good in the offseason and some of the shows are going to be stupid but you know what  that's what it takes that's like it's like 100 shows ish I think in the off-season we're gonna have a lot of really interesting ones we're gonna break down all 30 teams those will be fun ones we're gonna have some really good shows where we talk about the day and best for soul man squad in review we'll talk about the Yahoo board and review then we'll have these sweet free agency shows and then we're gonna have this stretch in like mid-july where we have nothing to talk about  I'll be totally honest with you guys if I wasn't so intent on doing a show every single day I would just take two weeks off in the middle of July and come back for you know Vegas summer league or whatever the hell is coming after that but yeah it's gonna be a fun off season I really appreciate you guys that are subscribed and and hanging out with us today  hey Dan love your vids thanks Jordan I appreciate that should I play Caruso OG&E Dilo Reeves today I need boards blocks and feel gold percent I'm thinking D-Lo Is Not Gonna Get You boards or blocks or field goal percent so probably not the guy for the category is your hunting for  Alex Caruso is the guy that would probably get you blocks and feel goal percent of the names you listed if he's healthy enough to go if he's not you could go for boards  and blocks and the second choice there would be OG probably Reeves is in a deep deep shooting slump and he doesn't block shots anyway so I don't know that he get maybe some rebounds because the Lakers have been doing a better job of game rebounding lately but I don't think you go to the Lakers for the categories you're hunting for my favorite again would be Caruso if he's playing if he's not I think I'd probably go and a nobby and pray that he's healthy enough to make it through the ballgame  oh Ryan says managed to win it all with Lillard and Mikhail Bridges as my top two picks thanks for the content you know what that's the thing so Mikhail bridge is gonna get and rightfully so blasted for his terrible per game production this season number 87 per game right now  but he has played in 79 ball games which like okay does that artificially inflate his value absolutely but is it important to actually have a guy that plays in every ball game hugely important specially this time of year  even a bad line is better than no line and so that's why bridge is top 50 by totals and yes obviously if you drafted him it like 25 you're going to be really annoyed that he's 50th by totals and 80 something per game that's bad that's not a good year but he didn't hurt you as much as some of the guys drafted near the top that just missed a ton of ball games  like Joel and beat his ranked 52nd he's right next to Michael bridges in overall ranking but indeed missed your whole fantasy playoffs most likely unless you've finished up with a very end of this last week  Roto it's kind of a different discussion you want the guy putting up the big big big big big individual lines but for head-to-head if you have guys that are just out there  on the court  you can win even if they're underperforming per game is number 14 by totals  he's been relatively healthy this year not mikal Bridges healthy but like Damian Lillard number 22  if you drafted him I still thought he should have been going like closer to 14 so I still would have taken him too high but he started going at like nine because everybody had convinced themselves that he was going to be totally fine next to Giannis know he was never gonna have as much usage there and Milwaukee as he had in Portland but number 22 and playing almost all the time doesn't kill your team that's the key you just don't want to lose in your first couple picks  you know who lost you a league  lamelo ball  if you dropped a little ball in the first round you basically had no shot to win your league most of the other guys drafted in the first round  you shot  even Dame who was sort of the underperformer of that bunch  second round most of those guys  were healthy enough where you were competitive  even Jaron Jackson also a victim of a Down year  by the way managed to kind of pull it together here towards the end he got up to number 50 per game and he's right around that same Mark by totals everybody we're talking about right now is right around 50th per game totals JJ's 55 he's like right behind the guys we were talking about  yeah even he was sort of able to hang in there by a little bit you know who crushed you in the third round  Cade Desmond Bane  by the way the Bane thing is super annoying Darius Garland was really beat up this year  the guys that killed you in those first few rounds aren't always the ones that have super down years it's usually the ones that Miss half a season you can come back from a guy underperforming if their healthy it's really hard to come back especially in head to head from a guy who's just not there all right 45 minutes is enough I think we can all agree thanks for
