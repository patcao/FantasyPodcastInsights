welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast what's happening everybody Big Show today here on this lovely Tuesday morning  March the 26th  2024  I think today actually is the 20 year anniversary of when my wife and I decided to consider ourselves a couple  it was March 26th 2004  holy mackerel that's a long time ago now  old man best for set your service here  hope you guys have a nice day hope the beginning of your week got off to an excellent start yes yesterday hope your fantasy teams had good statistical performance is  for today we will be recapping the pretty damn large Monday card think it was in 11 game or yesterday so near overflow level  maybe kind of sorta  but also  we have a special guest and I get to try out a new technology that I haven't done before  previously recorded video  yes indeed this is a thing I'm told that you can actually record video in advance and then and then play it later  in life this is a thing that you can do someone called me from the 1940s  we're talking to Ryan Ward  coming up here in just a matter of seconds  Lakers expert  at Lakers Nation all so the host of the jello jiggling podcast it's a chick Hearn reference for anybody who doesn't get it and you immediately all disappointed me if you didn't get that basically Ryan and I are gonna get into what's going on with the Lakers are there going to be any rotation changes our guys coming back because remember Jarred Vanderbilt was a fantasy play before he heard his foot again  so we'll dig into that and then we'll come shooting out the opposite end and we'll do a quick recap on yesterday's big 11 game card all that said welcome to the show fantasy NBA Today is a sports ethos.com presentation I am at Dan bestbus over on Twitter I hope you guys will find me over there and again I like to do these shows as if there is one person watching or listening for the very first time so if you're new welcome aboard you came in just in time for us to break down all sorts of stuff but also just in time for me to remind you that we're doing two shows a day right now this one which is the recap show and then slightly later sometimes immediately following a streaming show that focuses exclusively on how to utilize your head to head moves for the week to try to win that play off battle so without further Ado we have a lot going on today I want to see if I can pull this off here is my pre-recorded interview with the great ryann Ward  all right with the preface that I don't know how this technology is going to work today I am trying for the first time to record a video segments and then place it into a different podcast audio listeners you guys are never gonna know any different because this that's easy for me but I'm very excited to try it and more than anything I'm just excited to talk to our guests today Ryan Ward host of the jello jiggling podcast and of course a reporter at Lake Lakers Nation covering the Lakers Ryan what's going on man first of all love the chick Hearn reference as a play by play guy any chick or Vince Gully reference I'm I will drink to that how are you  I'm good I'm good just waiting for the End of This Disaster season well we don't know when the end's gonna be do you before we get into like the nitty-gritty of Lakers stuff what do you think they do when they see I mean they're they're playing team we know that much but right now yeah yeah you think you think Houston's gonna catch him  I don't know man I it's stranger things have happened and they keep it's like I call them the Jacqueline Hyde Lakers because you just don't know what the hell you gonna get from like tonight right it's like one night he played amazing basketball the next it's like they forgot how to play defense completely yeah I was I was at the the Thunder game where LeBron know it was that one after he scored 40,000 his den for right and then they won the next one against the Thunder and they were guarding people for like the last 46 minutes of that ball game it was astounding and then it just then it's just gone the next night what I I it's you know what it's like it's like this is gonna sound so bad  no now you got it  well like you're a father how many kids two two children yeah got help me two kids right so it's like sure you know trying to teach kids right and they get it one day and the next day they completely forget everything yes and there's no logical explanation as to like wait didn't you do it this way yesterday like what did something happen you get did your brother climb into your bed and hit you in the head in the middle of the night and it just gone which possible you know listen I don't know what's going on they make basketball look like golf sometimes like just extremely difficult to play like yeah like come on defense is not that hard well that's actually a great segue to my first question which is  is the only way to save the defense to get any of these injured players back and  you read the tea leaves more than I do are any of these guys coming back because like CBS had a reporter earlier this week that they weren't and then the Lakers were like no no no that's that's premature what's what is reality at this point  well it could just be the Lakers being like oh no no no no no no no they come back just just  to keep you watching right yeah um but we yeah it's it's it's it's it seems like every week it's a different report saying that they're done for the year oh there's a chance to get there doing on court work blah blah blah it's just I remember when Vando went down the last time and I'm like that's it he's done right it's just there's no time to get him back and then get them 100% you know and I think he's like the heart of the defense yeah Anthony Davis right if you have those two together healthy plan 100%  then it changes everything but if it's just leaning on a add all the time  they're just not good defensively yeah well and like at that point you're you're leaving Anthony Davis on an island so right and then you get to all the stuff that everybody's been complaining about which is like why did they give up so many threes one day and then open Rim runs the next day it's because it's like well Anthony Davis can only cover one or the other someone else had to do something  they don't have great envelope Defenders right just have a really good guy in the paint that's it LeBron used to be that guy but he's not anymore no and I feel him because I'm a year older than LeBron and I can't I can't move laterally at all if you don't you don't spend 1.5 million dollars on that's what you think  yeah I spent I spent zero how much did this yoga mat cost I spent 22 dollars on my body this year yeah and there's there's cameras who has flashes of good defense but he's he can't stay healthy I think he's returning tomorrow finally but I I don't think that moves the needle at all you know he's not a game changer know because he can't even he can't catch passes on offense so you sort of need like you can't finish the rim which is amazing to me is an MBA player you know yeah so is anything I guess the big the big looming question is does anything change for this team over the final three and change weeks of the regular season I know folks that are watching my shower like well how does that sort of connect to Fantasy the question is if there's a change could someone else emerge but it really sounds like it comes down to whether or not they're being truthful on Vanderbilt and or Gabe Vincent and you sound skeptical and my my reading  between the line well because I know I've been are in this team for a long time and I know the kind of BS that they throw out there just to keep people interested like they probably know it forever that you know van was not coming back or Gabe's not coming back but I did was a game was it yesterday the day before there was a report that came out that gave Vincent is intent on playing a game  again before the regular season ends and if I were him you know that's a smart move by him because the fan base hates him already just we're feeling those Kendrick Nunn Vibes again I think exactly they're comparing its like the same damn thing comes from the Heat and then just  everything falls apart on his body yeah which is terrible because I think that guy's a good dude and I think he'd really helped the team if you  just bad string along you know but that seems to happen with the Lincoln every year and in the LeBron era it's like they lose two three guys consistently throughout the whole year right and for the first time in a while it's not add or the Bronx yeah it's everybody else which I guess I mean like sorry to jump in I guess that's good news because if it was one of those two guys they'd probably be six games under 500 oh man who knows or Worse bad they would like at least sorry go ahead fantasy from a fantasy perspective adds probably pretty up there right kind of checks a lot of ya top three which is pretty awesome to see him upright this year overall overall yeah cuz he's actually like he's he's number four on a per game basis because Joel embiid is up in that that top group but he obviously hasn't played in a while and so you move him out and Anthony Davis is the number four player in fantasy because he's met he missed only what like five six percent of the game so far that's amazing for him many many yeah it's pretty remarkable it's incredible and how bad have the Lakers been in the games he's missed  oh yeah it's so unfortunate you know it's like you finally get with what you want  but you still don't get what you want ultimate right overall pictures just still blurry I yeah  I'm so I think I speak for all Lakers fans when I say I'm over this I'm over this you know I I would prefer them just to blow it up and start from scratch  well you know I this is what it's going to be this is it it's not gonna get any better and if they go and trade for say trade young which is what I would think they're going to do and summer I don't see that being a real game changer eating  let's talk about that actually what happens how does that how does that trade if it could happen how does it materialize because I admit I don't know anything about how the trade machine works who would they have to give up what is that team end up looking like  I'm sure that you have quite a bit you know Austin Reeves D'Angelo I mean quite a bit and if that's the thing they're gonna get their depth for another star it's like  that didn't work with Westbrook  and you're gonna bring in another guy who demands has that ball in his hands the whole time he's a good he's a great player but I don't I don't think he's a winning player right he's been in Atlanta for how long now and they've been the exact same team ever since he got there yeah I don't know if there's ever been a team that's more consistently middle of the road then then right but it's that same kind of like some of these guys have a high floor and a low ceiling and if you're comfortable with that okay but historically Lakers fans are not comfortable with that  no well thank you sir never comfortable good point there's something to complain about but I guess that's what happens when you win 17 titles right yeah a bit entitled you something expensive the same and other big markets at the same New York I couldn't imagine covering New York man I mean they finally looking up but damn how many years of just despair yeah gonna be rough talking to Ryan Ward LA on Twitter at Ryan Ward La again host of the jello jiggling podcast on the belief Network um Okay so  unfortunately the news I think is nothing is probably changing let's talk just for a second about D'Angelo Russell before we wrap things up he has been both from a reality and a fantasy standpoint a pretty exciting and really nice surprise this year and I personally and and everybody that watches my show they know I'm sort of like a pragmatic Laker fan I don't go draft them and fantasy sports unless I think there's a value to be had there and Dilo ended up being one and I've kind of fallen in love with the dude his postgame interviews are great he's like the most chill guy to hear nothing nothing bothers him anymore have you sort of become a Dilo fan like I have over the last year  yeah because I covered him when he came to like it's the first time and that was rough to say the least I mean  I'm surprised Kobe didn't get on him as much as I thought he would but that last season Kobe's last season he just  he got tore into in the weird year after just got worse with the whole Nick Young Thing and his immaturity was so  obvious and so bad specially in the locker room it's like I told the story recently where I said like I remember one night I was in the locker room and  we're all hooded around delos Locker at the end like you know most of the guys left and he's like laughing and giggling telling the same kind of like stupid joke over and over again to try and get a laugh and it's just crickets right no no player no reporter know nothing wanted to give him anything right and I'm like this and I was thinking myself this guy's done he is done the second that they can trade him he's out right sure enough that's exactly what Magic Johnson did the second season was over how Brooklyn Nets for Brook Lopez and picked it turned out to be calcium  but I I never thought he would change I just thought he was just gonna be these cocky kid with no self-awareness for the rest of his career and then he comes back and he's a completely different guy it's like you just got humbled and you know where was Brooklyn Golden State and then Minnesota Minnesota yeah I mean that's that's got a humble you right and just age you know sometimes you just have to be older  yeah he's got a kid now and a wife and all that so  it's just it's completely different guy and you could just tell from the way what he says and press conference is now he's gonna tell us a kid you know  and he just he channels all that negative energy you need to play on the on the court and you could see it so obvious so I I've been loving it he's been saying the right thing she's got in the respective ad and LeBron and the rest of the guys so I think he's got a break future in La as long as he doesn't blame out in the playoffs because you know in La like yeah all things is a week of really bad basketball and you're back in the house right yeah it's it can be rough do you think he wants to  well I you know he's got what the player option on next year do you think he's you think that's something he considers or do you think he's gonna go try to get a bigger contract believe he's played lately I feel like he's looking for something bigger oh yeah I think he'll do just with LeBron's gonna do opt out and look for a long-term deal right look to get paid and it just depends on  I think the Lakers situation so  50 50 with everything right like oh yeah because you just talked about with the Trey young stuff too that had to that would play a role  like if that it probably hinges on that  if they get Trey young they bring the band back together and probably let Dilo walk right but if they don't  then who knows he literally who knows what a terrifying hellscape Brian  oh it's bad I mean it's bad but good because I do feel like it's time for a change because we're beating a dead horse here like this it's the same result every year and everybody keeps going back oh the bubble Championship was like man that was 2020 but can you believe it's been that long  I know it's kind of crazy but he's been the same results every year since then and all I keep hearing is just wait till we get healthy this is it man this is yeah what you got to do with it if you can't do it now it's not gonna happen yeah it's like it's but the thing is the brand brings in so much money right it's just like Kobe again and his career brings in so much money that it kind of business sense it kind of makes sense to resign him just to keep making that money of course of course but you get a piss everybody off because you're not gonna do anything different you know it's just gonna be the same results and I think LeBron's lost a lot of  Lakers fans recently just because he's not really moving the needle that much yeah it's crazy to think that somebody putting up those numbers is isn't really moving the needle that much but yeah I mean I think Doris Burke on a recent broadcast and then we'll let you get back to your day a little bit here I think she said something like and it was the most broadcaster he super kind way of putting it she was like I think I think the quote was LeBron is the third most steps efficient player in the she said something like that now I was like oh she basically said that he moves the least the bottom three in like terms of actual movement on a basketball court but that's the thing like that's that's how you have to play when you're 39 years old he's an Android to be able to do the things he's still doing but he can't share his guys on defense every night that's just it's not feasible but you know what damn I'm gonna keep watching and I'm gonna keep hoping for more fantasy value to squeeze out of these guys Ryan thank you so much my man I appreciate it this is really exciting I had been following you for a long time it's really cool to get you on the show  yeah no problem man I enjoyed it do whatever you want to do it yeah and we shall because as we all know Lakers playoffs in offseason are also generally somewhat interesting he is at Ryan Ward LA on social media host of the jello jiggling podcast Lakers show on the believe Network Ryan thanks so much my man I'll talk to you soon  no problem  okay so that was awesome big thank you to Ryan Ward we taped that on Friday I have to say not only am I excited that I was able to talk to Ryan because again I've been you guys know I'm a Laker fans so I have been following Ryan  Harrison these guys for forever so very cool to get him on the podcast but also I'm excited about the fact that I mean you guys listening on the audio side right now after the factor like what do you what do you sell it like you've been putting these clips of guys into shows for years that's the first time this episode is the first time I've ever taped it on the video side and been able to drop it into the video playback pretty seamlessly other than the only seam probably being me  saying  here we go guys let's see if this crap works  all right let's get into what went on yesterday how do I  how do I get the new frame up here this this is where this is where the seams come in  there we go boom  seem free  this is our recap part of the show  Charlotte Cleveland Cavaliers nice easy win over a tanking team and Evan Mobley looking more like himself as well as far as Charlotte goes and again quick preface here um We're Not Gonna Be breaking down schedule's per se on this part of the of you know this one of our two episodes you know I might mention them in passing you know say something like oh well Charlene Cleveland play every other day this week but specifically we're not going to be doing oh this is a guy you had for schedule this is a guy you don't I'm going to do my best to try to cover as many bases as I can but these recap shows are really geared more towards guys that you can just sort of a have on your team who's going to be good enough on a given night to use against a roto games cap and then there's that cut off because the guy with a good head schedule doesn't need to be as good each night as someone who doesn't uh but against the games cap you're getting per game ranked that's what matters there  okay  so for Charlotte vasilia mitza she's cooled off here over the last three or four ball games I do think that some of it is just kind of like all right he's played in a couple weeks in a row of decent minute NBA games and it's catching up with him  and there will be a dip and there will be a surge and dip and Surge and all that stuff for young guys that are still kind of figuring out the game  I don't think you need to use him against the games cap right now Trey man similar story actually I don't you because of the holes in his family game I don't know that he's a he's definitely a play against the Roto games cap  but we're also at that part of the year and this applies to all the teams as we go through them we're at that part of the season now where Specialists appeal  is make sense and so like Trey man gives you kind of guard Wing eligibility and threes boards and assists which is kind of an interesting weird little combo  you're not gonna get it well you'll usually get some steals out of his deals have been okay since he moved over to Charlotte but you'll probably have relatively High turnovers you can have not a great field goal percent he's not gonna score a ton and so you kind of say Okay are these things that my team needs similarly with a guy like Nick Richards who you know wasn't very good in this one and the Cavaliers front Court defensively is awesome so you that was kind of easy to see coming do you need rebounds and field goal percent okay that's where we're at with most these guys as far as games cap who would I use against a games cap again you know some of it is that specialist level stuff but probably you're looking at Miller Bridges  you know again Richards if you need big man stats and then man both those guys to me Richards and Trey man are probably gonna sit between 100 and 150 the what we call the doesn't matter group but now that doesn't matter group maybe does if you need the stats that  elevate them to that level if that makes sense where mitts I don't know that he's gonna be good enough to get to that zone I think he's now falling back I think he probably ends up outside the top one 40150 so probably not a guy that needs to be rostered in all formats anymore  with Evan Mobley back and we had the blow out here and Mobile Police minutes or sort of slowly trending back up not that slowly I guess the question that I had coming into this game was Will Charis Levert still hold value even with Mobly back and Donovan Mitchell still out and I'm leaning towards a very soft yes like the ultimate softest if you're like Dan what are the odds that carries Levert is good between now and when Donovan Mitchell comes back I'd say 5149 towards yes barely above a coin flip and you saw it in this ball game 7.7 board 7 assists he went full slot machine but a steel 2 blocks and three pointer  bad field goal percent High turnovers will the good outweigh the bad On Any Given night and I think generally the answer is going to be yeah but it's very much not a guarantee and then George and yang had five three pointers Off the Bench but only 25 minutes that's not going to be enough for him long term so I don't think you need to worry about me Yang anymore as well  Boston choked going away late in this ball game it doesn't really matter everybody's freaking out about the Celtics this the Celtics are in full don't give a you know what they have a 10 and a half game lead on the blocks for the best record in the Eastern Conference and I think they have a six game lead over anybody for best record in the NBA so no one's passing boss and  the only thing that's happening here is that if they lose a couple of ball games they are not gonna have an 80% win clip this year  oh no  the good news from a fantasy standpoint is that because Derek white is getting some time off and Drew holiday is nursing a injured shoulder you get these nice paint and Pritchard and Sam Houser game and you're getting Al Horford games basically anytime they don't have a back-to-back so Horford's been great pritchard's been solid houses been solid you can pretty much play those guys in all formats and Boston has a couple of games on low tide today days this week as well so you know at least there's something that comes of it now if you know head-to-head folks your guys are sitting out there going with the hell am I gonna do with these dudes  blossoms become incredibly complicated on the head-to-head side although you figure if their guys are healthy they'll play now because they don't have any back-to-back for like two two weeks here  which also tells you Derek white and Drew holiday are probably not fully healthy Niche I know you gotta drop guys if you're getting zeros sucks but you kind of have no choice  for Atlanta Veet crunchy had a better ball game here finally took a few shots I'm not buying in on it yet specially with Jalen Johnson  hopefully back by the end of the week guess we'll see um crunchy hasn't really been willing to get involved on a game to game basis and so one good one I just can't be like oh yeah I guess he's he's in now  Hunter bogey capella Marie those are the four hex you can play against a game's cap they have a good schedule this week so that's why some of these other guys are going to be on rosters but for Roto those four and that is that  Detroit their down Cade cuttingham and I do wonder if that's the season for Kay they haven't said it yet but it's starting to feel that way Jalen Duren also out so Detroit really cut down to their Prime no Duran no kaede no azer Thompson know Isaiah Stewart for starters down Jaden Ivey the only starter left which means there should be some kind of fantasy value  has there been yet  not really  Jade and IVs usually good enough nice shot so horribly here that he blew that up but usually he's good enough when Cade Cunningham's out to use in all formats we know when Kate is in he's more of a points League only guy but typically that sort of scale of Point League Justice like is there gonna be enough  stuff  to counterbalance the bad and when he got the ball in his hands most of the ball game the answer is usually yes not so much in this one but I would I would play Jaden Ivy going forward  I would probably be played James Wiseman there isn't much in the way of upside for wise men but he's gonna get you some points and boards on a decent field goal percent and if you look into a block or us steel per game called that gravy and then you just pray he doesn't go to the free throw line but probably gonna be enough if he's playing 30 minutes that'll be enough big man stats kind of in the Nick Richards mold frankly better scorer  worse defensive stat  Marcus Sasser at 24 and 6 that's something to keep an eye on Malachi Flynn had 14 4 and 3 with two steals in a block that's something to keep an eye on and it's amazing to had three more defensive stats but only 17 minutes in this one I replayed 35 to 40 in the previous ball game  those are the guys I would keep my eye on for Detroit if indeed they're going into even deeper shut down here at the end of the season and you can keep one eye on Evan Fournier as well but I think you know you start with the starters  Ivy Wiseman could Sasser  lock in a bigger role like this  it feels  a little coin Flippy  but if he starts to I mean he took 18 shots led the team in field goal percent and or not feel good present feel like him and for free throw attempts in this ball game so they used to was very large for him  if that's something that's asked her starts to do here if it's like okay you got two and a half weeks to play for a contract or whatever to play for more playing time next year  you never know what guys can do in spots like this this may just be the Marcus Sasser run so I would say keep a very close watch on Detroit they play again tomorrow if a bad schedule this week for head to headers but if Sasser gets that start again tomorrow and continues to take you know a shot every other minute he's on the court then he'd definitely be an ad but I think we can watch for one more day  no real surprise is that in New York Deuce 43 more minutes for McBride  a true actually had nine and 16 and 26 minutes and you might be tempted to try to do something with it but I wouldn't this game was over early that allowed them to keep heart and shine at 24 minutes and said to 26 that meant a few extra for a Chua  that's funny that these starters minutes are the blowout level starters minutes for the next with Steven genzo scoring 40 in 41 minutes  Brunson was the only guy in the starter unit that were Tibbs was like all right this game's over come on get out get out of stop it but Josh Hart still played 40 McBride 43 ridiculous absolutely ridiculous but it does make it very easy to start the starters  Brooklyn got a win I don't think anybody cares at this point they're five and a half games back at the Hawks for the final plate in spot Brooklyn got a win without Cam Thomas and without Cam Johnson  this is a team the Nets are a team I think we should be extremely aware of possible shutdowns and I know that they they don't have their pick and there's no reason for them to pull the plug completely but if there are guys on this team that are just sort of tired of a long Bad season  maybe they just get some time off  and so what you saw here and listen I don't know what the legitimacy of the injuries to Johnson or Cam Thomas I think cam Johnson you got ruled out for a couple of games already so his appears to be quite real  there are opportunities for other guys to step up and we've talked about this before if Dorian Finney Smith gets up to 33 34 minutes of ball game he becomes a very easy fantasy play Dennis Schroder now with the usage freed up by cam Thomas being out becomes a play Jalen Wilson got the start here but no we're not gonna take the plunge on that front turned in Watford scored 19 Off the Bench and you're not doing anything there mikal Bridges continues to be truly terrible this season  I mean you know Nick klaxon 9 and 16 what if he gets some time off basically just like with Brooklyn we're gonna have to be aware on a day-to-day basis who is in who's out  but it may free up an opportunity for a little fantasy value  in the short term I don't really think you can do much they played tomorrow we don't know who's in and who's out  camp Thomas being the big one there if Cam Thomas is in I don't think I touched and it shrewd outside of if I'm sort of hunting points and assists but he's not good enough in the other stuff  if Kim Thomas is out again you could play Schroeder in that one if both cams are out you could probably play Dorian Finney Smith against the games cap what if someone else gets a day off  we don't know  can't do much about it until we know  Raptors love and to lose right now Toronto's lost 11 consecutive ballgames they are falling like a boulder  I'll try abaji not a bad defensive stats stream I don't think I would use him against the game's cap but  I if you did you'd probably get just enough Kelly Olynyk outside of the turnovers he's been pretty good Gary Trent scoring and hitting threes some steals mixed in there a clinic in Trent I think are guys that you can use right now Bruce Brown schedule level gradey dick schedule level abaji probably just above that  more of kind of that doesn't matter group a schedule level for me is like more in the 130 to 200 range it doesn't matter is more like 100 to 140 150 so there's a little bit of overlap there and then above 100 is a guy you're playing everywhere so on this team in my opinion Olynyk and Trent are above  oh Chi bhaji is in that  stream if you need his particular stats and then Brown gradey dick anybody else you want a lump into that pile are the  get a better schedule kind of guys  Phoenix oh dear they've had trouble with the Spurs this season for whatever reason and now the Suns have the hardest schedule in the NBA down the stretch and they may have lost multiple players in this ball game you used to have left early with an ankle injury Bradley Beal left late with a sprained finger  I don't know if they're going to be in Phoenix his next ball game Sons do not have a good schedule this week so if you're thinking about trying to squeeze or replacement player out maybe think again but if you're thinking game's cap Royce so Neil probably now slides into a really interesting spot  when one of the main guys is out he's been pretty good for Phoenix so keep an eye on O'Neill probably and again he's gonna needle to miss a ball game but this to be a thing but if Bill and nurture both out and you got Durant and Booker taken most of the shots and then O'Neill gets to slot in and take a few that's kind of all he needs because he liked Dorian finney-smith kind of similar fantasy appeal if they get into that 32334 minute range which probably happens if people are out  then you're gonna get stuff  so Rose O'Neill I wouldn't do anything with it today but you know if you have to make a move of day in advance or something like that on the Roto side you can pick them up  and then hopefully you get to use him tomorrow  Spurs know Wendy in this ball game unclear if he'll be back for the next one  because it's not like this was a back-to-back or something he's actually dealing with a thing a Spurs have no reason to push him but I know he wants to be out there so there's that kind of Again The Balancing Act going on Jeremy Sohan had 18 rebounds here this was you know big game Jeremy and I still don't trust him you guys know that but when Wendy's out you tend to get pretty good games from Zach Collins Johnson usually gets a bump when Wendy's out vessel always does trade Jones was not as good probably better when he gets to pass to him when he gets to be the point guard but more of a cell and Sohan on ball means less of Trey Jones on Ball but you're holding Trey you're holding a cell and then if one banana is another ball game Rodeo side I'm not playing so Hand in Johnson I just to worry about what their percentage is typically do Roto you could probably plays at Collins starter's minutes he's usually good enough not quite in this ball game but not too far off  the bad for free throw shooting in the turnovers heard a little bit so vessel Trey Jones Zach Collins on the Roto side head-to-head obviously you can lump a bunch more guys in but then maybe Wendy's back and then maybe none of this matters  so good thing we talked about it huh such as the plight of the end of the season where we just don't know who's in and who's out until 25 minutes before the ball game and such as the case with the Portland Trail Blazers know Anthony Simons know Deandre ayton  on top of everybody else that's already been out so you got a nice Delano Banton game in this one 39 bench minutes he took 21 shots to money tomorrow is actually had two good ones in a row do up brief crap to bed after a good one in his last one Chris Murray was meh after he was okay in the previous ball game and then scoot Henderson went back to being an if an efficiency disaster after he had one or two decent ones mixed in there  and that's the rub with Portland is you've got four or five guys that are all stepping into these giant rules but all of them have huge issues with their Fantasy game for nine cat  Dan who would you trust against a rodeo games cap in Portland's next ball game if all the main guys are still out  the answer  if I needed some boards and some defensive stats I'd probably go Kamara as my Top Choice  second choice would be Banton  and I don't think I even have a third choice their choice is probably wreath because he's unlikely to hurt you in a ton of stuff but he also might not help you either wreath Chris Murray are both in that kind of like won't hurt you but also might not help you  scoot is the  if you drop them in there you're you're literally praying before the ball game that he just can shoot okay for a night so that's just not one you could do  so Kamara Banton those guys are probably 50/50 plays for Roto  and then nobody else from for me is really all that close Houston wins again no Jabari Smith Jr was suspended so jock landale was the sort of easy streamer call he goes back to a bench role and the next ball game Jaylin green continues to light it up in the month of March bad shooting in this one but who cares he took 26 of them  Jalen green he's a play this month  Lord help us he is very good in the month of March  Friday van Fleet Jalen green I'm in Thompson and Jabari Smith Jr are the everyday guys and then you saw landale with the filling job here uh everybody's going nuts about Houston but among their winning kick right now for the rockets and immediately look they're playing well I get it they won nine games in a row not everybody can do that they've also had one of the easiest nine game scheduling runs that I've ever seen which of course also means that they took a bunch of losses against better teams because you sort of if you have a cake run then that means you had a hard run somewhere else but I was just talking about this on a different podcast yes they're playing better right now that's good but the Rockets nine game winning streak we just go backwards through it against the Blazers tank team Jazz tank team Bulls I mean okay fine they beat like a similarly skilled team at home  okay that's fine it's not like a great win but it's fine Wizards tank team calves without Donovan Mitchell and without Evan Mobley so a game they should win  Wizards again Spurs Tank teams that was in my opinion in this Rocket's nine game winning streak the win over the King's Inn Sacramento was there one when that I was like that's a pretty good win  and before that the tanking Blazers they also lost the Clippers and beat the tanking Spurs right before that also  before that they split a back-to-back with the Suns but I think Alper and shengwen was still healthy for that one if I'm not mistaken in any event the point of all it is they beat the kings that was them beating one pretty good team they beat the badly injured and slumping Cavaliers and they beat the Chicago Bulls  so one good win two okay wins and six wins over tanking teams on this nine game win streak that's what the end of the season can do if you happen to run up against a good scheduling spot yeah kudos to the rockets for taking advantage of it but they're destroying teams that are not trying to win  they have two more games with the Jazz the rest of the way how many games of the Rockets have left one two three four five  six seven eight nine ten eleven remaining two games with the Jazz over that stretch and one game with the Timberwolves so still three games left against teams that are actively trying to lose but the other eight coming against the Thunder the Mavs the Wolves the Warriors the heat the Mavs again the magic  and the Clippers on the very last day and now you'll start to see are the Rockettes really playing a lot better or  did they happen to run up against the best  two and a half weeks scheduling run of all time  I'm curious actually I think they are playing a tiny bit better but I don't think it's as much better as it looks  they're about to get a little bit of a wake up call although it's Thunder and then it's right back to the Jazz again and then the schedule gets more sort of consistently complicated  Wizards beat the Bulls so if you're talking about Chicago being a good win for the Rockets don't know Kyle kuzma no tyus Jones  Jordan Poole was still playing so you know they got that going for him  no Deni avdija  this was the Wizards like full plug pulling mode because they've actually won a couple of ball games laidley they've five and five in their last 10 and they're running a real risk of moving out of the bottom three in overall record don't do it Washington you've been terrible for so long  but of course the nice news is when all of those guys are out that means you get Jordan Poole taking 20 shots so he's an easy play you get Rashawn Holmes still playing 31 minutes out of the center spot he's a fantastic fantasy player in starter's minutes and as Corey kispert has now apparently remembered how to shoot a free throw  kidsport is very much a play when kuzma's out  that was always kind of the one-to-one and there was a stretch there where it looked like kispert might be a play when other guys were out but was in but that seems to have evaporated but 19 points 12 rebounds two steals 3 threes  if kuzma remains out then kiss bird is a full go what I am wondering about  a couple of things here one in particular is there a Marvin Bagley where Sean Holmes timeshare on the way until it happens  keep playing with Sean  but I do think it's a possibility  you're not picking up Patrick Ballwin you're not picking up Johnny Davis you are keeping one eye on Jared Butler  he had 13 assists a couple steals a couple blocks in this ball game 27 bench minutes which makes me look at it and go is this something that's going to repeat itself  I would love it if he got into the starting five  consistently so you know I Johnny was probably have to be the guy that sat it out at that point but if Jared Butler's gonna be a 30 minute starting point guard and just sort of shoveling passes to these other guys then now be a really interesting assist stream but I need to see it again this stuff I don't need to see again keep calling on Holmes kiss Bert with kuzma out the other stuff yeah you gotta want to wait on that Caruso came off the bench for Chicago and of course he was a plus eight in a game they lost same old same old  just so much was colder in this one but it Bulls no changes I know Drummond had a double-double but I don't care I know Tori Craig started but I don't care it's the same Five Guys so we don't need to go into detail on that  Denver blew out the Grizzlies didn't need Jamal Murray to do it Santi aldama didn't score as much in this one  still have no idea when he's gonna go take his shots this game apparently was not gonna be one of those but he blocked four shots so keep rolling with all dhamma he's been hot Lately from a fantasy standpoint JJJ was very bad offensively but he had six defensive stats so good Desmond Bane's a play when he's in those three guys are the obvious yeses GG Jackson is someone that I feel like I keep having to warn everybody about because we see the high scoring numbers but then we are willing to overlook the fact that he doesn't rebound pass or get defensive stats and he does it on a very bad field goal percent  I don't think that GG Jackson is a guy that sticks and I know he's he had like a three or four game super hot run in there so if you look at the last seven games or the last you know or seven days or the last 14 days or something like that the rank is gonna look pretty good but that's with the sort of small sample size stuff Blended in two or three gigantic games and even with those he's outside the top 100 over that stretch because of the bad field goal free throw has been weirdly down he has what one steal every three games right now  that hurts you  now  that lands him in the doesn't matter group  which means if you need points threes generally free throw percent then he's a start  so it's not that he doesn't belong on your lineup  but if you don't need those categories they need definitely doesn't if you do then he does  that's what these doesn't matter guys have  come to now late in the year they are statistical or categorical  specialists  I would love it if Scotty Pippen JR could carve out a more consistent role I don't think it's happening no conchar in this game was a big reason why and then Luke Kennard is still sort of Mia uh but that's the story on the Grizzlies for the Nuggets yes Reggie Jackson at 15 and 8 he and Dennis Schroder pretty much share the same Fantasy game  I know this is enough in this game it's enough typically I prefer two guys to be out on the nuggets before I take the Reggie Jackson plunge but again filling in for Murray he probably does get himself into that doesn't matter group probably more 130 to 150 range of it but if you're hunting points and assists  Reggie Jackson could be your guy if you want like a true top 100 nine cat play probably not  but again this time of year you're not really looking at you know do I want the 95th rank guy for the versus 130th rank guy you're looking at which dude if it's head-to-head you're looking at which dude plays a ton of all games and if it's Roto you're looking at which dude at attacks the categories where you can gain points  Road open points I should say  Dallas beat the tanking Jazz behind seven defensive stats from World beater Daniel gaffer I'm so glad it took the Mavericks a few weeks to get it figured out but I'm so damn glad that they finally figured out that Daniel Gafford is better than their other centers and so Gafford right back into the third round in per game value this year and 25 minutes of ball game wow what a massive win that's been I don't care about Tim Hardaway having a better ball game I don't care about PJ Washington having a slightly better shooting game gaffer Luka Kyrie the only guys are using against the game's cap  and look I mean if you're if your schedule streaming you've already done it so you don't need it we don't need to talk about that for Utah Larry Martin and back and Hammer blasting people again  it's been annoying because he probably got dropped in a bunch of spots just because nobody knew when the hell he was coming back but you know he's good again marketing John Collins Sexton Walker Kessler I don't care that he only played 17 minutes Walker Kessler's a play  and Counting George is sort of like your world's softest hold because if she has completely destroyed any shot he had here at consistent fantasy value  that's the rub I think he can fall towards the back end of the doesn't matter group you know one forty-one 50 probably and if he gets hot then you can use them in all formats but in the short term he's really just an assists play and with a sort of a nod to points as well but there's so much wrong with his Fantasy game  don't say I didn't warn you guys because I did repeatedly over and over again Philly down down goes Buddy hield down goes healed  I wasn't very good and down goes healed there's a little bit better but he healed hurt late in this ballgame ankle tweak  I don't know that it changes much you probably get a little bit more Kyle Lowry offensively but that's still probably not enough  Paul Reed still barely hanging on  its kind of at the front end of the doesn't matter group these days too  need rebounds and defensive stats there you go  Tyrese Maxey and Kelly oubre who wasn't in there for this ball game are the two guys you can play for Philly on an everyday basis and then the other stuff black  the Aaron Fox Keegan Murray had good games for the king's Son bonus had a very light  double triple double but he did break Kevin Love's Double-Double record in this ball game for consecutive double-doubles  50 by was I don't matter it's a big number key on Ellis had big time foul issues early in this game and he never really quite got on track but again like this new this is gonna happen because when you have a giant game it's gonna balance out with the quieter one I don't care they're better when key on Ellis is a part of what they're doing it's as simple as that  I'm playing him these days  Malik monk was okay he does seem like Malik may be cooling off a tiny bit  be careful  some of it was that this ball game didn't require Max effort some of it was that Davion Mitchell had a better shooting game so you got a little bit less Ellis and Monk  and some of it just because Malik runs really hot and then runs cold  if he hits a cold snap you don't want to be a part of it  and finally the floundering Clippers lose again the hell's happening to that team  Harden saying they have an identity problem I lose says now we got an identity we're soft  kind of like the called out his team that's good it's good stuff from Thai Liu as far as Indiana goes no Aaron neesmith for this game so Ben Shepard got the start and I don't care Jairus Walker put up an okay line I don't care  TJ McConnell and other 15 and six and that dude's consistent these days so Halliburton Myles Turner  Pascal siakam TJ McConnell was the only Pacers you're using against a games cap and for the Clippers we are back into one of those eats a zubats better runs of late he's at the front end of the doesn't matter group you know like top 110 ish kind of range a big man specialist appeal obviously if you don't need big man stats you don't need to play them but he's on the good side of it these days Norman Powell had 22 points I don't care PG Kawaii James Harden those are the guys you're playing and then again if you need what zubats brings you go that way and as we predicted because we've seen it like nine times in the last two and a half years Terrence Mann after two decent weeks has vanished from the face of the earth once again  whoo  all right guys a quick check of the clock reveals that we can probably  no you know what we'll do the streaming show right after lunch today I thought about doing it back-to-back but it's already 10:30 something it's gonna take me 15 20 minutes to get this thing posted to get the next one going yeah well we'll do the streaming show after lunch I do have many thoughts on the streaming side because now we're into that sort of light heavy light heavy part of the weekly schedule hope you guys have been preparing for this we talked about not doing much in the way of moves yesterday today is a day you're going to definitely want to do some moves so we'll talk about that in just a little bit Quick Check of the chat room here to see if anybody got some names in there that I didn't bring up question on whether or not to add Trey Yuen mmm  I think if you're in your head to head playoffs  I don't think you can do it  um they don't they still don't have a Target date for his return they reevaluation time was basically right around now but he's not ready yet so if you're in your playoffs you can't do it if you're in Roto you probably were sitting on him anyway so I would lean towards know if we're talking head to head side  questions about what to do with Grayson Allen you hold he's been very very good this year and I get it he's not like a super very Fantasy game but he's number 54  so unbelievably rare to get a guy hitting three three-pointers a game while shooting 50%  and I know their schedule sucks I know but I mean look beel might be down now so I'm holding  is it poker chefski time it's not not unless he starts getting midnight 20s and minutes you just you can't trust poker chefski and in 19 minutes of ball game even if you know you get a good game here and there if you're asking questions about streaming they will not be answered during this show I must say it again Dan who's the bigger bust pool 30s to 40s awful all year but cooking now or Mikhail Bridges teens to 20s mid all year that's a good question because Bridges is just been kind of black all season long but he didn't you never really had a stretch where he wasn't  playable  you just had it most of the Year where he's been not great you know like 75 to 100 range  or Jordan Poole who was fully unplayable for like four months and now he's playable I think pools the bigger bust  because  he again like he shouldn't have been on a fantasy team October November December January and most of February  giving me a slightly better run down the stretch doesn't fully make up for that and then you have to also add on the fact that even for Jordan Poole who's been good lately we're still talking like 70 range he hasn't been that good  so I would say pool is the bigger bust but Michael's been pretty crummy too  oh and JJJ getting thrown into the mix I mean he he got going a little bit and then got hurt and so on and so forth I I don't think I don't think JJJ is quite as those dudes these number 55 on the season and by and large he's been relatively healthy even on a tanking team  that's worth something  um  he's been a Miss  buddy hasn't been a bust  you know he's been a fifth rounder instead of a second rounder  which is not good but it's not like you know Bridges who's been a seventh rounder in stead of a late second rounder or pool who's been a non rounder instead of a third or fourth rounder not that it matters splitting hairs a little bit here  is Keon Ellis a drop for someone from Atlanta I'm fine with that although he plays tonight so I'm not dropping anybody who plays on a given evening  need a Hail Mary should I pick up RJ Barrett no I would not do that what are the chances he placed tomorrow I think extremely low  I don't know why but it feels like big men and defensive Specialists are easier to be good in nine cat because they're not required to do too much  to do much so they don't miss shots or turn it over you're correct  Albert you're you're 100% right and this is something this is a point that gets overlooked and fantasy circles  like the world over  because people are like oh all they're good at are these two categories yeah but here's the thing like a lot of guys that get picked up ahead of those dudes all their good at is points in threes  a great example of this and this is not my this isn't me picking on GG Jackson because he's fine GG like again he's gonna be probably in that  100 to 150 range in some capacity here but he's a great example of this if people I like oh gee gee Jackson is just dominating the universe  but over the last month  he's outside the top 200  despite the fact that he scoring 17 points  but it's the whole all he's good at all he's good at points in threes 17 points two and a half three pointers a game people are willing to overlook the fact actually free throws have been okay too people will go overlooked the fact that he gets no defensive stats his field goal percent is bad he doesn't pass and his rebounding is sub-average for someone listed as a forward  but then you scroll up the board and you're like oh well who's been in inside the top 100 over the last month Paul Reed is averaging 9 points a game over the last month but seven boards one steel one and a half blocks and he's done it on 50% from the field and 76 at the free throw line all you got to do sometimes in Fantasy is not be a huge anchor in stuff  and you can move up the board  this is why and again this is not maybe the best time of the year to have this discussion because right now GG Jackson might actually be more relevant to your fantasy team than Paul Reed you might just need points in threes more than the other stuff but when you're talking about like  December if we were having this discussion in December it's much more relevant because in December you don't want to play a guy all year or a month or whatever it is that's outside the top 200 they are then hurting your team more than their helping the math just says it  we can try to interpret this number these numbers however we like and again I know that there's been this sort of  fantasy Revolution happening I got yelled out on Twitter a few times that like  ranks don't matter at all but no that's the pendulum swinging too far  ranks do matter  they do  perhaps not as strictly as they'd been followed 15 years ago or something like that you know the number 60 player is not that different from the number of 55 players there the same basically they good at different categories but the number 60 player is different than the number one 140 player there's a difference there so ranks do matter it just has to be how they're utilized and so Gigi Jackson who's number 200 over the last month he is empirically worse for your team to play then Paul Reed over the last month  I don't even if you need points  he hurts too much in other stuff  and this again I'm not trying to pick on GG Jackson he's just a good example right now because he scored a bunch and so people are like wow this guy's been amazing but he has all these disastrous things going on and his nine cat game and I'm guilty of looking at Paul Reed and saying what's going on with this dude right now meanwhile he's like still sitting around the top 100 and generally useful provided you don't need a guy who's gonna score 15 points and frankly you find those six points somewhere else  so I would argue that like with all things in life moderation is key  and I think I actually do an okay job of this historically when we go into the offseason we kind of analyze how our ranks did we analyze how the Yahoo ranks did and just you know what does that mean and like if you drafted a guy or let's say I had a guy rank like 45th and he finished it 50 second it's not a win or a loss that's just he did what he did  you're not gonna get much closer than that  if you get within like a round of a guy in the late early or early mid-rounds  that's just accurate  so it's all about understanding what the sort of buffers are on that  ranks are not strictly the only thing you should go buy  who cares whose number 37 versus 41  but they do matter when the math starts to get starts to really tackle it  when the separation between guys becomes large enough  what is that separation I don't know is it around is a two rounds it's different the farther you go down the board then number six guy as a giant gap down to the number 14 guy but you know it's an eight spot hole 52 to 60 those guys are pretty similar  so I think that the pendulum is swung too far  we've taken this whole like we don't need to pay attention to ranks thing and we've we've extended it beyond what it should be and  actually we talked about this with I talked about this with Josh before the season started and he and I had a really good chat about how understanding what the the breath is  is the is really important part of this  and by the way friends those of you that have listened to this show for a long time remember how I did bukaty one off season not this most recent one but the previous one that's what that is  when people like Dan how do you rank your players I'm like well I don't really rank them I put them in buckets  because the first bucket has three players in it and then the next bucket has six players in it and you get into these it's like I think these guys are all basically the same caliber player so you know pick 31 to pick 309 I don't know what order those guys are gonna be in but that's a bucket for me  but I'm not gonna put that that 31 right guy in the same bucket as the guy I have down at 65  I want the 31 guy  until March now I just want the guy that's giving me the categories I'm looking for  Steve says he likes the Dan rant that's so much a rant I just think that sometimes and it's not even fantasy sports it's just like the world when we find something that's maybe a little bit off  and it was off how we were interpreting ranks to say oh well 37 is better than 38 is better than 39 it doesn't help doesn't help us at all  but to then say 37 is not better than 67  it is  so it's all about figuring out where the ends are on those buckets I think  all right I got a couple of questions that trickled in nine cat Bradley Beal versus Nas Reed believe it or not nas is probably gonna be better the rest of the way but both those guys should be on rosters  and then a question about streaming from tbz vids I will tell you  I'm going to be talking about streaming on our next show a little bit later on today so I'm not ignoring you come on back make sure to subscribe that way you can get your question in for our streaming episode that's coming up right after lunch today hey Dan do you think Anthony
