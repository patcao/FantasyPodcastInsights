welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  when the NBA cup is on the line  it's Chokehold time  I felt really good about what I did there  hardy har har I still can't laugh without coughing  as you hear but you know every day I'm getting a little bit a little tiny bit better welcome to the show officially now technical difficulties are in the past I am Dan best briefs this is fantasy NBA Today super busted beginning to the show but we're going now I'm at Danbury on social media I hope you guys will find me over there I hope that you guys find the title of today's show mildly amusing because we had ejections by the bowl full last night and we'll probably have suspensions so buckle up because the next few games for some of these teams are going to be a little bit on the weird side hey take a moment while you're here I'm not that this is the worst time to ask for it after an absolute terrible start to the show but if you like what you think you're about to hear please hit that like button subscribe whether it's on YouTube traditional channels that goes a long way towards continuing the growth here at Fantasy NBA today and it's Sports ethos and all so again come find me over on social at Danbury so let's talk about some of the games yesterday was a busy Tuesday it was an NBA cup night  and everybody keeps calling at the NBA in season tournament but they did actually give it a shorter name you can use its called the NBA cup  so that's how we're going to do  Indiana got their sweet revenge on the Philadelphia 76ers who've been very good so far this year Phillies 8 and 2 died for the best record in the Eastern Conference half game back of the nuggets for the best record overall but guess what the Pacers are seven and four and they're fun asleep  all so  listen to some of these numbers to put up lately  so Indie took about five three three four games to get their offense going and then starting on November 3rd four games how many real season games is that four games because they played the pit the Wizards in the very first one that one Almost Doesn't Count but  you know what just look at what the Pacers are scoring you don't need it doesn't matter when they figured it out so far this year in the 11 games the paces of played they've put up 143 125 105 because apparently they were on valium for that ball game 104 because the Celtics just manhandle them one 2152 134 126 126 again and 132  that's awesome  you want to talk about fantasy value that should be the absolute easiest place on Earth to find it and yet  Rick Carlyle  good coach though he may be is not good for Fantasy value  because there are three guys on his team that have an inside track to minutes obviously Tyreese Halliburton who with his ridiculous game of 33 points 15 assists seven boards and 7 3-pointers has moved himself into the number three slot in nine category leaks right now behind just Shay Guild just Alexander and Anthony Davis  ahead of Nicole yokich somehow even though yokich is averaging 3014 and almost nine assists like that tells you the popcorn numbers these guys are putting up at the top of the board  it's absurd right now it's actually out of control Myles Turner who fouled out in 19 minutes because  because Joel embiid who went 17 for 17 at the free throw line yesterday  somehow he's like how is embiid number five he's putting up 33 12 and 6 with two blocks a steal 51% from the field 873 throw line and over a 3-0 and he's fifth  top of the board right now is so crazy  all right I'm getting sidetracked here Jaylen Smith got hurt two and a half minutes into the ball game Myles Turner fouled out 19 minutes into the ball game which allowed Obi topping to play 37 minutes and he was good it is 37 minutes but there's absolutely no guarantee that it happens again and every time these types of things happen in Indiana someone's gonna yell at me on Twitter or in the chat room here during the show that I'm not high enough on player X from the Pacers it happened with Benedict mathura in a couple of times when he had two good games in a row since then he's crapped on his leg two times it's happened with Aaron Nesmith since then he's crapped out his leg like four times it's gonna happen with Obi toppin we know what the Pacers are they are three guys who play minutes Halliburton Myles Turner and Bruce Brown and everybody else is just biting at an apple and whoever gets their teeth do it into it On Any Given night is the guy that actually gets to play a little bit more  the guy we want to play a little bit more is Jalen Smith and he had been trending up before getting hurt in this ball game we'll keep an eye on him  he had prior to this one obviously but been able to put up fantasy numbers and only like 19 minutes of ball game which feels what unsustainable but you're not adding anybody on the Pacers you're not adding will be topping because we know damn well he's gonna play 22 minutes in the next ball game in the whole thing is going to get flipped on its damn head fill in Adelphia DeAnthony Melton time has arrived dude finally hit more than 30% of his shots in a single ball game leaps tall buildings in a single bound with one good game he has pushed himself up into 14 team territory but the beauty of mountain is that his minutes are at 28 remember I said he needs 28 minutes to be fantasy successful he's a 28 minutes after this one 1.3 steals still possibly On The Rise 36 and a half percent shooting from the field still on the rise know Kelly oubre for a very long time that's all so very good for Melton  Nick bottom likely comes back and retakes that starting spot from Rob Covington I like Nick bottom as an ad particularly in Roto had to head he's a little tougher because you know he's going to miss some ball games this is for personal reasons but he tends to play 30 plus minutes a bunch of games in a row he usually does end up getting hurt for some number of weeks and then kind of has to  ramp his way back up again  but Melton this is why we kept calling him a tough hold because of eventually you knew it was going to click  but two is the other guy on this team to add the fact that Covington was terrible in his chance to try to steal some minutes only make that that platoon suggestion Roto suggestion a little bit firmer Miami beat Charlotte 111105 Heywood Highsmith had seven defensive stats but I I can't get myself over the hump with Highsmith I know he's been decent for this team lately and he's basically taken a job that briefly belonged to Kevin Love and over the last four games he's actually averaging 3.8 defensive stats but he's doing very little else and I also simply don't believe that he's gonna average 3.8 defensive stats over a longer haul doesn't seem like a thing that's going to stick even though he had seven what I do want to point out is that first Kyle Lowry had fouls he got in foul trouble early and just never got going that said it does kind of feel like Duncan Robinson chucking up three pointers is probably the safer fill in for Tyler hero because he's gonna go out there and he's going to try to do some crummy fact simile of what hero did which was score largely  we're also seeing Duncan Robinson take the ball to the couple a little bit more this year because teams are playing him so hard at the three-point line and he's kind of advanced his game a little  so go ahead stream Duncan Robinson with Tyler hero out all right I think worst case scenario you just get like a bad shooting game I met jacquez 17 points 5 boards good a playing time here as was Josh Richardson's  the one between the rest of these guys that I'm like trying to get myself to buy in on I just can't get quite all the way there but it's close  it's closed I Robinson's the one that I prefer Lowry gets downgraded here he and Huck has are both kind of the if we have to type territory but I hope that we won't have to  Gordon Hayward finally missed a ball game for Charlotte is this the beginning of the end  now probably not but miles Bridges is also due back I think for their next ball game actually  and that's gonna shake things up a little bit  Terry Rosie will also resurfaced at some point in the meantime because there was no Bridges and no hey wait and no Rozier PJ Washington took 23 shots that ain't happening again anytime soon like maybe ever again so no like is this if you're about to ask me if you should be trying to get PJ Washington the answer is a firm and resounding no  if you can sell on him I would take anybody near the top 100 because there's almost no way he keeps this up when the team gets all of their small and power forwards back and we shuffle along the board Atlanta beat Detroit without Trey young shout out Deonte Murray for his 32 and 10 double double it's a bit Bogdan bogdanovich would have a slightly better ball game he was fine you know 17 points 33 threes in a block basically that I mean that'll get the job done but we wanted more  we do know that his steals rate is going to come down he's due to have like three or four games in a row without a steal and this may have been the first one of that he's still playable I think anytime Trae young is out basically all of these fringy guys DeAndre Hunter he was over the cut line with Trey young out saddiq Bey got back over the cut line with Trey young out and then the guys that are already good yeah I mean they're fine like Jalen Johnson played 36 minutes you know he's solid Clint capela had five defensive stats he's solid on Yakko kangwoo blah blah blah I Trey missed this game for the birth of his second child so he'll be back very soon but if you get one more game out of the trace Hawks at least we now make kind of all ready knew what to do but at least now we have a pretty good confirmation on that  I'll start tops and another five defensive stat game this time he managed to pair it up with a good shooting night from the field not the free throw line he's been a revelation here in his rookie season number 43 I still think the defensive stats are coming down from three point one a night but maybe not by that much he's got a pretty good shot to stay inside the top 6065 this year even if he does taper off just a little  Marvin Bagley filled in better for Jalen Duren in this one last time around hisa Isaiah Stewart who filled in better I know that they're starting together don't yell at me about that it's just that's the way things are in Detroit doesn't seem like both those guys can have good fill in games which means we probably should just leave them alone  as opposed to taking a shot at it  Killian Hayes and three defensive stats but he only played 23 minutes and this is another situation where I had a bunch of people yelling at me that I was too low on Hayes too low on Sasser and I was like guys have the Pistons are hurt  there's still two more guys out that are relevant Joe Harris and boy on bogdanovich  now that said I do think Alec Burks has legs for this team right now he came in in 24 minutes he got 12 shots up that's as many as most of the guys playing full starters minutes mostly because they just need him to score  because most of this team can't  they got a little bit more help for Cade in this ball game because he was really bad cutting out did have 12 assists but couldn't shoot and turned it over six times but in general it's like okay Kate's gonna go get some points is anybody else gonna actually have an offensive game and the one guy they've been able to rely on when healthy has been Alec Burks so the ceiling is not all that high for him but if his minutes happened to like Trend towards 2526 he's gonna get to do enough offensively to where I think he probably belongs on most rosters right now  Spurs lost to the thunder in a blowout Spurs were also sitting a few guys various nagging injuries in this one no  I've already forgotten who the hell said no trade Jones no keldon Johnson I think that was the two for this one  I think this person gonna take this year everybody was talking about how they were going to make a run in a play in spot I took the under for Spurs season win totals not because I think they're going to be terrible but because I just don't think they're gonna be wanting to win all that badly this is like the ease Victory into the NBA season and there's just sort of no point in playing him to a breaking point so you're gonna get weird games like this injuries real fake whatever you're gonna get games like this  Julian champagne played 31 minutes and so if we ever have these two guys missing again he's someone we could at least take an eyeball and pee or at  dude did have seven defensive stats and three three pointers that feels like something that probably won't happen again and this is my eternal beef with the San Antonio Spurs is that they lack efficiency almost everywhere the Thunder don't  shape put up a big line in his 28 minutes this game was over early Lou Dort did still have two defensive stats although I do think that the sky will be falling in on Lou pretty soon  still number 41 but he fell like a whole round with this one bad ball game and I think you're gonna see more of that so try to get something for Dort if you can you might not be able to but honestly I take anything inside the top eight year 90 right now and Jalen Williams is a very easy Buy Low he's number one oh nine and he can't get any steals so far that number is gonna go up and when it does he's gonna jump 45 slots so see if you can buy on Jalen Williams I don't know why I didn't put him on my Bilo show yesterday I probably should have you can probably get him for someone in the 80 range and I would definitely do that  magic got blown out in Brooklyn this is like a wave of blowouts in the middle of the car yesterday so don't read too much into it Jaylen Suggs briefly left the ball game as you can see on your YouTube screen he did return so don't panic there still got his three defensive stats even if the rest of the night was not particularly good for almost anybody on the magic I guess Franz Wagner You could argue survived it  points Leaguers were okay with Paolo Bunker's evening but overall it was pretty bad one Jonathan Isaac played 12 minutes he is doubtful for their next ball game because Jonathan Isaac is not going to play every day and this is why people are like it's a time is a time and I'm like no it's not time he's not gonna play back-to-backs probably the whole year and he still hasn't hit 20 minutes  that's the rule on Isaac he hits 20 minutes you can play him  Roto only  let's keep going  cam Johnson 20 points 5 boards to assist three steals three threes solid shooting from the fields 7 out of 11 missed a free throw womp but he's on his way up minutes are getting back to where we want them to be this game was all so  like not a full like the 20-point blowout was a little bit misleading because guys that got their minutes towards the front end of the fourth quarter still kind of got those like you can see didn't witty played 37 minutes Bridges played 30 to 1/2 but this game was over somewhat early there's a few things I want to point out with Brooklyn first thing is number one Ben Simmons is out and the News came out yesterday suggesting that he was dealing with a nerve issue in his hip and Back Again  so  and I put this almost verbatim in a tweet  I  I don't want to sound like too much of a pessimist  but I'm just not sure that  Ben Simmons plays again this year  and maybe he does I hope I'm wrong about that  just feels a lot like last year where he played and he looked pretty good for like two weeks and then he was just gone like forever so maybe he comes back but what does that mean we do with this information well first thing is you're looking at fill-ins and they're really isn't an obvious one like Rosie O'Neill played 34 minutes but brace O'Neill is Royce O'Neill you can't this is not a guy you're gonna rely upon for Fantasy value Dorian Finney Smith got the start I think he was playing better he would have done more and O'Neill would have done less more than anything losing their point forward means they need a point guard and that Spencer Dinwiddie who had a gigantic ball game yesterday and everybody's gonna be racing out to try to pick him up I would caution you all because Dinwiddie is not a good percentage guy he doesn't get defensive stats so if he's gonna hit value you're gonna need in Woody to basically averaged like 17 and nine and basically be Dennis Schroder  baby Dennis Schroder right now what he's doing for Toronto  and I don't know that I necessarily believe that's going to happen  but if you want to take a shot at it  I sort of wouldn't break you over that I just I don't think it's gonna be good enough  also cam Thomas remains out he will do some ball-handling when he gets back and he'll certainly take some of the shots 18 of which went to Dinwiddie yesterday  and you know McHale Bridges took what do you take like 30 shots the game before that's not gonna be a thing that happens when cam Thomas is in there because he's gonna be chucking away so I like cam Johnson as a start I like cam Thomas when he comes back as a start I obviously I like Mikhail Bridges as a start Nick Claxton they only needed him for 21 minutes here he's an obvious start Dinwiddie is the one where you're like maybe  call it a  speculative add where Rodeo I'd put him on my bench and head to head you're like come on don't ruin me in this next ball game  here's another blowout this one I don't think there's quite as much to take away Dallas got spanked they didn't play their guys much late and they said whatever will you know pack it up go to the next one  this was the off man I hate when you get the Luca down game because it's it's so damaging  field goal percent turnovers free throw percent no defensive stats like it's just these weights on him and Luca basically went from MidFirst round to end first round one bad ball game was all that took because it drove his field goal percent back down to 51 is free throw down I think he was in the 80s briefly now he's at 78 his turnovers jumped up to four and a half which I would say wow that's terrible like except that's only fourth worst in the NBA right now behind Devin Booker who's only played two games but we'll get more out of him Kate is at 5 and Darius Garland is at 4.8 so congratulations Luca you don't have the most turnovers in the NBA  at least eight caters don't care about it  um Kyrie he'll be fine in the next ball game Luke will be finding the next one the only thing I'm really watching on the Mavericks I guess there's two one is Tim Hardaway Jr who somehow been able to maintain a semblance of value Against All Odds he's number 97 he's like right on the cusp but you're still rolling with it until the whole thing comes to Pieces which I can almost promise it will at some point and then Derek Lively is the other question mark he was not good enough again in this ball game Dwight Powell is upright and lately that's been enough actually and Lively is about rank one 50 Ranger so  it just right now at least it looks like it he needs to be full starter's minutes to have fantasy value and that hasn't been guaranteed  herb Jones is back herb Jones is back in a big way five steals two blocks 19 points he's crushing it man herb Jones is number 28 in nine cat to this point  he's going full McHale Bridges Phoenix mode  obviously belongs on every roster must start Play but that's not I think what you guys are concerned about you guys are asking what Dan do you think about Jordan Hawkins and Dyson Daniels between the two I prefer Dyson Daniels because he's in the starting lineup I like his ability to get assists and steals that creates a much safer floor whereas a guy like Hawkins who took 17 shots and is playing his butt off right now  you could see it all evaporate if he goes cold  in a way where with Daniels I don't think that his shot  has almost anything to do with why he's in or out of a ball game  it's the defense so the steals the actual real life defense and then anything else that comes beyond that is sort of gravy  so I prefer to stream Dice and Daniels while McCollum is out I know that not everybody agrees with me in the fantasy space I'm okay with that I play nine cat  points you probably want the guy who's gonna take more shots so that would be Hawkins but nine category leaks he's had a couple weeks now to sort of show whether or not he can be a nine CAD guy and he hasn't been so far  folks picture this nightmare scenario you're hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of

the numbers are not going to necessarily bear it out because he wasn't playing many minutes before McCollum went down but since CJ went down and then more specifically really since herb Jones went down he has been inside the top 90 where Jordan Hawkins over that same stretch is outside the top 150 because his shot he's shooting 36 and a half percent over that range  so give me the guy who has the safe floor here  Portland no big surprise is here Skylar Mays playing a lot of minutes getting a lot of assists doesn't do all that much else but  that's why you picked him up he did get two blocks where the hell that came from  DeAndre Aiden not surprisingly we've seen the steals dry up a little bit after that crazy star but his numbers overall are still good this was another solid performance for the dominating 22 and 10 on good percentages that's basically the center you were drafting he remains just barely a late second rounder overall on the year so far  Utah's interesting and we talked about this earlier this week keyonte George has changed what that team looks like  meaning they have a point guard who's Distributing  he only got 26 minutes yesterday because Colin Sexton was playing well so they ran different lineups the bench was performing admirably so they sort of mixed and matched a little bit but overall keyonte George is getting Jordan Clarkson the ball in better spots and you've seen his numbers bounce up because of it I still don't think Jordan Clarkson is going to be a nine category guy I know he said two or three good games in a row here but we also know that eventually the other shoe falls with him but he's definitely better  absolutely a points League guy where he wasn't in anything guy for a little bit there John Collins he's seen an uptick some of that's because Walker Kessler's out and he's playing more Center but some of it is keyonte George just like he's getting to the ball in spots and Collins is being more aggressive  Larry marking in he was being aggressive regardless so I don't know that it changes his value all that much we also set Kelly Olynyk have a pretty good game Off the Bench it hasn't been consistent enough much as I'd love to roll with Olynyk I don't think that we necessarily can but County George belongs on rosters Clarkson belongs certainly on points League rosters you can stream them in nine cat while he's hot but I I would warn you that at some point the Luster's gonna come off here but just overall and I know they beat Portland a terrible team but George has just made Utah a palatable Club in a way that tailored and Tucker I had no shot to do  Clippers actually competed Paul George had a huge ball game so it looks like maybe the Dan best person I think we're gonna be able to buy low on all three of their Superstars comment is probably not Paul George related right now but you will be able to buy on hardened Leonard and you probably can right now if you want to get James Harden for like 50 60 range which is basically where he was getting drafted you could probably do it if you want to get kawaii for a 30 some on which is just slightly behind where he was getting drafted you could probably do it and damn it I would because Harden came out he was like look I'm not really in shape yet Kawaii is deferring hard to the other guys at this moment that's not gonna last forever at some point the team's gonna be like oh right Kawaii letter he's our most of efficient offensive player and they'll roll into that but they're just trying to figure out how the piece is fit  Buy on the guys you can buy on and Paul George you probably just have to sit tight because he's playing well  Nicole yokich had a bad shooting game which is very rare remember he went like three months last year without shooting under 50% well he shot under 50% of this ball game and his whole season now derailed  at sarcasm he's still shooting 58% on the year overall  Reggie Jackson is the guy you're looking at on the Nuggets 183 and 4 if it mostly I think he's just barely good enough to be a play while Jamal Murray is out don't expect all that much I think you're looking at like top one 20 Maybe  100 but don't look for much more than that  Michael Porter Jr finally had a quieter ball game which was a shame but I'm not worried about it what is he is like top 80 over the last week he still top 50 on the year and honestly I think both of his percentages probably go up so if anything not that he's a buy low but if you can get him for somebody who thinks that  he's on the way down then I think I might consider doing it  Minnesota lost Jaden McDaniels two minutes into the ball game that was part of that crazy fight where McDaniels and Klay Thompson got tied up and then Rudy gobert came over and bear hug three guys and then Draymond Green came over and choked out go bare so Draymond and Klay Thompson got kicked out Jake McDaniels got tossed on the other side  it was a wild scene man Minnesota ended up coming back in this game against the zombie Warrior's because once Drake and Clay were gone it was Chris Paul Dario sharp and pods  against the world  and it went about how do you expect which is  one team took the other one too Lightly for three quarters and then woke up and finally beat him late this is by the way while you back teams missing Superstars because the other team never plays hard  so fantasy wise  there's almost nothing on the Minnesota side it's very clear at this point that slow-mo is streamer level only don't worry about Nas Reed doesn't play that many minutes so every once in a while he's just not gonna get to play as much and frankly he wasn't defending well so his minutes were worse if someone got impatient with him after one bad ball game you pick him up because overall this year Nas has been fantastic he's right around top 100 value in like 20 minutes per game and he can keep that up  Mike Conley 13 points 8 assists 332 steals dude just steers the damn boat like a freaking King he's at 11 points five and a half assists to steal and two threes on 51% shooting he has not missed a free throw yet this year he's 9 for 9 and he's turned the ball over seven times  he has an assisted turnover ratio that's basically what is he at like 53 to 7 so like between 7 and 8 to 1  that is exactly what that team needed I mean you want to talk about a perfect fit that trade helped everybody Utah got assets wolves got the point guard they needed Lakers got the guy that could create that they needed  that was this incredible moment where everybody was just like ah we got it we got what we wanted  weird  parallel universe type of crap what about the Warriors well I thought we'd get more assists out of Chris Paul but then I also realized that he was passing the guys that largely don't really know how to play NBA level basketball so maybe I was a bit too hopeful there  you're not picking up the pods man  you're not picking up Dario Charlotte  although  because like look draymond's probably gonna get suspended for the Chokehold but clay will be back for the next ball game meaning like we've seen basically what this team is with Outreach and it's typically Kevon Looney is the guy you can roll with  maybe they run charge out there and maybe he gets hot and knocks down some shots but he really doesn't do a whole lot else  maybe the Warriors have no choice but to mmm we sort of think this one over on the Fly while we're we're talking about it  um  yeah leave it where it's at so you're gonna pop oh Brandon pods is gonna get picked up in a few spots but then he's gonna get promptly dropped  Andrew Wiggins man what a mess like the fact that he's still couldn't get it going with everybody out  that dude is broken  this is his shot  that well leave it alone leave it alone  I started his second guess myself but now I'm gonna go back to leave it alone Xavier Tillman was back for the Grizzlies meaning that he and Bismarck biyombo and Santi aldama are all gonna be fighting  JJ actually all so kind of fighting for sentiment it's wolf was JJ bad in this ball game he was on my Bilo list yesterday and Lord that by low window is wide open right now he's shooting 44% from the field only 2.1 defensive stats per ball game you might be able to get him for a top 50 range guy now before this terrible ball game I thought it would have taken top 35 to get him now you might again might like try someone in the 40s  try a freaking Keegan Murray try DeMar  try Mark Williams  you I I believe that you can get JJJ on the real cheap right now  but maybe I'm mistaken and you should do it because people are in full panic mode is smart tweaked ankle in this ball game he left early did it help anybody not really they kind of ran they ran big and rolled David Roddy in there and Desmond Bane handled some more points  and The Grizzlies are in real trouble they're two and deny and I know there's sort of counting down the next 14 games before they get job back but I mean they can't go another two and nine and expect have any shot to make playoffs or even play in at that point then you start to worry about shutdowns if they're you know five and  15 coming out of the gate  you likely it coming back from that even with John what happens if I start shutting down I think we worry about we'll sort of cross that bridge when we get there the best fantasy game on the team meaning the guy that could sort of leap into value the fastest is Santi aldama  he's a floor spacing pretty big guy so three-pointers rebounds blocks points  the percentages are what you worry about a little bit with aldama  but he's the guy that you'd be squatting on if you started to get closer to sort of a shutdown worry but we're nowhere near that Luke Kennard by the way also left this ball game I didn't even notice that at the time I thought that they were just like whatever we're getting destroyed but he actually had some knee soreness  and that is all so part of what opened things up for David Roddy there's just too many moving pieces in Memphis right now for me to suggest a streamer on today's show wait for their next ball game see who's in who's out and probably will just file some data points because you really don't want to take a shot in the dark specially if you're in a game's cap situation and for the Lakers this one was over early LeBron and Anthony Davis did not have to touch the court in the fourth quarter LeBron was done by about the the five minute Mark of the third he didn't come back into the game Anthony Davis left about two minutes to go in the third quarter he didn't come back into the Ballgame what a line he put up before then 1911 and 5 with six blocks for add he has been amazing somehow he's only the number two player in fantasy despite 0.8 Steals and 3.3 blocks and 54% from the field and 88 of the free-throw line which unfortunately as as ADD tires in the season goes is free throw percent is almost definitely going to come down  Austin Reeves I was talking earlier this morning about sixth The Man of the Year award prop type stuff Futures if you can get it on an Austin Reeves one I think you've got a little bit of an angle there  but this is all so why I talked about why you're not picking up the other fringy Lakers because when LeBron is in there's no guarantee that camera is just gonna get to do enough or Christian would really Hodge did score 23 points but did almost nothing else in the ball game the Lakers are LeBron ad d d Lowe Austin Reeves  and period  comma quotation mark  oh hey a bunch of you guys joined in while I was yamming about yesterday's card welcome to all those watching live there's a pretty good chunk of you I think it basically doubled while I was my nose deep in in the book there please do take a moment to come find me on social if you're new if you're watching live chat room is open but almost all of what I do is over on Twitter at Dan visperas d a n b e s b r i s  come find me over there please do it here right in the middle of the show because I got things rolling pretty much all the time over on social everybody else can attest I spend far too much time over there so um definitely come find me on that side  and all so before we take a look at what's coming up on this medium sized Wednesday which maybe a thing that we see here over the next little bit because Tuesdays and Fridays are the in-season tournament days so you'll probably see slightly less overloaded Mondays and Wednesdays as a result by the way that's a big win having a more balanced weekly schedule for streamers and my own brain that I have two things from manscaped I want to show you guys while we're here this is the handyman I'm realizing my my show light is Illuminating it a little bit too hard so I'll tip it down so you guys watching can see it this is about the size of like if you stretch your index and Pinky figure out a part real hard that's the size of the handyman I really enjoyed this thing and you guys have seen me I've done it right here on air and I'll do it again today basically so I'm someone where I have what I call Rogue facial hairs not because they can steal someone else's mutant Powers that's an X-Men joke but because I have this pretty traditional beard that comes around the sides and connects in the middle and you know neck care and all that but I also have about like 10 to 15 little hairs that come at in the cheeks and so I'll just take this bad boy right here on are oh God please don't turn it too far  I'll just do my cheek here  oh go down too low and and take out some of my beard because usually I use a mirror for that but that's a handyman man that's a great great device you can get that you can get the shears I've got this the luxury nail kit right here on my desk at my fingernails yesterday a lot more 5.0 Ultra is just down at the bottom of my right where my feet are but I don't want to lean out of view for a minute all that stuff at manscape they do good products there  stack them up  ethos 20th 20 you get 20% off and free shipping on your order over at manscape.com ethos 2-0 is the promo code for 20% off and free shipping at manscaped.com okay let's see what we got going on tonight  we can even make this bigger since  there aren't a whole giant sheet of boxcars you guys need to look at here's what we're watching for on this big Wednesday card  boo boo  doo doo  Mavericks Derek Lively is the only one I'm really tracking at this point he's the only one where I feel like we don't really know what's gonna happen over the course of the year right now schedule stream level but that could change so let's be ready just in case it does  the wizards they went into hard tank mode in their last ball game  so what does that mean for the next one you know what do we get out of Daniel Gafford in terms of minutes because when he's been on the court he's been awesome he's number 71 in only 23 minutes per ball game right now  but that's a number that could go up because his blocks his field goal percent his rebounding all that has been really really good but he's been held in check by injuries foul trouble and then in the last ball game by Tank which sucks  same story in the last ball game for tyus Jones he was finally putting up a good ball game he got held in check by the tank he's only averaging 26 and a half minutes per game  that's why I got to hold these guys because I feel like at some point they're just gonna have to get some minutes and at that point they're going to be fantasy values they haven't really been well that Gafford has been anyway but  we got to get there somehow  I'm also waiting until because at some point Jordan pools just gonna snap  so far he's been sort of a holding himself in check and that's not what we wanted out of pool we didn't want a checked Jordan Poole taking 15 shots a game we wanted looney bin Jordan Poole taking 20  I still believe it's gonna happen at some point I don't know when but  points you want to be there for it nine category League's he was always gonna be totally overdrafted  Milwaukee I'd like to know if any kind of consistency for Bobby Portis or Pat connaughton settles in here now and sort of this  Raptors what's up with Schroeder was that the start of the dip or was it just a one game or two game off kind of thing I I said it on yesterday's show I do feel a little bit less dumb  because when when Schroeder was going crazy I just kept thinking like God did I really miss by this much on him and the answer I think is no I probably missed by a little but not by you know 7580 slots maybe more like by 30 which is still a Miss but you know jumping from where I thought he'd be at like 120 132 you know between 85 and 110 is not as crazy as top 50 Schroeder and then what about Panic on Yakima portal because I got admit I'm a little bit worried about the turtle thing right now  but he didn't have to put together some good games together and snapped me out of it because I'm not all that thrilled  Celtics is usually nothing all though we got word that Jalen Brown and Kristofferson are each questionable for this ball game maybe they just figure  go in and let Philly get one not worried about getting clobbered early in the year when you're off to such a good start Jalen Brown is sick poor Singas is dealing with some knee soreness  like I they don't strike me as a team that's gonna push their guys and so if they're not there I mean if you're missing both of those guys I got to think that I'll whore for plays enough certainly in Roto to be useful and then who replaces Jalen Brown is it Sam Houser because he's been pretty good lately one of the best 3-point shooters in the NBA so far this year  if you need threes that he'd probably get you a few  Nicks I'm still waiting on confirmation on what the hell Josh Hartz job is going to be with that team when they're at full strength maybe we get it today if RJ Barrett doesn't have his migraine anymore Trey young is off the injury report for the Atlanta Hawks so presumably he'll be back and you can go back to your old valuations for that team that's easy enough  or Lando I expect to bounce back performance I'm not really watching anything all that closely especially since Jonathan Isaac is likely to sit out the back to back everything else kind of locked in  should Chicago we got word yesterday kind of buried the lead on this one  that Zach LaVine is on the Block  that's a that's a big one and  I would personally love it if the Bulls blew it up because Zach LaVine is gonna have fantasy value anywhere he goes  DeMar DeRozan would have value anywhere he goes food should have value anywhere he goes these teams that are gonna trade for these guys are not bringing him in to play some you know half cock back up role and then so you split them all up you reset their brains they'll probably be happier somewhere else and you'd get all these Bulls stepping into real roles that they've never had before like Kobe white who I'm not high on but if he's getting full starters minutes and full usage hell yeah he'd be useful I'm assuming Alex Caruso would also be on the trade block so he's not a guy throw in there but you might see Patrick Williams you might get Andre Drummond just doing a turn back the clock hell why not I'll go grab 14 boards a game for two months kind of thing it would be hilarious and fun and I'd love it  but I don't know that it's gonna happen overnight so you don't have to squat on all those backups just be ready to pounce in the event that the bulls start peeling pieces off and jettisoning them across the NBA  Minnesota I don't think we'll see anybody suspended on the Wolves but I guess you never know they're in Phoenix to take on the now full strength Phoenix Suns  Devin Booker is expected back for this ball game Bradley Beal is probable as well I think it's gonna be a little bit clunky and disjointed you're gonna see some very good offensive players make some kind of weird decisions throughout the game but they'll probably be okay fantasy wise I think you you can start them all  as far as the game goes I think Minnesota has the upper hand because they're they know how to play with one another but should be a fun one  Sacramento in LA Kings and Lakers games are fun these days Kings always get up to play the Lakers the Aaron Fox is back so we're only really seeing okay you know how good is Keegan Murray gonna get like where's the ceiling here for him this season and then is Malik monk can he do enough basically non-scoring and assisting categories to be a full season fantasy value the answer right now is probably not but I wouldn't make it zero it's not a 0% chance it's like a 15% chance that he can maybe get some steals going or like get the field goal percent up a little bit  but right now he's a two trick pony and then nine cat that's not enough tricks  to be a useful Pony  Lakers you just see if anybody sits the back to back I think they want wins right now so I'm guessing no but you never know  Cavaliers Carol's consistency Jared Allen's minutes cap and then Portland nothing really you know I don't think anybody's coming back for them this ball game so he probably roll with the same streamers you had in the last one  and now how many minutes did I leave myself for questions six  I certainly ain't getting all of them yeah I was a that's a lot of questions while I get to the questions again take a moment to please hit that like And subscribe Button as I scroll up the board here all right let's get into it skilly oh that's unheard and someone dropped him  in my head-to-head League yeah you should pick him up absolutely you I mean eight teamers and bigger you pick them up should I drop NOS Reed for Batum Lowry Olynyk or Duncan Robinson or Dario Sharjah it started depends on what you're looking for because Nas is your best full season guy in that group if you want the quick hit you go Robinson if you want the good until he gets hurt it's Nic Batum but I think generally I'm probably steep sticking with nas out of that group  thoughts on Jaren Jackson and Herb Jones Jaron Jackson is a Bilo herb Jones is probably a little bit of a sell high but both are very much starts  Brian says Dre should fight MMA we know he can punch now he can now we know he can rear naked choke I don't actually know what these terms mean but yeah that was that was something yes today  Lively George and Bilal Bilal excuse me who do you think we'll have more rest of season in nine  I think your guy there is probably keyonte George but if the Wizards roll into Mega tank mode then coolie as we're calling him could potentially pass him there I just I think I'd roll with George because he's the guy getting good minutes and doing good stuff all ready and then all as far as Cleveland goes your there's a little bit that's tied to the Delon Delon that's not right to the Delon Wright absence Mark Williams and Jordan Poole for or oh wait no Mark Williams and either pool or jaw for JJJ yes  will Draymond get suspended I think so  here's an interesting One Shining Knight says I'm at the point of the season when I can identify my team's weaknesses in his case its field goal percent and blocks and a little bit rebounds in an eighth cat Rodeo League what do you recommend in terms of future steps to improve the team well  I would not hunt more than one thing in a rotal league and then an eighth cat you almost don't really want to punt anything so I would like Lee take from a place where you feel like you have such a massive advantage that removing a little bit won't cost you that many Roto points but converting that player into someone who can improve your field goal percent and either rebounds or blocks or both could gain you some that's the way to do it so it's all about Roi you don't have to feel like you're winning the trade from just a strict ranks standpoint you need to win the trade from a roto points gained standpoint so let's say you're like way out in front of the pack in three pointers for example if you can take away from threes and only drop from first place to second place  you lose one point  but if the guy you get helps you gain a point or two points and field goal percent and one in boards and one in blocks you turn a one-point loss into a four-point game  so that's the way you want to think this through  follow-up question on that is should I focus on the waiver wire and just punt things now you you can't punt multiple things and when a roto League it just it just doesn't work like someone will be you you can get in the top three but you're probably not getting first place waiver wire would be useful um but if you're really that bad in certain things you're probably going to need more of an impact guy in them and that typically comes by trades  my two centers are vooch and yolk itch your rebounds should be fine then  you could just at what 14 rebounds a game and vouchers at like 11 right now  where is vooch do you slide back into the 40s no he's 38 yeah he's at 11 I got to think you're rebounds are probably okay and then you'll get feel goal percent should be a pretty good bun there I think I might focus on picking up a big who's more of a field goal percent blocks big  since you've got pretty good rebounds and just getting any other big even like a seven or eight rebound guy would be enough to help your team a little bit so that's that's the way I'd probably lean for your team  a couple more minutes here  which players or range of players should I Target with yakka Turtle you're not gonna get anybody  or are you talking about buying Pirtle  if you're talking about selling Pearl you're not gonna get anything back you gotta wait until he's playing better would you prefer  up slight coughing fit would you prefer Chad Holmgren or JJJ rest of season  I think I'm gonna go JJ on that one chat's been great I don't believe he can maintain 50% fee like 3 pointers and 90% free throws there's some stuff that's coming down for him  and as the season wears on you're gonna see him get beat up a little bit so I I like I mean you guys know I like Chad he was on the Danvers old man squad as what I call like the rookie take a shot one I because I thought he was gonna be his ADP I think he falls probably into the 20s maybe the 30s I think JJ probably moves past him up into the late teens early 20s something like that maybe even a little bit higher so JJ by a little bit Zion for cam Johnson all right well now this person's talking about having a bunch of punts threes assists turnovers  maybe free throws in a vacuum I obviously want cam Johnson if you're punting free throws you go Zion that's the only way in my mind you go Zion on on this one  I know it's expected but with hayward's injury how long will you hold a nine cat head-to-head I'm gonna hold for a little while here because we didn't hear about it being bad he was he was a game time decision who got ruled out like what two hours before so I don't think he even misses a week with this one  keonte George or Mike Conley give me Conley there  Kate or Kawaii Leonard head to head that's where it's a little tougher I think I'm going Kawaii  I know that the Cade thing is largely turnovers but I'm not punting turnovers I think you can  like the damage he's doing in turnover is field goal percent is  almost catastrophic in Roto and it's really really bad in head-to-head right now and even as Cade gets going I don't think there's a chance he catches Kawaii on the game side so then you're sort of asking yourself what about the game's played Gap and Kawaii played in their back-to-back because their schedule hasn't been too heavy he'll get some days off when the Clippers schedule loads up a bit but um I think you see him play in them here in the early going when they have all these two game weeks and he's not burned out yet  so I go Kawaii  and I got Kawaii on draft day too you guys know I was down on Cade  I don't like these build guys on draft night you you sure on yourself into a into a tight fit and if anything goes wrong then you're like what the hell did I do  nine cat Rodeo Kyrie and Jalen Williams or Jimmy Butler and DeMar DeRozan no that's fair that's fair  it's probably Jimmy and DeRozan by a little bit but that's a fair trade  somebody said I need subtitles yeah because my mic went off I know  doopy Doo this is where my technical difficulties where we were sorting through the mic thing thank you everybody for your help on that  we back drop Jaylen Suggs Bruce brown or Max Bruce for keyonte George  I guess it's probably Bruce brown but he's number one oh three like he's been good enough  it might be nobody guys it might be nobody out of these three you know like there's no guarantee that Gente has top 100 value the rest of the way and these three guys feel like they almost definitely will so it's probably nobody it suggests got dropped in my leak should I drop false and make the swap yeah I think I would  Dre really doesn't want to play without Steph yeah that was Rudy gobert's quote last night that was pretty damn funny Rudy was like I knew Dre was gonna try to get himself because he didn't want to bother with the game without Steph  nice Trash Talk Rudy  you know what I know everybody hates Rudy gobert but that that crap was funny and he's getting under some skin with that  Zach Levine or Jordan Poole rest of season that's Zach Levine  what range of players should I use in a trade for Jalen Williams in nine cat Rodeo if you can get Jalen Williams for top 80 range I would definitely do it and anything deeper than that is a is a guaranteed win I would probably pay as high as 70 right now  I think you could get him for someone in the 70 range that has some name power like maybe a dealer  I don't think I would give up Freddie because I think he's actually gonna be on the rise  and  who else is in there  oh Kong will probably wouldn't get it done maybe Jalen Johnson would get it done I think I'd rather have Jalen Williams and Jalen Johnson rest of season that might be an interesting one to look at  CP3 or Markle faults give me Chris Paul  should I trade LeBron and Valentino's for Scotty Barnes and Pascal siakam yes  Abe from says Tice to Clippers yeah I think the Clippers do have a bunch of guys that he's friends with is that already locked in or is this a guess  yes yeah all right so that's actually already out there so he would join the Clippers that's not a guest that's real  and they need it basically because Mason Plumlee has hurt so the Clippers need a backup big and ties would would filled out role which actually makes a lot of sense I think he I think he's buddies with some dudes on that team  love your show it's me from Denmark again what's up dude would you stream kase and Wallace the rest of this week instead of Jayden McDaniels know I think I don't think Jayden misses anytime what do you think about a trade with DeRozan for Kauai in a points League  like I go Kawaii there and we're gonna wrap this thing up I went deeper than I that I planned on it what are your thoughts of the change in value of the Bulls big three and a half it depending on where they go I think most of them are pretty stable vooch is the one I'd be most worried about going to a place where maybe they don't want to play him for you know 30 odd minutes but Levine will get his shots tomorrow get his shots Kobe white would get a massive bump because he'd be the guy that stays in Chicago  let me see if there's any questions that I really want to get to here because this is where I'm sadly pulling the plug on it meaning you guys got to get your questions in early if you want to answer on this thing don't don't be late  a lot of trade questions is John Collins a cell High a little bit yeah I mean he's doing more right now with Walker Kessler out so he's logging some sentiments he's number 73 if you can get somebody around 73 I think I would do it but I do still think that he has more of like a top one ten floor so I wouldn't Panic sell on him that's a good question on John Collins who else are there any other questions that I really want to get to here Derek white versus Kobe white rest of Seasons very much Derek white Don't Panic on Derek he had a couple of quiet games he's very good with John Collins for Jared Allen work yeah I think that's a good one go get Jared Allen with John Collins because at some point Jay's minutes cap is gonna come off and then he's going to smoke them in this one hmm people are asking if they should stash Kobe white I don't think I would do it yet  and what am I doing with Markle faults that's a good question  um let's do it I got two more questions I want to get to here what do we do with Markle faults basically it's like his knees are falling off I think you hold him because now he's ill eligible so at least you can stash him here for a little bit  I'd like to see what he looks like when he comes back and plays a couple weeks straight but you know if that doesn't happen for a while then yes you would end up being a drop and then this other one which is  Kiara Dan you and Josh Lloyd say Kyle kuzma is a cell High what type of rank should I look for oh I didn't know Josh and I agree on that but I'm not surprised because he smart I think I'm kind of smart and kuzma's very much so high because his percentages are already coming down free throw is dipped under 80 field goal is down to 409 that's gonna go lower for free throws probably all go to go lower one that happens he probably falls back towards the edge of the top one hundred  but if you can because he scored 24 points a game there are a lot of teams that would ignore some of those things and would fit better on them so if you can get somebody in the 70 range for kuzma who's like look I don't care that is you know free throw percentage gonna hurt a little bit and then you can get somebody good like I mean crap D'Angelo Russell would be an interesting Target right now I'd rather have him over Dlow Freddie Van Vleet if you can try to maybe package someone and Buy Low on Freddy that's a direction I would look Daniel Gafford believe it or not in nine cat Roto I would rather have over kuzma  who else we got in here  I don't know if I would go John Collins maybe ogn and Obi is 76 the right now I doubt you can get him  but I would think about it Jaylen Brown is also down there there's a lot of big names you could aim for you could go smaller game hunting for someone like a Jalen Johnson  I don't think you want my Conley unless you're attacking turnovers  you want to take a shot on Jane and Duran you could think about it so these are all options there as well  and that is where we'll pull the plug on an hour and seven minutes I think that's probably enough that's first five or six minutes was technical difficulties that's why I wanted to run a little bit over I'll try to edit that out for anybody that's watching way after the fact but YouTube doesn't make that super easy on your way out I'm hoping some of you hanging out with me today or new that's the most fun for me I love new faces please like rate subscribe and make sure to get your questions
