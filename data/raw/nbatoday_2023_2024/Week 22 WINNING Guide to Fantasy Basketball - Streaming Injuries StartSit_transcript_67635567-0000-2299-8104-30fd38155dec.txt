welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast friends at show two and I'm rolling back to back so we'll see if the voice actually hangs in there here for this  15 minute quick hitter  on streaming the beginning of a new week so we got to go a little bit heavier on actual week-long strategy as well but I don't want to take too much time at the front end here I do want to Dive Right In  only one remark  please follow at Dan Bass Pros on social media supports ethos.com go check out our baseball field right now and this is fantasy NBA Today almost forgot to give the name of the show this is our streaming show  it is focused exclusively on how to maximize gameplay and win your playoff head-to-head battle we are not talking Roto on this episode I split them up here during the fantasy playoffs because otherwise we'd have you know our in 15-minute episodes and I just frankly my voice needs a short break or medium-sized break but between them so we roll as we always do first of all this is a look at our streaming board for those that are watching the video with us this is something available to fantasy pass subscribers they get to see the entire thing I'm showing you a snippet here that's relevant to what we're talking about  but I want to start by talking about one main thing and that is that this week doesn't really have any high traffic days  basically none  today as eight games  Tuesday 5 Wednesday 8 Thursday 7 Friday 8 Saturday 8 Sunday 6  you are liable to have a open rosters slots on your head-to-head lineup board every single day  and if your medium heavy on one you're likely to be sort of light on the next one  as most teams this week either alternate games Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday or Tuesday Thursday Saturday and obviously there are that's not entirely true and in some people like Charlotte they don't have one on Wednesday but they fall in or Thursday excuse me but they fall into that same pattern teams kind of fall into that same pattern  and where teams don't it tends to be because there's an extra day off in between as a back-to-back all that to say compared to most weeks there aren't that many back-to-backs this week  there are more Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday so that'll be when we get I think maybe more into some heavier decision making but what that also means is that today if you're using roster moves today you pretty much want to sit on them for the week  because Wednesday Thursday Friday range is where you're going to be cashing in on a bunch of them to back load your week Wednesday to Saturday stuff or Beyond Thursday through Sunday stuff or Beyond Friday into the following week or Beyond  many of you are in your fantasy finals this week that's something to keep in mind teams like Dallas for instance they don't play after Thursday  so save a roster move for players that are just done with multiple games left in the week and there aren't that many of those mind you most teams play either Saturday or Sunday the only ones that don't are Memphis and Dallas I believe yeah Quick Check confirms that but again if you have any Grizzlies or Mavericks in your in your finals be ready to get the hell off of them after their last game this week who has the worst schedule starting today or frankly for the week ahead the worst schedule belongs to Charlotte and it's really not all that close  Charlotte has a game  tomorrow so if you have a hornet that you really like like a miles Bridges or a Brandon Miller or something like that or even Mitch you could hold through tomorrow and in fact I might consider doing so because you can still the nice thing about Charlotte is that you could use a move today to turn a two game week into a four game week but if you really like the Hornet you have you might as well get one game out of that dude and then three games out of someone else instead of zero games out of that dude in four games out of someone else or sorry two games out of say Mi Bridge let's use Myles Bridges as our example there this is just a math game  won game of Miles Bridges bridges plus the three of a random streamer is better than four games of a random streamer  two games of Miles Bridges plus one game of a streamer is probably worse than one of Myles plus three of a streamer so we're talking about this this balance point and you can happily get that balance point on Wednesday for the really good Charlotte Hornets you have on your roster so you don't have to abandon ship on them today unless they're fringy  you know like Grant Williams holding on to Grant Williams for one extra game probably isn't all that helpful but again  either way because Wednesday through Sunday there are plenty of teams that have three games to Charlotte's won the Hornets schedule really gets awful starting on Wednesday it's not horrible today tomorrow you get a game half of the time 50% is fine for streaming it's not great but you hang tough  might as well hold that move until Wednesday  Dallas has the other bad schedule this week if you like your Mavericks like a gaffer or Luka or Kyrie you hold them through Thursday obviously now if you're leak continues after that you probably tried to hold on to even gap for your definitely holding onto Luca and Kyrie after that but if you if your league ends as I just mentioned on Friday you just drop every Maverick on your roster  so those are the two worst schedules because they're just two game weeks there are other teams that have kind of bad schedules the Clippers the Thunder the Raptors have won game over four days to start this week with that one game coming on Wednesday so a Clipper a thunder a Raptor  if you wanted to move off of them today would be that day  so like let's say you went bones Hyland late last week I did that in one league and he had two pretty useful games one of them he didn't score very much made a bunch of defensive stats before  what's the kind way to put it  making diarrhea on the basketball court and yesterday's ballgame so you want to get off of Bones obviously because the schedule is not good anymore the Clippers starters are back in their  minus Norman Powell who's  starter ish  that's not enough to help bones or Terence man who actually had a pretty good ballgame yesterday these are guys you're not gonna hold on to through one game over four days because at that point starting on Wednesday you get three games out of them but you might as well just move to a different streamer who has four games over six days I would say to start the week because that then also gives you flexibility on Sunday for the Clippers if you want to get all three games you'd have to hold all the way through Sunday meaning no flexibility  I hate that same story for the Raptors and the Thunder I mean again we thought Thunder have some very fringy players that not I mean they probably didn't pop up on your radar because they didn't have a very good schedule at least the Clippers had a good schedule leading into this and Toronto at an okay schedule not great but there's loosens up a little bit now  Toronto and I mean like I don't think I'm dropping Gary Trent  because they go three times by Saturday so if you really wanted to get off a raptor you might as well take three games of Toronto and one of a streamer at the end of the week as opposed to four streamers  right like three of Gary Trent plus one streamer is better than four streamers  same for olenek Etc  if you have like oh child bojji yeah I mean you could probably find a better four game streamer out there but if you have like a half decent player try to squeeze out the game's that you can from that player  before you make your roster move common mistake that a lot of teams make is using up a bunch of moves on Monday  even if Monday's not a great day to stream  like there aren't that many teams in fact I think zero  I think there are 0 teams  that go back to back yeah zero teams that go back to back today and then flow into a decent schedule the rest of the week I want to talk about one more team that has bad schedule San Antonio schedule is not very good it's similar to the what we just talked about with Toronto but their game is on Tuesday so tomorrow meaning you could then hold through tomorrow and if you didn't like the spur you had if it was someone fringy you know like a Jeremy Sohan or something like that you could move off of him before they have two days off but then even though this person you have a back-to-back Friday Saturday so they also  finish up their week before Sunday  Oklahoma City is a little bit less great because like again you don't have the flexibility you'd have to hold all the way through Sunday to get all three games if it's a thunder that you liked liked  was the other team I mentioned in that mix the Clippers same thing the Clippers you have to go all the way through Sunday those are a little bit worse  because of the lack of flexibility Toronto and has flexibility in a way that the other ones don't same with San Antonio  so I guess technically Toronto in San Antonio of the teams that go one game over four days to start the week There's a little bit better you probably hold through Saturday if you need to to save your moves Clippers Thunder if you happen to have any fringy Thunder which you probably don't because they're scheduled sucked but if you had any  today's probably the dated abandoned ship on those guys  what about the flip side of this who has a good schedule this week well not that many teams actually  more scheduling spots will emerge as the week goes on so let's make sure that we're clear about that  for instance  what's a good one that we can use as an example here the New Orleans you know they go four times in six days but they go back to back Thursday Friday so that's an opportunity to get three games in four nights or over the second half of this week with flexibility Phoenix three times in four days starting Wednesday through Saturday  Sacramento has the same thing you die as the same thing but that also Segways into the main the discussion of teams that have a better schedule starting today Sacramento  is the best because they play today and then starting Wednesday they go into a five game in seven days stretch so if you're if you're not in the finals if you're lead continues Beyond this week Sacramento has a huge leg up on everybody else because they go four times this week and they go back to back to start next week so you can have a good schedule this week and front load next week so Sacramento Fringe players key on Ellis Kevin huerter  I'm assuming Malik monk Keegan Murray deer and fox and demonic the bonus are on rosters right now Harrison Barnes would qualify as a fringy player that would make sense for Sacramento  yeah again like it's gonna be different depending on who's available in your league I always get this like oh this guy's not a free agent in my league I'm doing my best guys I don't know who's a free agent in your league it's different for everybody just check them out see what fits  so if any of those guys is already in a roster like skip them I'm just throwing them out there I'm telling you who I think is probably  already rostered I I can't know for sure uh also next thing on the board what the hell was I doing here I'm accidentally enlarging and shrinking the wrong things there we go I did it Utah has another decent schedule for this week it's imperfect they are in the back end of a five and seven so some of that doesn't qualify but they play today and then they go back to back on Wednesday Thursday and they also have a game on Saturday so you get basically you get four games in six days if you wanted to or you just go three games in four nights if you wanted to Pivot off of a fringy jazz let's say guys start to come back and screws up your stream Utah players that I'm comfortable calling stream level Taylor Hendricks Kris Dunn maybe Bryce sensible he he's not putting a much in the way of numbers problem of course with Utah is  you know if Larry marketing comes back it changes all of this stuff if Jordan Clarkson happens to come back it changes all of this stuff John Collins probably comes back in there that like likely changes things a little bit  so that's why like  Johnny juzang I like I don't think I can put them on this list I know he's played okay last couple of ball games he may end up in the G league if any of these dudes comes back and then you picked up a dude who's getting you a zero I'm assuming keyonte George Walker Kessler and Colin Sexton and John Collins are all on rosters right now same with Clarkson same with Mark and so I'm just talking about others which is Hendrix and Dunn  and maybe sense about because Lisa's playing  those are your three Jazz options  other interesting that we talked about on yesterday's show but the Celtics still have three games over four days  and four over six but much like Utah the back-to-back falls in the middle of this stuff or towards the back end because the Celtics are on the five and seven for the Celtics and set the back end so if you're picking up a Boston player you got to hold him through Saturday not great if things aren't going all that well  we talked about Sam Houser yesterday and then he got hurt in the middle of an epic like League winning type of performance Payton Pritchard is the only real Celtic I would look at specially now with porzingis likely back so that takes Luke Coronet off the table  so Prichard is someone you could probably hold through Saturday and you'd probably get three starts out of four games for him on this met on this mess if Hauser happened to come back which seems unlikely then he could also get in there the Blazers have a very similar schedule to the the Celtics this week in fact it's exactly the same today Wednesday Friday Saturday Blazers had a good schedule for a while so you kind of know their streamers to this point  to money Kamara Delano Banton scoot Henderson maybe Chris Murray I don't think I'd go beyond that Jabari Walker is playing again so he could even creep onto that list and then the last team worth mentioning is Minnesota because they have a back-to-back today tomorrow  and it's part of a four game week with no flexibility so that's your problem there if you just wanted stream level nickeil Alexander Walker Kyle Anderson  Jaden McDaniels is streamer level all three of those guys make sense for the back-to-back the only problem is you're now forced to make another roster move I believe on Wednesday because I don't know that any of those three guys Warren's holding through a two game over five days stretch and it's not terrible two games over five days but when you think about how many moves it's taking you to keep that roster slot as a net positive  it's too many  like if you picked up a wolf today  you probably just want to hold them for a four game week and hope for the best  and hope that  like if you picked up Alexander Walker you hope that someone well can we know cats out for the year but you just hope that someone else misses like one game in there or two games in there and a magical universe  but I can't possibly advocate  pick it using a move on a timber wolf today that's one weekly move and then another one on Wednesday  that's two moves and yeah it turns that roster slot probably into a five game week but  you know what it what are you gaining here are you dropping uh  a hornet  that two game week  so two moves to make it a five gamer one and a half  extra games per move  you might as well just use one move turn a two game into a four game or and then you open up the pool at that point  then there ends up being no advantage using Minnesota over any team with a four-game week which we talked about a lot of them by the way but there are others Cleveland  Detroit  is a pretty good schedule like a five games over eight days coming up here so just Cleveland  Georgia with Donovan Mitchell back out  playable again  Detroit funky was questionable that someone else Step Up  Isaiah Stewart is a good stream a golden state has four games this week Indiana has four games this week so there's a lot of teams that have four games  fine you can move to any of those from your two gamer if you wanted to or like we talked about hold your two game her through their game on Tuesday and then turn a one game or into a three game or after that  I just don't think there's a lot maybe almost anything gained by using a move to Minnesota today  if you're not playing on moving off of them later in the week why switch to a guy that you have lower hopes on  now again someone like a bones Hyland who basically just went back to a goose egg you can go from Bones he is a three-game week but who cares you know his three game week is like a one game week for any for even a regular level streamer okay terrific go from Bones to anybody with a four-game week it doesn't have to be Minnesota  anybody with a 4 game week would do  so that's where I sit for this week  ultimately  today is not a great day  for doing a ton of long streaming  there are a few teams like we talked about where if you have somebody fringy on them you want to get the hell off of it like don't wait  that's like sitting on those guys is a very bad idea specifically if you have a fringe level clipper  because they got so much worse with James Harden coming back that's a situation where you want to turn their three game week which basically profiles is much less than that into somebody playing four times who's actually gonna get streaming level stuff but even if you go all the way to the two game teams most of them you could make a case to hold through Tuesday  there are very few players  outside of injured ones that I think are necessary to drop today  I think if you can  hold as many of your moves as possible through Wednesday of this week  see how all of your guys do your low traffic teams on Tuesday because they pretty much all play Tuesday the teams that have three game weeks pretty much all play onto not all of them but a lot of them play on Tuesday Clippers don't for instance  see how they do  and go from there the only other little tiny caveat to that would be the Lakers who play tonight and then our off for three days after that but we'll talk about them on tomorrow's show because starting tomorrow they have a very bad schedule  so that's really where I'm looking like if you have a Laker get off of them tomorrow a fringy Laker I should say  Charlotte fringy player you can get off on Wednesday Dallas you could hold them all the way through Friday if you wanted you don't have to make your moves now  even the Bucks who don't play today or tomorrow but then they go back to back  so you're back to two games over the first four days you're like you're basically locked in like a lot of other teams  because of the way this week is built without overflow days and without a ton of really powerful scheduling like spots because there are no teams that go back to back today that have flexibility  it's generally pretty wise to hold on to at least three maybe even all four of your weekly moves going into the week I know I don't say that very often but sit on them if you can  I didn't mean to zoom back out again here  there we go  all right everybody thanks so much for watching let me do a quick check on the chat room while I remind you guys to follow me over on  Twitter at Danvers d a n b e s b r i s  uh is Kelly Olynyk worth holding or getting a guy like slo-mo taeler Hendrix Kris Dunn well I think this falls into my discussion of  you might as well hold on for a bit because like think about it this way  the Raptors play three games by Saturday Utah plays four games by Saturday  you can add one game with a move their do you actually get more in four games of slow-mo versus three games of Olympic  I'm not sure you gain anything and if you do it's a razor thin margin a couple of points a couple of assists I mean even that's questionable  a couple of points a couple of assists probably  is that worth using up a move I don't think so I think I'd wait  and then on top of everything else with slo-mo you'd have to hold all the way through the end of the week  you could use that move on Olynyk slot on Sunday if you want to get three games of Kelly and one game of slow-mo if you wanted to no reason to do that today  is Kyle Anderson in I don't think we know yet actually  I haven't seen it no no new news on that already  yet  the only Minnesota news we got so far is that Rudy gobert was present at shoot around  I would Keegan not be rossed or he's rostered I just hesitated before I said something forgot about him for a second  Payton Pritchard yeah  hey Dan how are you doing in your League's I'm in three I'm in foreheads I'm sadly I wish it wasn't that many three of them were already in the playoffs I I'm in the finals now in one of them I Advanced I didn't think I had a shot I lost yesterday I was winning 5-4 and yoga having a terrible field goal percent game cost me a trip to the finals in the other one go figure  should have played Jordan Poole over yokich how could I have known  30 deep I also I beat brewski actually in 30 deep so I just went to the Conference Finals in that one that's a four round playoff instead of three and 30 deep and I've Kyrie in a two-game week so that's gonna be  gonna be a tough one but generally pretty well and then my Yahoo publicly just started to Playoffs today I was in second place so I have a buy so generally pretty good I'm gonna win money in one of them we know that already because I'm in the finals and if I can get into the finals in the Yahoo League I'll be pretty excited about that too  I'm in Thompson or Aaron neesmith if we're talking about just streaming here both teams or Houston three games nice Smith Force so nice Smith is if you're just going streaming if you're going  games cap then it's Thompson  would you rather add Jordan McLaughlin for the back-to-back today or I had someone better between today and tomorrow because considering only one game first Playoff round on ESPN points League I would rather hold off again I don't think there's a huge advantage to adding Minnesota players today because you might as well just hold him for the rest of the week  in the championship this week all thanks to you and the huge daily stuff appreciate it you got a man you go on streaming crazy these days  TJ McConnell or Delino band this week give me McConnell any hope of lamelo coming back I doubt it  what am I supposed to do with Mikhail bridges in a points League Brooklyn has a good schedule but he's just chucking shots lately he's been horrible yeah he's been terrible but you kind of have no choice but to sit on him  now hard or sensibaugh points League oh that's a good one I'll go nem hard  and then pray  but they have Cleveland without Mobly and without Donovan Mitchell so that'll be pretty the defense will be a lot easier to deal with Detroit horrible defense Warriors Matt defense Lakers are not playing any defense so and he's got a pretty good schedule this week  in terms of  who they're playing I mean how hard I really don't like his Fantasy game with Utah the issue is that if somebody comes back then since about just completely disappears  should I consider dropping Drew holiday um I mean honestly it's probably a two-game week for him  I think what you might do is see if he's probably he's not playing today so you'll get a game at him on Wednesday and then you get either Friday Saturday I think I'd probably hold through whatever game he plays on this in that second back-to-back and then you can move off after that if this is your finals week otherwise no  best rest of season Roto ads uh we needed that for the other show the show this isn't a roto that's the first half of our our double dip here  I have no idea Randy I'm really sorry I can't give you a good answer that question because I don't know who the hell is on your waiver wire and this show is all about streaming so hit it up in the comments section on one of our other shows or take it to Twitter or take it to YouTube or  Discord and and we'll you know we'll try to handle it over there the best we can but I'm gonna need some names  okay two shows back to back in the hopper thank you guys for watching both of them hopefully this one gets you started again big thing today don't use a move today unless you must so get off of guys that are giving you zeroes or near zeroes but otherwise  deep breath patients your opponent is probably gonna make two moves today because they're like oh no I have some guys that aren't playing  but they're gonna they're gonna overextend  by holding on to move where you don't really lose out on adding games played you can figure out what categories to attack and you can get more options because more teams have better schedules the rest of the week  I've known as valentina's and Walker Kessler sitting on the wire should I grab them  one of the Pelican schedule again this week  Valentino's grab them tomorrow if this is for streaming and Kessler grab them today  yes is the answer to those those guys are gonna have decent numbers this week I know jv's been bad but four games you take it  should I drop Grant Williams Javis Burton's for a four  game schedule player Payton Pritchard Sam Merrill something like that and then the next person is asking about Harris and Barnes I already talked I talked about Harrison Barnes a couple minutes ago so rewind the story here on Charlotte is it depends on how good the player is you like if you like them a little bit hold him through tomorrow because you can still get three games after tomorrow and against their one  that was baton I don't care that much if you can get a better player than novice who goes for times then yes I don't think there's a better streaming option today with four games this week then Grant Williams in a league of what I assume Miss sort of like medium to high competitive Fitness so I would hold Grant Williams through tomorrow uh let's see here  if you're asking questions about who has high and low games you got to go back to the beginning of the show guys I did this I did this  what about JJJ uh yeah he'll  they've been resting him against Bad teams  will he want to play against Wendy that's a good question you probably plays the two good opponents to start the week I really don't know  he's good enough for a two-game week probably fits in a weekly lock League compared to four out of like a top 15160 range guy so I would probably start him in a weekly lock and then you just hope call it a 30% chance he plays against we good enough  is Jeremy granted drop at this point probably if you're out of injury slots can't take 0's for him if you're in the playoffs  who's more droppable cam Johnson or Paul Reed points League I would probably drop Reed  although  it's Brooklyn schedule this week well this week it's cam  if your head to head battle right now he only has three games in and reads got four so if it's this week if you're like just looking near term you want the guy playing for games so I resented my original answer all right I gotta get out of here I've been podcasting for like an hour and a half straight good luck everybody try to save your moves that's the big it took me a half an hour to tell you don't do anything unless you have to but there are some spots where you have to guys that are hurt like a Jordan Clarkson maybe droppable bones who's not going to do anything droppable there are other names out there guys that are putting up zeros that's where you got to abandon ship almost every other scenario you can hang on a little bit and still get basically the same stuff out of your week we'll do two more tomorrow I think tomorrow's gonna be a tight squeeze but I'll do my best I'm Dan best briefs follow if you're watching on social they're like 400 of you watching on Twitter right now follow Dan Bass Pros just
