welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right show two of the morning going back to back today maybe I could  punch him out one after the other this is the weekly preview show for week 19  recap show went 50 minutes so I thought all right you know what instead of stretching that to an hour 5 let's just open up a new one this will give people an opportunity to just hit the things they want if you guys wanted the weekly preview you got that here if you want to recap you got that in the last one you kind of skip around a little bit easier hopefully you guys appreciate this it is a little bit of extra work on my end but I find that's okay and honestly they gave my voice in 10 minute break in between shows very long commercial basically what that was welcome to  this bonus half quarter whatever you want to call it edition of fantasy NBA today I am still Dan Bass Pros should you happen to be finding us for the first time through this program it's at Dan Vespers d a n b e s b r i s and this of course is a sports ethos presentation you can see that logo plastered all over the video screen if you're following using both the audio and visual mediums and if you just watching or listening on the audio side Sports ethos ethos that's the spelling on that bad boy baseball draft guide coming out as soon as later today we'll have the first features in there again you can get the MLB fantasy pass for six bucks a month Joe orrico's top 250 will be the rank board in that draft guide should be amazing we have Dynasty stuff forever in it so if you're into the baseball Dynasty side that's gonna be a big big part of the draft guy to have projections starting pitcher breakdowns relief pitcher breakdowns all sorts of incredible stuff strategic elements drafts  it's going to be awesome it's gonna be awesome if you have the all sports fantasy pass you get access to it all ready soon as those items drop you can go and check them out  but here's the week ahead it's weakened 19 I'm gonna treat this as the last non-playoff week There's I mean it like we could potentially make every week a playoff discussion but at some point you just kind of like have to pick a moment and so next week March the 4th is when I'm gonna be basically treating the our sort of nightly breakdowns as playoff tilted and what I mean by that is and I know this is taking up a minute or two at the beginning of the show and you guys just want me to get into this stuff but this is actually really important when we get into those playoff shows I will likely be splitting up my show into two halves daily  sometimes the recap show if there's like three or four games a day the recap show might only be 20 minutes long and then the preview show might be the longer one so instead of doing one long one we're gonna break it up into chunks because I got a lot of feedback last year that people were like Dan we only play Rodeo we don't want to hear about your long playoff streaming board and then I had people that were like your head to head stuff is amazing right now I love the long streaming but I don't want to have to sift through this ridiculous recap stretch so we're gonna bust it up  and that'll start next week  although Monday next week's gonna be weird so we'll probably try to do the weekly preview show sort of in conjunction with the nightly streaming board but that's gonna be the way we treat things going forward starting as early as next week this week is gonna be a little bit of a Down week because I think by Lowe's probably don't make sense anymore Mott team most League's are passed their trade deadline at this point so I don't know if we're gonna have that show mixed in there we already did our Silly Season stash board so there aren't that many sort of like one offs that I'm gonna throw out there but I'll try to come up with something for you guys but starting next week they're gonna be a lot of shows I'm gonna try to do one every day if I can because every day there's something going on with your playoff head-to-head battle and you just like  I can't like if I do a show on a Friday that may not apply to what you're working with on a Sunday  if you have any questions by the way on today's show because we're running live we're talking you know weekly preview feel free to throw them in the chat room I can probably get to them if they're about this topic weekly preview stuff  so the big thing and you guys can see if you're watching the graphic is small right now the big thing going on this week is how did how to handle the streaming stuff  there are a lot of ways that we can approach it and I'm going to go ahead and make that bigger so you guys can see this is actually an item that's in our fantasy pass this is the streaming board I've added some some color coordination on it we're gonna be going through this on today's show to see kind of how you break it all down and the reason I like to do it this way instead of just saying oh who has X number of games this week which is otherwise also relevant but to me that's just a starting point so if somebody's offering you up you know a weekly games total board that's a great place to begin  but it doesn't tell the whole story  so like if you're looking at a games played board right now for the teams in the NBA I believe one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve of the 30 teams are four game weeks and the other 18 are three game weeks  there are no fives which are pretty rare this year other than some rescheduling talk to five in there and I think Brooklyn has one coming up and there are no Tuesdays this week which is Tuesdays are more common  almost every team has a two in their schedule somehow a lot like the Clippers have a lot of force but then they have some twos to balance it out  but the fact that there are no twos this week means that first thing that should pop into your head is okay well there isn't like an obvious player on my team that I need to abandon ship on great that's lovely  by the way they know who's next week either Brooklyn has a five if you look in that far ahead  okay no Tuesdays this week that takes one of the little you know OHS off the board because you don't have to look your team go crap I have a two what am I going to do with this guy it also means that most likely you and your opponent are going to have a relatively similar number of games played this week it's not going to be exact obviously it's not going to be exact but because it's all fours and fives if you and your opponent just set your lineup for the whole week I would bet and I like to say this I would bet my vast fortune that if you're in like a Yahoo public prize League which is 13 roster slots that's pretty small rosters but  you're probably gonna be within three games of your opponent  it also means that because 18 teams played three games and 12 Play 4 they're actually just aren't that many games this week  for whatever reason it's just a little bit of a lower tide week of basketball  I can't explain it some of it is because teams played a bunch coming right out of the All-Star break last week so this most recent week you had a bunch of threes and some twos jammed into four days of basketball and so then the team sort of resultant you get a little bit of a semi breather and some of it's just luck of the draw so what all of that means when you roll it together is one you don't really have a bunch of guys on your team that you have to like avoid you don't have those radioactive two-game guys that are sitting like between 75 and 125 you're like I can probably find a four gamer at 140 he's gonna do better great that makes it simple but on the flip side of that is because it's not that many games this week it's not like there's if it was like flipped and it was 18 teams had four and 12 had three then it'd be a pretty busy week but just that difference of like basically six ball games effectively  not that I mean it's a little bit more than that I guess because we have to slice it in half so you can't just say 12 times  what did I say four that'd be 48 but those teams play each other right you have to divide it in half at the end  so just aren't that many games this week  three times 18 is 54 and 12 times 4 is 48 so that gets you 102 so 51 games total this week I think if I'm doing the math right on that  that's not that much  so what it means is that if you can find a way to squeeze an extra game or two to really utilize your streaming board  that to me tell this says this is one of the most important weeks to stream  because at the beginning of the week you and your opponent likely have an almost same or very close to same number of games whatever maximal streaming you can do actually is going to help a lot  you know a busy week  you might have you know again the 13 Ross you might have like 458 to 409 that's good  but if you can find 35 into 30 or 39 it's a much larger percentage gain over what you were going to have  so streaming is very important this week there are other factors at play that it's hard to talk about all of these on One show but I'm going to do my best the other thing that you have to stick in the back of your mind is if you playoffs start next week and you're streaming this week  you need to figure out okay am I safely in the playoffs because if I have like maybe I if I have a shot at a top two seed you want to be going for a buy there's a lot of stuff you need to be considering if you're gonna go for a bye week if you have to make sure you're in the playoffs then you need to be streaming extra hard if you feel like you're comfortable in the playoffs but maybe can't go for a Buy in the top two seeds then you likely save all of your moves until the weekend to front load next week I can't go over all of those strategies on One show right now they will likely change over the course of this week and you know what your situation is better than I do personally I have a head-to-head team that's in first place by the way not punting turnovers turnovers on that team yeah you can still do really well without doing it I have a head-to-head team that's in fifth place so that one is hanging on by a thread that was a team that lost the third and fourth round picks and it's been kind of fighting but better I got a couple of guys back there so that one I obviously need to be going Buckwild all week long on moves maximum streaming I think I have another one that's like right near the bubble on getting in that one I just didn't draft all that well one bad luck just not a great team so for those two I got a stream like a son of a gun and for the one that's in first place I probably want to maybe stream just a tiny bit to lock in  my first place  but not a lot I want to make sure I'm saving moves to get ready for next week  but let's say that you are attacking this week and this week only let's say that you have a team like the one that I was describing that's you know fifth sixth place where you have like a three or four game gap it's unlikely you're gonna fall out of a playoff spot but if you get smashed this week and that guy in seventh place has a great one you flip and you're out  so then we look at what's going on this week so look at the graphic if you can see it on your screen if you're not I would this is the type of show I recommend people try to watch if they can next time because looking at this streaming chart is actually really helpful and one of the great reasons you guys should get a fantasy pass next year if you didn't do it this season one of many reasons we have daily projections now guys we have daily projections  the other thing you'll notice as you look at the streaming board this week and maybe you can do it just by looking at the way the game's are listed on how many games per day so let's do that actually let's do that thing four games tonight  that's a low tide 11 games tomorrow that's high tide on a Tuesday  Wednesday only 6 Thursday only 8 Friday only nine one two three four five yeah Saturday 5 and Sunday 8 again  this reminds me it's almost like a bubble week where every day seemingly is like five six seven eight or nine  that was the best buy the way the bubble was horrible and everything about covid year was horrible but the fact that they were eight games and it was like two games every couple of hours all that was great you just have the TV on all day watching basketball okay so the game's this week are happening in the evening like because you know home court and tickets sales and all that good stuff but I love it when it's spaced out like that but the first thing you need to look at if you're streaming this week is are you overloaded on Tuesday because that's going to change the way you approach the front end of your week  if you are in Yahoo public prize League where it's 13 Ross or slots and tart start 10  in all likelihood your Tuesday will be right on the borderline of an overload  because just think about it from like how many teams are playing and how many are not  22 out of 30 teams are playing which is  what's 22 out of 30 uh 22 times 3.3  actually you know what we can just do this on a calculator 73 73% of the league  and you need 10 out of 13 to maximize your roster slot at 77  so on average you would be just slightly under and overload day  tomorrow Tuesday  11 games and a Yahoo is just slightly under now if you're in your own league and like let's say you have 14 Ross or slots and you need to start 10 now you're actually likely to be slightly over and overload because it's 10 out of 14 is only 71% of your roster and again what did I say 73% of the league is playing tomorrow so leak settings are going to matter how many bench slots you have is going to matter but if I assume that you're in a Yahoo League start 10 3 bench so short bed you probably will need one more guy to make sure that your Tuesday is full so I'm gonna assume that there are no overload days this week but definitely check because you might have one this is all average  it'd be very easy for someone to have all freaking 13 of their guys going tomorrow if you just have dudes on the right or wrong team  so if you're overloaded tomorrow you're likely in the minority  and so then you don't really have to worry about tomorrow it does change approach a little bit  but let's start with the let's start with the odds that you don't because again the numbers suggest that more teams won't have an overload tomorrow then do  in that case and you can see from the color coding on the screen the Brooklyn Nets  the Detroit Pistons  the Miami Heat  then New York Knicks all have a back-to-back to start the week  some of those teams have a slightly Superior schedule beyond the back to back for instance  Miami goes four and six days New York goes three in four days  Detroit doesn't they're just straight back-to-back and Brooklyn goes four and six  so if you wanted to go long stream you have options on Brooklyn  Miami  and sort of New York that's like a medium stream that's a four-day  so then you go to your board and this is easy I'm not going to tell you the names here on the show because I don't know who's available in your league but New York probably doesn't have many streamers just based on like who's roster to heavily their starters of the guys that are playable right now my Emi might give their some suspensions so someone like a Caleb Martin today probably has a big role tomorrow back to kind of a smallish role but getting that on the back-to-back would be interesting and you could even hold him for  six days this week because he's been you know like top one 50 range 150 160 when the team's been healthy and you get three games of that plus one game of top 100 that's actually pretty good thing to squeeze out of six days and you can make a move on Sunday  but if you're also looking for six days you could go Memphis because they go today Wednesday and then Friday Saturday it's sort of back loaded in the better part of their schedule think about it they're a hard team to handicap right now or Brooklyn they've got these fringy dudes if someone didn't pick up Dorian finney-smith he'd be kind of interesting for this most of the other guys on that roster that have a chance to be interesting in six days are probably rostered already but that's the way that you'd think about starting your week and then Detroit if you just want to go with the back-to-back they probably have more options Quinton Grimes even if one tekio these are guys that are on Waiver Wires right now in a lot of leagues very useful on a back-to-back if Grimes plays the back-to-back but not for all a long term thing  so those are the ways that you could start the week I would suggest whether or not you have an overload day tomorrow consider making a move at the beginning of this week because if you don't do it today you'll almost definitely not making a move tomorrow then you have all of your moves on Wednesday and your opportunity to maximize games played string with every passing day of the week  so yeah there are some teams that go for in six starting tomorrow but how much is that actually helping you  you might as well use the move today even if you don't have an overload day tomorrow because like what's the point of waiting at that point you're sitting on a guy who's not playing today to pick up somebody who is most of the teams that are playing today are teams that you want to just hold the guy the rest of the week think Sacramento are they the only team that goes today that doesn't have a four-game week  Sacramento plays today they've only got a three game week New York plays today they got for Toronto plays today they have four Miami Minnesota or sorry Miami Memphis they played it they've got four Detroit's got four yes there's a spaced out a little bit more Brooklyn's got four so if you have a guy that's playing today he's probably guy that you can just hold for a while like unless he's horrible and you need to get off abandon ship  this is likely a guy that like they're gonna play four games this week you probably hold on to them because again it's a lower games total week there isn't really a movie you can make with that roster slot that's gonna increase your games played by more than one  and even then you're looking later on down the week so what's the point  Sacramento if you have like a Kevin herder they played today you can make a move tomorrow when Sacramento only has two games arrest of the week you switch that into somebody who has four so that's way to add two games to your week but that's the only way to do it after today  there are some other spots where you can add two games rest of week much later in the week  but again in talking about like why would you save a roster for tomorrow there's no reason  if you're gonna use it tomorrow you might as well just use it today  except for Sacramento  because a lot of these teams just don't play today so there's a opportunity to take one of your guys that maybe only has three games the rest of the week turn them into a four by making that move today  and you could also turn them into a four that maybe is open on Sunday if you wanted to make it additional move  as you look towards the rest of the week I'm skipping over tomorrow because again presumably if you're using moves you're using them today you can start looking at Wednesday but there aren't that many great options there Denver and the Lakers have some kind of intrigued on Wednesday because they go back to back Wednesday Thursday and the Lakers have three games in four days over that stretch nuggets actually do as well one of them is against each other that's that's the Saturday game so that's a situation where those two teams have three games left the rest of the week but again there's like there's nobody in the league that only has one from that day on  so even if you made a move on Wednesday to a back-to-back  you're not gaining two games the rest of the week  there aren't that many reasons in my mind to do it unless you only have like one roster slot you're streaming and so you went with the Detroit back to back and then you could go to a Lakers or nuggets back to back and then you could go to a Thursday Friday back-to-back if you wanted to are there any teams that have a Thursday Friday night yeah Portland that's it so you're stuck with Portland they play the Grizzlies on back to back days and then you made another move on Sunday so one move Monday one move Wednesday one move Friday one moves Sunday yes you turned that rosters slot from either a three or a four game week in to a seven game week  but the best you can possibly do with that is adding for games to your week  that's the best  and that's not horrible  and it's something that you should definitely do if you only have one streaming slot but a lot of us myself included a lot of my teams have two streamable rosters slots  so I'm not gonna use four moves on one roster slot I'm gonna longstream two of them or medium stream two of them for instance the Knicks were a team I mentioned they don't have many streaming options but just hypothetically they're a team you could pick up Monday Tuesday Thursday  and then pivot to another club that has two games between Friday and Sunday  so now you've used two roster moves  and hopefully you've been able to maximize your situation there but that would ultimately be now a five game week  okay  but again you know I  point I really want to sort of cycle back to here is  using your moves kind of earlier this week makes sense because as the week drones on the best you're gonna do is add  one game the rest of week with a move  with the exception of like we talked about  Sacramento after today  and Chicago doesn't play over the weekend Milwaukee New Orleans don't play over the weekend  and we'll Sacramento who we already talked about and the Wizards don't play over the weekend so you're two choices this week and this is probably the way I would stack it up  moves today  and probably moves Saturday  Phoenix has a back-to-back over the weekend that's your only option there  so you can't like sit and wait and hope that you get a Sons streamer  because if that teams fully healthy they just won't even have a streamer  like you could take a really so Neil who's probably on rosters after the big ball game he had yesterday might get dropped because the Suns don't play the first three days this week or an Eric Gordon if he's back but if that team is fully healthy those guys are getting probably mid-20s minutes off the bench and I don't know much they're doing with them and I don't know if they're even gonna be available in your league  you might want to try to get two sons for their weekend back-to-back but there might not be two suns you go in bowl bowl and and Roy so Neil you could get him maybe  what are the odds that two of The Three Sons Fringe guys are available Saturday Sunday You're gonna be fighting with everybody else in your league for those if that's the way you're playing this week so those are your options which is why again I recommend using some moves early save one or two in case of injury for later in the week and then you can maybe you know use them late you add one game to The Ledger that might just have to be the way that you accept it going so make sure you're adding four minimum games played to your Ledger with the streaming you're doing this week and if you're looking towards next week let's say your playoff start Brooklyn has a five game week  so if you can get your hand on some Nets this week they go for in six days you'll be best served just holding on to him  because they've got the best schedule that anybody has in any week all season long next week  and they play Memphis in there they play Philly without embiid they play Charlotte and Detroit in their Cleveland at the end of the week that's the like really legitimately good defensive team Charlotte's been playing better defensively but some really good matchups for the Nets next week in a five gamer  they are the only team that starts next week with a Monday Tuesday back to back  so Brooklyn is the team you really want to be leaning in on I would advise making moves to Brooklyn now because they've got a good week this week as well I mean you could pick up two Fringe Nets today and just hold on to him for two whole weeks and use whatever other user other two roster moves towards the end of this week if you need to or I mean stream a different roster slot I don't care  get nuts  but go Brooklyn that's your team with the best schedule and at the end of this week maybe on Friday show or maybe we'll do two shows on Friday or something like that we'll start profiling how you get ready for your playoff starting next week  and I think that's basically what I wanted to talk about on today's show in terms of getting ready for week 19 two shows back-to-back let's see what we got over in the chat room here and I'll leave this this window up here but doo doo doo doo doo doo doo many only answering questions about streaming  and so if you have questions that are not specifically about streaming you can throw those in the comments after the show and I will get to those at some point  I think we just got news on Chris Paul  yes he'll be back tomorrow well that'll be interesting Warriors have four games the rest of the week starting tomorrow I don't know if he'll play in the back-to-back but it's a possibility because it was a hand thing so you know it's not like he needs to rest a knee or something like that so Chris Paul absolutely an ad if you can get him I mean probably got dropped in some spots this might ruin Brandon pajam ski it might ruin Klay Thompson it's hard to know but Chris Paul presumably he can get up to full minutes pretty quickly as well again because the injury was not too a lower body situation so there's good news on that front good good stuff in the chat room there because that happened while we were on are what else we got CP3 going to knock dream on down to a drop possibly  possibly  I'm locked in the first seed this is Steve I'm out of streaming spots for the playoffs because I picked up so many rest of season guys how do I decide who to drop between keyonte George  Tre Mann Paul Reed Jordan Poole  schedule  go on schedule  that's it it's dwell Al Horford worth holding through the fantasy playoffs probably not because he's gonna sit back to backs so depending on when your playoffs start you can look to see when Boston has them they don't this week or next week but they do the week after that the week after that so the maximum you're gonna get out of order is a three-game week and then you're kind of just hoping other guys sit him out  so I would say probably not  do do do do do do do do do what do we got here  oh yeah there's a Warriors back to back in there as well sorry was pointed out that Milwaukee is not the only one there so you do have a Thursday Friday back to back I just I still think front end and back end of this week is the way to go  or just go Brooklyn and never look back  would you drop Max Drew for a net Fringe player if you're going into your playoffs next week I probably would a Cleveland does have a four gamer next week and a four game or this week so this week no I think he'd be better than a fringe guy next week maybe I guess it kind of depends on who The Fringe guy is on the Nets so but probably in in a perfect world to this question I'd rather drop someone who has three games this week and next week for a brooklynite so you know Boston they go from you go from six games to nine games over the next two weeks Denver if you have any fringy guys there Pelicans are three three phoenixes three three Spurs jazz or three three pivoting off of one of those guys to a net player that has nine that's a big jump  a three-game bounce over two weeks in one roster move that's terrific  any Brooklyn players worth streaming this week yeah I mean like almost everybody because they start the week with a great schedule and then they flow into a better schedule next week and I think that's where I'm Gonna Leave it hit me up with questions over on Twitter at Dan Bass Pros that's where I can probably try to help you guys with some of this streaming stuff that's hard to convey without knowing sort of individual situations I'll do my best I'm gonna try to host a an AMA in our Sports ethos Discord today if I can find time this afternoon that Discord link it's free it's in the show description so check that out right now follow me over on social at Dan Vespers but again the comments Discord if I'm doing an AMA that's the best way to get a hold of me off the show and I will talk to you guys in a little bit on all of that stuff thanks for joining us for two shows today I'm gonna stop talking for a bit cheers
