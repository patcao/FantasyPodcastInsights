welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  show time ladies and gentlemen number two on this  actually kind of wet Wednesday morning it's raining in Los Angeles we don't know what to do with ourselves out here when that happens but we'll find a way  fear not  you guys don't need to worry we'll be fine  we got show Halo Tony so everybody in Los Angeles is fine they can rain on us forever and we're fine  yep hate me if you will that's okay welcome to Fantasy NBA today this is a sports ethos presentation and I'm your host Dan Bass Pros  it's a knowing last name I love it but it's annoying I love it because it's Unique  but look I should have gone by Dan Walter a long time ago that's my middle name it's my mother's maiden name  it's too late I'm Dan bass now  I mean I always have been but  missed my window  I was Dan Bebe when I was working at pregame.com I don't know if you guys know that how many stories have I haven't told that many specific stories of my time at pregame.com sort of a weird time in my life but I was day in Beebe I had my own web page and everything  was silly  but now I work in fantasy sports which is obviously not silly at all  it's very serious serious matters  here's a dumb little treat for YouTube viewers we've been doing a lot of  I call Winter cleaning here in the apartment Hanukkah ended kids got all kinds of stuff it felt like the great opportunity to take  older stuff and remove it from our house and we came across this and I don't know how clear it is on the YouTube video but this is a baseball that has this is from my childhood  and I don't know how I ended up in our house here is supposed to like my mom's house but it's got finger grips for learning how to throw different pitches so here let's see let's learn  a fork ball know let's throw a slider so the thumb goes here and the fingers go here across it and then presumably you snap down with that bad boy so you're not supposed to do this with a seven year old that's what my kid is the kid 70 year olds not supposed to try to throw a curve balls but that's a fun little toy came out of the woodwork here at the oldest person apartment complex anyway  why am I talking about random BS well because yesterday was a brief fantasy card there were just four games on the docket  Memphis God John Moran back that's the big story they went into New Orleans fell behind by 20 points and then came back and won it jaw a game winner  in his first game back 35 minutes 34.6 boards 8 assists two steals one block 12 out of 14 shooting 10 out of 12 at the foul line  here's the thing  so I'm gonna need you guys to once again hold two thoughts in your head at the same time so whatever you need to do to prepare yourself please do so now  John Morant is going to be good this year  John Morant is also going to be dramatically overvalued in nine category leaks  we've seen it year after year after year after year last year job ran averaged 26 points 8 assists and six rebounds  and was number 92 on a per game basis  and it's the hardest damn thing to reconcile because he is the poster child for a player that is way better in real life than they are in nine category fantasy League's because he doesn't really hit that many three-pointers which is kind of surprising for a guy who scores as much as he does  both of his percentages were pretty good size negatives  it doesn't block shots and his turnovers are very high  many of you are hunting turnovers on the head-to-head side obviously that moves them up the board a little bit  but as nine category players go John Moran is always going to be extremely overvalued  and that's fine it's because he scores a lot of points and gets a bunch of assists as our hard things to find I get it I get it the intrinsic value of those categories is not necessarily the same as others but  if you're in a nine category League had to Head Road oh whatever and you need to be consistently competitive in all nine categories  he does sometimes more damage than good  that's not number one I need you to hold in your head  thought number two I need you to hold in your head is that John Morris historically has gotten off too fast starts in fantasy reality whatever season you want to talk about if you want to look at last year I told you he finished at number 92 what you may not recall is that at the very beginning of the season and I took freaking hell for this because on every podcast leading up to the year I was like guys like I know you're going to be tempted to draft John Moran but believe me when I tell you he's better in reality then he is in nine cat John Moran through the first month last year was number 43  he scored more he rebounded more he hit more three-pointers his field goal and free-throw percent were both higher  as the season wore on jaw tired  you call Luka Duncan  it's kind of the same thing and by the way that's the first month last year if you go shorter distance basically the shorter the Run of time you're using at the beginning of the year  the better his rank was if you go just like the first two and a half weeks John was number 30 because he was shooting 50% from the field and 85% at the free throw line  he did the year before too you guys don't need me going all that detail just believe me when I tell you got off to really hot starts each of the last two years I had people in my Twitter mentions going Dan you Biff this one hard he's this is the year and I was like give it time  and again this isn't me trying to clown on John Murray he is one of the most exciting players in the NBA he's a he's an All-Star level player might be a superstar level player but from a fantasy standpoint me you know this is a nine category Roto Baseline and then you tweak from there to fit your team situation whatever that might be  all of that very long-winded explanation to say  if you now have waited this long on John Moran there's going to be a built-in desire in your heart to cash in on what you waited for  I want you to try to beat that feeling down deep as far as you possibly can and go try to get some top 40 asset for John in nine cat right now today  because this one ball game yesterday it was a you know first round type of performance  but we know he ain't averaging 34 we know he ain't averaging three defensive stats or 50/83 splits  duh  but you could probably go out right now and get somebody ranked around 35  and people wouldn't even bat an eye you could probably go get Freddie Van Vliet go do it  you might be able to get bam out of Bio go do it  Darren Fox  he's scoring 30 points maybe not might not be able to get him  you might be able to get Anthony Edwards who's ranked 39th right now  or Jalen Brunson at 42  do it  as a really my thoughts almost on that entire ball game as a whole as far as Memphis goes Marcus Smart is closed I would stash him as well just to see what happens it might not work I don't care you throw him back into the pile if it doesn't work  by the way JJ's now been a top 20 player for the last two three weeks in a row so  anywho New Orleans side not much to go on here just a quick thought on herb Jones who has unfortunately kind of fallen off a cliff here over the last four basketball games he still number 54 by averages on the year so that's why you got to give some leeway he's actually number 38 by total so he's been even better than that  but he's been bad the last week there's really no way to sugarcoat it outside the top 200 minutes of fluctuated at role has really really fallen off and you got to think that some of that is because the Pelicans got healthy some of it is because guys run hot and cold and and when a guy like herb runs cold who relies on a couple of three pointers ridiculous defensive stats and percentages  to float his value if that stuff goes away there's nothing to fall back on because he's not rebounding he's not passing he's not scoring so there isn't that sort of consistency the stats that don't bounce as much from week to week  I've got a lot of people already telling me it's time to drop  I disagree for one very clear cut reason and that is whoever you're dropping him for right now is almost definitely going to be a short-term solution  where the guy like her you know again even with this really bad last like real bad last week he still been inside the top 55 on the whole season that's how good he was the first six seven weeks  guys like that don't grow on trees if you're dropping him it better be for somebody who has like top 65 rest of season potential there's literally only one player that's emerged lately that I thought I might consider dropping her for that guy and it's Terry Easton basically everybody else that's jumping up on the wire is oh that's a one two-week fill-in for someone who just got hurt  those are not the guys who should be dropping her before  and in fact my recommendation hard though it may be sometimes these are complicated days you gotta be a little bit patient  give them another week  please give him another week if this thing if this you know right now it's a slump if it lasts two or more weeks then it starts to feel a little bit more real then you move on  I promise you will never forgive yourself if you drop a player who comes roaring back and ends up as like a top 60 full season guy  there aren't many worst things you can do because you ain't missing out on much what you gonna do pick up Zach Collins in case we misses another ball game congratulations you got one more good game out of a guy but you gave up on someone who might be arrested season play that just cannot be the calculus for how to win a fantasy league if you're in a competitive format  so give it a little bit longer  Trey Murphy all so by the way a hold he wasn't very good in this ball game so his minutes were depressed slightly but he'll be fine top 100 is the target for Trey Murphy anything better than that is gravy  we move on  folks picture this nightmare scenario  you're hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with

must be 21 plus not available in all locations no embi as I just mentioned a moment ago he sat this one out Zach Collins slid in its Center and of course he had a big ball game and now that's basically the role for Collins at this point he's a wimpy fill in and less they move him back into the starting five meaning streaming for now and drop him probably when one banana comes back  I call Victor webmin Yama when Yamaha say it slower Dan Malachi Branham we have not even one full eye on Malachi we have a half an eye on him because he's more of a points League type of dude but he's starting right now so you know pay a little bit of attention and that's as far as I go I want to keep moving I don't want to spend much time on Malachi Branham it makes me feel sad to talk about the Spurs more than I have to  guys I think we may have exhausted the Buy Low window on Damian Lillard he's top four play over the last week and again it was one of the easiest by Lowe's on planet Earth because he was shooting 41% from the field and that just wasn't gonna stick I mean this is a guy that was shooting 45% when everybody was guarding only him and Portland and now he's alongside Giannis that just like you know it wasn't gonna stick so anyway now he's destroying he's up to number 15 on a per game basis played in 25 games for the bucks so far so he's actually number 11 by totals and that's why we had him on the Buy Low board we can a half ago  that was an easy one  Brook Lopez six more blocks  for the king of block country right now at least he's actually leading blocks it's got to stay ahead of chat  I love me some Brook Lopez I really do  Malik Beasley 20 28 minutes in this ball game you know there would be some kind of cool down but he's a hold right now Chris Middleton showing signs of improving he's a hole and then Bobby Portis he's part of this new group that I coined for this week called The Stream wall hot group Portishead hot got cold these hot again so play him while he's hot  easy peasy move on when he's not  is Bobby hot or not.com  fabled old website hey before we get to Phoenix Portland I want to remind everybody to hang out with our buddies over at

ping me over there I do keep one eye on the chat room to see if there's anything that pops up there that I kind of forgot to cover in real time so if you have something that you think might apply to everybody that would be the place to drop it  but again making no promises about covering the chat room during the show that's just sort of a little side bonus  Phoenix this was a game they probably should have won  special when Kevin Durant scores 40 points on 28 shots but he didn't get a whole lot of help Devin Booker had a quieter ball game I know he had 26 points and seven assists  but this is like the Anthony Simon's 26 and 7  which is funny because Simon said 23 and 7 on the other side it's just took too many shots to get there didn't involve nearly enough defensive stats for Booker not nearly enough three-pointers um so it's like one of those games that  looks better I guess that it was and I'm sure he'd say the same thing so this is not me  trying to be a butthead or anything uh  fantasy wise couple of notes on the Phoenix side for one Grayson Allen actually does look like a guy you can play right now is that a couple decent ones in a row rebounds are not going to be a thing that sticks but steals do tend to be pretty reliable for him  some three pointers usually Blended in there and as long as Bradley Beal is out I think I'm trusting Grace and Allen so go ahead and make him an ad and then on the booker front  here's the thing  you guys know that I didn't think Booker was gonna get to his ADP which was like around 14  if I'm remembering towards the end of draft season all these Pages have changed their numbers now so it's kind of hard to remember  and  for a while there he came out of the gates and he was roaring  and again people like to dunk early  here's the thing  reality does eventually set in Booker's gonna have as I've said before a very good fantasy season  especially with Beale missing now two months and Counting  so first of all he and Kevin Durant is both have both been able to do more than we expected to this point  but a few things were happening with Devin that we knew weren't going to stick  the field goal percent was crazy high the assists were crazy high the defensive stats were actually higher than expected  and that's why when he was sitting at like number six or seven he was a sell High guy  and I think a lot of people thought that I was  sort of stuck on a take  and I get it but if you guys have followed me for a while you know that I'm an extremely extremely pragmatic fantasy player  2A to an over patient fall at times probably a lesson that I need to get better on is sometimes being a little bit more aggressive  but when you see something that isn't sustainable  it's worth pointing out  so and again it's a small but significant Booker Has Fallen  little by little  it hasn't been this like big massive game-changing drop off  but over the last two weeks he's number 41  you know last month he's like in the 30s  that's not to say that he won't come roaring back and have a week where he's a you know putting up first round numbers again but he's down to number 21 in nine category leaks right now  now if you're saying steals he is worth more because he's a guard that doesn't get many defensive stats but is very very good in points assists  free throw percent  like a neutral guard in field goal percent is technically kind of a win  or if you're  I don't know I mean everybody had dead says they're punting turnovers but like that's not really that big of a deal for a guy to have three kind of near the top of the board  or if you're you're looking for a really high scoring dude who doesn't get that many three-pointers he actually kind of fits into that mold as well but again  ranks are ranks are ranks if you're incorporating all nine categories he is now behind his ADP  and missed two weeks of games  so you can try to slam it on my face all you want that like you got off to a crazy hot start but it's gonna be about the long game here  and be still isn't even back yet what do we think that's gonna do  now much the way that I feel like people are going to take the beginning of the show and say oh Dan hates John Moran know oh Dan hates Devin Booker I don't hate any of these guys  I have no emotional attachment to any of them other than I guess Brooke Lopez who I am very emotionally attached to  I'm trying to find ways for us to win  and when Booker was number six trying to move him for somebody that had full season first round appeal was the move  now he's number 21  I still think you could probably get someone in the top 15 for him because of his giant scoring and assist numbers  so if you can you should  because I actually feel like and you know this may not actually be a thing until Beal comes back this actually looking at him right now for Booker this is probably about where he's gonna be while it's just Booker and Durant around number 20 maybe the assists come down just a littlest bit but  the thing I'm more concerned about is what happens when Beal comes back does he actually take anything away from Booker and Durant frankly  and I think the answer has to be yes even if it's only a small amount  so that's why I said what I said it's why I continue to say what I'm saying and it's why right now he's behind his 80P  kill me if you want I'm just reading the damn basketball monster rank page  and they're ranked page is very good  for Portland shaedon Sharpe got hurt early in this ball game left after 8 minutes that's stinks if you were using him against the games but you shouldn't have been because how many times did I need to yell about how sharp was a cell High a couple weeks ago when Simon's was out and Grant was out and Scoot was just working his way back into shape and sharp is averaging 17 points five boards three and a half assists in a steal and somehow he's outside the top one 60 on the year why because he's been a huge negative and field goal percent  and that matters if hunting field goal percents a little bit of a different monster but his role is decreasing now not because of anything he's doing wrong but just because the team is getting healthy brogden's back Simon Says back Grant is back at eight in his back  he doesn't need to play 42 minutes and take 22 shots a game he can play 35 minutes and take 15 shots a game  it's too late to sell high on shade and sharp but you know at this point if you haven't you're sitting on him you're hoping he comes back and goes on a little heater and then maybe get another window  as it stands right now Simon's 8 and Grant are the safe place on Portland Malcolm Brogden is a safe play if sharp misses any time frankly if any of the main guys miss a game Malcolm Brogden is the guy but he was trending down when everybody was back  to money Kamara started and actually had an okay fantasy line but 21 minutes ain't enough same with Matisse stibel who was on a defensive stats role right now but 21 minutes ain't enough  and that's about as far as you go cuz scoot Henderson is a luxury stash remember he had that two game Run and I was like don't don't believe that this is him like fully figuring it out it's gonna be up and down and up and down and up and down  you've probably got about a month and a half two months to wait on him becoming a bit more consistent  best guess but that's when it happens for a lot of these young guys and that's what you got with the Blazers right now  Golden State beat Boston and overtime Christopher singha sat this one out so I'll Horford at 1312 and 6 with 33 pointers didn't shoot the ball well but who cares anytime porzingis sits Horford is the man  Jayson Tatum tweaked an ankle didn't really look right after that  I've got to think he sits out the back-to-back in Sacramento but I guess we'll see if he does you could probably get a 3-point Blitz out of Sam Houser for a game if you really wanted  hey homerun hack I get it but it's there meanwhile Derek white is the freaking man every time we think he can't go higher he goes higher he's number 24 now  they're quite as a second rounder on a per game basis  that's pretty sick  more interesting side in this one was the warrior side I don't think that there's any fight in that one um  Steph went nuts so there's that and Klay Thompson 24 points again  Clay is on the rise ladies and gentlemen it took frickin' long enough but he's finally getting there he's like top 50 over the last three weeks now so hopefully we can just sort of forget the beginning of the Season happened those aren't the guys you're thinking about let's start at the bottom and work our way up Andrew Wiggins did start the second half because Brandon pajam ski got hurt for his back in the second quarter he's questionable for their next one and frankly they need him because Wiggins is God awful now Andrew Wiggins has turned into a full-blown pumpkin  drop him  drop Wiggins useless  sack of sand  page is is a  that's a that's a pain in the butt he was really looking good as a villain option and hopefully he'll be back again you know who knows with this type of stuff game two games week nothing we really don't we have no idea  try to hold on because he looked like he was going to be a really good filling during this sort of dream on green list era  but also I get it if you don't have room for him if he doesn't get an eel tag  you're kind of stuck in head to head you don't want to take Zeroes  two players that I know you guys want me to get to before we finish up the Warriors Jonathan kaminga 17 and 7 with two steals shot the ball well and missed two free throws again the free-throw thing I just cannot get over because he needs the other stats to be  so good right now  to overcome the free-throw issue  because look like over the last week  a lot of his numbers are pretty good he's averaging 14 points five boards a steal 1.33 pointers on 58% from the field but he's shooting 54% of the foul line  and I just I like I don't think I have space on my roster  for a guy who's not putting up  big popcorn lines  and can't shoot free throws  like if you can give me big popcorn lines and you stink at the free throw line  I'll deal with it but he's missing all of them  that can't hit a free throws save his life right now so head to head  you know if you're not winning for free throws anyway he makes a lot of sense it's like a soft punt that kind of thing Roti I can't possibly give my blessing on a guy that's been that bad at the foul line and not good enough in the other stuff to counterbalance it  and then Trace Jackson Davis who was actually kind of had two decent ball games in a row though his minutes were super low in the previous one got extra time in this one some of it was because gemski was out some of it was because Jackson Davis was playing well some of it was because Kevon Looney wasn't some of it was because Andrew Wiggins wasn't  some of it was because Dario Sharps couldn't guard anybody  and look  I'll be frank with you guys  I've gone back and forth since last night  probably a dozen times  on what the actual move here is with Jackson Davis and I think the answer is that it's  kind of League dependent  in the following way  so first of all he's he went from 1% roster to 14% rostered overnight and he got picked up in like almost every single League I'm in  because everybody wants to be out in front of it  here's the thing though it's not always going to be this good  it's just not an 18 minutes which he got in the previous game is generally not going to be enough but he was a huge positive for the Warriors last night  and he probably earned himself another try at the very least to do it again  use a team best plus 25 in the minutes he was on the floor and a lot of that was because the warriors were down almost 20 points he was part of the unit that made the big comeback so of course you're gonna have a big plus minus  almost anybody that comes in when a team is being blown out  is gonna have a polarizing plus minus  like if you're part of any kind of comeback it's gonna do a thing  I think  so like again it really depends on the drop  don't drop somebody that you think has appeal  for the rest of the season  but  in Rhode Island  if you could kind of treat them almost like an injured player and just wait it out a little  that I can get behind  or if you're in a head-to-head league and you have a streaming slot and you're like you know what I'll just turn this streaming slot into trayce Jackson Davis to see what happens because the Warriors look their schedules not great for the next couple of days and then it gets pretty good they wanted the best schedules starting on Friday  they go Friday Saturday and Monday wedged all around Christmas time  there's like three or four teams that have a really good schedule like that Mavericks nuggets Warriors like those are the three that go three and four starting on Friday  so yeah you kind of got to pay it forward with two days without a game for him now but then you get a really nice run and so over you know three games in four days even if he's not very good in those games you're getting pretty good numbers on the head side and then for Roto  because you're gonna get this like a decent sample size to see what he's gonna be then you might be able to make a call hey do I play this guy on Christmas day do I play him in their back to back because they're playing some clunker teams in the back-to-back Washington Portland  they should be some numbers to go around there  so I think there's a pretty good argument to be made that you could grab him call it a speculative add I believe that's the old fashioned fantasy term for it  and then  play it out because the schedule allows it  what do I actually think is going to happen I think he's gonna cool off considerably I don't think this is going to be a thing that sticks  but also you don't want to miss it if it does  even if it's just a 10% chance  if you've got something you can  junk into the waiver pool and never really think about again  then you go ahead and do it easy peasy  um  what do I want to do here before we wrap things up we've got a  pretty good sized Wednesday card on the docket why don't we do a speed run through that and then we'll wrap up the show  um Charlotte is adding Indiana not much there other than just kind of waiting on a lamelo status situation Indiana we want to know if Myles Turner's playing or not for the heat Jimmy Butler's been ruled out of this ball game already so we should have some streamables  streamables it kind of feels like Edibles the way like I say it and I'm like oh yeah like we're just gonna get a little high on these these one or two game guys  latency who's starting for Butler that'll be a good indicator of which guys gonna make the most sense Kyle Lowry is likely a stream and then one would assume that like a either Caleb Martin or jacquez is probably the next in line there but they might go Duncan Robinson so let's wait and find out or Lando sounds like window Carter Juniors coming back he'll probably have a minute's cap but that messes up whatever you had going on at Center which might have been Goga and remember Wendell Carter Junior is not really a great nine category guy better points League Center so I'm not all that concerned about it  Timberwolves  think basically just whether or not anything Edwards plays it's the only thing for Philly I am interested in what's gonna go on with Kelly oubre it's a good defensive team so they may need a little more  a little spark Off the Bench and bead versus gobert should be interesting  Utah  we got this little Talen Horton Tucker thing going on I really need there to be a bad ball game so we can just stop even worrying about it Colin Sexton's been good I expect John Collins to probably get back into the starting lineup we've seen Walker Kessler starting good good Cavaliers carols Levert see if Max Drew's can bust out of his bad shooting spell right now that's the whole thing going on with his fantasy dip is that he's been shooting 31% but again  up and down it's a long season guys get hot guys get cold  the next nothing really Isaiah hartenstein is rolling now that Jericho Sims is out Brooklyn  Camp Thomas you know I've been talking about he's a flippable  Denver nothing Toronto nothing  Atlanta mostly just how they're going to use okongwu  Houston tari Eason Lakers  I'm gonna assume that everybody relevant is playing so nothing really  Bulls Alex Caruso if he's in good if he's not probably go Patrick Williams  Clippers are rolling Mavericks you guys know where I stand on that one I'm basically only using Tim Hardaway Jr I don't trust the other Wings to be consistent enough  Boston just who's in on the back-to-back whether or not Jayson Tatum sits and then Sacramento basically nothing so you know we're in one of these these windows again where it's the the  surges when I think I've said the terms I've been flow a lot on this podcast over the years and that's really what it is there is these Ebbs and flows of when fantasy stories are coming and going and in between when you're when it's flowing then you're looking for like big tickets stuff and when it's ebbing that's when you're looking for more injury replacement stuff  little little things around the edges to improve your team and that's how you can really make a difference  let me uh  quickly scan the chat room see if anybody's got sort of some overarching things we throw in there um pretty pretty  would you drop Trey Murphy for a healthy Brandon podemski and head-to-head I would not think Trey Murphy's arrest of seasoned guy I'm almost always gonna be prioritizing rest of season guys  so here's the thing so they're more there's some more thoughts in the chat room about Jonathan kaminga and how I called him more of a punt free throw guy here's the issue guys he's not doing enough in the other categories  that's the problem it's not just that he's terrible at the free throw line that's certainly a part of it  it's that 15 points and five and a half rebounds with a steal and a decent field goal percent is not enough positive impact stuff  to counterweight the power of the negative free throw  and by the way it's it's more than two for most of these games over the last two weeks he's averaging three and a half free throws a game  so the issue isn't just that it's a free throw percent and and I should have been more clear about this because the way I said is like oh well he'd be on my team if not for the free throw here's the thing  if not for the free throw he would be borderline  so that's the issue like compare him to someone  take like Rudy gobert as a good example of this who's what like around 60th something like that number 58 right now  61% of the foul line five free throw attempts per game  the reason that he can be on fantasy teams even with his bad free throw shooting  is that he's a huge positive and rebounds blocks and field goal percent  he is doing enough to counterweight the negative  or as if you look at Jonathan comingo over the last two weeks he's number one 173 and 9 cat and it's not just because of the free throws yes that plays a part of it unquestionably and it's why that was sort of the stat that I chose to focus on but he's only number 92  even if you completely ignore the free throw meaning if you're a punt free throw team  he's barely a start  and that's why I said Head to Head go for it  because head you just kind of hope that he doesn't like take too many free throws over a three games banned or whatever or you know the the fluctuations of it you get a bad free-throw week you get a good free throw week number 92 you get a minute you know three games in four nights kind of thing that's good  but Roto if you care about free throw he's doing more damage than good it's the plus against the negative and right now the negatives are bigger than the positives because there are other negatives he doesn't pass he doesn't shoot the three ball he doesn't block shots actually which is kind of interesting he gets steals but doesn't block  so right now the combination of negatives is larger and it's not that close actually then the combination of positives so it's not just the free throws that was I should have done a better job of explaining myself on that one it's that  one two three four he's like five negative impact categories right now and one  actual positive is field goal percent that's what it's been a positive points is fine but he's not like you know 15 ish points per game is not really doing damage when you can go get somebody gets 12 and isn't obliterating a different thing like that's just not 3 points a game is nothing  minimal impact and rebounds you can find five rebound guys on the waiver wire they're there now if he starts to do something that's significant  then that starts to outweigh the damage in free throw in  non blocks from a big man Etc  so it's that combination of items  and I only highlighted free throws because that was sort of the biggest among them so hopefully that makes a little bit more sense  all right let's wrap it up you know I kind of want to try to do a third show later today I have no idea if it's gonna work no clue because my schedule is absolutely out of control but I had this idea that I wanted to do forever and I think it's going to be like a really fun people want to talk about it sort of
