welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  hey happy Friday everybody it's a weekend review time here on fantasy NBA today I'm in for some reason all Los Angeles Garb I don't know why it's just the crap I grabbed off a shelf here and a wall there  I don't shower before I do these shows you guys should know that by now so the clothing du jour is really whatever I can snatch from some weird corner of my bedroom first I hope everybody's having a really nice week I hope that everybody's week is coming to a pleasant relaxing and  I know for me this week very much was a ramp up  kids were sick most of this the first half of the week they're both out of here man they're out of here  I got this place to myself for a few hours  the dog has a freaking appointment today because why would Dan have a regular day to himself he doesn't by the way is that the note on that but that's okay that's easy you know I have to fight with the dog about anything you just put on a leash and  off we go  this is a big week in review show and of week 12 we got ads we got holds we got the I'm scared and nervous guys we got the watch list we got the stream while warm Ward  which is growing by the way I've been adding names to it we got a massive injury replacement board  and I'm realizing that as I begin the show I actually forgot to copy and paste these names into a Word document so we're gonna go even lower Tech today  and we are going to be using  a note pad document which I know is absolutely the fanciest thing you can do  oh my goodness I really this is Rock Bottom Man  but we're going to do it which means you're also going to get to see a lot of the names before I actually get to them because I can't separate it by Page the same way that I could with a word doc  let's see think I could put this all into a Word document while I'm talking you guys I don't think I can you know what let's just see what it would look like well what's it gonna look like if I share a notepad document here it's gonna look like this  that's not that bad I guess it's flickering why I don't know  why are you flickering document I don't like that at all  okay well maybe this isn't gonna work let's not let's not share that  can't have nothing nice around here all right here's what we're gonna do danios gonna copy this stuff into a Word document while I'm talking to you because I mean look here's the thing  we got a couple of notes here at the beginning of the show  first things first you can find me over on social media at Dan best purse d a n b e s b r i s this is a sports presentation  the show of course

things as we continue to try to grow what we're doing over here  and someone asked what kind of dog it's a some sort of crazy mix there's Jack Russell in her that's like it's about as much as we know we got her at the pound the West Los Angeles pound in November of 2013 she'll be 11 in February and  she's an 18 pound tank  tough dog man  tough dog  gumshoe is her name she's a freaking Warrior  not that like she's had to go through a lot we don't really know what happened to her before we got her but she's tough I'll get these little dogs that are super tough like that but she's a tough customer she's eaten so many weird things total billy goat of an animal I think my favorite might be when she ate a blue ink pen and then pooped blue for two days  we talk a lot about bowel movements on this podcast I'm realizing I don't know how we're gonna get new listeners that way but now you never know  might latch onto somebody who's just like you know what I want today I want fantasy basketball information  and  talk of defecation  let's do a weekend review you jerks kidding I love you all let's start with the ads that's what everybody wants to know only four names on the ads board this week and you know I'm gonna try to do I'm gonna make the font bigger because I think it's kind of hard to see and well I'll just make sure that I scroll as we're going the four ads this week add number one is Donte divincenzo who I admit that I was a little bit slow to add because the minutes were not totally locked in  on a game to game basis he played 29 and a half minutes yesterday which is way more than enough but for the most part he was hovering between like 18 and 26 which historically for Devin Gentoo hasn't been enough  he's been running hot which obviously works in his favor but the big note I think that we're finding with Dante is that his permitted production is way up this year and I can't really explain it because for most players when they come to the Knicks  that's not the thing that happens they're gonna get usually buried under Julius Randle and Jalen Brunson and for a while it was RJ Barrett just kind of doing all the stuff but David genzo is out there getting 10 11 shots in 25 minutes a game  I mean just look at back at basically every year of his young career when he came into the league like 2018 since he's played in the 20s in minutes so excluding his rookie year 23 minutes we'll just read him straight through 23 27 20  got traded 26 and a half 26 again last year in Golden State and now 21 and a half with New York  the thing that jumps out to us right now is that in New York this year  in 21 and a half minutes he's taking eight shots a game  in Sacramento two years ago he took 8.7 shots per game in almost 27 minutes a game and the most he's ever taken in his career was nine back in 2020 with Milwaukee and that was in 27 and a half minutes per ball game so what you're seeing is that his activity is just up right now I don't know that it sticks all season long I really don't  but right now he's averaging a career best in scoring at 11 points per game and that again is in only 21 and a half minutes per night  last night for example Thursday night he played 29 and a half minutes in their loss in Dallas took 13 shots  nine and ten the two games before that in about 22 minutes per ball game they had a 16 minute game I was a weird one blowout win in Philly where he took only six shots but prior to that it was 10 11 21  he's pretty consistently getting nine or ten shots in about 22 or 23 minutes of ball game  so then the thought becomes all right well you know they brought in OG&E that's not great for everybody but they sent out two guys in Emmanuel quickly and RJ Barrett whoever averaging more minutes combined then OG figures to get when he arrives so that means more for even so more for Josh Hart more for Quentin Grimes even if it's not like this overwhelming Avalanche Hearts not gonna go from 20 minutes to 33 but even if he goes from 20 to 25 or 26 if he holds on the current per minute pace that he's on I don't even care about the fact that he's shooting 407% because I do think that number comes down it's all about the activity right now for him and I just sort of didn't believe it  which means we're probably a little bit late on this one but it happens  so make sure John Dante's an ad  see if he keeps up this permanent production which is again very weird but if he does  there you go  Jaden Ivy is the name on the ads board he certainly a much better add in points I continue to maintain and again there I think I said this on yesterday's show there's nothing to say that he can't get better from last year to this year in fact most young guys do get better between their rookie and sophomore year certainly between you know first and third Seasons if we get that far  but he was so far away from having nine cat value last season when cayde was out that it's like well what do we really think change  dramatically season overseas and to say yes this is why Jaden Ivy is now magically a nine category guy even though he really wasn't closed last year he played plenty he had a week here and there where he put up nine cat value but by and large he was so bad in turnovers defensive stats and particularly field goal percent between the various percentages that even that I mean look at it like the last 10 games last year Jane Ivy averaged 22 points almost three three-pointers and almost eight assists per ball game and he was outside the top 180 because he was so bad in defensive stats field goal percent and turnovers that it couldn't counterweight the good he was doing in the other stuff  again Improvement does not  you know we can't preclude we can't exclude the idea that maybe he got better and so maybe the turnovers won't be as big of an issue maybe he'll get a few more steals or maybe he'll fall into a block or maybe the field goal percent won't be quite so bad that is a path forward which is why I think you probably have to add him in most places in points League's head to head you're probably starting because you're likely punting one of those things because freaking everybody is that's just the universe we live in right now even though I don't think you have to really don't think you need to pawn a turnover or a percentage to win your head to head league in fact it's probably time to zag when everybody is doing that but regardless by and large a lot of you are probably doing it because it's just sort of like the path of least resistance these days so sure you're starting in their Roto  I don't know  it's gonna have to do a lot a lot in the counting stuff  to overcome those problematic areas  I think you need to add Draymond Green not because I think that Draymond Green is about to magically become extraordinarily good at basketball again because he's old and he's slow and everything is trending down but mostly because I think the Warriors are  I've done a really good job not swearing on this podcast over the years and I'm not going to start today I think the Warriors are trash without Draymond I think most people are seeing that and so they're going to make sure that he's in everything and Chris Paul is out so he's going to have to be the ball move on offense  I don't like dream on greens Fantasy game all that much these days he wasn't really all that close to being a must start guy before you went down he was number one 52 I believe this year no that's not right  no that is right 152 at 10 points five and a half boards and six assists Steals and blocks or way down and he's just like old itis you guys know I like old man types that doesn't mean everybody that's old is an old man type  dragon man doesn't really have it anymore but at the same time the Warriors are gonna need to see what they are with Him healthy  he's only played 25 minutes a game so far this year mostly because of ejections and injuries that's not a number that's going to stick he'll get into the 30s and so you'll see the scoring the boards the assist the steals the blocks all that stuff is going to be higher than it looks like it is right now he's got a shot to get inside the top 100 110 feels maybe like a more reasonable Target but I am adding him with the expectation that he'll be back in the next one to two basketball games  and the last name on the ads board is one that may shock you Daniel uses his BuzzFeed voice Kris Dunn  who over the last two weeks this is one of the silliest stat lines I think I can possibly relate to you is averaging three and a half points per game in 22 minutes a night  three and a half points per game he is legitimately not bothering to score  3.3 rebounds 5.66 is pretty rare you get a guy who's averaging more assists than points two Steals and 1.1 blocks it's even rarer rarer that you find a guy who's averaging basically the same number of combined defensive stats as points but here we are  but that's the thing Chris Dunn is Matisse diebel with assists instead of a three and a pointer  and thigh Bol when we when he's rolling is a top 100 guy  so we kind of have to just sort of believe what we're seeing with Kris Dunn who's been actually kind of on the upswing over the last two weeks in fact over the last one week he is up to 25 minutes per ball game and over the last week he has averaged more combined Steals and blocks then points per game he's at 3.8 combined Steals and blocks and he's at three points per game  that's one of the craziest and dumbest stats that I think I've ever brought to you on this show  but it is to be rostered right now because in 2425 minutes a game he's generally been a fantasy startable guy in 9 cat fear to points League you're looking at me like Dan you must have your head so far up your you know what there is no chance and yet you're right don't bother don't bother points leaks that's crazy we scroll down into the holes and again because I screwed up my formatting here you're not gonna be able to see everything on the same page you're gonna watch me do it in real time here are some holes I don't know how much explanation a lot of these guys need but we'll we'll go into detail on any of them that actually do Aaron Nesmith as a hold I don't think requires a lot of explanation Alex Caruso Dennis Schroder probably all so don't require a ton of explanation all the you guys know that I'm not particularly high on Dennis Schroder he's number one under 125 and he's trending over the last week excuse me 125 with the last week 110 on the season it does feel like he's been trending down a little bit  although after the very hot start and then cold spell to sort of level off you guys know the great leveling the great leveling it always happens somewhere in that six to seven week range and now he's leveled off at 1:10  he's fine he's not gonna blow the roof off the building but he's fine  Gary Trent Jr requires I think maybe a little bit more explanation I just so I'm not all that high on Trent I don't think that he's someone that you need to be racing out to add I just I have this feeling in the back of my brain that he could get a little hot  but more than anything he's the guy right now that steps into big stuff if anyone goes down for Toronto  because the Raptors they don't have another option anymore  this is the this is their group  and yakka portal is already hurt so there's already a little bit of room for Trent that there wasn't two days ago even though I know that young is picking up a lot of those minutes  Gary Trent probably at the end of the day profiles better  as an injury replacement than a hold on this board like  it probably makes more sense to have him sitting somewhere off to the side and you say all right well you know like if Scotty Barnes has missed a game you play Gary Trend or if manual quickly misses a game he played Gary Trent this because all the sudden 15 16 shots fall into the shot pool and Gary Trent is lying there in the middle of the shop pool  it's a waiting pool it's a backyard you know above ground inflatable he's lying on his back  collecting water and squirting Fountain up into the air and he just waiting for one of these guys to pour a bucket of water in so fine call him an injury replacement blah blah blah move on Colin Sexton is a whole he's been fine lately so you guys probably don't need an explanation on that Derek Lively is a hold if you can  that's not just a traditional horror that's an h i y c  uh heck  it's like a hiccup hold if you can I get it it's hard we don't know really know when he's coming back  but I really like his Fantasy game we just need him to stay healthy for more than four games in a row  it's really hard to hold I get it  D'Angelo Russell is a whole he played more yesterday and the Lakers discussing blowout loss in a day of all blowout losses  because he's basically being showcased Russell's getting moved there's almost no question about it at this point uh he and the team seemed to have soured on each other he is playing  kind of Lucy goosey basketball right now  where that that's not the d low that the Lakers want they wanted the aggressive confident focused one and now they're getting an aggressive confident unfocused Dilo  but you can't drop him because he's too good fantasy wise he's too good offensively and he's gonna end up someplace where he's going to get to do some stuff it's sort of reinvent again  poor Dlow I thought he was going to be a decent fit  he's getting blamed for stuff that isn't really his fault Lakers defensive game plan is idiotic  but  because D-Low is one of the players that's been getting yanked around with all this stupid stupid crap and it's like oh well we surely we can carve out minutes for cam reddish yeah I mean obviously he's annoyed delos annoyed  Max Drew Scott hurt which unfortunately as much as I've enjoyed his crazy minutes per game Run did kind of feel inevitable with as many minutes as he's been playing  almost 34 a ball game still shooting just 40% from the field he's a hold because as that field goal percent ticks up towards 403 he moves back into the top 80 range I am not a feared  but the injury is annoying and probably one that we could have seen coming Grace and Allen's a whole I don't think that one actually needs much of an explanation he didn't do much yesterday but Phoenix didn't need him to because Bradley Beal went completely insane and the game was over relatively early  and Jalen Suggs I actually there's no reason he's needs to be on this I forgot to take his name off that board he's not even need to be on the holds board because he's been really good and nobody's asking about him it the I'm scared board comes next on the list whoops scrolled too far I know this is low Tech today even lower Tech than usual  this embarrassing man and embarrassing level show what happens if I change the width  nothing  just wanted to see what it would look like in real time  hey before I tell you guys about the folks that I'm either dropping or I'm about to drop I do want to remind you to check out our Pals over at

was no other reason to put him back  is the third week in a row I told you guys to drop Gordon Hayward there's no explanation I'm just having fun John Collins I had him on last week I'll put him on again it just feels like and I know he's had a couple of okay games mixed in but it just feels like his aggression is not quite there and with Utah giving everybody 25 minutes a night these days that's not enough time for him to get it done so I think you can move on he's more of a streamable type  and that's like there's just not enough there buddy hield I'm dropping bench buddy hield is not good Malik Beasley I'm dropping because he's not doing anything besides hitting three-pointers he I think I mentioned on a show earlier this week profiles better Beasley does  as a  injury fill-in type when you know either if Dame or Giannis or whoever if Middleton if those guys miss a game and there's suddenly a bunch more shots available that's when he becomes interesting  I think the Mavs streamer wings like Derek Jones Grant Williams Dante Exum Josh Hardy you know Jaylen Hardy Josh Green  was the actor who's gonna make a joke and I Tom Hardy I was screwed that up I think all those guys can probably be moved on from outside of again head-to-head type scheduling plays Patrick Williams is a drop with the bulls healthy and then not a drop yet but I am genuinely concerned his Brandon Putski who feels like he's kind of run out of gas someone was asking me I think on Twitter what do you mean like why would you run out of gas it's just that the rigors the length of an NBA season is not what young guys are used to  you got to remember college basketball players played two games a week  that's it outside of tournament time  then they ramp it up for you know a couple of weeks in there they've got their conference tournaments whatever they might play three games they might go back to back to back sometimes okay they've got enough in the tank to do that like once a year in the NBA you're doing it all the time you got back-to-backs you're playing three four games every seven days they are reasons no break you don't have three four days off to regain your strength go sit in a couple of classes sleep until noon  then on top of that you're also bashing up against people in the NBA versus college that are like one point eight times larger  sometimes more than that depending on what conference you're coming from  and guys just get worn down and then guys get worn down quicker if they're playing the way pajami did which I mean I think we all really loved it but it's you know head down crashed through a wall for your team get all the rebounds get all the assist get all the steals do everything you can and then you know sleep when you're dead kind of thing well he's kind of dead right now he may need to sleep before he dies  so it's closed he may be a drop a hold on a little bit longer but I do think that he's out of gas  here's your watch list Andrew Wiggins is on my watch list in case the Warriors pivot back into veteran and ending veterin  or trade him  really hachimura is on my watch list because it feels like the Lakers badly need him because they suck right now I know they want a couple of games but they were not decisive nothing the Lakers have done lately has been decisive  that team needs a big shake up and it probably needs to come from the top they're gonna make a dumb trade instead Alec Burks remains on the watch list he was putting up some pretty good scoring numbers before Kate Cunningham went down we'll he now have the bandwidth to do more than just score is what I'm watching their  I could core and Sam Merrill on the calves are on my watch list I know they don't play again until checks watch 2025 because they got a fly back from Europe but it's true Smith is a game and you know Garland who by the way Darius Garland is someone you should go trade for right now because I'm pretty sure that dudes playing in like the next two weeks cam Whitmore on Houston is a watch list guy also a spec ad you could call him a speculative add Luke Kennard same story kind of a speculative ad type but I think maybe tilting a little bit more towards watch list there and Xavier Tillman is a  watch list you know last time I know they had bismack biyombo around for a while I'm not sure that I believe that Tillman's gonna just play all the sentiments for this team because they'll run JJJ its Center they'll run Santi aldama at Center and if they go into tank mode then who the hell knows what's gonna go on for Memphis at Center if you want to pre add again tell me you could call a speculative add he has kind of like top 100 big man upside rebounds field goal percent some steals basically but not consistently and I don't know that the minutes are going to be consistent either I know what you're thinking Dan or you know you're thinking Colin Dan where the hell is Vince Williams  injury replacement list don't worry we're getting there we are almost there there was something else that I was gonna mention about the Cavaliers oh I remember so in a big news break that will do at the end of this big board the big news break does pertain to someone that we had on our Bi-Lo board I said do it before you get any good news well the good news is out now  here the names that make the stream well warm board right now Bobby Portis Nas Reed Cole Anthony Kelly Olynyk Kevin loved any of you Atari and Prince Jordan Clarkson and RJ Barrett play those guys when they're hot and Abandoned Ship when they're not no other explanation needed on any of them other than obviously they could move into sort of a you know injury replacement posture if someone in front of them  gets hurt like you know if Walker Kessler goes down or John Collins goes down then Kelly Olynyk would become more of it every day play or like if or Lando of Jalen Suggs goes back down Cole Anthony become more of an everyday play and for now as Reed who might actually be on the injury replacement for right now because remember he had a big game with Rudy gobert out he's an injury replacement type you guys get the idea I think I think you guys get the idea  it's hard to put all these thoughts together  all right here we go buckle up everybody these are the injury replacement boards make sure to follow ethos fantasy BK by the way on Twitter outstanding news feed that's up to 10,000 800 followers now which is pretty damn cool not only do they have breaking news but they also have post-game news which not a lot of the other news feeds do make sure to follow ethos fantasy BK I put that right up on your screen here for those watching the video those listening you guys already know what to do  all righty here they are and all of their Glory I think it does continue on to a second page yet two pages of these names TJ McConnell for Tyreese Halliburton Bruce Brown probably  probably Bruce Brown also for Halliburton nazri if gobert Mrs another ballgame I don't think he will slow-mo if Conley misses another ball game I don't think he will Al Horford if any Boston started sits which it sounds like they're good for the next one but you never know Harris Levert continuing this is a rolling one for Darius Garland said he'd Bae this is a rolling one all so this time it's DeAndre Hunter and stead of jail and Johnson for a while Nick Richards still rolling for Mark Williams Malcolm Brogden is back on the board if healthy he didn't play Yesterday button sharp got hurt to like it was in a doctor soreness thing which usually guys don't play in the next ball game but we don't know yet what we do know is that when either sharp Grant or Simon's is out Brogden is the winner but when all three of those guys are healthy sharp Simons and Grant Brogden is not a winner  keep an eye on this one he might have gotten dropped because all three of those guys were healthy and Brogden was basically not playing the last week  check your waiver wire  do a brief it gets a big from me eh  yeah January 8 and Moses Brown are both out so there's not really much in the way of other options  maybe is an option  but Portland's gonna have to not lose by 50 points every game if wreath is gonna get to play more than 23 minutes that's a problem right now we're in this is what I call Wizards syndrome we just need competitive  but we haven't gotten it in a while  hi miaz for Jimmy Butler although I need to add a name actually in real time here Duncan Robinson because Tyler hero is back out again with a shoulder issue so put d-rob back on the board Tim Hardaway Jr because Luca sat out the last ball game that's of course you play Tim Hardaway if either of the Mavs Superstars sits because he gets a big use of bump Paul Reed for Joel embiid love a good stream that rhymes on Yucca okongwu for Clint capela Goga bataty who is again right at that  barely playable Mark with Wendell Carter Junior out and then Vince Williams Junior who I think is a little bit more of a speculative injury replacement for both John Moran and Marcus Smart because we saw this before he's interesting but there's really been no guarantee that he does enough on a game to game basis to be startable I just think it's worthwhile to have him on your team to see what happens  by the way cocoon man in the chat just said he subscribed and he found me through tweet storms so that basically does my promo for me  subscribe and find me on Twitter because I do tweets storms  thanks Google man happy to have you born  those are the names you guys are gonna watch me close out my Microsoft Word document and real time as well Godly don't you just love the high tech crap someone was telling me on Twitter that they really want me to start doing Graphics I'm like yeah  I really want me to start doing Graphics too but I also need like an extra two hours like my day  what does that mean I guess it means that I need the kids to be at school from like eight to five but they're not  they're not someday perhaps my older one can make it from 8 to like for 4:30 5 ish the younger one ain't making it that far especially while he's continuing to potty train by the way you guys want to know what messes up potty training really fast  on eight-day gastrointestinal drug  an eight-day gastrointestinal bug  you know what I bought yesterday  air freshener  this place stinks  that's all right I mean it  but most of you guys already know the big news I just wanted to make a stink about it because it's such a fun fun thing to have happened  the big news is  he gonna say  What's it gonna be  let me all is back for the Charlotte Hornets ladies and gentlemen lamelo is back honest to God I don't even remember the last time this dude played a basketball game  uh when was lamelo's last game  anybody  anybody  Bueller  November 26th  yeah seven weeks basically  wolf  if you drafted him in the first round your team is  probably buried right now so this wonderful news I don't know how much it helps you certainly makes your team better  but the thing that the reason I actually brought this up is because if you guys recall  on our Buy Low board two weeks ago I said this is the time Bi-Lo on lamelo ball there's been no update on him but he's been out at that point for like five weeks and right ankle sprains no matter how bad they are basically don't take longer than eight  otherwise you're getting into like tears and they would have probably had to say that I know the Hornets are terrible with their injury reporting but they've been calling it right angle spring this whole time  they switched it call it something else okay a different monster but they never changed off of that and so when we got to five weeks and there wasn't that update I was like look worst case scenario right now he's out three more weeks  worst case  and you could probably get him for a top 50 guy at that point  like you think somebody was saying no to you if you offered them Deontay Murray for lamelo ball  two weeks ago or outrun  Tyler hero before you got hurt again right now know they're taking those dudes  miles Bridges DeMar DeRozan bam out of Bio these guys probably all would have gotten it done  lamelo ball was number 31 before he got hurt  but I do think it's worth pointing out that he was coming on  also before he got hurt  he was number 20 in the five games before he went down and that was despite four and a half turnovers per game because other numbers were 29 Points 6 boards 8 assists 4.33 pointers medium volume 92% at the free throw line 1.3 steals those are first round type of numbers minus the four and a half League worst turnovers during that stretch worse than Trey Yuen you had an opportunity to get a guy who's a first rounder if you're punting turnovers over that stretch that probably won't numbers that we're going to hold the whole way through for a top 50 I  and all you had to do was be willing to take a chance that he'd be back in the next two to three weeks  and here you go  one good question in the chat there actually way more than one there's a lot of really good questions in the chat room I love that you guys are helping each other I appreciate that because you know I can't get to them but this is an interesting question someone dropped Evan Mobley  should you pick him up and hold him in your injured reserve slot or no well the problem with Mobley that we didn't have it's I think it's not really a problem I guess the sort of the issue is that we immediately got told that Mobley was out for one and a half to two months  right out of the chute  he's been out right now for about one month and a week or so  so you're looking at probably another three or four weeks  but we don't really know for sure  we know that he's not just gonna pop up and start playing any day now which wasn't the case with lamelo ball that was one of the reasons that I put him as a bylaw because I was like look we might get really lucky on this Bilo and he might just pop up and play tomorrow that's not happening with Mobley you know you're squatting on him for at least two to three weeks maybe longer but we are talking about a top 50 guy and generally the rule of thumb is you should be willing to stash at top 50 guide for up to six weeks so the short answer to the Evan Mobley should I stash him right now question  I think is probably yes because I think he's back in about one more month so all star break  if you can stash him top 40 guy for one month you definitely do it  good question  again that brings up a rule of thumb top 50 guys you stash for up to six weeks top 75 guys I wouldn't stash for more than three or four weeks call it four about a month top 90 or deeper you probably dumped them if they clear that Mark  that's kind of the stash rule of thumb  I think that's probably it actually I think that's it for today um we should have a show on Sunday  because Monday as you guys might recall is MLK day one of the absolute most fantastic NBA days of the year because there's a bazillion game and they run from first thing in the morning until your head hits the pillow in fact let's see when do they actually start on that one I think we looked this up one other time first game is at 10 a.m. Pacific time I love it you just got time to like get the day going rub the sleep out of your eyes and then it's party time it's an 11 game day so it's like Christmas doubled basically with the same general idea you got the morning game hour and a half later your midday crop of four game starts  two and a half hours after that you got a four game chunk of early evening games then you got that one weird Mountain game in Utah and then you got The nightcap like Lakers host the Thunder I'm sure the Lakers are going to get bludgeoned in that ball game but whatever oh I love it I love it but of course that means there is really isn't time for us to do a Monday Morning Show to get you ready for a 10 mm lineup lock so we're gonna try to do that on Sunday it'll be later in the day on Sunday so that most of the results are in we might not have the end of that Phoenix Portland game on Sunday night but everything else should be done by about 6 6:30 Pacific time and then we'll try to get that show out that'll recap the weekend and get you situated for the coming week ahead one thing to kind of keep in mind as you guys look towards next week is that because Monday is such a heavy day it's a heavy flow day ladies and gentlemen it's a  that's a gross joke waiting to happen but it's not the only heavy flow day next week so you got MLK day which is 11 gamer you got Wednesday which is a 10 gamer so there's two days where you might get stuck with sort of an overload on roster  and maybe more importantly Tuesday is an extremely light day  and there are opportunities to front load your week the Thunder go Monday Tuesday back to back and the Sixers go Monday Tuesday back to back so that's an interesting way to look as you start a pivot into next week we'll talk about all of that and more in a Sunday evening show in the meantime please make sure to like rate
