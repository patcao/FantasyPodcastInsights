welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  all right folks  this is a get through it episode  fantasy NBA today  I am Dan Vespers and I have been  oh sicker than sick still am by all accounts but I'm upright now for the first time in about two days  it's been it's been a tough stretch and the the real I mean obviously being terribly ill  has been crummy in and of itself but today was supposed to be kind of a  and I guess it's still is it's a big announcement day on the show  and I was hoping that I have the energy to really bring the Heat and the fire but I don't I don't I don't have the energy  I think over the last two full days over the last 48 hours I've consumed a slice of bread with some SunButter on it and a bowl of chicken broth and then like copious amounts of Pedialyte it's been  it's been a tough go but the big news before we get into a little weekend 30 team review is that the sports ethos pod Network  is joining forces with the believe  pod Network  and so you'll see over the next couple of weeks our shows migrating over to the belief platform you'll probably see some logos get tossed in on things you'll see some more cross promotional stuff you could actually  as far as like how you get the podcast that shouldn't change at all should still just remain available on all the traditional podcast channels were just very excited to join forces with a  also like us relatively young Organization no Sports ethos who ball were only like six seven years old believe I think is a little bit less than that or close to the same and they have ways of helping power boost our stuff and we bring to them and array of sports teams and fantasy angles that hopefully they didn't have before and it's a symbiotic relationship so very excited about that  even if it's not as obvious as it should be in the tone of my voice because I don't really have the strength to do this the way that it deserves to be done but we are indeed very excited about that I am Dan bass this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation we have a lot to cover and I don't know when I'm going to tuck her out so let's just dive straight into it please do like rate subscribe all that good stuff and let's start talking about the games over the weekend it's my kids beat the piss out of each other in the Next Room over  um  San Antonio at Cleveland which is this is reverse chronological action we'll go through all the games that happened yes yesterday we'll go through the games that happened Saturday and we'll just get you caught up basically on all the teams most recent activity and then we'll put a pin in this one I don't believe we're gonna have a weekly preview show this week I I again I just this is no way I could do two shows today doing my best just to get through one but one of the big pieces of news over the weekend that I'm actually quite sad I was too laid out on a bathroom floor to do anything about is that Trey Jones got a spot start in one ball game for San Antonio and Malachi brand was out Brandon came back and Joan's continued to start which is something we were looking for basically all season because they're so so much better when he's running their point and finally  pop was like all right you know we've  sudo tanked hard enough here let's go make ourselves a little bit competitive and lo and behold  in the the starters we're very good in this game starters were basically like a plus 11 plus 12 for the Spurs in the game they lost by two so then don't worry the other guys can come in and muck it up at some point  but this feels like something that if the Spurs actually want to be competitive and they want to sort of get the best version of Devin vassell and victoriam and that starting five Trey Jones is someone that could stick possibly the rest of this the season although San Antonio changes their lineups every four games so don't get too excited but he's a must add play right now and he's probably the biggest piece of news  from like a non-injury replacement standpoint  from the last two to three days of basketball so it's nice that we get to knock that out right from the outset  keldon Johnson as expected has mostly fallen off he still scoring but he's kind of turned back into last year's version of Kelvin Johnson which is outside the top one ten he does what he does for your team and you're okay with that that's fine  Devin vassell has been markedly better of late I know I say sell guys on the Spurs whenever they have good ball games but for sale again I with him with a point guard alongside of him I have much greater Trust  I don't know that he  yeah I mean I guess what he's doing is relatively repeatable now that Kelvin Johnson's on the bench so  I'm gonna take the cell High moniker off of a cell because I like how he fits in these lineups better than how he fit in the other ones  Jared Allen is into the 40s in per game right on the year he's come on we caught out of always knew that was gonna be the case so that's good Carousel vert good feeling in for Darius Garland Max Drew's that was hoping he was having a few games in a row where he shot the ball better he's just he's slumping man I thought you know you figure that one game was going to be the one to get him cooking  and it didn't really but luckily he's getting bored he's getting assists he's getting defensive stats there's no reason to move on he's number 93 and 9 cat on the season everybody has slumps it'll be okay Portland at Brooklyn uh do up wreath played 41 minutes  this hasn't been a consistent thing for him  while filling in for DeAndre Aiden who you know I don't really know when he's gonna come back but Reed Smith it's been all over the map  32 missed three games and injury 6 27/41  it really depends a lot on how he's playing on any given night I anyway that looks at this one ball game and it's like oh he's a sure bet to be great in the next one no I mean no that's no that's not how it works I think he probably qualifies as someone you could use as a fill-in see what happens but don't expect it to be this good and this is an overtime game on top of everything else  Jeremy Grant Anthony Simons Hayden sharp 40 minutes off the bench but when all of those guys and Scoot Henderson when all those guys are healthy Malcolm Brogden slides back in store that veteran leader role  you gotta figure Portland's gonna play Brogden less leading up to the trade deadline which I believe is a month away right now and they're going to want to try to get something for him and that'll be easier if he's healthy so expect Malcolm Brogden to continue to Trend down with the Blazers getting healthy Henderson is going to very slowly continue to kind of figure things out and you guys know my feelings on the rest of the dudes on that team so I don't think we need to go over those all around again  Mikhail Bridges had 42 playing the Blazers doesn't hurt but he was also one of the easiest by low guys in the history of time it'll probably have a few more good ball games as well dayron Sharpe got hurt that means it's just gonna be more Nic Claxton you'll see a little bit more Dorian Finney Smith as well and minutes open up at the big man's spots Phoenix is not an ad cam Johnson continues to be okay Dennis Smith Jr is also worth mentioning he's played really well for Brooklyn over the last two or three ball games fouled out of this one in 29 minutes  don't be too surprised if you see them run small and more Dennis Smith Jr because he's been facilitating well  he didn't Rebound in this ball game but he's pretty good rebounding guard steals gets those  I don't think that he's  what you'd call sort of like a must add but I think from a speculative standpoint I'm good with picking up Dennis Smith Jr just kind of see how it goes and I make a mental note to myself because I didn't really do anything for my fantasy teams lying on the bathroom floor I got my phone in my hand I'm just like okay let's make sure that all the superstars are in and then went back to napping on the floor New Orleans blew out Sacramento I don't think you have to read too much into this ball game one thing I will say is that CJ McCollum is still number 21 he's sticking it right in my face with his three and a half threes 2.1 defensive stats and just really good stuff all the way around and he's  he's steering that ship and pills are pretty good when he's around  and then not surprisingly here well Zion was out for this ball game and then the blowout minutes screwed everything up but herb Jones we've seen he just  went dream Murphy is around it's almost like he just doesn't do the stuff that he knows how to do  I can't figure anyway again move on from this ball game this game was over very early let's go to Atlanta or Orlando  did you guys go Garrison Mathews on the hawk side I didn't know Garrison Mathews on the Hawks anyway he got hurt in this ball game nothing else changes on the Atlantis side not at least until DeAndre Hunter comes back  or Lando  Caleb Houston filling in for France Wagner had 25 points and 73 pointers I mean for 14 from downtown in this ball game you simply can't expect that to happen on a day-to-day basis uh no Wendell Carter Junior in this one so but today and mo Wagner got bigger minutes like all that time when  when Wendell was out before that usually meant that Go-Go was playable but  we'll see if it's longer than a very short term thing Jalen Suggs still good no problem there call Anthony  had plenty to do but it didn't do a whole lot with it Gary Harris out and with Franz Wagner out you got to assume that Cole Anthony should have enough to do but then Mark how folks also came back played 15  uninspiring minutes but they'll work him back in slowly here two boards four assists one steal I'm not in the you need to stash faults group of people I I don't I don't know that he gets inside the top 100  specially with I mean unless Orlando kind of thins the ranks a little bit and injury is done a tiny bit of that but I also don't think they're gonna push folks coming off of an injury that cost him what like eight weeks and played forever  I don't think you need to stash Fall's  in traditional nine cat  I think he's gonna take a while to get him ramped up and even once he is I don't know that he he breaks the 100 mark Dallas beat Minnesota Kyrie Irving who apparently while he was hurt decided he was going to get a little bit more aggressive I like that he's number 13 now per game after a couple of big ones the steals the blocks those were the things we were always looking at he's always been a good steals blocks guard super efficient has always been his calling card and you're starting to see that stuff happen  still no Dante Exum Derek Jones junior did enough in this ball game he had a pretty good line  no Derek Lively again and I said on a preview show I get it it's very hard to hold hold if you can on lively but I also understand if you can't  do I Powell's not an ad Josh Green you kind of semi watch list but I just feels like they're really only missing like one  well Lively they're really only missing one Wing type right now and that's exam  when he comes back  does he start for Josh Green maybe is there enough when Luca and Kyrie are both healthy  teetering slightly towards know  but if you have those guys you might as well just kind of ride it out and if you don't then I don't know that I would race out there and try to do something with it  um  let's keep moving Memphis beat Phoenix behind a 19 and 9 Off the Bench from Vince Williams go figure no jaw in this ballgame Marcus Smart has had two good ones in a row  I  what did I say last time I remain not fully convinced  that  that's smart is going to be in the top 100 he's had these two giant games against the Lakers and then the Suns  but when Josh healthy I know he was for the Laker game but when John is right we saw smart really wasn't doing all that much  and you know guys can get hot they can hit what did he  hit like 12 3 pointers and his last two ball games I think you're going to see him get some steals for sure handful of assists here and there  it's all about where the dust settles on Marcus Smart and I  if I had to guess I probably put him  he kind of just outside the top 100 which is probably roster stable and most formats  you know as you two good ball games he bounces inside two or three bad ball games he bounces back out of it you're not gonna be able to figure out what day those are gonna be obviously you play them  against the games cap when one of the other main guys is out like if Bane missed a game or if John misses another ballgame when everybody's healthy though call it a 50/50 play  this is the power of recency bias I know you guys are gonna yell at me like how can you say that after guys coming off these two Mega Knights well because two games do not a seasoned make  Phoenix lost despite having their big three together Bradley Beal was not very good Booker and Durant were decent  in blow the roof off the building or anything  and I think you can hold on to Grayson Allen said that before I think he's I think he fits just fine as the other guy in this group he's gonna hit some three he's got some defensive stats prototypical 3D  cool cool  not so cool did Detroit lost Cade Cunningham early in their loss in Denver and an e strain feels like it's not a one game kind of thing well we don't really know from this one is who picks up the pieces because Killian Hayes probably played a little bit more than he would have Alec Burks has been scoring a lot lately but he's more in the kind of stream while warm Department you might see a little more Jaden ivy on Ball but we saw last year that's actually maybe not a great thing in nine cat formats so there's really nobody I'm racing out to pick up on the Pistons in the wake of this Cunningham news um I think you can take a wait-and-see approach roll from there  funny little footnote on this game Nicola yokich this looked like one of those games was like I wonder if I can win this game without taking a shot he took three shots had 16 assists and five blocks just basically messing with the Pistons and  sure enough they beat him  Toronto when did the Golden State and just spanked the Warriors RJ Barrett  is not an ad I don't care how good he looks for one ball game the guy that I was watching at Toronto was Gary Trent Jr to see if he could continue to have a role and I don't know actually still the answer because this one was technically a blowout RJ Barrow was kind of the only guy who got normal starters minutes  I don't I don't think you need to roster Gary Trent Jr while we wait and find out but I think you should keep a close watch on him specially with all the Pascal come trade stuff floating around because if somebody comes back and Trent is ahead of said person coming back and the pecking order and does he get to start does he get enough shots at that point  so it's a little bit of a stash it's a little bit of another  and  yeah that's the Gary TransUnion story Scotty Barnes finally had a bad ball game he was due it's okay he's not the only one  uh what else we got from this ball game trayce Jackson Davis on the Warriors He's a start when he's starting we also got word that Draymond Green is ramping up to a return I think that news broke over the weekend and then a little story today surface that Draymond was considering retiring instead of like  not  not hitting people in the sack or choking people out which feels a little silly like come on dream on you're an adult just get a hold of yourself  but anyway he'll be back in the not too distant future  and  that's gonna upset a few little apple carts like what does it mean for Jonathan comingo who I don't think is a Road Old playable guy anyway  is it going to mess up trayce Jackson Davis probably he's a start while he's starting though Moses Moody was better in this ball game but hasn't done a whole lot lately and then Steph when Steph has a bad ball game The Warriors are just gonna lose  Brandon pajam ski is I think running out of gas  eight boards for says he's always gonna do that hustle stuff but  rookies don't really know how to budget  their Seasons worth of energy I think you and that's like what ends up being known as the rookie wall but it's just that they don't sort of know how to handle the full season they gotta go a little bit softer but he wasn't and to his credit  you know he's put up great lines  but I do think that he's getting a little tired and I think you're starting to see it in the production the field goal percent is still okay but defensive stats are a little lower rebounds a little lower assist a little lower scoring a little lower everything's just tapering a tiny bit  he's a hold because Chris Paul broke a wrist over the weekend and he's out for four to six weeks but don't be too floored if the Warriors have to kind of mix and match give me a little time to kind of regain his wind over an upcoming game or two don't freak out about that but also don't be surprised if you see it happen  Lakers finally guarded somebody Clippers were weird in this ball game this was this was fun for me because I was able to have a TV close enough that I could watch Lakers Clippers while still again laid out on a bathroom floor  if you bots was awesome and he often does this to the Lakers because they like hers are much more keyed in on the the Clippers wings and Zoo just destroys and Lakers don't know how to keep anybody off the offensive glass anyway because Anthony Davis is constantly protecting other dudes who played poor defense  but like it was actually defended okay Clippers will be fine if you're looking at these lines like well I wanted what happened here like why did most of the Clippers shoot terribly kind of an off night mixed with just like Better Effort from the Lakers defensively  D Lowe played 31 minutes this is why I said to hold because ultimately he's just better than the whack dudes that they've been playing looking at you Cam reddish  I don't know why Max Christy only got 13 minutes and yesterday's game he was one of the best defenders and floor spacers the Lakers had  I almost feel like Darvin ham got lucky that his rotations didn't lose this game but from a an actual fantasy standpoint ad and LeBron or obviously a go you know you're not punting on Austin Reeves this is a bad matchup for him your holding on delowe Christian Woodsman playing better lately but I don't think his minutes are ever going to get high enough to matter and then Tori and Prince is your kind of three-point streamer type  and we'll see what that means when rui comes back because you might see how much more step in there and take the reddish and take some of the Christian Woodman's and take some of the Taurean Prince minutes like there's remain a little bit influx  all right let's go back to Saturday we knocked out what how many games were there nine games on Sunday so we're a little more than halfway through the league which is good because I don't think I have the energy to do more in about 30 35 minutes on this podcast Boston beat Indiana on the road number of players are resting for the Celtics coming up so you can get a little Al Horford stream going on  that's really the only thing that happens with the Celtics on a day-to-day basis for Indiana  Aaron Nesmith for more defensive stats he's a strong hold even if he didn't score very much in this ball game buddy hield got the start because there was some dudes out on the Indiana side and if he'll start starting he's a start that's kind of the way it's been so far this year if he's not he's not  easy peasy right let's keep moving  Nick's beat the Wizards 121 105 of the Wizards did a nice job to get this lightly competitive in the fourth quarter so that you know the Knicks got their Tibbs minutes  that's good for The Usual Suspects  the Donte divincenzo versus Josh Hart  thing is probably going to keep both of them from having top 100 value oh well  oh man how good Isaiah hartenstein been so good  as far as the Wizards go Deni avdija is back on his heater train again this is like how he started the season so play him while he's warm  man it's just again tougher Ball Game Wizards have been blown out two or three times in a row Jordan Poole I just I don't know that he's ever gonna wake up this year  but you know hold don't make any adjustments again you just  anything we do with the wizard test to be based on what happens in a competitive ball game and at this point nothing's really changing their at least not yet  Utah beat the embed lists 76ers on the road Utah's weird rotations are  producing a couple of wins here and there  I mentioned that I wasn't convinced to on fontecchio and then this game happened and I felt less foolish about putting that type of call out there  I don't know what the hell is going on with Walker Kessler  Utah went very small in this ball game and it worked  Colin Sexton is a firm hold long as he continues to start Kessler's a hold obviously minutes are weirdly inject John Collins had a better ball game here but he'd been trending down pretty consistently  um and then it looks like maybe Kelly Olynyk is back on the outside looking in  problem with the team like Utah is I'd love to be able to come on a show and just say yes this guy this guy this guy not that guy not that guy you does not that cut and dry  obviously Larry marketing is a start and Kessler's a start because he can do it and you know 2022 minutes of ballgame and Sexton is a start right now and then everybody else is a coin flip  you know me I'm working against the game's cap a coin flip is a no  had to head whatever  uh basketball b-ball Paul at 16 and 6 in start for me that was fine wanted some defensive stats didn't get him Kelly who brings been a really nice feeling for the Anthony Melton so you can keep streaming there  Marcus Morris had a better ball game but you're not no you're not no don't do that  keep going  and I know that I think everybody wanted more from Reed but  yeah you gonna have to just settle with what you got  Houston got a nice win over Milwaukee Rockets kind of needed a Few Good Vibes and for the bucks Giannis tried to do it himself  Dame has another little buy window open right now he had that heater got him up to like number 13 14 now he's fallen back a few slots if you can get Dame and then Malik Beasley as we talked about his little more than a three-point streamer and nothing else really matters for the bucks as far as the Rockets go  they could use some depth  they could use some depth  but I don't think it's fall out of the sky they started  I thought they started Jeff Green I guess he came off the bench and just played a ton of minutes either way Jeff Green got a bunch of playing time if you're looking at like a points League dropping kind of guy but really we just want tari Eason to come back and play because he's so much fun and fantasy and  he hasn't played in a little bit and that makes me sad  and now we go back to Friday and look at the teams that didn't play over the weekend and those teams are let's see what do we got here I think we've covered 26 out of the 30 teams  so we need to talk about Oklahoma City nothing changes there so keep moving Charlotte and Chicago that's when we got to talk about we haven't discussed those two teams Charlotte just ruled Mark Williams out for at least another week so they did finally give up on the whole doubtful every game tag I still think lamelo ball is getting close to coming back  this is your loan opportunity to buy low on him because as soon as news breaks that he's not far away then whoever's been holding in this whole time it's gonna wait and hold him  meantime the whole team is dead at this point PJ Washington left this ball game he joins lamelo ball Mark Williams Gordon Hayward I don't know PJ is technically part of their original starting five but basically four of their top six rotation players are out right now Terry Rozier and Miles bridges of the last ones left Brandon Miller sort of a last one left as well Cody Martin also left this ball game early with the groin strain I mean there's there's legitimately nobody left  Nick Richards you can use as a fill in I don't know how Charlotte's going to keep games close right now Rosie and Miles bridges are going to have to take about 25 shots of peace  you might see someone else step up and play 30 minutes mostly because they have no choice but I would wait and find out who that is before I picked him up  Zach LaVine came back and now he's right back to being questionable again this time it's foot inflammation shoulder soreness whoo this feels like he's about to get traded I mean  come on like was the last game was this just a showcase oh yeah Zack's fine he came back and now he's out again  as far as the bullet goes Bulls go that's good news for Kobe white who is always gonna be better when Levine is not playing 40 minutes of ball game Alex Caruso missed their last one as did Patrick Williams that means I owe to Sumo was a good fill-in  and Andre Drummond's time is limited as Nicola is back and he'll be ramping up here slowly  so get ready to make some adjustments to your bowls if Caruso's healthy you play him  if Levine is back out and Caruso's in but Patrick Williams is out you could probably play ayo  but you kind of can't make any decisions on the Bulls until you get the Health Report right before the ball game starts which we don't have right now  who else are we missing Miami and  is that it is through this up is it just Miami  like I'm missing somebody but who is it  I don't know anyway for Miami you're just you're streaming I met as Junior as long as Jimmy Butler is out Kevin Love is weirdly streamable these days some of it has to do with Caleb Martin and Haywood Highsmith being down but he's been putting up decent enough numbers and that's probably where we're gonna leave things  all right I know that this was a tough one I barely made it through it's a shorter show today we are again extremely excited to be joining the belief network of PODS thank you to those that were here live I know that this is not the best show we've ever done but you know what sometimes you just gotta get through one and I have more strength by tomorrow I will say that I'm starting to feel a tiny bit hungry which is a good sign  who man it has been  it's been a rough one out here in best Forest Town find me over on Twitter at Dan Bass Pros this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation I'm sure there were other things I was supposed to promote but I don't remember what they are because I'm loopy is heck oh right manscaped ethos 20 20% off and free shipping  whoo boy all right well we'll be back tomorrow I'm gonna hopefully we can go to show Tuesday and want to get a new Buy Low show going I've got all these ideas of shows that I haven't either had this strength or time to do and I also don't want to say what they are  but they will be very fun if I could ever find the time to pull them off okay see you guys on social it's easier for me to type a tweet it is for me to do a pod right this second but I do appreciate you guys tune in and we'll see you again tomorrow so long now
