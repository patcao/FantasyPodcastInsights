welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right folks I think we can keep this one on the brief side as well  early show broken promise  with Dan best price it's broken promises changing the title of today's show today's forget the show we're changing the title of the whole damn experience  this is no longer fantasy NBA today  is it a sports presentation well we'll see if they want it this is your episode of  broken promises with Dan best price  today's broken promise  that I'm going to keep this show extremely brief every day I say it and every day I try to do it every day I  fail miserably  anywho we're gonna do our best I'm at Dan best person on Twitter let's talk streaming  Friends confidants it's Tuesday  in a weird week  most of you I think that are watching these streaming shows are kind of like at least semi up-to-date and how things have been going and this is a week where the overarching theme is Friday you have 12 games Sunday you have 13 so most likely unless you've already taken various precautions your Friday and your Sunday are probably full  which meant that this week needed to be an exercise in front loading  because there really aren't that many ways to backload the week  no matter how you slice it in those last three days if you tried to back load it somebody playing two games is gonna fall at least on one of those two days  and those final three  so the front four is the way to go  and we talked yesterday about how the Atlanta Hawks have the best schedule in the first four days because they go three times in four but one of those is now done so the Hawks much like many other teams in the NBA have two games over the next three days which no longer makes them an advantage of scheduling spot just from a strict number of game standpoint  the reason the Hawks continue to actually have one of the better schedules is that all three of their days fall on non overload days  there is only one team with a truly awful schedule right now it's the Chicago Bulls they're off for three days in a row all the other teams that started the week with the bad schedule play tonight so there's really no reason to make a move off of those guys those teams the San Antonio Spurs and the Utah Jazz who have two games off starting tomorrow or two days off I guess we should say so if you wanted to make any move on those guys that would be the time to do it there's no reason to preempt it by making the move now  the  the most likely scenario that you're looking at here Atlanta obviously there are the advantages of having Wednesday Thursday Saturday because you don't have to worry about benching anyone as a result of the Atlanta Hawks but they're not the only team where you can look at and say oh you know I'm probably getting three weeks the rest three games the rest of the way because when you think about it from another standpoint the team that you're dropping the player on you're probably going to pick somebody up that replaces said player  so think about Chicago for instance not only do they have three days off but they play on Friday and Sunday the days that you're probably full Friday about 10 guys on your team should be going 10.4 was the number we came up with and Sunday you go probably have 11 11.2 was the average number of active players on a Yahoo roster 11.2 out of 13 based on how many games are playing in the NBA again we're just running very simple averages and your team will be and some part of a bell curve on either side of those that 10 and that 11 that I just mentioned so when you think of the nas standpoint dropping a Chicago Bull today and yeah you can think this through you're probably not dropping DeMar DeRozan he's been too good you're probably not dropping vooch he's been too good  I  I hate to think that you'd have to drop Alex Caruso because he's actually been that good this year Caruso's number 50 guys per game this year  number 50  he's actually one slot behind vooch and if you like oh what is it turn overseas not really much is it 1.6 Caruso's at one point four Caruso's just been that freaking good at three Steals and blocks all season long that's how he's done it  hyper leading steals great and blocks for a guard two three-pointers a game and then obviously not turning the ball over and  it's kind of amazing when you think about the impact that those categories can have  but what about  the guys that are a little bit farther down the list and nobody wants to think of it this way but Kobe white is farther down the list he's number one oh four over the last month yeah he's scoring 19 points but he's killing you from the field 42 and a half percent he doesn't get defensive stats it's point it's threes are okay free throws are okay but then there's too many negatives in there and then what about Iota sumu who we've been relying on to get it done with percentages has it been enough and the answer is generally yes he's number 67 over the last month  so the Bulls are kind of a hard one when you're like oh yeah this is the team I should be dropping from but which of these five guys can I drop  the honest goodness answer is maybe none but by nine cat rankings Kobe white has been the weakest link in that bunch  because of the nine category flaws  most notably that he's a very high volume low feel goal percent guys that he basically a punt feel but if your team is punting fuel goal then you know he leaps 340 slots and then that's again another guy you can't drop  so dropping someone right now is kind of hard I get it if you have all four of your weekly moves you can get a little bit more aggressive if you don't you dial it back a tiny bit the one thing that you absolutely positively cannot let happen is taking a zero  that's the big one  so someone like a Gary Trent for instance who just got ruled out maybe he plays in the back-to-back Toronto's got another game tomorrow he's not playing today  and he goes Friday Sunday  so it's a situation where  do you add one game yeah could you potentially add two if he doesn't play tomorrow yes  and that's what you need to be looking for right now  there aren't that many opportunities to do it the Bulls is one but again the players are hard to drop  Utah San Antonio the moves you should be making would be tomorrow but again adding two games at that point is going to be very very hard  outside again of presumably the Atlanta Hawks because then they go Wednesday Thursday Saturday  but if you can't get your hand on a good Hawk to stream you're kind of up a creek a little bit and you're looking at teams that do play on the overload days  and still have four games left this week  those teams there's quite a few of them by the way Cleveland plays on one of the overload days but they have three games that are on non-crazy days so today tomorrow which are borderline overloads and Saturday  Dallas has four games including two overloads Golden State and Houston each have four games including two overloads the Clippers play today and then they start a five and seven starting on Thursday so that's a good schedule going into next week in Kawhi Leonard already got ruled out for this one so that starts now Lakers have a good schedule a couple of back-to-back so they dodged the Friday overload if that could be potentially useful for you Miami they've got a back-to-back Thursday Friday but they've got four Milwaukee and Minnesota or each and Oklahoma City actually are each in the midst of a six game in nine days stretch that starts today but again they do fall on the overloads the Knicks have four games Phillies got four games but three of them are on better days Sacramento has got four Toronto's got four Washington's got four you have a ton of choices still this week of teams with four games where a lot of them fall on those overload days  if I could potentially steer you away from any of the overloads I'd like to try to do it  so those teams would be obviously at Atlanta we've talked about that they've got three games left but you're going to get to use all three Cleveland's got three games left you could probably or four games live and you can probably use three so Cavaliers is one of them you're looking for four game weeks the rest of the way four-game left this week the rest of this week where three of them are on days where you're not overloaded so Cleveland is won the Lakers is another  Philadelphia is a third  and I think that might be it  so who are the plays on those teams well Cleveland's got a few Donovan Mitchell's already been ruled out for knee injury maintenance because they've got two back-to-backs here presumably he'll be ruled out for half of the other one I would guess it will be the one against the Clippers so awesome  which is sucks by the way if you have Donovan Mitchell because this is probably going to be a game week for him but they're in a whole lot you can do about that  I don't know if Max Drew's is gonna miss one half of the back-to-backs but he's the guy that would see some bump their Carol Verde obviously gets a pretty big bumped Darius Garland's gonna play better but he's not gonna be floating around on your wire Georges niang gets a little bit of a bump more three-pointers  you're getting three games that's kind of what's important there  the Lakers is the next one really is the only one I would put in that mix he's probably out rostered already but he's not he would be a really good fit there because again you could drop him if you wanted to on Sunday and start gaming for next week or whatever but honestly you just hold it through easy peasy no problem there Lakers by the way one of the rare teams that only has three games that final week so something to kind of keep in the back of your brain as well and then Philly troubling because Joel embiid might be back on Thursday might be back on Saturday he ain't playing in the back-to-back and Tyrese Maxey could be back as soon as tonight so you're looking at a team where you're like all right who might really streaming here and the answer is  nobody it's too risky  it's too risky you can't go Paul Reed because indeed would blow that up you can't really go Kyle Lowry because he's gonna skip the back-to-back and if he misses the Saturday half then it ruins the whole plan although I would assume he skips the second half of it we just can't really know for sure they might go the other way  you can't really go campaign because he's not good enough  who Braves getting played anyway he's not on the way for wire but Tom is not going to be good enough so just didn't really an option on Philly the Lakers don't really have one because presumably hachimura is already rostered so you're looking at Cleveland today as the non Atlantis I can still get three games out of this team on non overloaded days play  Cavaliers I lean into Cavaliers probably because they have better streaming options in the Hawks  sorry Atlanta specially with Jalen Johnson back your streaming options just got thinner and thinner so the calves is one and then the other option is what if you're not fully overloaded like what if you decided you did want to drop Kobe white well maybe you have an opportunity to play someone who has a game on Friday so Chicago yeah they've got games on Friday and Sunday but you can find a team that also has games on Friday and Sunday that has two games before that  that's what makes the Bulls schedule so obscene is that now you're doing a math problem okay what is Kobe white going to get me over his two games the rest of this week provided I actually get to play him in those two games okay well you know we can go by what he's done over the last month that's probably the best way to do the math there that would be about 38 points 8 boards 10 assists five and a half to six three pointers one steal on bad field goal percent pretty good free throw  so then the question you start to ask yourself is can I get that out of somebody playing four games the rest of the way and kind I potentially get a little bit above that out of somebody playing four games and I think the answer is a pretty resounding yes  38 points ain't that hard to get out of a four game or when you have as many options as we just like a dozen teams left  a lot of guys on the wire can give you nine and a half points when you're not picking from the you know the 9th and 10th players on the New Orleans Pelicans so really give it some serious thought that a team where you can add two extra games played and then the other little footnote on this before we wrap up the show that I said was going to be short and I can still do it I believe in myself the other footnote is if you drop say Kobe white let's use him as the example here who slots in to take his spot on Friday and Sunday maybe on Friday it's the guy you pick up but maybe on Sunday you actually had an 11th best player that you can slot in that's better than the guy you pick up  so maybe you're only seeing the Kobe 2 replacement drop off on Friday and on Sunday you're seeing a Kobe 2 slightly better than replacement drop off  but Chicago's the team you really got to give a lot of thought to usually if you and your finals week and you don't need them for it next week Kobe white IO whatever these guys are really really really really good and you're gonna miss them on Friday and Sunday but getting four games versus two is a colossal colossal jump in Chicago is that remaining team where you can get a two game bump with out doing anything super fancy good luck tonight everyone and keep it under 15 minutes so I did it I am Dan Vespers at and best press over on Twitter good luck tonight I will talk to you guys again tomorrow we got a double whammy coming up Wednesday Thursday and Friday and then we're done with the two first two days end after Friday try to maybe do some streaming stuff over the weekend because a lot of leagues are wrapping up but next week we'll go to one show a day and following week we go into offseason one show a day holy smokes I can't believe it see you soon
