welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  hey everybody sorry about the slight delay their Windows update got the best of my machine there is I guess a big  some sort of install last night and it messed up all my audio settings which I choose not to use Windows defaults and then it updates drivers and the new Windows audio driver condenses audio it's just it's terrible and this is happening for years now I  drives me up the wall but at least I now basically know how to fix it so it only took what was that 10 minutes instead of back when it first started and I was hunting everywhere and it took me like 45 minutes to figure out what was going on  anyway we're back on track welcome to Fantasy NBA today it's your week in review edition of the show we will have all the stories of the last week and there are many they are plentiful well we'll have the ads  we'll have the drops we'll have the holes we'll have to watch list guys we'll have the buys we'll have the cells have the injury replacement board and will finish her off with a 30 team look ahead at the weekend coming up which again will largely parallel the things we talked about as kind of the stories of the week so we'll lightning round our way through that but at least give us things to kind of watch out for as The Weeknd develops one of the moves we might make for or against add drop that kind of stuff  quickly before we get started we want to see if everybody had a chance to check out my night in 90 segment I've tried the last two evening's those are all available on the YouTube page of all posted them on Twitter it's a challenge for me to talk as fast as humanly possible and see if I can jam it all the biggest stories of the night super quick my thought process on this was  I can't stay up late to do a show at like 11:00 at night Pacific time  I can't kids are asleep it would wake him up if I was yelling this loud and they're one room over anyway but what I could do was just get a cell phone right up in my face and do a 90 second quick hit video so check those out there on the YouTube page subscribe to that while you're there make sure to like anything that you see  obviously subscribe if you're listening on the traditional pod channels I would love your feedback on those things it's kind of a new project and sort of see how it goes all so you guys know I've been kind of making this this very conscious push to try to get as many of you as possible into our Sports ethos Discord and I don't want to go down the Deep rabbit hole on why the short version is that Twitter just gets sort of harder to use every four months and it's persisting but we want to make sure that there's a place you guys can hang out if anything happens to Twitter a place where we can get you all the information from Sports ethos I can tell you when pods are coming out things all like that  there's a link on your screen it's also in the show description so come hang out with us over there let's get into the mix now you guys have waited long enough here is your week in review it's week six in the association already can you guys believe that we're six weeks in Seasons almost a quarter done like a 25 26 weeks season  so we're we're pretty close I think once you get through next week we'll actually be passed the quarter Mark for whatever that's worth but I also don't want this to make you guys panic because the other flip of that is we still have three quarters more actually of the Season left so you don't have to freak out most of what we talked about on these we can review shows has a rest of season bent to it so let's just keep plugging along I hope your Rodeo teams are doing as well as mine are I have five Rodeo's four of them a redraft and in those four legs my three of them are first place in one is second so if you guys have followed the Dan best purse Rodeo method here you too should have a pretty darn good team in right now I hope who are the ads of the week let's get in we'll break them all down to those that are watching live and hanging out in the chat room you're probably going to be helping each other today I don't think there's going to be time to do questions these we can review shows do tend to take about an hour and that's about as much as the old screaming can handle before I gotta step away for a minute so chat room  that's a friend's helping friends type of deal today  let's talk about some ads  these are in no particular order this is as I work my way backwards through the week so that's the order I guess not in order of priority for any stretch but let's just go through them Killian Hayes is the first name on the list he moved into the Pistons starting lineup in yesterday's ballgame and with the very obvious caveat that Detroit's lineup is far from locked in and hey he's his definitely not going to shoot 77% every ball game he does have a fantasy stat profile that can translate I'm not gonna say it will if given the requisite number of minutes so far this year is right around top one 50 in about 26 minutes per ball game largely because he is a good steals Guy a decent assists guy and that's a pretty good back to sort of ride to Fantasy value and then yesterday he actually hit a few shots but that's not what your banking on with him if he slides into there in the starting lineup and he starts getting about 30 minutes of ball game I think you can probably expect him to post something in the neighborhood of I guess not all that far off from what he did last year which was like 10 points but he shot 38% so that's gonna have to be a number that works its way up he can't shoot 38% again but if he gets into the 40s that's a big deal and if he gets into the 40s the 10 points would become 11 he was at six assists last year he was at about one and a half steals last season that would actually be enough if the field goal percent does sort of Wiggle its way up into the low 40s so I'm willing to take a grab on MC if Detroit gives this thing a few weeks to see if it sticks if it doesn't we move on you may see Jaden Ivy coming up later on in a drop column  shouldn't be a surprise  that's the story on Killian Hayes nothing is guaranteed  Josh Hart is sort of a maybe add you guys know if you've been watching the show or listening to this show Daily you guys know every time I try to quit Josh Hart  he gets 30 minutes for a couple ball game in a row overall this year he has not gotten 30 minutes and he's basically a lot like Gillian Hayes he's round 150 in about 28 minutes per ballgame instead of 26 but historically when heart gets 30 he gets inside the top 100 it steals will probably be a little bit higher as the season progresses and sort of everything you know Works itself out field goal free throw percent could work their way up it's not a guarantee but I would expect it to kind of trend that way and if you look at what he did with New York last year he was playing way over his head he shot 59% with the Nyx that's just not a number that he's gonna replicate lately he's been closer to 50 overall which is still good lately he's also generally been into the high 70s and said of the low 70s at the free throw line and so that's kind of what we're riding on here can he get to 30 minutes of ball game the answer is I have no idea  because it keeps bouncing back and forth he's an amazing rebounding guard which is a great thing to get out of an adaptation deal but also you know he complained about his minutes and then suddenly he got the average 31 minutes over his last two ballgames  is that something that's gonna stick or was it you know guy complained he's gonna get a couple game bounce and then he falls back off so if you have dead weight to cut I think you could add Josh Hart if you're looking at some guy who was like pretty interesting then you probably stick with guy who was pretty interesting I put Malik Beasley on this board and frankly he should have been there a little while a little ways back because he's just been running hot he's shooting 48% from the field this year that's a number that I simply still don't believe is going to hold but this is again this is growth this is Dan Vesper showing growth  just because he's shooting 48% right now doesn't mean it can't last for another week or two  looking at his last two or three seasons he's been under 40% and for his career he's at 42 although he did have you know a two weeks stretch in Minnesota and if you go all the way back to Denver like five six years ago where he did shoot in the mid-to-high 40s for this long or a little longer so anything's possible  you shouldn't 44% from downtown that probably comes down 67% of the free throw line that probably goes up the big key for him right now is that he's getting basically starter's minutes some of that because Jay Crowder is out some of its because he's been a good floor space for them however you want to ride this thing out he's been running warm and so that you know new improved and we're says hey if a guy's running hot just play them  it's okay even if we know that the wheels are gonna come off it's okay to just play them until they do Kobe white is a stash play we've talked about this one a thousand times now but it's worth mentioning again he doesn't have the fantasy profile to support starter ship when the team is healthy  but when the team isn't and now we have news today that Zach LaVine is going to be rested for quote unquote a week due to his quote unquote sore foot Kobe white is very much an added a stash  and I don't even know that he's gonna be good enough to play with only Levine gone it's sort of if he he's been good lately because he's shooting 92% at the free throw line and he's scoring 20 points of ball game with four three-pointers over his last four five ball games  you know that's not a thing that sticks even when guys are hurt but it's the uptick in usage that's what your banking on here because he doesn't get steals or blocks he doesn't rebound very much you're banking on points threes free throw percent and hopefully more assists as guys start to  get shut down get moved whatever the Bulls detonation is underway already  so we need to be we need to make sure we're on top of that and Kobe white is I mean he's the most obvious stash in the NBA right now he's pretty heavily rostered because everybody knows what's going down but make sure he's rostered in your league  and don't worry we'll talk about a couple other Bulls a little bit later on  Andrew Wiggins and Kelly oubre Jr are both in my ad if dropped discussion would have been dropped because of injury Wiggins would have been dropped because he put together one of the worst starts of a season that I can remember from any established NBA player  but after before slamming his door in the finger of his car which is just like  this is like what a kid does they're learning you don't put your finger near the hinge of the car door or where close is on the opposite side regardless it happened or at least that's what they said happened he had his best game of the season right before that he was aggressive I know you could say that the game like two and a half weeks ago and against the Thunder was maybe better statistically speaking  but I didn't see better effort in any game besides this last one he played in their loss in Sacramento he had 10 rebounds that was a season High that's just a sign that he was more engaged he was having fun he was aggressive he was doing the things that Wiggins of old could do he got dropped in the bunch of leaks because he was outside the top 300 prior to that ball game which again like yeah you can't hold a guy like that so I don't blame teams for dropping him but if this is a sign that he's waking up  you got to get him that's basically as far as it goes like if he's waking up and this starts to level off you need to make sure you have them there and then same story for Kelly oubre who I don't know that we ever got the actual final story of what happened with him he said he was hit by a run a hit-and-run driver and then there was some stuff about riding a bicycle I like who knows either way sounds like he's coming back  sorry as soon as tonight possibly but very soon and he was great before he went down he was scoring 16 points on good shooting he was getting open looks around him beating Tyrese Maxey yeah there's a chance his numbers slow a little bit but you got to make sure that he's on a roster because he got dropped in a bunch of spots when he was hurt especially when folks thought he was gonna be out for a really long time  Cole Anthony who also kind of falls into the not quite as long as Malik Beasley but guy who's running crazy hot right now just needs to be rostered  I don't think that the Run he's on lasts for that much longer um because it never has and it's not like he's just magically gonna become a superstar overnight but he's putting up Superstar numbers over the last week and a half and you got to play him when that's happening  if you go back to November 21st which is about a week and a half ago almost exactly at 15 points in tennis  he had a couple of decent ball games before that but there wasn't the like oh my goodness game until he had the double double then he went for 20 the next night 163 and 6 with 3 defensive stats the game after that 37 and 7 in their win over Charlotte 256 and 5 with two blocks in their win over Washington yeah I mean the opponent certainly help but the magic of 18 games in a row at Anthony has been pretty darn warm for about seven of them so just roll with it if markelle fultz ever shows his face that could put a dent into it if coal gets cold that could put a dent into it  but who cares right now he's hot  play it  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last-second drink run and end up missing the game-winning touchdown

watching the list and make sure that Derek Lively is on rosters he's fully rostered in all of my League's but he still listed as only 44% rostered overall and he very much needs to be because his minutes have been trending up as Jason kidding Mavs have decided that they're very old contingent of backup center just isn't as fun of an option or good frankly and for lively he's right on the cusp he's like just outside the top 100 and 24 minutes of all game so 25 one minute literally all you need to get him inside the top 100 from their 26 gravy forgets up as high as 27 now you're really cooking with gas and I do think that as the season progresses and he kind of continues to learn the NBA pace  that number might continue to increase  so just make sure he's on a roster and then we've got two injury return stash guys whose news they're all of it was breaking yesterday who break coming back boy and Bugattis coming back probably tomorrow Trey Murphy coming back for the pals as soon as tonight  I got a lot of questions after these news broke yesterday of who I prefer between boy and bug zdanowicz and Trey Murphy  and I had to stop and I had to stop and I had to think about it for a really long time because I don't think it's it's  a simple answer  the complicated answer paired down as best I can is  I think the Pistons need bogdanovich more than the Pelicans need Trey Murphy I think Trey Murphy  is currently the better player between the two  but I don't know that that matters  because if you look at last year  and don't look at the very end because the pills were resting a bunch of guys he was taking 15 16 shots a game in those ball games if you look at last year he was getting 10 shots of game over the entire season  extraordinarily efficient 48% from the field 41 from 390 at the free throw line he was damn close to a 5490 guy and so that got him to 14 and a half points a steal and change half a block not many rebounds or assist but he did it with a fishy  but he was also getting 31 minutes a game last year  which largely came when either Brandon Ingram CJ McCollum or Zion Williamson was out or some combination of the two of those guys  those were when he put up his Gigantor numbers  as you might recall because I've said it on this pod a few times the Pelicans were healthy for I'm going to put them up on the screen here because I can do it on one hand  four games last season where they had all three of their main dudes and it was in like mid-november before Zion went out for almost the whole year before Brandon Ingram went down for like three months they had all their guys now it's by the way and Trey Murphy was outside the top 150 during those games but but the flip side of that is they didn't really know what they had  in Trey Murphy at that point  he hadn't shown them how good he was yet  so I think this is another spot where we kind of have to keep a few thoughts on our head at the same time thought number one is he's probably not gonna have the  runway he had last year they're simply just won't be as many available shots for him  but the other thought is the pills though he's really good and so they're gonna try to find ways to get him into ball games and to get him opportunities  somehow whether that's with rotations  getting kind of clever with him maybe try not to have him out there with all three of those other guys at the same time maybe you only have him out there with two of the three High usage guys  I think they're going to try to figure out a way to make that work because they know how effective he is and how unbelievably important it is to have a decent Defender who can also be one of the best floor spacers in the NBA I mean three Indie guys we talked about three and all the time but like  really good three is usually not part of that equation usually it's like hey this Defender can shoot the three ball a little bit  Trey Murphy's more like hey this guy can defend a little bit damn he can really shoot  laser beam  so I think Trey Murphy will be  useful I think there's a pretty darn good chance he's a 12 team her  I just feel like boy and bogdanovich and these both of these guys are gonna need to ramp up a little bit so don't expect much in the next you know one or two games from them but once they get their legs underneath them a week week and a half whatever it takes  I think boy and Bug zdanowicz likely scores a whole hell of a lot more than Trey Murphy does both of them are actually pretty efficient when it comes to the field goal free throw thing bogdanovich actually much better at getting to the line he was four and a half for five from the free throw line last year that's almost 90%  he also shot 49% from the field and hit over two three pointers a game the difference is that you got an extra half steal a game at a train Murphy and you got an extra six seven points out of billion zdanowicz and the rest of their stuff was not all that dissimilar  the positive free throw impact was bigger for bug zdanowicz but the  steals actually pushed Trey Murphy to the higher nine cat per game ranking all the lower turnovers so I think when you when you roll all that together as I like to say on this show into one big old burrito  I think I prefer bogdanovich  just because points are gonna be harder to find on The Wire right now I'm not super worried about one extra turnover per week out of boy on and I don't know that it's even gonna be as high this year as it was last year because you know they have caged back and he'll go ahead and soak up all the turnovers I like that big free throw bump and I don't know that my teams badly need another waiver wire steals guys so I probably prefer bogdanovich I think they're both decent shots to be 12 teams but that's where I get to my answer and you guys can feel free to disagree I don't know that there's like a perfectly right answer to that that's just how my brain works through it  next on the list is our whole who this is

now that I can probably leave the window the way it is with my face bigger but all so I don't really want to be this big face let's go small Dan small Dan big words  holds Gordon Hayward become a much easier hold last night thank goodness for that because it was getting complicated to hang on to him but he put up a big ball game for Charlotte  226 and six  he's gonna just have more to do with lamelo ball out it was also helpful that Brandon Miller was out that gave him a few more things to do same with PJ Washington he's he's on the watch list board I think or did I where did I put PJ yeah I think he's on the watch list board  I don't expect Brandon Miller to be out all that long we know the Mellows out for a little bit so that's the one and that was the one that I thought surely Gordon Hayward can find some sort of opportunity here with lamelo down for this long right  right like he couldn't possibly miss out on this chance  anyway let's hang on  Spencer did we have to admit I'm a little worried that his campus gets revved up didn't have as much to do but you should hold for now  but he'll this is only this is basically he's on this board because somebody asked about it he had one game where his minutes were lower he fouled out yesterday so I'm not worried about that Anya go Congo every time he has a little LOL in his Fantasy game I gotta throw him on the holds board he obviously hasn't been as juicy lately as he was earlier but he always sits inside the top one fifteen when click capella is healthy just wait at some point this year Capella's gonna miss a few ballgames and then Hong Kong was gonna get nuts  and he's been good enough regardless Alex Caruso is on the holds board people like Kenny still holds value if he gets traded and I'm like I don't really know but these numbers 75 and 9 cat right now and he's starting for a team that just shut down Zach LaVine for quote unquote one week  so yeah Caruso has got to be on your team and then I wrote it as this way so I'll just read it this way all the Wizards messy messes the Wizards have so many messy messes hold on to all of them few of them have been good enough anyway who's must been good enough because they've been actually giving him minutes regardless of whether it's a blowout or not Daniel Gafford has been good enough because he can put up stats in short order by the way gaffords now inside the top 60  but you got a whole Jordan Poole he's a mess but you got a hold tyus Jones he's been a mess but you got a hold tyus has been a slightly smaller mess than Jordan Poole  Deni avdija I think he's what did he climb just back inside the top 100 yeah 95  he's a whole  it's a struggle man but as I said yesterday you know they're playing right now where 55% of their games have been blowouts that's crazy like that's the type of thing you expect over a week not a month and a half think it's got to get better I can't guarantee it  but I feel like I got to be there if we're when it does  here's the guys that are either drops or I'm very scared or nervous about them and I'll let you know which is which Caris LeVert he's a drop at this point and it's not doing enough with that team healthy he when guys were missing games he was sort of revving himself up and then it seemed like even once the team got healthy he continued to be at that higher aggression click now is Donovan Mitchell has gotten himself sort of resettled charis's is out he's number one seventy-five on the year in nine cat that doesn't play in any format sadly he's not good enough in any one statistical category to be like oh head-to-head you could punch so and so but you'd have to punt like four things and that's probably not a great recipe for winning  be Lauderdale  he is playing plenty of minutes and the fantasy isn't there  because he doesn't do that much besides get some steals  and his field goal percentage has been okay  for him it's gonna come down to a big usage bump that's the way that he gets himself back into the mix and I don't see that happening unless Jordan Poole and tyus Jones probably have to lose all of the back court and then at some point we might even see Dylan Wright again on that team so I don't think we need to sit on coolie I don't think we're that close to it being a thing  I said he was I think on my last show I called him kind of a you know a mid to late season stash mostly for the head to head side I don't even think we need to do that with him right now I I think that you could leave him alone and I don't think anybody's picking him up because he frankly hasn't been good lately  Jayden Ivy is also a drop he got moved to the bench he didn't play very many minutes this is an easy one as Detroit keeps switching around their line UPS if he's not playing he doesn't need to be on a roster  we have no guarantee that he sees it uptick in minutes at any point in the next I don't know how many weeks so  yeah Bobby Portis is a little bit more of a gray area he's not an obvious drop he's been kind of bad lately he does make more sense on the head to head side than Rodeo because he tends to be better at kind of the points rebounds part of this show  Road oh I think you can drop head to head I'm okay with you hanging on  provided their schedule kind of allows it Milwaukee is in the play in tournament so as far as headers go that gives you a leg up because he's playing on at least one non overload day but Roto he just hasn't been good enough to get into your lineup so assess from there  keyonte George he's he also falls in a little bit of a gray area he's been very bad from a nine cat standpoint but we're all kind of just staring at him like what if it starts to click because now you got a point guard starting for a high octane team who's trying to learn how to play at an NBA speed  you could make a decent argument to just squat on him if you're a roto team like if you don't need your 15th roster slot because you're not starting right now  and head to head not that he's been playable really over the last couple of weeks he's outside the top 200 but you know it on bad percentages at least he gets you a few points in assists  I'd be more inclined to sit on him just because again he has to point guard stat set that could emerge as the season goes  I also get it like if you need that roster spot he's a drop because he's been badly but he again Falls in a little bit more of a gray area as does the last name in this part of the board that's Santi aldama who got moved to the bench in the latest Griz board reshuffling still played 24 and a half minutes which for him can be enough for Fantasy value it's not guaranteed to be enough and you might see the Grizzlies rearrange bodies again but it also sounds like Xavier Tillman is getting close to coming back it might be tonight you got upgraded to questionable if it's not tonight it's probably the next one that's just another option the front Court that's gonna make life more difficult for aldama to actually do more than just take a bunch of shots and so that's why I think you could probably get away with kind of a pre-emptive drop their  let's do the watch list real quick scoot Henderson is on my watch list because you're just watching his sort of growth Arc but it's gonna be a bit before he gets to where you want him to be  Obi topping is on the watch list for a very different reason he's seen his minutes actually improve a little  he still you know he's outside the top one 40 in 27 minutes a game over the last two weeks everybody's looking at this one or two ball games are like oh here comes Obi someone in my Twitter mention was like what gives man like what if he's guaranteed 30 minutes but he's not nobody's guaranteed 30 minutes on that Pacers team  had to head  you again you could make a  argument for the Pacers because they're in the NBA cup quarters next year ah so like that makes more sense but there's no chance I have the stones to  play him in a roto side when his minutes could just evaporate  brutal that's brutal  I owned a suitable and Patrick Williams work themselves onto my watch list Patrick Williams was already there before last night December got on there yesterday with both DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine resting  dazuma went from basically afterthought in fantasy to full starter's minutes and I have to admit I did not see that coming  because he's averaging only 16 minute game this year and before last night that number was in the like 14's and 15s but then all of a sudden Glam although 39 minutes yesterday think that game went to overtime so would have been more like 34 and regulation but still that's full starters level and we know when he's full starters level he is very much a 12 team her but it does seem like he needs both Levine and DeRozan out to get there so can we stash him that's a big ask because a trade of one guy in Chicago feels imminent a trait of multiple guys feels like it could take a little bit longer and then Patrick Williams is the other player who is it kind of in a in a similar boat Williams at least he plays you know he's been around 23 24 minutes when the team's been healthy it went up a little bit with Levine kind of in and out of the lineup he has a quieter fantasy profile you know easier for him to get some Steals and blocks  doesn't rebound all that much doesn't score all that much but it'll get you a couple of Threes percentages or not a complete disaster  so Williams is kind of your a little bit more three indeed type of dude so he's I guess kind of the third name on that priority totem pole because he too would probably be top 100 range  if they dumped Lavigne de Rosen I just don't know how high he could go unless he suddenly was like oh by the way I'm gonna start taking 13 shots a game which  feels  sort of neither  sediment the chat rooms like where's us our Thompson don't worry guys this board is not over yet there's more to come here's the injury replacement list it's gigantic  reminder Again by the way to those that may be joining part way or zipping around please do take a second to like rate subscribe please subscribe to the YouTube page we got all sorts of good stuff by the way I came up with some new fun ideas for shows yesterday I really like I hunkered down last night and was like okay I want to do some more  we call Specialty shows on YouTube and I want to give all away um but definitely subscribe because I have some interesting ideas up my sleeve and in addition to the Bilo sell high and weakly preview shows that were doing all ready those are not that unique I think I came up with some ideas that are a little bit more unique  all right injury replacement board this is pretty easy we can go through this a little faster because it's just names and then the sort of associated player that's hurt on them for the Heat this has been really weird by the way that three players got good when one player went out Duncan Robinson Kyle Lowry and Jaime Hawkins Junior have all gotten good since Tyler hero went down the darndest thing Kyle Lowry he plays regardless but Robinson wasn't getting to do enough I guess wasn't dating to do enough it's wild so um roll these guys out there as long as Heroes hurt and then once he comes back we'll reassess  Goga batad say who has been extremely boring but right around the edge of the top 100 with Wendell Carter Junior out so he's a replacement Kobe white is on here with Zach Levine out so there you go we already had him on the other board Brandon Miller with lamelo out but he got hurt so then PJ Washington with Brandon Miller out this is the the like Russian nesting doll of injury replacement board Sadiq Bay with Jalen Johnson Ottawa that one is been sort of pretty well confirmed over the last couple of ball games Nicole Alexander Walker  talked about it on yesterday's pod I said hey you know he's been starting with Jayden McDaniels but he hasn't been able to take any shots well then Anthony Edwards went down and nikhil got a bunch of shots so he'd be a great spot play if Edwards misses another ball game  Simone fontecchio with Larry Martin and out not a super fun one as I'm not that excited about this and again this is the injury board where you like kind of have to wait for updates and you got to make sure you're targeting specific things like he always been like a couple of threes and a steal more or less if Devin Booker has to miss any time with his ankle sprain it sounded not great so we'll see then you'd get Eric Gordon into your lineups Derek Rose who's not going to play him back to back so I can pretty much guarantee it but with both Marcus Smart and John Moran out he got a shot in the starting lineup he looked really good  so he's a spot play Al Horford with Chris Doppler sing us out has been awesome and Joel embiid missed shoot around today with his illness and that would mean more Paul Reed and by the way also throw in some news here that broke during the show Luka doncic is out due to personal reasons tonight historically that's meant Tim Hardaway Jr has been decent enough to get on this board I'm not gonna add him while we're talking right now but if you wanted to play Tim Hardaway you probably could although I think he might be questionable also  so you got to make sure that he's playing before you do it if he's out he's gonna be a whole lot of Kyrie Irving tonight baby  ooh doggie and I'm good I'm good with that because I ended up with Kyrie and all a lot of spots  dead at Doo I'm good with that  let's get into the Bi-Lo and sell high if you were wondering where some of these names are but leave it or not I had us our Thompson earlier this week on the sell High board  then he got benched and he played 15 minutes  and now everybody's gonna panic and now you can buy them back  we had to act quickly and I know some of you guys like Dan how the hell did you know it was gonna fall off a cliff like that I didn't I thought he was just gonna hit a rookie wall well it seems like his coach sort of built the rookie wall  anyway people are gonna freak out about his bench role I don't think it's gonna last more than a couple of weeks and once he gets through that then you might be able to get him you know somebody that could roll 75 80 range at very cheap hell he might even get dropped in some spots  Jalen Williams had a big ball game against the Lakers yesterday at some point he's gonna wake up more permanently and you're going to want to be aboard for that ogn and nobody Jaron Jackson Jr these guys I've talked about as baillos for a week and a half two weeks now and nothing I've seen his move me off of that position your cell highs or Jeremy Grant because he's running super hot right now but I do think he settles in that kind of 65 to 80 range and then Kyle kuzma who like we saw him fall 20 spots just because of percentages dip  the that whole thing is a little bit frightening with the Wizards at some point either they don't play him 32 minutes a game or some of the bottom falls out so you want to try to lock in and I think you can get a decent thing you can get some decent return on kuzma I believe because he's scoring a lot and he had some big assist games mixed in there and people are willing to overlook the fact that he's bad at the free-throw line and eventually his field goal percent is going to kind of kick you in the Nerds so you can probably get a pretty good player coming back  and that  my fine feather friends is your weekend review part of the show but also friends that are both fine and feathered we've got more because we've got a weekend preview part of the show Yet to Come As I  have slap Dash hap Hazard try to get that to show up on the screen here on the YouTube's there it is so very quickly here  by the way someone in the chat was like maybe you should reassess the Calcutta is just good guys we know what who's in is  we know he's not a 90% free throw shooter which he's shot over the last two weeks  we know the bottom falls out  that doesn't mean that he's going to be bad you guys are not great at interpreting when I say Buy Low sell High School's number 71 right now in nine cat and he still shooting 82% at the free-throw line  he doesn't get defensive stats people are more than willing to overlook that the 47% from the field probably ticks down to 4546 when these things happen the free throw percent comes down the field goal percent comes down the other stuff kind of ticks down with it that will hurt him  but because he's scoring and assisting so much even though he's ranked 71 you could probably get someone inside the top 64 just because of what he does well so sort of that head-to-head model good scoring good assists good threes out of a power forward someone willing to overlook some of the other stuff will overpay for that  hope that made sense okay weekend in advance and there will be that many things here that we have in already talked about but Washington we just talked about or Lando  again like there is a whole lot to go on there other than when the hell markelle fultz actually shows back up again we talked Cole Anthony already Nicks Josh Hart that's the only one Raptors  nothing  I think it's basically nothing where's Scotty Barnes at now may I still 14  Pascal siakam sees sort of slowly working his way up the board yeah he's up to 139 now  which by the way Pascal siakam is I think a glowing example of what could happen to Kyle kuzma when the free throw number comes down  because there are other stuff ain't all that different  just saying where he's at right now  what the hell is this going on here Memphis we really need to see what the hell is going on with their starting lineup is it still gonna be rows and Roti and then in the back-to-back of rows is sitting what do they do their  Dallas it comes down to health really who else is who's going to be upright for them Sixers Joel and Beads status that's kind of it I'll tell you he's back for this one you'll see how many minutes he gets it won't be a full compliment some people are freaking out about the Anthony Melton already I don't think you need to I mean yeah he got to do more with guys out but he finally got the field goal percent up to 40 and so everything now is just sort of fine there  Celtics they finally played again two game week for Boston so that was a little bit annoying I mean you know me and my love of Big Al Spurs I didn't really talk about very much because when Yamaha he's been coming on he's dealing with a little bit of a hip thing so there's a chance he might miss a game he's number 27 right now feel gold percent has inched up a little bit you guys know my feelings on the Spurs pretty much anytime guys on that team have a really efficient ball game you consider selling like Devin vassell do you think he's gonna have 50 78 splits this year I'm inclined to doubt it but if you get somebody in the 75 or better range you probably do it keldon Johnson he's fallen to number 80 nobody's really noticed  we call them a cell when he was in the 60s  yeah maybe 80 he could hold it's a possibility he could keep that all I still think the field goal percent probably comes down and I'm a little worried the rebounds do all so  and then Jeremy Sohan had that one gigantic ball game to push him back inside the top 200 not that you could sell on him I think most of us are just hoping that Sohan misses a couple games so Trey Jones can start at point guard  that's the Spurs Pelicans let's see how things how they work Trey Murphy in that's definitely on the board Denver did your mom Marie tweak something in that last but we haven't heard anything about it so I'm gonna just sort of assumed the answers no but I don't really know for sure and then Phoenix Devin Booker's status is kind of the only thing you're worried about giant card on Saturday is everybody gets wrapped up because nobody plays I believe nobody plays on Sunday yeah no games on Sunday and then the tournament starts on Monday ah so the Warriors Andrew Wiggins Chris Paul those guys are closed it sounds like Chris Paul they're hoping to get back by early next week  he's being reassessed on Monday Warriors play on Wednesday so they're off for a while that you know Chris Paul will miss this game on Saturday but effectively he ends up getting like almost a week off  so those two guys Wiggins and Paul are the question marks for the Warriors and then how does that kind of trickle down to anybody else Clippers not much there at this point you're just kind of watching the regulars Minnesota Anthony Edwards is the question mark because then to kill Alexander Walker could pop loose Charlotte Brandon Miller is a question mark because his absence did seem to clear the way for Gordon Hayward and PJ Washington can Hayward subsist on what's there even when Miller's back in  we have seen yet I'm inclined to think the answer is probably but we don't know for sure Brooklyn as Camp Thomas ramps up what does that do to the other guy that's really what we need to know their people have asked me what my take is on Ben Simmons honestly I'm just kind of worried that it's gonna be like last year where he drops back in thinks he's okay to play for a little bit and then just isn't  it's the end of that discussion  Cleveland nothing really Detroit just you know who's the achillion haze is the question there what is the lineup do and boiling bogdanovich is he works his way back in Bulls will Zach LaVine be gone by this game tomorrow  Pacers  I'll be topping actually keep these minutes I can't believe that it would be true Miami bam out of Bio heard his hip in that last ball game that's something I forgot to mention earlier in the show  Thomas Bryant has not been a viable fill in for him but  bam if he asked him to miss a ball game that does open up more shots for all of those streamers we keep talking about  hawks we have a pretty good feel for bucks I think we got a pretty good feel for this we talked about earlier already Thunder not much Portland nothing really Utah I think Larry marketing could be back for this ball game they had ruled him out for two and he's now missed those two so we'll wait on a report on marketing if he's out it's mostly been kind of bad news Jordan Clarkson also missed their last ball game and that left a whole bunch of shots for keyonte George to miss but we talked about him already uh Sacramento I'd love to see Keegan Murray back for this ball game I think if you can buy on Murray this would be your opportunity to do it today because then tomorrow Whoever has been like you know what I'd rather wait and find out if he plays tonight at that point you're kind of rolling the dice that they're gonna be like okay I got him back I don't want to deal with you anymore Rockets they've been off for a bit  guess the question is whether Freddy Van Vliet is back in there Lakers are missing so many rotation guys and it keeps feeling like that should be enough of an opening for someone like a Tory and Prince to be  somewhat useful and he's been basically exactly that he's been somewhat useful with everybody out but the Lakers are missing jaxson Hayes that meant more Christian Wood but it didn't really mean more anything good for Christian Wood it has meant more Taurean Prince because Jerry Vanderbilt still out and came right Ash was back out for their game in Oklahoma City on the back-to-back  they're just they're down five rotation guys and  unfortunately you know touring Prince played 32 minutes in that game and okay see just  didn't get to do very much and they look kind of exhausted so that one's iffy it's why I didn't put him on the injury replacement board and certainly if you're the Lakers you're hoping you get some of those guys back for this ball game and that is our big weekend review and weekend preview show I'm going to pull it's been a really cool looking chat room looks like everybody is really kind of chatting with each other I'm gonna try to skim through as fast as possible and see if I can grab one or two questions that are kind of  not League dependent  and if that isn't  super obvious then  we'll we'll move forward here's one who is your favorite pickup out of Brandon pajami Dorian Finney Smith and Nicole Alexander Walker  the safest is Dorian Finney Smith because you know Ben Simmons is going to be out for a while yet Alan Alexander Walker is your big upside play but you can't really make that move until we know if Anthony Edwards is playing in the next ball game so that's that's kind of where you lean on that one um let's see what do we got here anything else that is super like across the board League relevant who would you prefer between Zach Collins and onyeka okongwu that's actually a pretty good question Zach Collins is at 128 a lot of that's because he's at almost three turnovers a game  and Congo was right at the top 100 per game so I think the answer is if you give a crap about turnovers it's okongwu and if you don't really like if you build a team the way I often do which is I don't go heavy turnovers early so my teams with Zach Collins he doesn't hurt them now much you know I my early guys like Kyrie Irving only turn the ball over one and a half times or Kawhi Leonard 1.4 times my early round picks are not nine eight cat guys they're nine cat guys so that allows me to get a guy like Zach Collins later in a draft and not really worry about the fact that he's one of my higher turnover dudes so I probably prefer Zach Collins  now like if you think a Pella gets hurt tomorrow then I reserve the right to change my opinion on that but that's where I come from and I'm assuming the most of you guys that are listening or watching this show also follow the Dan best briefs Doctrine and you're not going heavy on the giveaway guys early like you don't have a team that's Luka Cade and Darius Garland because then you really cannot afford to have another high turnover guy late in your draft but you know if you have Tyrese Maxey early he's not I turnover guy or even Tyreese Halliburton at only two and a half and she is it 2.2 there's a lot of guys that went early this year that are not three and a half turnover Doods  so getting a high two's turnover guy at that spot you can kind of treat Zach Collins like you are punting turnovers even if you're not really you're not punting them you just have a nice solid base  and if you're hunting turnovers Collins's number 87 and I'll come with his way to hell down the board somewhere  so that's the difference you like if you have a high turnover team I'll come we'll make a lot of sense  if you have a low turnover team you could afford to have college with that makes see if that adds up a little bit  uh let's see I like to do one more how here's an interesting one Kawhi Leonard or Damian Lillard I'm gonna go on this one even though right this second Kawaii is actually beating him in per game where I can go ice number 18 damage number 24  I and kauai's played in every game he's been healthy for which is freaking unbelievable they just had a five-game in seven Knight stretch in Kauai played in all of them  it just feels to me like James field goal percent is gonna tick up he's at 42 I believe that gets up to 44 or 45 as the season goes  and that alone is enough to probably catch him up with Kawaii who by the way might see his free throw number go up as well  I think I just trust Dame a little bit more long-term but you guys know I love all those guys love me my old dudes and I hope the rest of you guys were able to kind of
