welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast yo  yo my children are at school today  you got energized you got energized best for us this morning  guess it's the afternoon for you East Coasters  not for me  I had a few things I had to take care of this morning before we could launch headlong into the show I know we're like maybe a half an hour later than usual but that really bother me because I have a quiet house there's this silly old draft board behind me you guys can see it if you're watching the show and on the other side of that is a dog a 10 year old dog and that's the only sounds will hear in the house other than hopefully not a whole lot of like whether beating the outside the rain has  very much mellowed out today  still drizzling but I mean it's like not even remotely close to what we had going on yesterday it was  it was it was something fierce I don't know if you guys saw the video of what was going on supposed to mellow out I think completely by later on this evening hopefully all of you guys wherever you may be or not too severely impacted and I know it I know brewski was well he's in surgery right now has nothing to do with the rainstorms  but I know he lost his power for like half a day but I do want to start Today's Show by wishing the great Aaron Bruce Lee a safe  surgery he talked about it on Twitter I think he's mentioned it here on the show as well he was initially diagnosed a couple years ago with a carpal tunnel variant that did not turn out to be the correct it I know diagnosis he had a surgery for that that didn't help he is under the knife today for surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome most of you in the Sports World probably tie that to Stephen Strasburg probably the highest profile athlete who's had the surgery for that and and I know that he's sort of never been the same but he is functional again which is what we're hoping for for the big dog so all the best get well quick let's make sure that that's a nice safe recovery safe surgery and if Brew is is getting back to his old ways in a couple of weeks hopefully that's the that's the fingers crossed you'll get the the maniac level brew that that we haven't seen frankly in a few years because he has has not been able to type I don't know if you guys know this and I want to go too deep on it because his story but bro does all of his typing through dictation now he doesn't click the mouse in the traditional sense like he has a program where if he hovers the mouse over something for a few seconds it auto clicks it for him he's just all things to keep him from not having to like use the fingers on his hand people don't realize this he's doing all this stuff and he like can't use his arms  it's crazy because this is the guy who pioneered the you know 15,000 word fantasy update articles but anyway welcome to show everybody big news of the morning here on fantasy NBA today is that we have a rough rough estimate on Joel embiid woj tweeting about two hours ago that Joel embiid I'll just read it verbatim here well just tweet Philadelphia 76ers star Joel embiid underwent a left meniscus procedure they still really don't want to call it a surgery on Tuesday and bill will be reevaluated in approximately four weeks maybe I should throw that up on the screen maybe that would have made more sense if I had  tossed the the wojt up there we'll do that while I'm talking for for those that are watching live with us here  so there's a few things that play here and I think it's important to get the right feel for it and there's the there's the tweet for you  the  and those of you guys that play a lot of fantasy basketball you're fully aware of the the word that I'm going to be pointing at first the word is reevaluated  he is not going to be back in four weeks  it's not gonna happen  but there is now a chance small medium large we don't know yet that at that four week Mark they'll say oh okay well you know you're uh  two weeks away you can start a ramp up program you're three weeks away from a ramp up program  so now we got a breakout the calendar it's important like we got because look the the basketball season what are we what are we decide now we're 61 now officially percent of the way through the season and that's games played so by actual time it's a little bit longer than 31% because you've got the All-Star break but the season is over on I think it's April 14th is that the Sunday  yeah Sunday April 14th  which from two days ago February 4th would be one two three four  five six seven eight nine ten weeks from two days ago  so we're nine weeks  nine times seven 63  and five days 68 days away  or 68 days away from the end of the NBA regular season  which I think is farther than most people realize oh you guys thought I was gonna say that's not that far away but I actually think it's the opposite  okay  68 days away from the end of the NBA regular season it's not a giant number obviously because we're again well beyond the halfway point but it's also not that small of a number  and when you just start to look at the math of all of this if he's really gonna be re-evaluated in four weeks that's 28 we can do that math pretty quickly 68 minus 20 8 means that there would still be 40 days left in the NBA regular season  when Joel embiid is reevaluated  so 40 days left in the regular season when he's re-evaluated that's when the math really starts to take hold that's when the Clause get in  40 days left for Roto is an eternity it's a month and a half almost you can get a lot of good game out of a guy of Joel and Beads ability  in even a fraction of 40 days like even if he's back with 15 days left you're going to want two weeks of Joel embiid but what if you what do we think that means okay so what do we think the ramp up could be I think the ramp up after four weeks my honestly my guess and I don't want to get into this just yet I want to come back to what I actually think is gonna happen here  but with 40 days left  let's say that there's a two to three week ramped up so call that 14 to 20 days of ramp up before you take the floor that means he takes the floor again with about 20 days left in the NBA regular season that's still three weeks mind you  and for those who have head-to-head League's that go to the end of the regular season that would mean that he comes back basically on like the third day of your fantasy playoffs  meaning for those of you who go to the end of the regular season which I staunchly believe is a terrible idea but Yahoo's Public's are set up that way so there really isn't a whole lot that you can do about it if you're not in charge of those like you know the regular season for Yahoo publicly exists is still a long way left how many there's like there's like six weeks left the NBA or the to a Yahoo head-to-head regular season still an eternity left on that front but again like those leagues have three IL spots Yahoo public prize leagues  and go to the end of the regular season  so you can easily store players I mean three IL slots in a league that's 10 players with three bench slots like it's a massive percentage of the league you can just plop into your ill guys that have almost no hope of coming back you can still squat on them because there's almost no way you're gonna have four guys on a on a roster that short that actually need to be on your eye and if you do okay fine then you know maybe you make a cut but odds are pretty low  Roto what if you got three weeks out of it and I get it he'd come back in the end of the regular season with three weeks left and he would play 19 minutes the first game back and then 22 and then 22 again and if there's a back-to-back in there which I didn't check here for the show sorry he probably wouldn't play it  then that is another 22 and so we're talking about somewhere in the neighborhood about 10 to 12 ball games  maximum I think  and maybe skip two of those and has limited minutes in like eight of them but again who cares because he's Joel embiid and even in 25 minutes of ballgame he's probably still a top 40 fantasy player maybe better than that honestly because again in full minutes this year he was number one  he was ahead of Shea before he played through a knee injury had like two bad ballgames and then his like got blown up  Joel embed in 22 minutes a game is top 50 I could almost guarantee it  Joel embiid in 25 minutes a game is probably inside the third round Joel embed if he gets into the mid-to-high 20s now he's probably early third mid-second range  so absolutely there's a reason if your league goes to the end of the year to hold on to Joel embiid right now  but again we got to get into the math of all of this if your league doesn't go to the end of the regular season you start to shave days off of that and and you heard on the math we just did if he's reevaluated in four weeks and he's playing again the three weeks after that you have 20 days left 19 actually in your regular season  if your league doesn't compete the final week you're down to 12 days if your league doesn't compete the final two weeks you're down to five days meaning you'd probably get two games of Joel embiid and probably one of them would be 18 minutes in the other would be 20  I mean yeah they'd be too probably pretty good games but what is it cost you to get to that point  if your league against three weeks early I think there's a very real chance you don't get Joel embiid back  there's a shot there's an outside shot well let's look at this from the other perspective too because I think we were being kind of  I don't want to say conservative in our estimates what do we got a little bit more liberal in our estimates of how fast he could ramp up to play again what if the ramp up was only two weeks instead of three  now you have 47 days left in the regular season of 40  now you have effectively  oh sorry that wouldn't that's incorrect you have 27 and of 20 you'd have 26 and set of 19 technically if we want to really get into the Weeds on this thing  that's actually pretty important because if your league goes to the very end you might actually see him be before your playoffs start  and by the second week of your playoffs if they're really doing the ramp up the old-fashioned way you might get some pretty good numbers and by the last week of your playoffs you're probably getting one or two like almost full tilt games  so that's I think a best case absolute best case scenario  I don't think the odds are that that one happens what I just mentioned him being back in six weeks I think I would put my money on more like seven between seven and eight weeks he makes his return  but again the short version of that is if your league goes to the end of the regular season you try to find a way to sit on him until then  or trade maybe you can trade him to somebody who is it you know kind of a top spot in the league as a first round bye they can afford to give up somebody and and then your team makes a run something like that so there are a few different ways to play this but at least we have a starting point now with Joel embiid  officially welcome to the show I'm Dan bass this is fantasy NBA today a sports presentation please do follow me over on social at Dan best those of you that are joining us for the first time welcome I do uh way too much on social media  way way way way too much like an unhealthy amount of social media use but I don't plan on changing that anytime soon because it's become incredibly difficult to get seen noticed shared in the fantasy space which by the way brings up another Point here while I'm doing my promo at the beginning of the show I have a rant that  it's not I'm not actually upset about it but I am I do feel rant level  again at Danbury so over on social media I do hope we'll find you guys over there we have our trade deadline live show coming up that link is in the show description no matter how you're taking in the podcast all so throw it in the chat room just in case anybody that's watching live wants to go click on that please do throw a thumbs up on our trade deadline live show where we're at 78 now  made a nice little push yesterday I would like to get 42 more before we start our show two days from now I don't know if we can do it because I think we're running out of people that have YouTube accounts but if you have one please do click on that link in the show description to go to the trade deadline live show like subscribe that's a big deal that like Thursday is probably our biggest single growth opportunity day of the calendar year so I just that's why I lean in so hard it's why I'm so annoying about this I just I want to like grind his heart as I can to make that day as special as possible and then I need your guy's help to get there but my rant my rant  is  my rant is  this is a really complicated field  to grow in  because if you're good at it  people that find your stuff are not wanting are not going to want to tell anybody else about it  so like you can get into a league one person in the league can find your stuff and it's probably gonna take them like three years of winning before someone else in the league is like hey how did Joe get so good  hey how did Erica get so good  and then they start to bug them they're like what do you what like what is it and then like oh okay fine I'll let you know I'm following Dan or whatever it is  I gotta figure out a way and I'm open to your suggestions out there universe  followers friends confidants I'm open to your suggestions on how I can get people  to tell their league  about this podcast  I have no idea I don't have a clue  I don't have a clue  don't know what to do maybe I'll run a promo on like the second to like we last week of the regular season but that probably wouldn't even make sense because a lot of head leaks will be over I think in the like four weeks left in the regular season I'll run a promo  where  if people tell their league about this podcast I'll do something extraordinary for them like the world's you just discount on on next year's fantasy pass or something I don't know I'll figure it out I gotta figure it out on the fly but anyway that's my that's my issue right now let's get into the recap part of the show a little bit Dallas beat the zombie 76ers and I call them that in this one because Tyrese Maxey and I guess we can talk about the Sixers side first we'll come back Tyrese Maxey had three thousands in the first six minutes of the ballgame  Philly actually got off to a pretty good start mostly because Dallas was kind of coasting and and then and then they started to try a little bit more  the the number of people out there who want Paul Reed to fail is very weird right now  like I said I want him getting 25 minutes ballgame I've said that on the show a couple of times I think if he gets to 2728 it's sort of gravy mode  this is a really tough matchups what five out most of the ball game except the Dwight Powell bit it's basically and so Paul Reed was dealing with switching like how the hell is he going to deal with Luca and Kyrie is a terrible matchup  and he's still getting over a cold slash flu  he will be fine I will admit though someone in one of my League's offered me CAM Johnson for Paul Reed and I took it because I remain more bullish on cam Johnson than most I think but Paul Reeves a hold he's a hold you know mo Bamba played 18 minutes that takes care of most of the center minutes I think Marcus Morris may have grabbed a couple in there but like if Paul reads playing better and healthy he's not gonna score you know two points on one has to shooting his unusual he's gonna get you some boards he's gonna get you some defensive stats and he's usually gonna do it on decent percentages but he just not right right now  buddy will be  as someone who's sick all the time I can verify If eventually you get better  and unless he has two children traveling with him like I do he'll probably stay healthy for more than a week and a half  so to buy Sarah's he's gonna go on a big run here Maxi will as well provided he's not in foul trouble and having a weird ball game Kelly oubre Paul Reed those the other guys you want to be using for the Sixers right now  for the Mavericks Josh Green is on a two-game heater he went six of nine and I think we all know that's not a sustainable number I'm not in the ad Josh Green Boat I don't think it's sticks the reason you'd be adding Josh Green would be if you think the Mavs trade him to get a solid power forward they've been linked to Kyle kuzma Jeremy Grant which sounds like a harder thing they've been linked to some lesser power forwards that maybe wouldn't require them to trade the young guys their kind of semi excited about I don't think you need to squat on green because you know we have a body of work to know that this is not a sustainable number I'm more interested in are the Mavericks gonna actually pick a replacement Center here with Derek Lively out because two games back were Sean a home's played 30 minutes out of nowhere and the last two games it's been Maxi kleeba that's picked up the center minutes  if we somehow could know  is any of these guys actually gonna get a normal amount of Center minutes  I would say to pick up that guy  I just I don't know  so far it's three games in a row now three games in a row the setter that has started for the Mavericks has played near or all the way starter's minutes again there's no way to know that that's actually something that sticks and presumably Lively will be back at some point here so this isn't a super long term decision  but I would love like if the Mavs came out and said oh I'm actually cleave was starting their next ball game I think they play it back to back tonight if I'm not mistaken  by getting that right I don't have everybody schedule right in front of me right now a quick check on Mavericks schedule they are indeed they're in Brooklyn to take on the Nets here on the back-to-back  we know Cleveland's probable  but we don't know if he's starting  so  if we find out clebus starting  think I would probably  add and play  because it seems like  it seems like whoever starting for the Mavs Etc is gonna get some minutes right now by the way there was a wage report overnight before we get into anything else here the sort of finished this first game I'm not interested in Grant Williams or not interested in Jane Harvey I'm not interested in Derek Jones Junior I'm not interested in Tim Hardaway when Luca and Kyrie are there so yeah we're good on this ball game by the way there was a wage report overnight that I forgot to mention suggesting that Kyle kuzma Malcolm Brogden boy and Bug zdanowicz are growing less likely to be traded I never thought of it was gonna get traded because the Pistons like they have to have some veteran on that team or  it'll really all kinds if it hasn't come apart yet it'll really all come apart I'm not sure I believe that brogden's not getting traded feels a little silly because the Blazers do actually have a couple of veterans on that team they could lean on for guidance but maybe they want that as well  and then for kuzma I know they just want a lot so I do think there's a very real chance he'd stays put because the price is too high all right let's keep shuffling along here Cleveland blew out the Kings the calves are good man and they're still working some of their best players back by the way um calves are technically the two seed in the Eastern Conference right now they're five back to the Celtics that's not happening but Cleveland is a very real shot to end as the two because the Doc Rivers are trying to figure out what the hell they're doing in the middle of the season the Nicks are banged up so that's the reason I don't know that they catch him but man Cavs like  defensively they are so nasty  as far as the king's go Malik Monk Is as warmed back up again I think I still trust him more head-to-head than Road always game is just not this is Malik we're talking about super Roto friendly had to head he makes a lot of sense because he scores he gets assist usually some threes you know you hope you catch him on a week where the field goal percentage isn't his bad  Kevin Harter played 31 minutes again if he gets over 30 minutes he's probably startable he's obviously not my favorite guy but on the season he's number one 45 and 25 minutes and over I think it's been about three weeks if I'm remembering the number right he's at back up to 31 minutes and he's shooting well he's at 50% over that stretch and he's number 69 in nine category League's I don't try to remember if it was longer than that no I think it was right around three weeks ago  was it two and a half weeks ago no right around three weeks ago yeah that was when it all kicked into gear for her so again as long as he's getting 31 minutes he's the top 100 guy you play her if the minutes Trend back down that's why he's sort of in our stream well warm universe  the ward  he's a play as long as he's warm and for him the warmth has to do basically with minutes per game  Cleveland Max Drew's 22 points 63 point is he finally had himself a better shooting game  because it's been a hall for that dude man I  I know and yesterday's podcast I finally said man maybe I should give up on him getting back up over 42% from the field well Max what from 40 to 40.6  in one ball game  I want two more like that  and I'll be Satisfied because then at that point it'll be basically a top 90 play  and I'll stop threatening to give up  maybe I don't know  but this is why I'm good with it I mean this game was a blowout he got 13 shots in 26 minutes so the usage is there the steals were there the boards were there like still like what I'm seeing I still believe Charis Levert is gonna end up a drop here in the not too distant future he had a good enough ball game here some of it was blowout related some of it was just that he's on sign of a field goal percent surge at the moment  and I think Darius Garland We can probably start now you got up to 27 and a half 28 minutes in this ball game meaning he'll probably Target around 30 in the next one and that should be enough for him to be you know top 75 to top 90 range if he can sort out the turnovers that was a big deal earlier this year that he moves up towards that top 50 range  and we proceed Lakers at Hornets this game was briefly a blowout and then Brayden Miller and Miles Bridges went absolutely nuts in the fourth quarter made it all again but Anthony Davis was just simply too much tripled for the third time in his career I think of all three of them but no two of the three I think have been this year teams are doubling add Moore and his passing has really come along like a lot a lot  and impressive and impressive amount of growth from 80s passing not surprisingly he was a plus 16 in this game and when ad was off the floor the Lakers were just getting ripped to pieces because their defense remains super weird  let's do the fantasy thoughts and then I have a couple of thoughts on on just Lakers and I watched them and so but it I think we can use stuff like that like if you're really digging in on a team you can see more about what they're doing for right now I know really how much more is in the starting five and it gives them a little bit of size which is good but he does not have even remotely close to the lateral quickness of a Jarred Vanderbilt or a passing Lane ability of of Jarred Vanderbilt  so you know you see the limitations Brandon Miller miles Bridges were cooking people really at times and they'd get switches and they'd cook Reeves and then they'd cook D-Lo  and honestly they cooked LeBron  LeBron is not chasing dudes right now  he's saving up for offense  so I think the Lakers they just make keep rotating it really is going to start here until they cool off because they've won three games in a row they've been nice wins he's not startable in 12 teams I don't know I don't care that we played 29 minutes yesterday the fantasy game just isn't thick enough with ad and Lebron in there if a superstar misses a game I would consider playing Roy but that's about as far as I go as far as Charlotte's concerned you got four guys you can play most days Nick Richards played 32 minutes but he sort of got Anthony Davis did write out of this ball game he's fine most days then you got PJ miles Bridges and Brandon Miller those are the three guys you're playing right now while lamelo ball is out we don't know when lamelo's coming back we've heard Rumblings that Gordon Hayward might not actually be all that far away from returning but is very much on the trade block so who the hell knows their  I am not stashing Gordon Hayward I don't like his Fantasy game at this point in his career he is old and slow he was number one 32 and 32 minutes of all game in what you can only really described as like a best case usage scenario for him  other than I guess if you magically comes back I mean he's coming back from a cafe injury so it's not like they're gonna give him 32 minutes out of the Chute the only way this works for Hayward is if he doesn't get traded lamelo gets shut down and it's these guys plus Gordon because he would just come in and take all the you know leaky black Bryce McGowan's minutes and there'd be plenty of usage but we're asking a lot there and we're probably still looking multiple weeks down the line so pass  hey we have enough points in Clippers Hawks  my God 290 points in a regulation ball game Clippers are a fantasy Gold Mine mostly James Harden Kawhi Leonard and Paul George and this one no zubats he sat out the last game of their their road trip I believe there's the last game of it yeah  zoo is gonna work his way back up to being the regular starting center he'll probably be like a top 125 type of guy which is startable in most formats I just you know I feel like putting the stamp on him here just so everybody kind of knows where we sit  I have the combination of James Harden and Kawhi Leonard on like 70% of my Rodeo teams  not all of them because in some of them I'm in people that listen to the podcast and so you guys didn't let me get him all those guys but the Yahoo public prize League's  which is where I'm playing against people who don't know who I am I think I think I got him in almost every both of these guys in almost every single draft and those teams are all either in first or second place basically because of these guys I mean the rest of my draft was fine but it didn't need to be all that great because I you know you got him in the third round and he's number four by totals right now and James Harden I think I got him as late as the 50s and one of those drafts he's number 16 on a per game basis and by totals actually both  these guys are just destroying people anyway no real thoughts on the Clipper side zubats coming back will render Mason Plumlee and frankly Russell Westbrook  afterthoughts and so then again you peel back to sort of the main Superstars around it Atlanta is the more interesting side of this ball game because there's a lot sort of dangling hanging in the balance on the Atlantic side who are they what are they gonna do with the trade deadline  and you know I we started don't know precisely who the Hawks are gonna be at the deadline let's zoom in a little tighter on these Atlanta names so let's do let's go with the easy stuff  and the interestingly there really isn't much on Yoko is easy  because Capella's out for a couple weeks with an injury it finally happened it's not that we were waiting for it but you just knew it was coming  Jalen Johnson and Trey young I think there's almost a 0% chance approaching zero a horizontal asymptote  near zero that those three guys are staying put I mean they offers would have to be so insane for the Hawks to specifically Jalen Johnson in my eyes is probably the guy least likely to go anywhere even in an even in a blow up like at least in a blow up because I well maybe they trade Trey young I don't think that's happening either  cling capella people ask me if I thought his injury makes him harder to trade I don't think so because the expectation is that he's just out for like two weeks and if something lingers then maybe that's a reason but like anybody that would trade for capella is probably okay to sit on him for another week week and a half before he ends up having to play for them because again you know you've got an All-Star break coming up later this month there's a lot of downtime before the game's kind of ramped back up and frequency at the end of February and then that through the end of the season so no I don't think it really changes the odds of capella getting traded I still think that there's  like a pretty good size non-zero shot I think anybody saying 50/50 is probably going to I don't know if anybody even said that I've said this before the show I actually don't have time to know what anybody else is saying in the fantasy space simply don't I just have to get the facts and I interpret them my own way but if someone out there is telling you there's a good chance click capella gets traded I think that's probably aiming too high I think there's a chance he gets traded and I'm sure the Hawks are exploring it but they're not going to take nothing so what would I say 25 30% that might even be too high 20% chance Capelli gets traded but you know again that's one of those moments where I like OK Google goes from being you know top 100 top 130 range to top 50  Deonte Murray seems likely to be traded all though again it also sounds like the Hawks are not getting the kinds of offers they wanted for him because word is squeaking out that he's been a problem in the locker room and the buyers Market it's just it's not a seller's market right now for whatever reason so the teams I think some of it's just like a lack of assets from teams that want to go all in on dejounte Murray we've heard Lakers we've heard gnats we've heard Sixers  I don't think these teams are all going to go nuts to outbid each other but who knows I mean maybe did Dante Murray gets traded he's still seems like the most likely to get traded on this Hawks team if he gets moved that means there's a lot left that gets dumped into the big bucket for saddiq Bey Bogdan bogdanovich DeAndre Hunter are the three guys that benefit the most because  look Jalen Johnson's been given plenty Trey young is always gonna have plenty oh Kong was the center so it doesn't change his job all that much  unless capella doesn't get moved and maybe you see perhaps a little bit more sort of Tandem Center lineup so I guess it could help out a little bit  but do you under Hunter who's working his way back in 2490 minutes yesterday and I've said for two weeks on the podcast now that I think he's someone you consider squatting on through the deadline because there's a chance that a guy like Sonic bag it's moved  or bogged on both frankly  now if multiple guys get moved the under Hunters gonna have no choice but to figure out a way to get healthy and then take a bunch of shots  he's a tough hold on the head-to-head side because Hunters probably not going to be playing in back-to-backs maybe the rest of the year I don't know possibly they get him in there towards the end of the season but I wouldn't expect it  but you know Roto side he does have a great Roto game but at a certain point you're just given enough shots that it doesn't matter you find a way inside the top 100 just on sheer volume alone  if Murray's the only guy traded  saddiq Bey probably stays as a fringe startable player  if Marie does not get traded I don't think hunter or Bay needs to be on a roster so there's like all these weird permutations of okay what if Marie and Bae get traded great then DeAndre Hunter is a must roster guy what if it's Marie and book zdanowicz and Hunter and baby probably a rostered what a bug zdanowicz stays put  and nobody gets traded he's probably still inside the startable range if Murray gets traded only book zdanowicz is yes obviously so again there's all these sort of like how many different ways can you move Four Guys yes or no  and you just you probably just need to be ready for it more than anything else  before we get to Golden State Brooklyn wanted to just take a brief moment in the middle of the show to remind everybody to please follow on Twitter over at Dan best person and all so to ask you all  when you guys go to the bathroom like in

at Brooklyn 109.98 Jonathan kaminga continued his ridiculous tear he's on it's not gonna last forever we know this um and it's not my I'm not like trying to be a buzz killer or anything it's just the simple facts of the matter that he's on a vicious heater  and I still think if you can sell High you should someone was asking me if I felt that same way about points and that's actually really good question that I hadn't thought about know I think you can probably just roll with him in points League's because we know both percentages are going to come down here when the heater evaporates or dissipates or just sort of cools to a calm boil or whatever so points League I think you can probably just stick with it nine cat he's rolling you know second round value over the last two weeks we all know that's not a thing that's just gonna be the rest of the season but again with every good game he puts up you can probably aim a little higher two games back you could probably have gotten top 75 now with another two decent ball games you can probably aim for top 60  those are pretty good players top 60 guys are like  these are these are pretty rare  you know Anthony Edwards is number 50 okay that's not gonna happen but like if you get France Wagner form bam out of bio  Rudy gobert is number 60 I don't know if you go JJ cuz shut down is coming here  Deonte Murray if somebody's worried about what happens here at the deadline vooch at 46 maybe is attainable  I don't think these guys are completely out of the question with his hot as coming as been so aim high see what happens  no Andrew Wiggins he missed this ball game Brandon Putski now as had three good ones in a row  he very much does belong on rosters at least while he is kind of he's getting these giant minutes and it does seem like he's coming out of his little rookie Haze that lasted about three four weeks so make sure Jim ski is rostered and started right now when Wiggins comes back you could potentially I think play a by ear the  Klay Thompson got benched down the stretch in this ball game so that's a thing now but he's a hold  even though he's very much a shell of his former self he's still a hold  Brooklyn's weird so Lonnie Walker got hurt which kind of happens with him doesn't sound like it was a huge deal but who knows hamstring was the ruling here  cam Johnson another decent ball game 13 points 8 boards four assists a steal two blocks he's been coming on lately after a prolonged prolonged cold spell cam is up to number one oh nine so again if you started every day this year that's a startled player in 12 team leads  I think that's pretty game am I looking at the right page here yeah per game  so cam Johnson is a start and you guys yelled at me because I said you definitely do at least hold him through the trade downline but this is kind of why like no Ben Simmons in this game injury management he's gonna be a pain in the butt to roster  no Dorian Finney Smith in this ball game either he's hurt right now and then we know Dorian Finney Smith we know Rose O'Neill we know Spencer Dinwiddie these guys are on the trade block  you know if you clear out a little bit of space cam Johnson goes from being pretty good which he's been lately to being very good  sounds like the Nets are not trading Mikhail Bridges under any circumstance cam Thomas I referred to as a big time sell high and then he came out and shot four for 21 in this ball game he is still a sell High because he's taking a crap ton of shots and people don't realize that these types of games actually hurt more than the good ones help  just the math of it all  you guys are just gonna have to believe me on this one see what you can get for Camp Thomas you can go if you can get top 75 you definitely do it there and then Dennis Smith Jr is another name I wanted to mention because he ended up playing 31 minutes here with no with Lonnie Walker basically going down and I said on the show a couple of times I think Dennis Smith Jr could be it really interesting trade deadline winner if Spencer didn't witty gets moved and or Dorian Finney Smith like I do think that it's kind of a tool away and you know Ben Simmons out Finney Smith out Walker got hurt so Smith got a bunch of extra run here but I mean you take Spencer didn't witty out of the equation you drop 30 plus minutes of point guard spot back into the bucket yes some of that can go to Ben Simmons if he ever gets ramped up to any reasonable number of minutes but Dennis Smith Jr ends up getting a decent chunk of that I would think  Toronto got blown out by New Orleans so we don't want to read too much into this Gary Trent did leave early with an injury of his own that's annoying because he was a guy I kind of wanted to see how he was gonna look leading up to the deadline  and now we don't get to now how severe was it was back soreness they were getting spanked  maybe he plays in the next ball game this game was over very very early  as I've said before I think Gary Trent Jr needs two guys to get out of his way probably Bruce Brown and Dennis Schroder might be the same story needing Bruce Brown and Gary Trent to probably get out of the way at least Yakima portal played pretty well in this game but again don't read too much into the Toronto side because they got destroyed Brandon Ingram had his oh I can hit three pointers game which he doesn't do very often he's number 69 and 9 cat this one got him up to one point five three-pointers per ball game  Ingram just generally kind of float back into that this range the like 60 to 90 range because he has some weird flaws in his Fantasy game but he's you know he's safe play in this spot this game doesn't really change like he's not gonna just become a guy who is 83 pointers at night again ball game was over early on both sides but it is worth noting that with Larry Nance back jv's projections should drop with herb Jones back Trey Murphy's projections drop trade did have two blocks in this game to kind of float his value but I don't know that  you know you start valent Judas out of that group of four  I don't know that I start herb or Trey or Nance unless someone is out  we need a thinning of the herd subtraction by addition here fantasy wise you're not adding guys Daniels you're not adding Jose Alvarado this game again blow out so toss it and that is your card from yesterday I did do a little sort of quick hitter Twitter thing on the upcoming card tonight we can do this very very fast because I don't think that I mean there will be more stuff that breaks over the course of the day the big things I'm watching for tonight Tyrese halliburton's minutes because I am  actually contemplating a Bi-Lo there if we had any idea how long he was going to be on this minutes cap Jalen Suggs defensive stats coming back I don't know if he's gonna do enough in the other stuff but I think he's probably worth the look The Zombie Grizzlies um we don't have by the way Dorian Finney Smith lawn you Walker they've been ruled out for tonight so that already happened and cam Johnson is doubtful that would probably be just sort of a general rest game so you know fart sound effect there for getting any information we don't however have the Grizzlies  injury update for today yet so will they have 13 guys out or only 11 guys out and it matters a lot because like if Santi aldama comes back I would play him and if it's William's comes back I would play him  I would like to know if Luke Kennard can get up to 28 29 30 minutes of ball game is his body gonna allow it  anyway Mavs Center spot tonight we already talked about that because they just played Ben Simmons his minutes for tonight  we talked about Dennis with Junior already and then Brooke Lopez he's been out for a personal reasons for a little bit would love to see him come back but if he doesn't just make sure that Bobby Portis is is already on your radar and that's kind of the big stuff I'm looking at for tonight  I know that you guys in the chat room at a couple of questions on some of these games coming up this evening so what I want to do here is I'll leave this this sort of big nope let's make that a little smaller there we go I'll leave the the schedule for tonight up on the board here while I do my quick scan through the chat room to see if you guys brought up some players that I maybe intended to talk about but didn't  and then we'll wrap this bad boy up let's see  do do do do do oh here's an interesting one this is a cell high for a buy High I took your advice I traded cam Thomas for Jonathan kaminga  in my eyes that's like six of one half dozen the other I think Amiga has the higher ceiling than Thomas because you know Camp Thomas is eventually going to settle back at like 440% high volume fuel goal we don't know I mean come get the free throws are probably not going to be great but the field goal percentage is probably gonna be a positive and then if the free throw percent can just be not a massive negative then he probably wins this head-to-head fantasy battle there's some discussion in the chat about when folks think and beats coming back some say not at all that's a possibility but in my eyes you have to at least hold on for these four weeks to get this first update this is Delonte says there's no chance I'd ever share you or Josh with my team it's or my my league it's just too big of an edge I try to make up for it through Retreats engagement even the manscape sponsor I can imagine how hard it must be to have your growth injured because you're too good at what you do yeah  that's it that's it man I like I don't want to say it because it sounds like a real like a dick thing to say but the better you are at giving fantasy analysis the less anybody wants to tell anyone else about you  it's the ultimate compliment for somebody to be like screw you I'm not spreading word about what you do  what's the upside for Paul Reed if he does play okay I think I called him top 100 or slightly better on a show maybe two days ago no that's not true on the Saturday show  maybe he was yesterday who knows man I can't keep my days straight top 100 is in my estimation that's what you're targeting with him if he starts to play better and Nick nurse gets him up to 27 28 minutes instead of 24 25 then you're looking at maybe 80 to 75 range but that's a best case scenario and I think you should be aiming for 100 let's see here uh some trade questions you guys can throw those in the comments after the show are we picking up amen Thompson with Freddie Van Vliet out or be patient until the deadline  ooh that's a good question um  it is deadline week and it's really important to save your moves until a trade goes down I think I made the mistake on Twitter of saying save them until Thursday save them until a trade happens because someone who didn't have value you could pop up that becomes more of a Difference Maker the rest of the way Freddie is out we don't have a specific timeline for him yet um  which sucks because he actually been relatively healthy it's a left a doctor issue which you know I don't think that's gonna be one game that's probably gonna be a couple and the rockets I think pretty badly need his leadership and defense these days  and her family like you know it's it's been generally a pretty good year from a health standpoint and he missed what two three games all season long so he's gonna try to get back as fast as he can um I'ma Thompson is a very good streamer possibility here  but I would probably unless unless news breaks later today that they're expecting Van Vliet to miss like two weeks or more I think I would just leave it alone because I want to have my moves for the deadline I don't think that Thompson is going to be a rest of season guy there's just simply isn't enough minute available for him when Van Vliet is healthy  so right now this week in particular and it's not something we've had to do since like the first three weeks of the season first three weeks first two to three weeks of the Season you're looking for these big rest of season guys that maybe analysts myself included didn't see  leading up to the year so like worked were on the waiver wire and then we've been a run in a stretch now of like the last 11 weeks 12 weeks where  most of the pickups are related to injury  so you know you're looking for somebody that can give you two weeks or three weeks or five weeks or whatever it is and now all of a sudden you've got deadlines week and you have to treat it like the first week of the Season again you make your moves based on something you think it could help your team for the next 10 weeks instead of almond Thompson who might be one or two but again if we get a report that Bentley is going to be out longer okay fine then you make the move you get three weeks four weeks out of a guy that's probably still worth making a roster because like that's a big deal it helps your team for a month that's significant but as of right now van Fleet is not week to week  yet um  so I think I'd prefer to save my moves  thank you Albert that's very kind of you says this is the best fantasy podcast in the world especially for us Dying Breed Roto folks yeah there needs to be  there needs to be a  some Roto discussion and it's not because  like look more people play head I get that I just think that when you evaluate a player you should evaluate them first for whether or not they make sense for a nine category games cap format meaning is this someone that has potential to be a game to game impact dude and then for head-to-head you make tweaks to that and my punting something does this player have a really good schedule coming up that's how you can kind of Take That Base Line handicap of a player and tweak it up or down on a more head-to-head requires more of a micro analysis of okay well what is this tonight what is this for the next four days what is this for the next seven days kind of thing where Rodeo it's all about am I gonna get double digit value out of this guy Brandon Marcus my old buddy Brandon Marcos happy Brandon day everyone one of the two hosts of our incredible Clippers show by the way asking about clay the field goal percent murderer is he even worth it  I'm gonna still say yes I still think Clay is worth it he had an awful start to the year but he isn't 119  in  nine cat right now he's basically been sitting you know he has a terrible start to the year that he had to run of like top 60 and he's kind of been sitting like around the edge of the top 100 since then which awful though his field goal percent may be he is still a nine cat 12 team start even if he sort of Sitting On The Fringe those guys that are you know between 80 and 120 they are typically good enough to play  and I think he probably all so is due for a good game after getting benched so does he come out angry guess we'll find out  and here's one Paul Reed versus Ozark Thompson for a stash I don't I mean Paul reads on a stash because he's like he might have eight weeks of being a starter there and with Thompson I don't know that he's gonna be playing big minutes even right now he had better numbers in their last ball game but that could vanish very much in the next one because Monty Williams loves Kevin Knox for some reason and I don't think Thompson really gets free reign in Detroit until closer to Silly Season which is still like six weeks away  maybe seven even and Paul Reed might be useful for those seven weeks you might even be able to go Paul Reed for the next five six weeks and then switch and get them both for when they are relevant  and that  is the end of the line thank you everybody for tuning in live thank you to anybody that listens or watches after the fact I will once again asked all of you on the way out please go drop a thumbs up on our trade deadline live show  I
