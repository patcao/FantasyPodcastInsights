welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast good morning everybody  good late morning Pacific timer is good early afternoon  everybody else basically except Hawaii where I wish I was  constantly finally stopped raining in Los Angeles just long enough for the first massive trade of the day to break  I know I know we're Josh and we're just having a little bit of our sillies today on the show I got to get my sillies out I got a wig jump dance my wiggles out or whatever those kids songs are the first trade of the deadline week  pandemonium  the Utah Jazz are trading Simona fontecchio to the Detroit Pistons  for a 2024 second round pick whoa and  we all believe Kevin Knox woj has two tweets on this I was hoping that I could find a way to get them all in the same thing looks like it's a second rounder  and and Kevin Knox  and the draft rights to  Gabriele procida  Gabriella procida  get that right  let's see here what do we got there's the other tweet let's see if I can get this one on the board as well this one actually is probably better honestly so let's switch it give you guys the old what do you get to see on your screen Switcheroo any  where is it  there we go all right there's the full deal the details on it I mean I get it where you know we're having a little bit of fun here at the beginning of this show and I've got my trade tracker sheet cooking I have no idea how many keep up tomorrow when all of this stuff is happening and I'm already live on air but this is the fourth trade  basically of the season I think we had OG the OG trade right before New Year's we had siakam and Roeser and now we've got funky I'm sure that the first thing you guys all want to know is should I do anything with this and the answer is only in a very specific set of circumstances we're going to give this one the uh the Liam Neeson particular set of skills treatment which is the particular set of circumstances for what you'd be doing here is and I'm referring to 12 teamers it's it's simply too hard to do a show where you're like and what about 14 teams well what about 16 what about 18 what about 20 we got time for that  if you're into 12 Team league  the player that benefits the most from this deal is spectacular  the question however is is it enough  his Fantasy game is  kind of middling by all accounts this year averaged about 23 minutes a game for Utah 93 and a half boards point six deals 0.4 blocks one point eight three pointers that was sort of the big upward thrust for Funko who's already a much older player  born in 1995 which is like ancient in the modern NBA yes I feel very old but he's in his late 20s already so from like a developmental standpoint  he's going to get a little bits better but there isn't this like big pivot coming for his Fantasy game  so what you can see and then you know I always find it more helpful to go in and look at a players game log to find out okay well what have they done in games where the role matches what we either expect or hope and those two things sometimes aligned and sometimes they're very different what we either hope or expect the role could be  in this instance  for Detroit woes was kind enough to send out another tweet in sort of a bit of a mini Storm from the man himself that said and I quote I'm not fast enough to get this one up on your screen also you know what maybe I am fested enough let's see can Dan get this one on the screen we're gonna go to just feed and we're gonna just scroll down past all these lovely advertisements on EX to this one this is the one right here  let's zoom in on it for everybody quote funtech will be a restricted free agent this summer and pistons made trade to keep him as part of franchise's longer-term core  montecchio had a lot of suitors at trade deadline  two hyphens and pistons land him for an early second round pick and draft rights to proceda poor Kevin Knox got left out of that tweet but he's also part of this as well the thing that I think we want to focus on and I'm gonna try to highlight it and I don't know if that's gonna show up properly on the video feed  but Pistons made trade to keep him as part of franchises longer term core  that  is key what this this is verbiage that woj doesn't come up with on his own  this is verbiage that is fed  directly to the big news Breakers  because this is what teams want him putting out on their behalf meaning Detroit  told him this is not something that you taught is going to leak it's not something I mean maybe fontecchio Camp could leak it but that wouldn't really help them who does this help this helps  Pistons try to endear themselves to a fan base a tiny bit more and to a player frankly a tiny bit more who again is about to be a restricted free agent so he doesn't have that much in the way of opportunity but it's good to build a nice relationship and maybe that leads to something point is the only really the only entity that benefits by putting out a statement like this  is the Pistons front office  so you can kind of tell where it comes from  but it also tells us something and yes it can all be Bluster because Monty Williams can ultimately do whatever the hell he wants with his players that's why we've seen Kevin Knox starting on a team that has  asthma Thompson waiting in the wings to develop and become an NBA star  funky old can shoot  that's the key here  so let's just play a brief game because in a moment we'll look at the seven games from yesterday but I didn't think it was like that hyper impactful of a car the Rockets game I thought had  some stuff the Grizzlies had a little bit of stuff  Brooklyn had a little bit of stuff and that's kind of it from yesterday so what don't worry we'll we'll laser in on those teams in a minute but again you know what the deadline coming and honestly something could happen while we're on air I kind of frankly hope that it does because then I can just be like hey first  first  but yeah nothing nothing at this moment as of yet  the reason I bring this up is okay if they're gonna go out of their way to describe this player as part of their core which is pretty weird for a guy who's already 28 but let's just take it at face value  the Assumption then is that he's gonna come to Detroit and he's gonna get to play  especially with Isaiah Stewart out  because now you've got Kevin Knox out of the way you've got Stewart sidelined  and you got a team that desperately desperately needs somebody to be able to go hit a damn jump shot  who's also not tiny that's actually important that is 6768 somewhere in that neck of the woods he sort of a big guard  small forward kind of thing so you know he's wingy everybody loves Wings in the NBA these days and funky is a wing who can shoot a little bit  what if we extrapolate his numbers that's the game to play here what if we extrapolate his numbers to 26 27 28 minutes per game now if the if the Pistons roster stays unchanged from this point forward in Isaiah Stewart comes back and boy and bug zdanowicz is still there and Alec Burks is still there  and Danny Lo Gallinari is still there then things do get a little bit jammed up no question about it  but I got to think that Burke's is on the Block we know boy and bug zdanowicz is on the Block that you know repeatedly they haven't gotten as much as they wanted to for him so I don't think you can just assume he's gonna go anywhere  but let's let's take the best case scenario path here because that'll give us I think a pretty good indicator of whether we should even  dig deeper is it even worth it  but he owe at let's say 29 minutes and this big number  it's a big number he's a 23 for the season in Utah and you know it wasn't remotely close to good enough for Fantasy Valley 23 minutes a game he was outside the top 200 and it's not like the percentages were all that bad it's just that he sort of wasn't doing very much but there's a couple things that play here first let's extrapolate to 29 minutes let's call it a best case scenario because I don't think there's any way he's playing 30  I don't even think in a best case scenario he's playing 30 so let's say 29 is the perfect stars align Universe without a whole team getting hurt at the same time kind of thing what does that mean for his numbers seven shots becomes what well 7.2 in 23 minutes 29 is six additional minutes which is a little bit less about a quarter more it's about a quarter more  quarter of 23 minutes is you know five and change so it's about a quarter more  quarter of seven and some odd is in the high ones so seven shots becomes call it nine seven point two shots becomes nine which actually I think is is exactly an extra quarter there  so if he's at 9 points in seven shots  which is again you know like one point two eight ish points per field goal attempt  in nine shots it again goes up by about two and a half so well 9 points becomes 11 and a half points a citgo's from one and a half to close to two not quite steals goes from point six to point eight blocks goes from point four to point five  and a little bit  for free throws he'll take one again instead of 0.8 rebounds goes from three and a half to roughly about four and a half little s  4.4 I think  uh yeah yeah that's no yes no  yes  is that good enough  is 11 points four and a half rebounds two assists and 1.3 ish combined defensive stats mind you all so you know about 2.2 2.33 pointers that's not nothing  is that a top 100 fantasy play and the answer is barely barely  and if 45% shooting in 80 at the free throw line and I think the answer is actually kind of barely not  but then we have to adjust for one other thing in our brains on this fun Tech yo situation that one other little thing is is his role bigger in Detroit then it was in Utah and that's kind of digging in on who gets the shots  unfortunately we can't answer that right now because we don't know if bug zdanowicz and or Burke's and or Gallinari and or whoever if these guys are all going to be on the Pistons past the trade deadline  like if you move say you moved by zdanowicz out of the way that dramatically changes forget just a minute for a fun Tech yo it dramatically changes the amount of looks he'll get but I'm just taking 15 shots a game and almost four free throws that's a lot to put back into the main bucket it's a lot  he would probably be the  the largest  of the possible things that could get I mean Kate I know in 19 shots a game but he's not going anywhere  J nivi is at 11 shots per game and more than that lately some of that of course being with Kade out so you kind of mix and match but Burks has been at about 10 11 shots lately when Kate was out  and Isaiah Stewart was at 10 boom in that 15 range still  so you know what happens here because it's not like Kevin Knox talk about a bunch of shots with him on the way out  yucky  no  so could fontech yo then go from 9 shots say just enroll alone to 10  if nobody gets moved possibly  what does that then change on his numbers he goes from 11 and some odd points per game to 12 and a half or 13 now are we getting close to a top 100  what if one of these guys gets moved what if Burks gets moved and you know eight to 11 8 to 12 shots Off the Bench get put back into the main bucket could you get funk you to 10 and a half 11 shots I think we're starting to ask a lot because if you look at Utah this year they're just aren't that many games where he took more than 10 shots you can count them on two hands  maybe less November 29th 30th and December 2nd  1312 and 12 that's three December 11th December 13th at 5 say we need our second hand December 21st January 1st January 3rd that's it eight games all year he's taking more than 10 shots and I think in one game he took exactly 10 shots so if you want to call it nine that's fine  but that's basically what you need out of him he needs to be taking 10 or more shots per game to have consistent fantasy value I know you can dig in there and you can say all look Dan Daniel where 203 took nine shots at 18 4 and 2 yeah I mean he made six out of the nine shots and five of them were three pointers that's the type of thing that levels off with some other game where he played 24 minutes and took nine shots and made three of them  these things are just there they balance out that's December 16th by the way 25 minutes three out of nine had seven and two  you got to look for opportunity and you got to look for  consistent opportunity  and if you go to those games where you took 10 shots or more you could make an argument that this guy is a is a 12 team or even if the field goal percentage is not that outstanding like if you look at December 11th December 13th  he didn't shoot that great in both of them seven for 11:1 that's good for for 12 in the other so 11 out of 23 a little bit below 50% 6 threes the average 17 points four boards three one and a half assists excuse me he did have a weird  measure of blocks in there came out of nowhere a bit but you know one steal  is where he came out so again like that's the thing can we get him up near 30 minutes  can we get him to 11 or 12 shots a game  and the answer I think as the Pistons are currently constructed is no  if they move bogdanovich  the answer I think becomes  probably  and then we're talking about being right now a player away from maybe being a top 100 guy just again analyzing how a fantasy game takes shape  and this is all part of the handicapping process so I know a lot of your like Dan you've done 15 minutes on Simone  adding him and the answer is on head-to-head probably not because I think I'd rather save my four weekly moves for something bigger I don't know what it's gonna be maybe it doesn't happen I don't know there's no guarantee that a better trade pops up but we've talked on you know three different shows about guys that have stash appeal like if Spencer Dinwiddie is on the move  I'd rather use a move on Dennis Smith Jr then Simone fontecchio  what other names yeah I want to have a move available in case Daniel Gafford gets moved I want to have a move available in case dejounte Murray gets moved  if none of those things shake out okay fine then someone else beat you to Simone fontecchio and maybe they have like a top 125 fantasy guy or maybe somebody gets moved he actually does get near the top 100  but I wouldn't use a move on it  the other question that's coming through is does this help so Thompson and actually believe in the short term it doesn't  Kevin knocked was starting for the Pistons but he's not good  sorry Kevin Knox I didn't intend to come on this show and clown on you he's a fringe NBA level basketball player which makes him better than 99.9% of basketball players in the universe but compared to these guys he's not good and you know Knox started the last ball game but he only played 13 minutes  the same amount of attack you is better than Kevin Knox as evidenced by the fact that the Pistons had to send more stuff to Utah to get fontecchio then Utah had to send to get in quotes Kevin Knox  fontecchio has a better chance of playing than Knox did because he's a better basketball player  so in the very short term this actually hurts Master Thompson  I know that's not what any of us wanted to hear but it's the house to truth they brought in a better player than the guy they're sending out  Thompson is going to have a path to minutes at some point I've said in this show of many times I think it's maybe more silly season than trade deadline season like you know if bug zdanowicz gets shipped out and and Burke's gets shipped like the Pistons really do peel off all the pieces  I actually don't think that it's a guarantee that these guys are gone because I think the Pistons badly need shooting around Cade Cunningham and they just don't want to play out the string look they're bad but right now the Pistons are more competitive than the Hornets and The Grizzlies I don't think they want to be that it's been bad long enough in Detroit they wanted to at least be fighting in these games even if they go down swinging and they need shooters  it seems like Burks is contract is easier to move that's why he's the name I keep mentioning as a guy that that could be traded here for Detroit and bulgarisch could get traded too uh it's just you know someone's gonna have to pay up for him he's he'll be more pricey for some other team and I think the Pistons kind of prefer having him around veteran leadership floor spacing that kind of stuff on a team that has not Pistons are the worst three-point team I think they were the worst 3-point team in the league the last time I looked but maybe that's shifted since then  so yeah some of these guys could get cleared out tomorrow or later on today and would that then helped Thompson yes would it help Pontiac who they just brought in that would all be good but the answer the question of does this trade make you want to pick up Thompson is no  no other trades went down in the 20 minutes we spent talking about this one womp womp let's quickly then welcome you to the show I didn't even have a chance to say hi hello everybody I'm Dan bass this is fantasy NBA today the day before the deadline we got a day before the deadline actually deadline is what 24 hours and about 39 minutes from this very moment

days before the Super Bowl which is also kind of crazy I'm gonna stop sharing that screen because now it's looks like it's just playing an ad of  who the hell was that that was that that was that

gonna yell at you a lot tomorrow to come find me on social media because they're gonna be some new folks that are tuning in that's all so fun about trade deadline day  going to be a wing ding my friends gonna be a wing ding  let's let's quickly go through yesterday's stuff just make sure we didn't miss anything super important that's not yes yesterday apologies will also zoom in so you guys can get a good look at it there we go Houston know Freddy van Fleet for at least a week that's one of the big pieces for the Rockets right now Dillon Brooks is gonna get more shots I am not sold on him as a stream I'm in Thompson got the start doubled with rebounds by the way three blocks six assists also missed a bunch of his free throws but I feel like and this is again you know I do you spend a weekly move on Thompson probably not because this is a short-term fill-in thing but certainly if you have unlimited moves that's where you make the the pivot here as a Freddie vanvleet fill in  and you know there's gonna be some  maybe some issues you saw yesterday with the missed free throws he's not a good foul shooter he doesn't shoot three pointers  but he'll put up some defensive stats as you saw I can rebound he can pass  I think he's worth a look here well Freddy is out I think we should probably also not put the cart before the horse and just expect him to be like a top 50 fantasy guy as a rookie ball handler  these are problematic times for friends but there is enough there you know in terms of  other stuff  that you just sort of prey the free throws the field goal that stuff doesn't kind of sag him down  do keep an eye on Dillon Brooks much is we mock him for his ridiculous confidence if he actually is going to go take 15 shots of game with Freddie Van Fleet out you consider it but we also need to bear in mind this game was against a Pacers team that doesn't bother to play defense so everybody's always gonna put up or numbers I think we should probably watch for one more game before doing anything on the Dillon Brooks front with the Rocket's Soul Freddie Van Fleet for the Pacers Tyreese Halliburton 29 minutes friends 29 minutes we had our Bi-Lo show yesterday and I said he was a Buy Low and you had to go do it and I didn't think we only had like an hour and a half to pull it off  oopsies well guess we need to do that by low show a little bit sooner anyway Halliburton is gonna cost you again because no way people didn't notice he played 29 minutes instead of 22  this is awesome  if you can go get him I mean honestly spend anything up to like number 15 because he's now very close to getting revved back up to full minutes I don't know if you can get him for anything in that range but I think it's worth a try you know if you've got like a Tyrese Maxey don't come out there  see if you can get Halliburton  maybe Dame can get you Halliburton  Trey young probably not Scotty Barnes worth the try  I think anybody lower is gonna get it done and I don't know how much higher I would go because some of those other guys are cooking as well you could go Paul George maybe get your Tyree salbert and who knows maybe he doesn't work after him you know after he played more minutes here but worth the shot ah not too much takeaway from Miami or Orlando I think I'm downgrading Jonathan Suggs back to or Jonathan Suggs Jalen Suggs to not super trustworthy it looked like the defensive stats were coming along and I don't want to read too much into this game because the magic got blitzed by the heat uh but it also doesn't seem like I mean we're in a situation now where Wendell Carter Junior is sort of probably points League relate is yeah on Carroll points League yes 9 cat yeah so Franz Wagner is the only nine cat guy I trust on the magic that's where we're at  not the other guys  went down and Paulo yeah sure points League side Suggs Man passed at this point false also pass for me  for the Josh Richardson's had a couple of decent games in a row Off the Bench but I'm not doing anything with it same story for Jaime KES who had a decent game here also not doing anything there Jimmy Butler continues to rumble since coming back from his injury but for all intensive purposes the heater a team where you're playing the four name recognition guys Butler Rozier Hero at a bio move on  oh the Grizzlies good gracious all right so trade Jameson played 32 minutes at 12 and 7 with a couple of blocks I think you can get away with watch listing Him Luke Kennard should his body allow it and I've got to think that he's actually on the trade block for the Griz but maybe not maybe they want to keep him for when they're putting the pieces back together next year if Luke Kenard can get back up to 28 minutes or more I would add him  Santi aldama I'm holding on to I actually don't know why he only played 22 and a half minutes in this game but he had 11 4 and 5 with 33 pointers so it's actually a pretty good line even in 22 minutes I'd still expect Obama as he gets fully healthy to ramp that back up into the high 20s maybe if we get lucky load 30s but I don't want to guarantee anything on that front and again then you're just hoping for decent percentages because he can give you stuff in every counting category if he's playing you know 27 to 32 minutes of ball game 22 here and a half would not be useful long-term but I'm gonna give him a little bit longer GG Jackson's a no for me Jacob Gilyard is a no for me Vince Williams is a yes for me John conchar is a no unless I think honestly I think I need Luke Kennard back out again just to guarantee contract a few extra minutes but anyway  um David Roddy has been a know for a long time is Fantasy game is not very good  for the next Jalen Brunson heard his ankle late in this ballgame relatively late you can see you know some of these starters played 40 minutes Brunson only played 31 that was why if he's out we saw miles Deuce McBride put up some pretty good numbers last time Bronson had to miss a couple of ball games  again not using a weekly move on McBride but if you wanted to stream him in a league where you didn't have a weekly moves cap you could probably do that precious TOA is a start because he's playing 40 minutes to even chenzo's been crazy and his run lately Josh Hart got his knee looked at late in this ball game hopefully he'll be good for the next one we'll see but he's all very much a start for the Knicks right now as well  kind of lightning rounding this one a little bit  oh well Dallas both stars played Luca was questionable and then got ruled in and ended up with 3518 and 9  oh boy Dallas could use a little bit of help around those two guys Kyrie had 36 he was awesome also  Tim Hardaway is a drop with those two guys healthy I don't care that he had 14 points and seven boards Tim Hardaway is not good enough when Kyrie and Luke are both playing Derek Jones Junior know Josh Green know I know he played 33 minutes he had two good games prior to this one but his Fantasy game just doesn't hold the weight in the nine Cat Side and he's a candidate to maybe get traded  Maxi kleber is somewhat interesting he didn't have a great ball game here because Luca took every rebound but Clement typically if he gets these full starters minutes he is nine cats startable and he's been playable basically over his last three two good ones and then this kind of quiet one  I'll be honest I don't know exactly when Derek Lively's coming back they've been kind of covert on that timeline but if Cleveland really is gonna start and get full starters minutes which he did here now basically three games in a row I would probably use it an ad on him on the Roto side again not spending weekly moves on short-term stuff in head-to-head right now don't do it gotta save those moves for tomorrow  Mikhail Bridges decent game Nicole Clarkston decent game Spencer did witty I've been calling him a drop for a month he might get traded somewhere where he could be useful but it does feel more like anybody trading for Dinwiddie is gonna use him as kind of like an around other bigger pieces kind of dude so I think didn't he's a straight drop Ben Simmons is an interesting one we kind of have to pause on as well he had nine nine and seven in 20 minutes he's playing fast and hard in his limited minutes right now which to me says okay fine Roto Adam sit him on your bench until his minutes get up to a higher number  had to head I don't know that you can play Simmons because he's gonna sit back to backs  and  he's gonna I mean I'm gonna be constantly worried that he's  gonna get hurt again which is all very much in play  and it's gonna take still even if he doesn't get hurt again while sitting back to back it's still feels like it's gonna take another week or two for him to get up to a number of minutes that you can say oh yes I can rely start this guy so I just I don't know how you start a guy who  you know even when he was playing well the first couple weeks this season he was still like sitting just outside the top 100  that's not a player you can hold in head-to-head if they're all so taking back-to-backs off  that's not good enough you can't get a you know he's got a four game week with the back-to-back top 100 guy  in a three-game week is often gonna get bested by a top one 25 guy in a Four game week and yes some of the Ben Simmons stuff is because of the free throws if you're punting that makes it a little bit of an easier decision  but that's where I'm at with him I think I'd be much more inclined to stash him in a place where you don't need to play everyone every day  campus I am continuing to call a cell very high when you can I like the eight boards and the eight assists that was kind of cool in this one the percentages are eventually going to obliterate him and they're doing it what is he something like  this is six for 16 here and four for 21 in the last one let's say 10 for 37 last two ball game I mean a little lose you a category by himself some weeks  which again like he's putting up these big popcorn numbers so you you have a shot to go out there and get a top 65 top 75 something like that top 80  if it works you do it so Neil Edison ball game  I expect him to get traded or certainly on the blocked or in Finney Smith who knows if he gets traded or comes back I'm hoping Dennis Smith Jr can end up on some of my teams but again that's going to require Spencer didn't we get out of the way and that hasn't happened yet nothing for you on the Timberwolves not much for you on Chicago other than you know one little footnote on this game I would assume Who Came Back Off the Bench again and had a quieter ballgame because Andre Drummond got the start in kind of a  like a goal line package for Chicago they went huge Drummond and vooch  is there starting front Court  as big front court but they could do it because the other side had go bare and cat so they could have vooch go chase cat around and drum and could deal with Gilbert closer to the paintballs had a wild comeback in this game  Kobe white vouched DeRozan just huge huge second halves in particular  someone was asking me I think in the chat room and I wanted to address it anyway should we pick up and stash under a drum and I don't think this is a repeatable lineup  for  the Chicago Bulls and I think we may have actually just had a trade everybody oh that's fun oh here we go let's finish up going over the box scores because we're almost done there and then we'll  talk about the next one because it's the Grizzlies unloading a player that wasn't really playing anyway so yeah you're not going to need to do a whole lot else with this but will break it down don't worry let's do the last of the box score here and then we'll we'll talk about the next one  where were we Okay Oklahoma City nothing Utah that we just talked a little bit about the Jazz you can see fontecchio with a little trade logo by his name there this is another one where different lineups had success for Utah so Kris Dunn saw some extra time and he had a monster Fantasy game keyonte George was playing well Walker Kessler has gotten a couple extra minutes in the last few ball games that's good to see  there isn't anybody that I'm picking up in just stashing on Utah because we've heard done could get moved we've heard Clarkson could get moved we've heard a Linux could get moved  which that would actually I think really helped Walker Kessler and John Collins a little bit if if a Linux got traded  right now you're still starting Sexton and Kessler and marketing and Colin sorry throw him into the mix as well every day right now for Utah because John Collins getting sentiments has completely woken up his Fantasy game  but you're not picking up Chris Dunn you're not picking update George because this phone you trade doesn't really change his path all that much if Clarkson gets traded that could kind of unleash George although I don't know that I want him fully Unleashed because then you get the sort of rookie guard stuff creeping back in  but yes count is kind of on your watch list right now if Clarkson gets traded but Kris Dunn doesn't that's also one where you can be like maybe that thing kind of creeps in but again save your moves until something happens  until something happens some of the chat room mentioned Taylor Hendricks being helped for the Jazz okay but unless they go into full blow it up mode this is a guy who's playing in the G league right now so he has more than one player to jump to get full NBA minutes today  I mean yes long-term yes but short-term  yeah it's still still ways off on that one and let's talk about the last game on the card then we'll pivot back to the trade that just went down Milwaukee loses again but they were down a bunch of players khris Middleton got hurt early there was no Dame there was no Brook Lopez so I wouldn't read too much into this one Malik Beasley is the very obvious add when big usage guys are down Bobby Portis is to play when Brooke Lopez is down so if Middleton has to miss any time I think I might consider a Beasley add just try to see if you can get three plus three pointers for a week or two or whatever it turns out to be  and then hopefully Brooke will be back so we don't have to worry about Port as much longer I know Jay Crowder all played 40 minutes here there was just a distinct like a body's for the bucks but Beasley's the one that you're looking at first or Portis already and then Beasley's sort of the next one in line there and for Phoenix you start to starters  that's an easy one  all right let's get back to the trade that just went down I want to make sure that I'm properly sharing that I also want to make sure that I can  tweet about it so people know that I'm talking about this trade so here you go let me read the trade out loud and then I'm going to mention that we're talking about it live on are the Memphis Grizzlies have traded Xavier Tillman to the Boston Celtics for two second round picks and this is a big Mighty ho hum of a trade this trade means nothing really um because Tillman wasn't really playing  did he even log a minute yesterday's game  no not one minute and yesterday's ball game for Xavier Tillman so we just talked about the Grizzlies what you saw yesterday the only thing that this changes is  you know like Trey Jameson will see a little bit more consistent playing time they really isn't many guys floating around that are going to come in and take all of Santee all Obama's minutes the Grizzlies are an absolute dumpster fire let's let's be clear but Tillman wasn't playing anyway they were putting him on Ice basically for this moment because he was gonna be a restricted free agent I don't think they wanted to pay him and you know now they don't have to worry about it so easy peasy lemon squeezy Xavier Tillman is gone he will be doing very little for the Boston Celtics he is basically big man Insurance in case for zingus gets hurt and or Horford gets hurt because the Boston big men are a little bit on the brittle side slash old but as far as the Grizzlies go you know you're getting to see it all ready everybody's getting a chance which is kind of annoying because that whites us down to right now Vince Williams is kind of like the only guy you're like yeah that guy gets to play every day  again like I just said Luke Kennard if he can get up near 30 minutes he's be someone I'd play I felt Dominick can get up near near the high 20s he's someone that I would play and I'm holding all dominant a few spots because again provided his percentages go back to what they were last year  he would actually be kind of interesting points threes boards assist steals blocks you just have to hope he doesn't kill you in field goal and free throw percent and then I'd like to see a little more out of Trey Jamison I'm not spending a weekly move on him and frankly I don't think I'm spending a move on him on the Roto side either  I think we probably see some games of Jaron Jackson the next few weeks not all of them he'll get plenty of time off I don't know if Trey Jamison is even on a guaranteed contract yet so this could just vanish overnight  and that's why I would trust you know someone like an aldama a little bit more but keep an eye on the Grizzlies again not a whole lot to do as a result of this trade  other than for me just to kind of put it on the list I gotta update my trade board  yeah well you know what I asked for trades and I got trades and  I didn't get the trades I wanted but I got some trades that actually happened  I think we've basically talked about everybody today is there anything we didn't cover  oh like so listen in terms of what's gone on so far  ah tough road man Memphis is billion everybody 20 324 minutes again yeah here you go good call shining Knight make sure you don't have Tillman roster is the result of the straight he goes from being someone you definitely shouldn't have roster to someone you definitely shouldn't have rostered  anyway  all right if something crazy happens in the next few hours I might try to pop back on for a sort of a quick hitter show but it would have to be like a big name trade not more of these sort of little ones these happen to occur right around the time I was going to be doing this show anyway but like you know Deonte Murray if he gets moved I'll probably pop on and do a live show if not if it's all little stuff we'll save it up we'll have more to talk
