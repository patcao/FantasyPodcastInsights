welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast morning everybody I know we are a couple of quarters into the first game of the day but lucky for you guys those games have nothing to do with streaming today the Bucks and Sons  nothing to do with anything  why well because they're streaming today they're playing today neither one has a particularly good schedule after today  let's try this again shall we welcome to the show everybody there is a game going right now but luckily it does have anything to do with streaming stuff Phoenix playing Milwaukee as we speak Phoenix is off for two days after this one the Bucks are offered two days after this one as well so you won't add any of them for this game and you're not dropping them after  the rest of today however you do want to be a best of so quickly let's scroll through the board make sure we know what direction we're going what direction we're coming from and we'll go from there your worst schedules today which is the way we're going with this thing I like to start with the worst we'll work from there to the best we're schedule is the Charlotte Hornets and it's like it's not even close well I guess it's close because some teams are all so bad hornets have won game over six days starting today they're off today and tomorrow they play Tuesday and then they're off for three more days after that yikes the Lakers also another back into a terrible schedule they've got one game over five days as do the Oklahoma City Thunder one game over five days Thunder the worst of those two nobody's coming close to Charlotte's horrible schedule but the Thunder offer three days today tomorrow and Tuesday so as we look at these teams and there is sort of like a  third place like a distant third but they're still in there the Rockets the Pelicans the Knicks they've got one game over four days  probably you don't need to drop especially because the pals go into a four game week so not a huge problem there the Knicks actually played tomorrow so if you're gonna drop them you'd probably want to do it on Tuesday when they go into a slightly lighter schedule Rockets that would be one you might consider because they're only into a three-game week and if you have any fringy players on that club that would be the time to consider moving on from those dudes but really focusing on kind of the top ones there The Hornet schedule is just so bad that they're almost there's almost nobody on that team that you absolutely must hold through this next little stretch because it's a two-game week for them on top of everything else  legitimately I don't even know if you need to hold on to Miles Bridges who's generally been playable all season long aside you know there's like a one week stretch where he wasn't as great but like if you wanted to hold until Tuesday you could do that because then they have only one game over five days the rest of next week  that might be the way to do it you don't really get to front load all that much but if you're not desperate  for an extra games played today that would allow you to just basically say okay well next week I'm gonna get one out of the first two days and then I got to move on and the legitimately after Tuesday there's really nobody on the Hornets that you need to hang on to if it's your finals week if it's not your finals week you try to hang on to Miles Bridges but again nobody else not kidding not message not man not Miller nobody over those last five days is good enough to Warrant holding if your league comes to its conclusion and even if it doesn't I think you're you're talking about bridges and probably Miller are the only two that you try to find a way to sort of Wiggle through everybody else is in no  the Lakers in the Thunder neither one of these teams has many streamers so I don't think we have to worry about much but for the Lakers you'd think of somebody like a really hot Chmura but again you might as well just hold them through Monday and then drop for the three days off after that for the Thunder Lou Dort Josh giddey case and while these are guys that maybe got picked up at some point but their schedule hasn't been good before this so I'm guessing much like with the Lakers nobody really was going down that streaming path and then again if you really wanted to get into the the two the teeth of it Houston with two days off today and tomorrow if you really need to maximize things that would be a spot where you could maybe get off of well it certainly off of landale because he wasn't really worth exploring to begin with you're holding on a Freddie Van Vleet you're holding on to Jabari Smith Jr specially while he's playing center now Jalen Green's been oddly good but he's someone that I would consider moving off of in nine cat format other formats that's sort of a different story I'm in Thompson who we like a lot on the Roto side probably someone you could abandon ship on for the streaming side just for this sort of one game in four days stretch but again  the those last three teams I mentioned I don't know like  you what did I say Houston New Orleans New York Knicks there aren't that many  you can probably just  kind of roll through it  only there's a whole lot you need to do there  any who  so those are the worst schedules best schedules coming up right now are the Celtics who started five game in seven Knights stretch the Pistons who have six games in nine nights and then a pretty big drop off you got Miami on a back-to-back that also would go with three and four or four and six if you want to stretch it longer and then the Atlanta Hawks who just have the back-to-back  let's take a 10 second break here we'll drop in we'll let YouTube Drop in some ads and we will let our other partners drop in some ads and then we'll give you the names that you should be looking at with these best schedule scenario's that's what's coming up here in just a matter of seconds I'm realizing of course that YouTubers never got a chance to see the streaming calendar that was meant to go up there but  my child knocking me in the head with my poster board behind me and then making a bunch of noise and look I  have done so many shows over the years where my kid always popped into them and they're always adorable and all I asked was for a couple of seconds of like if you wanted to come say hi that's all fine just please don't like bang around behind that was it  that was it  feeling frustrated I want to do this show like two hours ago anyway my apologies to my child my apologies to all of you I got frustrated and you guys heard me  what was I think I growled anyway we'll do some editing for the folks that are hearing that after the fact YouTubers and Twitter viewers you guys got the full experience by the way those that are watching on the TV version of this please do follow me on social media at Dan visperas this is a hard time of year to maintain your following a lot of people like or to get some done with fantasy basketball I don't need to follow this guy anymore but I actually really do appreciate it this is a cool time for me to pick up a few folks that are just kind of tuning in at the end of the season trying to fight for their playoffs we're doing some stuff sort of having we're throwing try and some things here I've never done a streaming show like this every day the way we are but  we do our best  okay so quickly here let's go through some of the  the names that makes sense on the ads side those guys on the Celtics are not the regulars what you'd say it's Sam Houser and Payton Pritchard because with the Celtics playing two back-to-backs over seven days we're singing still isn't back you know for his gonna sit two of those five you can probably bet that Drew holiday basically all of the starters are probably gonna sit out of those five games because Celtics are way out in front of everybody else and record so you're gonna get at least 2 and probably more like four out of the five good games from Hauser and Pritchard  because the guys and if the Celtics last back-to-back is any indicator they rested half of their starters in one half of the back-to-back and the other half of their starters and the other one that was their portal and Utah now again that was a tougher one because it was flying into altitude and losing an hour but again they have nothing to push their guys for right now they can beat a lot of the teams they're playing with out two of their starters  and then Hauser and Pritchard get to just drop in and get that bump up so we're talking about probably four games of 25 to 30 minutes a piece for those guys and then maybe one game where they get their more typical like 15 to 20 minutes but that's fine effectively you're getting like four and a half games out of dudes that are very much sitting on the waiver wire over a seven-day span that's great  especially if they go big in any of them  for the Pistons probably roster already because they've had a good schedule pretty much throughout Simone from techie oh Isaiah Stewart are the two guys that are streamer level on the Pistons there if you guys that are above that there are a number of guys that are below it and if you really wanted to go kind of dumpster diving here if you can't get a Celtic or a piston then you go heat that's the next one Caleb Martin their rolling into a you know back to back and the front load next week which is nice and then you could hold through Wednesday or even Friday on Miami if you wanted to go that bar that's all so fine I met jacquez junior is on that board Duncan Robinson's likely already rostered because Heroes out indefinitely so Caleb and Jaime are probably the ones and the Hawks who have a back-to-back and nothing else  who nobody really you're not picking up crunchy who's gonna lose a bunch of minutes because Jalen Johnson is back you're not like Bruno Fernando is the closest thing you got but okay Clint Capel is basically revved up to normal minutes now so that's not really all that useful and forth you just have you know four or five guys that are all the time startable and then a massive drop off to anybody else  let's see what do we got here um but but I think that's basically it for today if you want to look a little bit farther down the line and we'll take that image off the screen I will now finally get the scheduling board up there because I biffed that early or well arguing with a youth there you go there's this scheduling board will make it bigger and I'll try to do a little bit of a scroll through here for folks that are watching while we talk about it but again if you want to look towards the future a little bit again I love the idea of going kind of Boston or Detroit right now because that sets you up for most of next week without having to use a move next week but if you're stuck doing something at the beginning of next week Minnesota is a team that goes back to back to start the week but doesn't really have a good schedule after that what you'd be looking for if you were making your move on Monday instead of today and we'll do a streaming show tomorrow as well as it'll be sort of streaming on a weekly preview is you're looking for guys that give you three games over four days or more to start the week those teams are Utah because they're finishing up a five and seven and they're in some pretty significant tank mode Sacramento goes three times in four days to start next week again those watching can see me doing the scroll and that's it if you wanted to get four games in six days believe it or not your list actually gets a little bit better because if you teams have a back-to-back on sort of the tail end of that stretch of Friday Saturday back to back so that now includes Boston who we already talked about is a pickup today on top of the Sacramento Utah both those teams actually fit that mold Portland goes back into having four games in six days because they have a back-to-back on Friday Saturday and looking at probably have a lot of blazers rostered already and those are the teams that get added in so that would be what you're doing tomorrow if you have to make your moves a day ahead those are the the directions you'd look there but we'll get into more detail on that on tomorrow's episode thanks for watching everybody kept this one quick and not all that clean you oh boy get it together Dan thanks for hanging out with us every day again just trying to squeeze this thing in between other stuff on a Sunday morning good luck to
