welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast welcome to week 22 everybody you made it  maybe some of you might just be watching because it's happened at this point but those that are still rolling congratulations  you head-to-head Leaguers you're a crazy Bunch I'm in a couple of head leaks I have to I mean it's it's sort of comes with the territory you gotta be able to talk about them if you're gonna be a fan of analysts you kind of have to do them which probably should be a reasoning for me to get into a dynasty league but I still don't really talk about it so you know problem solved I guess on that front I'm Dan Bass Pros this is fantasy NBA today thanks as always for joining us everybody this is a sports ethos.com presentation  here's what's coming up on today's show the the quick version is we're going to be recapping all 30 teams  most recent ball game  provided they played any time in the last three nights which I think everybody did we will be doing a second show possibly immediately following the conclusion of this one depending on how timing works out today that's my goal but we'll see if it fits kind of depends on how long this show goes that show is going to be focused exclusively on head-to-head schedule analysis so make sure that you subscribe however you're taking in this content so that you get a little blue when that second show comes up this show is not gonna Focus that hard on schedules  and a lot of you guys are always like Dan what about you know what if this guy plays two games in this stretch that's not what I'm worried about right now the show is a little bit more geared towards Roto it's geared towards Head to Head leaders that are looking for someone you can basically hold for a while  or someone that's going to be giving you an intense bump in production potentially over a short term  or medium term or whatever it turns out to be but this show is about  is not as concerned with weekly moves  so if I talk about streaming on this episode it's gonna be about a guy that I think might be able to put up some big numbers things of that nature  hopefully that analysis makes sense let's go ahead and dive straight in because we got to talk about 30 teams and that tends to not happen all that fast starting on Sunday will work our way backwards through The Weeknd Phoenix at Milwaukee the Bucks were without Giannis antetokounmpo and they won anyway  luckily we have some teams as we go through this board that are pretty easy to handicap in Phoenix happens to be one of them because now that they have their main guys back you start the starters and that's it  Yusuf nurkic tapered off after hot start to the year which was kind of expected I don't think there was really ever a chance that he was going to keep up his early season Pace he's been fine but he's kind of now landed in that doesn't matter chunk number one 13  he's a real doesn't matter  but you can start him and Beale Grace now and Kevin Durant Devin Booker easy peasy wrap it up move on to the next thing  okay that  buck side okay so don't read too much into this Bobby Portis is monster game  eliminated me actually  in one of my League's I'm pretty pissed about that I may have a rant mid show when we get to the relevant parties Port is one of them I haven't to be playing against Bob Bobby Portis in both of my cash head-to-head leaks I did not have him as the guy that was going to knock my butt out but his massive field goal percent game was a huge difference maker and this is of course is because yanis was out khris Middleton came back and obviously if he's available you pick him up because specially if you honest is out he's gonna be doing a bunch he'll be doing enough even with the honest back as I've said from the beginning of this season he's a much larger headache than he's worth but we're so close to the end now that kind of who cares so you you go get him in Roto go get him in whatever format you can bother with now the problem of course is that they have a back-to-back and I said we're going to talk much about schedule analysis but this is probably a two-game week for Middleton so if you're in your head playoffs that's probably not gonna work otherwise it'll be fine  otherwise  Malik Beasley still got 11 shots up in this one that's gonna try to down when Giannis and Middleton or both in there so he will probably he'll probably end up being a schedule type guy but bucks don't have a particularly good schedule for a couple of weeks yet so Beasley a big arrow down Jae Crowder had a big ball game here but I truly don't care the real note to take away is if you honest is out you play Bobby Portis  and in this one they went big Brooke Lopez only got 18 minutes but up a big line in 18 minutes but Port has got so damn hot that they were just like you know Bobby you're the center for today  you're the captain now Miami was without Jimmy Butler in this ballgame we don't know for how long they managed to squeak past Detroit maybe this was a one game we can win without you against the Pistons kind of a ball game  it was the front end of a back-to-back they're in Philadelphia tonight so maybe Butler's back keep an eye on that if Jimmy's out  that elevates Jaime Hawkes Junior into streamable land  if Jimmy is in  then Duncan Robinson for Tyler hero remains basically the only reliable stream you could use their Caleb Martin is gonna be kind of teetering on the relatively closed bubble  and with Butler out he was probably on the right side of that cut line with Butler in he probably Trends a little bit more towards the outside of it you guys know my feelings this heat thing this Heat roster is Butler Rozier at a bio and hero and when Heroes out it turns into that fourth slot turns into Duncan Robinson but when two guys are out sometimes you get an extra couple of dudes that become fantasy playable Caleb Martin Jaime's both relatively close so when a usage guy goes out Beyond Tyler hero that's where sometimes you get two extra dudes that are playable I think Butler might be back  I feel like this was a rest game against Detroit but you know wait watch the news for later on today we're already getting info on who's in and who's out in a couple of spots he's questionable for tonight  that makes me think he's playing but only one way to find out that's the way to see  somebody Funko dealing with a great toe issue big toe hurts for Simone which is a shame because he's been filming in pretty damn well for us our Thompson  and obviously Detroit with a good schedule right now so this could be a real pain in the butt there they started a six game and nine nights stretch yesterday so the Hope was to hold all of these guys through Monday of next week if you're in Long streaming mode  if Funko gets ruled out for this ball game today you probably think about going some other direction and let me play he's playing well but I don't know about good enough in a three game week  Evan Fournier popped off  how I don't know what to say about that I mean he played well so like that's the the first thing he was shooting the ball well he was passing the ball or relatively well guys were hitting shots but he got a bunch of steals all so admittedly Miami without Butler offensively is pretty anemic  and I look at this and it's like okay well it wasn't because my Decay was out so anyways we played this ball game so where did 48 minutes come from largely Jaden ivy  with a smattering from Marcus Sasser  meaning there's really no guarantee that Fournier gets these minutes again  it is worth pointing out though that if fontecchio is out for this ball game we already know us our Thompson is out dealing with some long stuff there's a word that it might be asthma related either way hopefully he's not out for too much longer it's pretty crummy news on the Thompson front  if one is out  and Grimes is still out I think he's Quinn's get upgraded a question no he's out already  I have no idea  who Detroit's next powerful word up would be it might  I guess it's small forward but you know they rotate through it might be even born yet  so if you get news later on today that 48 is starting this ball game he's probably worth a one game drop in  and maybe it ends up being more than that I don't know of course if Thompson and fontech you'll come back at some point this week and we don't even know a funtech is going to miss a game yet but let's say they're out for this one and you pick up Fournier you may end up getting one game out of that and then having to get the hell out of the way so it's a very dicey play on the head-to-head side  this is a hell of a ballgame Dallas Denver Kyrie Irving with about a 20 foot Lefty hook shot to win it that was wild please go watch that that highlight if you haven't already there's really nothing to take away on the Denver side for Dallas Daniel Gafford was in foul trouble and still got up to 24 and a half minutes that's a good sign Maxi Cleburne played 20 Derek Lively got 23 so they went relatively large for stretches in this game because you know you'll get just a monster and Denver Frontline is relatively big not huge  what do we learn well Lucas back so Tim Hardaway Jr disappears quickly PJ Washington I've talked about this 100 times you guys know I really don't like playing guys on heaters because then the other shoe  drops and you get this series of just like gross ball games now at least he had 11 rebounds in a block in this one but bad PJ can be very upsetting so who am I playing Irving don't you and that's it it's a handful of guys PJ included  Lively maybe Derek Jones Junior maybe Dante eggs and these guys are all considerations when Dallas has a better schedule but they're on a 2 game week right now so  I know I mentioned I wasn't gonna talk too much about schedule stuff and I really I still don't want to focus on it too hard  um  obviously if you have Kyrie or Luca you're hanging on and frankly Dallas having games Tuesday Thursday makes that an easier decision I think for Gafford as well you hold through Thursday and if this is your finals week then obviously you can drop any of them after Thursday because they don't play anymore  do your finals week  cut ties with the best player in the NBA if they're scheduled is done  so  bug sweep it in here Toronto does not have a great schedule this week but I don't care because Gary Trent is putting up really nice number is Kelly Olynyk generally nice numbers it's foul issues in this ball game which once again held him back  game also ended early or late plays really good defense you're going Trent you're going Olynyk you're going to manual quickly who was just horrible shooting the basketball here and I still think you can probably roll with Bruce Brown it's not as it's not as much of a guarantee but with RJ Barrett out tending to Family Matters at a loss in the family pretty awful stuff uh but again with all the guys that are already out for Toronto I don't I kind of don't see how Bruce Brown doesn't have some kind of fantasy value  he probably falls in the doesn't matter club for Roto and then for head to head that makes him like a very good schedule play but their schedule isn't that good so yeah  if you absolutely pass positively had to move on I'd be okay with it it just feels to me like you probably have somebody worse on your team  then Bruce Brown  if you don't congratulations you have a very strong team  or Orlando hasn't had a fantasy note in well since when do Carter Jr came back from his injury like two months ago they legitimately haven't had a note since then Paolo had a good shooting game here typically appoints League dude France Wagner is a 9 cat guy  I feel like France is slowed a little bit after a hot start where where is he ranked now I haven't looked in a while know he's still hanging in there right around number 70  right around where he got drafted  I need to come up with a name for a guy that that finish like right at their 80P  it's not a win it's not a loss but it's also not really a neutral because  avoiding the loss is actually more important than getting a win on fantasy draft night so it's like  the world's smallest win  and generally pretty healthy so anyway all right let's not waste time on the magic there's boring Boston blew out the Wizards hit 24/3 pointers I think 17 of them 17 or 18 were in the first half  and then somehow got hurt he had 10 threes in this game before turning ankle in the third quarter  I mean a legitimately looked like Hauser might threaten the NBA record for three-pointers but he's been ruled out for tonight second half of their back-to-back Horford is out holidays out  Tatum is questionable sounds like Jalen Brown is questionable so I would expect Jailyn Brown to play in the second half of the back to back I would expect Tatum to sit but you know he never know  and then we got word just moments ago Kristoff poor singing his is back ladies and gentlemen  excellent news on that front so poor sinkus is back what did he miss week week and a half something like that  which means if you were thinking about going to Luke cornette route please allow me to gently steer you in another Direction Cornell that's not gonna put up numbers in this one not with ports and gets back he'll back him up and he'll play 18 minutes or something like that but that's not enough to rely on if you are if you're looking for sort of like  the one game  we call it a fantasy one night stand Payton Pritchard just had one he probably has another because he'll fill in for Drew holiday alongside Derek White  and that's probably as about as far as you go give that houses out now which is a real shame because Houser was a guy that I told everybody to pick up on yesterday's show because of the Celtics awesome awesome schedule and that now  after exploding for one game kind of falls on its face as far as Washington goes  they are  into a bit of a semi tank which is silly when you think about it because they lose anyway but  I don't want people to get caught up in that part of it like oh well why the Grizzlies why or why did the Wizards need to rest guys are already the worst  yeah it's really just about guys starting to get a little bit worn more than anything else because the main guys for the Wizards to have basically played in their games this year Ty's Joan's played 66 who's 65  pool 66 Bert 66  it's bad news by the way what a team that's been largely a healthy has been this bad but that's where you're at tyus Jones miss both halves of the back to back dealing with back spasms kuzma shoulder soreness which sounded more like a rest day and then Kula believe dealing with a right wrist issue he's a rook so if they're taking him out for a game that's probably a real injury  Washington does not have a great schedule this week but not the worst they go Tuesday Thursday Saturday they go on sort of this slightly lower traffic days for whatever that's worth and again we'll get more into this stuff on the on our afternoon show but like Tuesdays at 5 gamer Thursday 7 Saturday is a medium sized card  it's not that any day is particularly large this week though is any day have more than nine games I don't think so so it's not really a light in and dark kind of weak for scheduling  get doesn't really give these guys any advantage over everyone else because you're probably not in overflow mode basically what you need to be watching for here  is who's in and who's out the nice thing is the Wizards are not a good head-to-head team this week so you don't really have to be like oh my God oh my God oh my God how do I make the move what do I do because I don't know who's gonna be a Nunez can be out you can pretty much treat them as a well I gotta look for rest of season guys on this team and those guys right now are Jordan Poole obviously kuzma when he comes back who's been maybe I shouldn't say obviously because the number one oh six but that's startable in all formats he's not he hasn't been amazing because the percentage is continued to hurt but he's been more than good enough and he puts up the nice popcorn numbers tyus Jones calculus major Jordan Poole those guys are really obvious ones Corey kissed bird I think is holdable right now I know he was bad in this ball game but generally he's been pretty good lately giving the various injuries dennya is another guy you can probably hang on to lately  he's also been a little bit banged up but you know looking at  what do we look I guess we can look like the last month  Abdi has heard with his free throws but 15 and 3 with a steal and a 3-pointers pretty good Tice Jones has had a lower scoring month but like  generally those guys have been fine kiss for you can't really look at the whole month because the few games when the team was healthy he was coming off the bench and he wasn't startled when he started I'm good with a kiss for it start and same same general story for like the other main guys I talked about Rashawn Holmes is the question mark right now because he didn't play many minutes in this ball game last night just 19 of them and it wasn't like he was insignificant foul trouble the whole game they just went a different direction  I went Patrick Baldwin a little more Patrick Baldwin Center a little more Anthony Gill at Center just to try things out because they were getting smashed so I was like all right whatever I think I'm holding onto Holmes where I have him just to see how the next game or two goes and we don't sound like bagley's coming back anytime in the next couple of days so it gives us a little room to kind of watch and see and then make moves and then Justin champagne who had 14 and 8 with two steals  no a lot of that is because the Wizards had like four guys out  same story for Patrick Baldwin now if everybody's out again and then the next ball game and Patrick Baldwin's starting at power forward I would probably fire him up  do shot two for 11 and still had a good fantasy game he was blocking shots he was flying around  Japanese I'd be a little bit more concerned we saw this steals  I mean legitimately if anybody comes back I don't think I'd play either of those guys against the games cap but if it's the same group where there's one usage guy and it's Jordan Poole  can't hurt to try then  Brooklyn lost an overtime oops cam Thomas had a nice ball game Nick Claxton was fine Mikhail Bridges can't shoot but he was fine cam Johnson played all right off the bench actually 12 and 5 a steal a three-pointer I'd like to see a little bit more out of Cam  Dorian Finney Smith had four steals he played 37 minutes and obviously what we've always talked about with him is he needs about 34 ish minutes to hit fantasy value and he got to that in this one but over time did play a role and then Dennis Schroder is the one that I think well we're bouncing around a little bit here so here's what you're doing if you're using up guy against the games cap the ones that you can definitely start our camp Thomas because right now he's just gonna take 20 shots a game Bridges even though he's kind of killing you in some categories he's a start and Clacks to those three are the obvious yeses  the next rung down for me would be cam Johnson who I leaning towards yes against the game's cap but also he might be in that doesn't matter group and the next rung down is Dorian Finney Smith and Dennis Schroder who again Vinny Smith needs a crap ton of minutes because he's just not gonna take any shots with all these guys back and healthy the two cams are back now uh Intruder who can get you some points in some assists but oftentimes hurts you and stuff generally doesn't it many three pointers yes he did have two here he doesn't get many defensive stats although he did have two here but field goal percent  turnovers open gaps in nine cat game those things all tend to kind of add up on truder I know a lot of your like dance stop like if I'm punting even one of those things and he's a start yeah  but I don't know if you're punting those things  if you're hunting points in assists okay fine but if you're using him against the game's cap there is absolutely no guarantee that he posted top 100 line on any given night any sort of did here  turn over some field goal percent sank him a bit but you'll take 19 and 7 with some three Steals and blocks that kind of stuff you're not gonna complain about this particular line but I am saying that he's on the borderline  Webby went full Wendy in this ball game he'd be kind of quiet the last week or last like two-ish games but went quiet and this one he's trying to chase down Kawhi Leonard for the number six spot in fantasy right now how Wild is that  Trey Jones had a nice game in overtime Devin vassell had a pretty nice game in overtime  I think trade Jones is more of a doesn't matter range guy you know 112 to 140 kind of stuff play them don't play them I don't care  if you need what he does play him if you don't need what he does you don't keldon Johnson had 24 points but I very much don't care about that he's a schedule level guy as is Jeremy Sohan and that's it for saying Antonio  Atlanta  smashed the Clippers in the late game yesterday did not see this one coming but zdanowicz was hurt late in the Ballgame hopefully he'll be ready to go for Atlantis next one they are finishing up a good scheduling run and then they pivot into a very bad one starting tomorrow for the rest of this week  so  you know see what happens to night if you find out he's not playing tonight frankly if any of these Atlanta like non-star level guys are not playing tonight that gives them three days off before their next ball game and they would then kind of become an unplayable but nobody else is on the injury report at least not yet so bog on the one guy to monitor so you've got Jalen Johnson you've got Deonte Murray you've got Clint capela you got DeAndre Hunter and then again if he plays you've got zdanowicz and if he doesn't who cares nobody else is really stepping up for this team for the Clippers I think we can officially downgrade if it's a zubats into just schedule level if you want or I mean you can put them in the doesn't matter group I don't care but you're seeing enough Mason Plumlee enough Daniel theis and enough small ball lineups out of the Clippers that zubats not getting 30 minutes means he just isn't gonna get to daily fantasy value so you're back to just PG Kauai and Harden  all right that's about half the league before we get to the other half of the league a quick mid-show reminder to please find me on Twitter at Dan best person some of you a lot of

just my brain needs a respite after the hardcore basketball Deep dive but these guys have poured so many hours Joe oriko and his team like the depth that they go to in their stuff is  above and beyond plus you get the 250 ranked list from Joe the Oracle to 50 you get projections and the live draft tracker powered by ATC projections that's all over its Sports ethos.com  and we recommend Saturday  what do we got here all right the Cavaliers  Donovan Mitchell is out  broke his nose  we don't know how long we got ruled out for Monday's game pretty well in advance that's not a great sign but hopefully you get him back for it you know three games arrested the week  if Donovan Mitchell is out we've played this ball game before Harris Levert goes back to being useful again which he was in this last ball game George and yang gets a few extra shots Darius Garland gets a few extra shots Isaac akoro goes back to being playable all these guys that looked like they were about to Trend out Trend right back in  the problem is we don't know how long if this is like Oh Donna Mitchell just needs a day or two for the swelling to go down and he's back okay you know great but if there's more to it than that and he's going to miss two or three ball games then these guys become much more interesting grabs we don't know yet and we probably won't know until tomorrow or maybe even as late as Wednesday Houston's running small I did try to tell you guys that 25 minutes of jock landale wasn't going to be enough if that was the upper limit and he only got 17 here so you're running the starters minus Dillon Brooks who I still have one eye on  I do think there's a chance with sengun out Brooks takes enough shots daily to be fantasy playable I don't think it's happened yet but I can't completely write it out  Jalen green is on a heater which you guys know how I feel about riding guys on heaters generally I don't do it but  he tends to run it obscenely hot  and again with Shane out all these guys have sort of no choice but to do a bunch more so tomorrow Smith Jr Freddy man believed Jalen green I'm in Thompson all of these guys are being forced into larger roles which for efficiency might not be the best but for fantasy  ya chef's kiss  Portland sucks but there's still playing a couple of their main guys DeAndre Aiden  Anthony Simons were both in there for this one Simon's took one half of their last back-to-back off just something to keep in mind because they do have a back-to-back Friday Saturday of this week don't know if he's gonna play in both of those uh if Jeremy Grant happens to resurface you could play him as well and then everybody else on this team is scheduled level only yes including Delano Banton who had 28 points typically  roughs you up in percentages and doesn't get any defensive stats turns it over doesn't rebound or assist all that much happened to get a little bit more of those in this ball game  but yes I mean schedule level Banton Henderson Kamara maybe even Chris Walker he's more bored aligned than the other guys are all great for schedule plays and Portland has a pretty good schedule but against the game's cap yeah no  keep riding train Murphy on that Pelican side boy you don't have Valentino's is really fallen off the map you guys might recall that I was in fade yonas mode  at the beginning of this season and for about three and a half months I thought I was a complete idiot and now I don't feel like such an idiot anymore if it feels like the balance units thing is finally gone in the Direction Where We handicapped it it just took like three and a half months for them to be like you know what Zion at Center makes sense  is not like Larry Nance played a bunch in this ball game Jeremiah Robinson Earl was the backup point guard with Nance out or backup center excuse me and he got more minutes than JV because they were just spreading them out and running  and that keeps happening to Valentine's I think you got to hold on if you have him anywhere which I have been one place I traded for him because I just needed rebounds and field goal percent but I didn't draft him anywhere but I'm guessing some of you guys did draft him some places probably hang on a little bit longer  this is a bottoming out point for him and I think he'll probably come back a bit  herb Jones was also by the way out for this one don't know his exact timetable for return  that allowed Jose Alvarado to step into a few extra minutes  we move along Philly Beach Charlotte has a bunch of their guys back Brandon Miller got ejected early in this game so don't read too much into that it a lot of protons to play 31 minutes but he'd been doing very little prior to that  Trey man is a start Nick Richards is your super duper low end basically in the doesn't matter group Center I happened to think Grand William's is also probably in the doesn't matter chunk  he's been above that lately while he's been kind of running hot but everything always levels off as it does poker chefski's a watch list guy  miles Bridges start  vasilia midsection start Brandon Miller start now of course Charlotte has the worst schedule in the entire NBA and we'll talk more about that on our streaming show later today but in terms of guys that you'd use against your Roto games cap  Bridges and Miller obviously Mitch while Cody Martin is out Trey man I would say yes  and then you know great Nick Richards is if you're hunting rebounds and field goal percent Grant Williams is if you're hunting three-pointers basically but those guys are not  those are not all format yeses for Richard and William's those are more a little more specialisti and then for Philly they needed to play a bad team so this is a sort of a Get Right game I'm not picking up Nic Batum  Kyle Lowry is an assists and steals stream only so not games cap ready  Maxi and oubre are kind of the only Sixers that I'm trusting right now an Uber has been bad for the last few weeks mostly because his turnovers have been high and his percentages have been low but when he gets 16 shots and his playing 30 some odd minutes he tends to end up somewhere in the 65 to 75 range so just assume that the numbers will crawl their way back in that direction and then Paul Reed is the other one who only got 19 and a half minutes in this game still manage put up 11 and 8 with a block I continue to not really know why I have this sinking feeling this feeling of dread but this ballgame was a little bit of a taste of that dread because Mo Bamba played better I guess I was this assessment here  not entirely clear that that was true but Bamba just got more minutes for this game and that Force Paul reading to a smaller role but every time he gets 25 minutes he's a go  so technically he remains a yes  but he healed sadly as a drop  he got phased out pretty quick and favor of Kyle freaking Lowry  so did they needed a big booty point guard more than he needed his floor spacing score I guess  Brooklyn we talked about already Indiana they've got a nice schedule this week and good news for those who have been soft holding Aaron neesmith forever wink wink nod nod  because Aaron Smith is being forced to play a bunch of minutes and he's finally starting to get his rhythm back thank Heaven's  he's a start teaching McConnell is still a start I know it's seems insane but in 20 minutes of ball game he's rolling top 75 for almost a month now  a little bit less than that obviously the absence of Benedict mathura and has all of these guys uh but they just really like what McConnell's bringing with that high octane bench unit and he had one bad game mixed in there and then generally a whole bunch of decent ones and like two really good ones  so yeah TJ McConnell  fire em up man  Washington we talked about I mean look this is what Corey kispert did the previous ball game so if you watched the recent one you were like oh no he had nine cash stats in this anyway  for Chicago  my brain is exploding down Kobe white for the last couple of ball games he's questionable for this one it's sounds like he's getting closer but there wasn't really an ad anyway My Hope was that we'd see Andre Drummond get a spot start and then you could drop him in there but didn't happen  Chicago was also coming to the end of their good scheduling run today is sort of the end of it then they have two games over the next six days so  deal with that as far as you know Roto goes you guys know what to do with this team they've got five Rodeo ready guys one of them is currently out  move along okay see okay don't you see that nothing changes for this team Shea actually had a rare bad game don't expect that to happen again but they want anyway Shay chat Jalen Williams easy peasy on we go Memphis so here's one where I did not see this coming Desmond Bane came back and played 32 minutes in his return  where the did that come from  first game back 32 freaking minutes and he was a plus 11  so anyway obviously you should have Desmond Bane at this point I don't care that they only have a three game week the fact that they don't have a single back-to-back until April 5th is a really good sign he might get a game off in there I don't know cuz you know tank  but their opponents are pretty good  early this week Sacramento Golden State I think they'll play their usuals because they I feel like there's an Integrity thing happening there and then when they play other tanking teams they pulled the plug on some of these guys so San Antonio on Friday they'll probably pulled the plug on a couple of them  they've got Detroit like two weeks down the line that's another one where you'll probably see everybody get the game off and maybe there'll be some other ones mixed in there where guys get in get those days off but you really might see JJ and Bane in I don't know 70 to 80% of those games 80%  all right and what do you do well for one thing at least we have now two guys that we know you can play nightly when they're in JJ in vain  if Vince Williams happens to resurface he would be the third one that you're like yes I feel good about that  the rest of them it's hard for me to say I feel good about it because John conchar got pushed back to the bench with Desmond Bane coming back so contrary you don't have to worry about any more Canard is out for personal reasons so maybe that moves contract back into the starting five  I know throws hands in the air in disgust it's why for head to head  I don't see how you roster any of these fringy guys for Roto you can try to find the ones that like  so Kennard when he plays is is playable in Roto  Jake laravia has been putting up some decent steals numbers but 24 minutes isn't going to be enough for him I'll dama had a couple of better shooting games here and he played 39 minutes so I guess he's part of the like you're a guy I trust group but typically he hadn't been getting enough shots except when JJ was out maybe there's a thing happening here where having better players around makes aldama a little bit better but again I don't see how you I couldn't possibly convince myself to use him against the games cap if I don't know he's gonna get a dozen shots GG Jackson same issue  not a robust enough Fantasy game and now they're legitimate players around these guys so with Memphis you pretty much can only make these decisions like an hour or two before the ball game and that doesn't really help you and head-to-head because you have a moves limit and it doesn't really help you in Roto because a lot of them  are day before  Warriors beat the Lakers largely because the Lakers don't play defense and that's largely because Anthony Davis got elbowed in the eye and his I basically swelled shut near the end of the first quarter I believe  you got ruled out later in the ball game but he basically played the first quarter and was a plus six and then the Lakers were a minus 13 after he went out and I mean say what you would like LeBron had a massive ball game here but without anything Davis the Lakers cannot win  this game is gonna count as one that he played because he started it but I think the games and adds hasn't missed very many games this year but I'm pretty sure the Lakers have lost all of them except that one weird one where everybody rested in Boston and they wanted anyway they can't guard anybody  who's having a field day  so that's great for Fantasy stuff on the other side Steph Curry back he seems fine Klay Thompson had a good ballgame Draymond had a good ball game  but what do we do okay let's not get into too deep into the weeds first of all Brandon pajami I think you can drop I never played 35 minutes here that's good but in my eyes they're just sort of isn't enough stuff for him to do when all these other guys are healthy  also typically I think you'll see more Chris Paul  he was not a good fit for this particular game but he'll play more going forward and that's all so bad for pajam ski  Chris Paul you can use against the game's cap Klay and Steph I think you can use against the games Capo you can use against a game's cap we gets as a doesn't matter if you need some points and a couple of rebounds and a steel go for it if you don't don't  dream on similar thing he's a doesn't matter level guy if you need boards and assists go ahead if you don't don't  trace Jackson Davis still got 21 minutes here that's good all though again it helps when you're playing the Lakers team without Anthony Davis so even just Rim running and nobody was stopping him I don't think Jackson Davis is going to stay above the cut line  provided the Warrior's stay mostly healthy starting from like before this ball game  he happened to do just enough here I mean literally just enough if he goes for one block and two this game you probably call kind of a net negative but he got two so you know I the skin of his teeth I don't think he ends up being a guy you hang on to for the Lakers Anthony Davis is questionable for their ballgame tonight they've got Atlanta  he's a tough Atlanta went yesterday they got the LA back to back two days in a row and then the Lakers go back into three days off again  if Anthony Davis plays you know exactly what to do if he doesn't he could probably stream jaxson Hayes who likely then plays 25 to 30 minutes so he'll get you double digit rebounds I would assume provided he doesn't immediately fall out of the ball game you want to see the Lakers get fully demolished by Clint capela on the offensive glass have it  Minnesota nice little back-to-back to start the week they beat Utah handling here no Rudy gobert so that's notable Nas read and Minnesota now moves into a better scheduling spot so Anthony Edwards Rudy gobert nasri Mike Conley those are the guys that you're starting every day and we'll talk about some streamer level stuff on our later on our afternoon am I gonna go back to back maybe back to back level show Utah's one we got a pause for a second because they're they're moving pretty hard into a tank valuation these days but I don't know if it's sticks because it sounds like Lowry marketing might be trying to get back Johnny juzang he played pretty well here but is currently on the G league roster so we don't know if he's gonna even play in the next ball game  the Jazz you should feel comfortable with right now kante George Collin Sexton Walker Kessler  from this ball game if he plays in the next one John Collins Jordan Clarkson Already Got ruled out  but a lot of Clarkson's value was bumping up because marketing was out but now it feels like maybe marketing gets back before Clarkson  if no one comes back I would probably consider playing Kris Dunn because 2425 minutes is enough for him to put a pretty big dent into defensive stats on your whatever I mean if you don't need defensive stats obviously it's a different thing but much like the Grizzlies I don't know how you make a call on Utah until we get the final Health Report which  by the Rudy gobert as of like 10 minutes ago was it shoot around and Herb Jones practice so we might be getting those guys back just throwing in a little injury note  ogn and Obey That Elbow is not right try to come back probably too soon sounds like he's basically back out again so precious to chewa becomes much more interesting Nick schedule is not very good this week but I'll take three out of a chewa if Annie needs you know a couple games off  Isaiah hardenstein 28 minutes here that's the highest number for him in a month  if that's a sign of things to come you got to get him back on Ross's because I think while you know while he was playing 2023 minutes he needed to be dropped and he did he got dropped a bunch of spots but if he's back up into the high 20s that's a very different monster and one that definitely needs to be on your roster he playing Josh Hart that's an easy one  and yeah I mean just you know watch the end Adobe thing we know he's out for one  it's gonna help even chenzo as well by the way but true as the guy that's gonna get the biggest bump there  and then for Sacramento I mean this was like a what the hell happened they played great two games in a row and then the wheels came off  basically you know when Darren Fox is bad or sits the king's have a lot of trouble winning basketball games Keon Alice is a dramatically out playing Kevin herder these days if you need steals he would be your play and Sacramento does a good schedule but you're not using it against the games cap Harrison Barnes is doing a little bit more largely because Trey Lyles is out but I don't trust him as far as I can Chuck him  against the game's cap Fox monk sabonis those are the guys you're using against a game's cap right now and Keegan Murray sorry I left him out that first pass  and now we play The Weekly game of who didn't play over the weekend that Dan hasn't talked about yet doodle
