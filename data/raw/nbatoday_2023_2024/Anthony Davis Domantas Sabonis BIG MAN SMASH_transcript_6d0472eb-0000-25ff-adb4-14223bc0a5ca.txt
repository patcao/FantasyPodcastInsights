welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I'm  I honestly I don't  I'm in order to do with myself right now  both of my children  are not home  I think this is the first time  since December like  20th or something I mean it's been  it's been freaking forever  and I I get that starting a show like that makes it seem like I reset my children  which is not the case I honestly just felt horrible for them because if you guys have been listening to the show lately you know that my kids have been going through a stomach virus for the freaking ages  the violent part had been over for a while but the lingering after shocks hadn't  and you just you can't send a kid to school with that going on  when they're older you risk them becoming the kid where that thing happens and when they're younger like just don't get everywhere  so their home and their home and their home and I'm like I'm trying to get things done but  when their kids that need things in the Next Room and they're not super old  I get a podcast done and then  like everything else I was just trying to wedge in during little moments and then you have this  this sort of opposite side of it here where I know I'm not talking about basketball yet and you guys hate it when I talk about other stuff at the beginning of the show so whatever  do you guys ever have this happen to you where you now finally have a moment  and your body goes into full let down mode because that's what I'm feeling right in this moment like I know that I should be getting nuts and like anything can happen tomorrow they could both be sick again the sky could fall I should get everything I can done today while I have I don't know I handful of hours to do it but all my body wants to do is just like oh Dan don't you really want to just rest for a second because for the last I don't know how many days I've been trying to jam 1000 things into 45 minutes and that's  also exhausting  welcome to the show  my show opening celebration slash rant  this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation I am your host Dan visperas now a member of the bee leave podcast Network  fun piece of news for us I'm going to do a Twitter announcement about it at some point  I want to I want to make sure that I actually put my butt into that my whole butt not just a fraction of said butt  and that's another reason that I haven't like I've been able to do a proper announcement about that because I don't want to do it just like racing in the bedroom to get on the computer and race back off to figure out whatever  what's wrong with kid number two so that'll probably happen today I have  I have a wild hope that I'll be able to get a second show done this afternoon I have prep I've got to do for a play-by-play stuff  the list is 1,000 things long  I might get to three of them before I just straight up fall asleep  right onto the microphone  was there any big news in the NBA over the last little bit the answer is not really interestingly enough  nothing this morning no news has yet broken this morning there weren't really any large injuries last night Marcus Smart dealing with a finger thing that was sort of the biggest one we don't really have a follow-up on that so  to that end I will say to everyone please take a moment to like rate subscribe  it does matter every little thing that happens helps kind of snowball it welcome to those watching live on YouTube and on Twitter these days I'm trying to simulcast again we'll see how the hell it works  streamer had actually seems to indicate looking over on the side here  their comments coming from Twitter and from YouTube I don't I think I can put either of them on the board if I want I just have no idea if I can respond to them  we're figuring it out on the Fly because I got a freaking cardboard sheet as my backdrop I got an unmade bedroom on the other side of it this is high tech stuff high-tech  maybe I misusing that  Minnesota beat Orlando a blowout lovely way to start the evening this game was actually not like all the way over at the end of the third quarter  so you still got 33 34 35 minutes out of some of the starters thank goodness I guess because it could have been worse particularly on the Orlando side from Minnesota not a ton of surprises Jaden McDaniels continues to be like kind of the ultimate and I'm trying to think of a knot  the  house it a way to describe Jaden McDaniels in a non  or in a safe for work way  let's just leave it at I wish he would be even remotely close to this aggressive on a nightly basis  because he's a one-one-one guy one three one steal one block  problem is that he's kind of a one one one one one one one one guy like one steal one three one block one free throw one turnover one assist to rebounds like he just  he doesn't really do  normally if you see a guy who has a three a steal and a block they should be able to walk into fantasy value but they have to do some other stuff and sure he did in this ball game but that's not the norm unfortunately and I'm just gonna keep waiting until it is  no changes elsewhere you guys know my stance on almost all these guys Nas read is a stream while warm member of the stream while warm award I don't know why I decided to make it a silly sentence because now I have to say it every day Anthony Edwards left and came back you only played 26 minutes but it'll be fine don't don't look too much of that he'll be okay over on the Orlando side window Carter Jr back out again Cole Anthony actually tweaked a thigh the problem I think he's had at some point in his career before so hopefully he'll be okay quickly  in the short term  the magic do actually have a couple of fantasy things going on Jalen Suggs is not really one of them he's been just sort of consistently good again lately the center situation is one go get the start and got run off the court so they went to Moe Wagner who was scoring better it had 21 and 8 but that thing's back to what it was the last time Wendell Carter Junior was out which was Goga had the better path to Value as the starter who gets blocks and rebounds  but then you know one at every two or three ball games it flips completely and so Goga just can't clear the top 100 and Wagner typically didn't get all that close to that if you can catch them on the right night congratulations but it's kind of impossible  so if you're gonna stream somebody it's probably go even after looking at this ball game  I don't know that I'm doing either one people always say Dan well what are you actually gonna do here the answer is probably nothing markelle fultz I've basically moved on from he missed whatever it was two months they're working back in and credibly slowly I'm sure they loved him for him to play starters minutes I don't know how long it's gonna get there but I didn't get to be fast and unless a bunch of guys are still out when he gets back to start his level minutes I don't think Markle gets inside the top 100 least not this year  Caleb Houston is filling in for France Wagner he's fine he got 12 shots up which isn't bad and 8 points 7 boards a couple of three-pointers  not using a roto games cap play on him if you wanted to so I got to come up with a way of doing this faster and when I say this I mean I got to come up with a way of delineating  what is a head-to-head play versus a roto play versus a schedule play  because they're not all the same thing and I was trying to describe them a little bit I think on yesterday's show or maybe it's the one before that who knows  time is  swirling around my head and I have no idea which way is up so a rotop play in my mind  is just an expression I use for someone who's a start in all formats because I call them a roto play I'm not saying oh that means they're good in all nine categories because there's like two guys in the NBA that fit that mold when I say someone is a roto play it means I'm comfortable using them against a games cap meaning I think that this guy is going to be in the top 100 on a nightly basis or at least like over some link of time  each individual game might not be a top 100 play but you know over a week or two weeks or three weeks or whatever that person's a top 100 play  I had to head play as I should be using the term is someone who might have a weak point in their Fantasy game where in head-to-head leaks maybe it doesn't matter as much so maybe the weak point is one of the percentages because those fluctuate week to week so if somebody is a bad free throw shooter but just has an okay free throw shooting week then they don't really have that negative impact on your team that week  if you're if it's a guard who doesn't get steals that would be annoying on the Roto side but it's let's say you're punting steals in a head-to-head League that guy becomes more of a head-to-head play someone who might not be inside the top 100 nine cat but if you're hunting one category or if you're not worried about certain variants  that guy becomes so when you could use on the head to head side  a schedule play all so implies head-to-head  but not as much of a concern oh this person is going to put up top 100 numbers or this person is going to put up top 100 punt something numbers but in Stead you know maybe they're like a top 1314150 range dude which is not all that impressive but they've got three games in four nights  so three games in four nights at a top one 40 guy that's better than two games out of a top 100 guy in that same span or one game out of a top 75 guy in that span  so the schedule play is kind of that third rung down and that's more about streaming  that's the way I'm going to try to use those terms I'll try to refresh us on that as we go speaking of as we go let's go Sacramento Bee Detroit this game was closed for the first half and then not so close for the second half  Detroit is good for opposing teams  so bonus Giant game Keegan Murray Giant Game Malik monk Giant game Darren Fox like kind of a medium sized game but you're not gonna complain about it  Trails played 32 minutes off the bench in this one I don't think that he's an ad but you could certainly classify him as a schedule play now  this not to say like I don't like I could look up the king's schedule while we're going here I don't have them all saved in the back of my brain this is part of a back-to-back for Sacramento the they they're starting yesterday they go for in six days and then they have a bad schedule next week so it's not like this is a good spot I'm just saying like if you wanted to pick up Trey Lyles yesterday to get three games in four nights that would have been fine you're not using it against the Rodeo Games cap is not a guy that you're looking at using in head-to-head long term so this is where we can start to Define that the terminology a little bit he got those extra minutes because Harrison Barnes was garbage  and hopefully is gonna get moved at some point soon I mean maybe not  don't get excited about trellis because they move Barnes they're gonna bring somebody in that would take those minutes anyway  uh let's keep moving there's nothing really to see on the Sacramento side as far as Detroit goes this is game one without Cade Cunningham where we're looking to see who might get the initial burst the  I think the overall consensus was that Jayden ivy without the first crack at it and he did he took 17 shots to lead the team yesterday 20 2 points five board six assists two threes two steals those are all good numbers the problems for Ivy which you got a little bit of a taste of them here is field goal percent is going to be trouble free throw percent is going to be trouble turnovers are going to be trouble  and I would venture to Guess that on a night tonight basis you'll see more trouble in other things as well this is a ball game where the points  assists and steals were positive enough that it I think you could say successfully counterweighted the bad stuff but I also want to try to remind everybody of an old term I'm sure you've heard of it it's called the law of averages  we saw Jade and Ivy in a feature role last year that's not to say that he didn't get better season overseas because this field goal percent is 45 this year after was 42 last season  maybe that's something that sticks maybe that was also because he had Cade playing next to him  hard to say  last year you have a 16 points for boards five assists just less than a steel per ball game point two blocks  on 41 and a half percent shooting 75% of the free throw line and 3.2 turnovers per game last year he was not inside the top 100 in nine category leaks  if this is what he turns back into now with Cunningham house someone who's taking 1314 shots a game  points League he should be added everywhere or he probably should have been Ross or already everywhere because his problems tend to be that things that are D emphasized in a lot of points for mats not all of them but many of them  he's also operating slightly above last year's permanent Mark and Steals and blocks right now which could potentially come down we don't know for sure again there's a lot of variants there but you know it got off to sort of like a big block start and then over the last six games he has won  these things have a way of leveling out with  the expectations  I don't want to again I want to say it again I don't want to write off the possibility that he might have just gotten a little bit better because young guys do  but  I think it's all so worth noting that you know looking at last year  he Not only was he not a nine category guy but he frankly wasn't all that close to a nine category guy like he was outside the top 200 almost no matter how you slice the stats up last season  and it was basically this team that you're seeing for Detroit right now  they have all star Thompson  who they didn't have in their lives last year but then it was like a bunch of mishmash pieces  and Jayden and Ivy  so again points Lee's yes Roto games cap know I I can't do it I like I think he's gonna do more damage in the bad category he's gonna help in the good ones people like oh but 22 points and and six assists like that that helps a lot yeah it helps  but it doesn't help as much as some of the other stuff hurts  so  I know I'm gonna take some heat for this one but I don't feel bad about the take  it's part of being an analyst you're going to take heat for things that seem insane  he does all so certainly fit the bill as someone who would classify more as a head-to-head kind of guy like if you're punting turnovers or if you're punting one of the percentages he absolutely inches closer  but people are gonna be like oh damn you can't like your legs are not competitive if you don't have Jayden Ivy that's just not true  there might be a team in your league that's punting turnovers and field goal percent okay fine  does that mean that he has to be rostered know because if there isn't a team in your league that's punching two of the three what we sort of traditionally called the points League exclusion categories then he wouldn't make sense and in a Rollie wrote a leak he wouldn't make sense  so it's League dependent  as far as everybody else I'm not that worried about it because I've used the only one that you're looking at is like hey maybe this could work Alec works right now is exclusively like a points category only stream not points the points category Killian Hayes don't care bullying bogdanovich she's gonna get do a lot hopefully Jalen Duren stays upright and that's as far as you can throw that Pebble and just hope that cayde gets back quickly  is anybody surprised that the Blazers have actually gotten worse since DeAndre ayton got hurt and they kind of semi benched Malcolm Brogdon I'm not surprised  it'll get better the Knicks are playing really good basketball right now the ogn and Obi trade is one that kind of weirdly worked out on both sides we'll talk about Toronto in a minute  this game was over early so I don't want to take too much away from either team nothing about the Blazers changes in my eyes we call them free Simon's a cell hi when he got off to that crazy hot start this year he's now sliding to number 64 because he wasn't gonna hit 53 pointers a game  it is what it is like again the law of averages all of these things have eventually just shake out the right way  do a brief is interesting right now because Moses Brown had surgery and eaten is still out I know he didn't have a good ball game here but nobody did on the Blazers so you figure maybe they play a team that's not as skilled defensively as the Nicks you could probably drop breathe in there just because if he doesn't foul out he'll have to play 20 to 30 minutes in a regular ball game because there's just sort of nobody else I guess maybe that's not accurate  Ebu bhaji  played 27 minutes I guess there is one other player I just feels like wreath is the safer play he's not something I'm he's not someone I'm racing to pick up let's let's leave it at that I felt like we needed to mention his name you can mention his name as well they flip-flopped and bhaji started got the starting job I might reconsider but in this spot  again I I wouldn't use a reef game against a game cap on the Roto side  head-to-head you could probably get away with it  you know what screw it leave them all alone they're not very good  the fantasy wise they're certainly not there all NBA players so good but fantasy wise yeah  it's kind of amazing that anybody on the Knicks got over 31 minutes but then you got to remember it's Tom Thibodeau this game was basically a 30-point ball game throughout Julius Randle still managed 31 minutes because why the hell not  Quentin Grimes had 17 points Off the Bench I know they've been wanting to get him more playing time I wouldn't read too much into this Isaiah hardenstein rolling and an OB good on his new team Randall Brunson had down game but who cares Donte divincenzo and Josh Hart are the two names on the Knicks that you sort of have one side eye on Dante has been putting up really big per minute numbers  but we can't seem to get as minutes above about 25 which makes him kind of a tough sell as far as fantasy teams go and then Josh Hart you know he's always gonna do the rebounding thing but his minutes aren't safe and then the production isn't always safe so I again I think I'm pretty much leaving those guys alone  schedule plays schedule plays we have an opportunity again to use our new not new but more accurately  appropriated terminology  there's a little squeaky noise you guys just heard and I'm realizing it's because the side of my water mug is pressing up against the the pop filter on my microphone and you get this little squeeze and unfortunately by the time I get to the end of the show I'm not gonna remember the time stamp on this  and then I'm gonna forget to edit it out so I figured it was easier to just to explain what the weird noise was Memphis beat Dallas won 20 to 103 this was very much a  injured star Theory ballgame John got ruled out for the year he inspired his guys to go play hard and they did and Dallas came out and they were like this team doesn't have jar anymore their season is done we don't have to focus  that's the magic of the NBA there's really only two teams in the NBA you can actually play without any Focus  and The Grizzlies are not one of those two teams they're not good but they have enough on the team to beat you if you come in and you close your eyes  let's hope Marcus Smart is okay he was settling into well he's on a heater and that's definitely not gonna stick forever but his role is certainly gonna be bigger here with John Morant out for the season  Marcus marked definitely belongs on rosters because of that news  no JJ in this ball game so the starting lineup got a little bit of a shake up Luke Kennard and Vince Williams were the starting wings for the Grizzlies  and  I do think that some of that is worth watching  previously we saw Vince Williams get more playing time when John was out  if smart is healthy and JJ comes back I'm probably not picking up anybody else if JJJ misses any additional time I might consider a Vince Williams start on the head-to-head side  because there are you know a few holes in his Fantasy game and you might may or may not get a massive massive game out of it I don't think that I would use them on the Roto side Canard is the one that I wish would see more playing time it seems like they're trying to keep his minutes in check  which and some of that is a defensive thing some of that is just a body breakdown thing which makes it hard to say yeah you know this is a guy you might end up picking up  I don't think there's anybody else on the Grizzlies I really don't Vince Williams probably ends up being your closest  but you're probably just looking at smart  Jackson and then Desmond Bane who  we all we all thought was a cell high for a while but now he's gonna have to go do some heavy lifting the fear for the Grizzlies of course is that  they end up looking terrible at some point here soon and they will like this is the adrenaline game when nobody else in the NBA has any  and then they'll come back and  have none after it runs out and then they're going to get their butts kicked for a while hey guys were you worried about Kyrie Irving even when I told you not to be  yeah he's fine  what did it take a week of good ball games that was it  carries up to number 10 in nine category leagues now 24.5 boards five assists 2.73 is 1.4 steals half a block on 48.89 splits he is a majestically low turnover player he is like Kawhi Leonard very close to a 9 category guy  needs about 0.2 blocks  about  0.8 rebounds which probably won't happen  and about one percentage point from the field which frankly he might have two of those after one more ball game with the way he's going right now so he's on Kyrie's on her heater  unfortunately I mean this ball game is obviously were a huge pain in the butt with that freak injury do I Powell slamming into his foot and that was a downer luckily he is actually played when he's healthy so far this season and so we're good on that front the map's story I think is what happens to the wings now  does this game I thought was an example of how  when the stars are in especially if they're losing  the wings are going to disappear  so Derek Jones Junior not a good enough ball game here and it's just sort of Salvage it by having decent percentages in a block but not a good ball game you knew Tim Horton Hardy Junior wasn't going to be able to do stuff when both Kyrie and Luca are there because he needs shots to be successful  the only other name you're thinking about is Dante Exum who's been out for the last few ball games and we don't have an exact timeline on his return but he did a lot of his damage with field goal percent which again like you need to take shots for that to have a positive impact and I just don't know that they're going to be enough shots for these guys  the exam thing is annoying because it's hard to hold a fringe or player when they're hurt  he's questionable so like he very well could be back for the next ball game but the reason he's been a top 100 play for the last two or three weeks was because he's been shooting 60% from the field if that goes away is there enough to float his value I think the answer is no  I think ultimately all of these Dallas Fringe guys fall outside the top 100 as long as Kyrie and Luca are healthy and the third guy on that team the only third guy that I would think about wanting to roster would be Derek Lively but he's also hurt right now which also makes him a difficult hold in head-to-head leaks if you don't have an eel slot  so the maps are troubling right now they're a difficult team to work with  is the answer to just like drop all of those guys maybe I mean again you know your league better than I do if you need that roster slide if you need if you can't take those zeros then yeah  then yeah I mean you move on at that point but  if you can hold on to Lively I would still try to do it the other guys I don't think there's nearly as much upside and so I wouldn't be all that worried about it  Lakers and Raptors had a wild one 132 131 the internet was all a buzz because the Lakers got a whole bunch of free throws  this only happens when the Lakers take free throws  there were  people are acting like they were like 15 really weird calls the end of that ball game I think they were probably two that I thought were goofy the flagrant on a manual quickly was extremely odd it was an offensive foul he caught cam reddish in the face with an elbow  fan if you're a fan of Toronto you don't like that call whatever team it goes against the call you're not gonna like it but they've been calling that very consistently in the NBA the last two seasons if you catch a Defender with an inadvertent elbow it's an offensive file that's just the way it is I have no idea why it was a flagrant foul and they reviewed it they were like I think that they the Lakers broadcasted at least showed  one of the officials trying to explain it to quickly said oh like he led with the elbow forward instead of the ball coming across I watched the replay along with the rest of you it's seemed like he was just swinging the ball across and the elbow  caught reddish kind of like chicken winged him coming inward  it looked very inadvertent it didn't look like anything malicious I have no idea why that was a flagrant foul that's seemed  wacky wacky to me and then I'm trying to think of the other one  feel like it was like an out of bounds call that didn't matter I watched the end of it it was actually a pretty fun ball game until he got all controversial at the end both teams shot the crap out of it Raptors 56% Lakers 54 I will also comment though that  anybody that's yelling about this and then also yells  when  the media positions things as a Lakers Centric story has to sort of swallow the  weird pill there  and what I mean by this I don't want you guys to take offense to this thing I just mean like  we can't really have it both ways  are we annoyed  that ESPN features Lakers stuff as often as they do are we annoyed that ESPN makes their stories Lakers Centric  and if the Lakers get beat its Lakers lose as a post to other team wins  that's what they do because the Lakers get clicks  but then when this type of thing happens  the only time we ever talked about it  is when it's involving the Lakers  now this fourth quarter was a specialty large but there are plenty other games that happened in an NBA season where one team gets 15 20 more free throws than the other one nobody talks about it we only talk about it when it's the Lakers because then it's all the league is rigged blah blah blah  the league is not rigged this type of crap happens  it just so happens that whether this officiating crew was seeing things a particular way I'll try to do a better job of pointing out the next time that one team has like a 20 free throw Gap over the other fourth quarter yes was weird I am not denying that  but it's not cooked these types of things happen  their games where  but then again my point is basically if we're only gonna talk about this when it happens  we are feeding into the problem  if Twitter I need Twitter I need you all to go I need you all to go crazy the next time any team gets a 20 free throw advantage  but we're also proving the media is point is what I'm saying  we're proving the media's point they're saying look if you guys are only gonna talk about stuff when it's Lakers we're just gonna talk about Lakers  the reason they keep doing it is because people keep reading it  they're not stupid I promise and then they do it and then you talk about how annoying it is that they do it and so that's still us talking about it it's not there's nothing that you and I or any of us there's what you know a few thousand of us here that read sports ethos and listen to these podcasts we're not going to do anything exactly shining Knight  shining Knight self-fulfilling prophecy perfectly said it's a self-fulfilling prophecy I don't think there's anything we can do about it  but we just have to be okay with it at this point because if we want to get enraged when stuff happens involving the Lakers we can't be mad when they just keep Force feeding Lakers stuff to us  anyway most of this game was pretty fun I hope you guys got to watch it from the outset because it really went back and forth I don't think any team I don't believe either team led by more than 8 points the whole game that's crazy in the modern NBA considering everybody's just bombing in threes the whole night  and from a good news standpoint Scotty Barnes had a nice ball game Pascal siakam at a nice ball game manual quickly had a nice ball game Anthony Davis went huge LeBron had a good ball game  like we got some pretty good fantasy lines RJ Barrett  has returned to Canada and he's playing with a renewed purpose but guess who doesn't care Dan races his hand here's the thing guys go on hot runs you guys remember the first two weeks this year in RJ Barrett was inside the top 40 because he was shooting like 48% from downtown I actually had someone in the YouTube mention say can't guys just get better at shooting three-pointers  no  no  this actually when a guy's been in the NBA for a decade already so here's the thing if you want to play RJ Barrett while he's on a heater I'm not gonna stop you but there's zero chance I'm playing him in a roto games Kathleen  because he could come out and he could just take an absolute  what my kids have been making the last eight days on your percentages it could all go to hell and a heart in a heartbeat  I think he's going to be better here in Toronto that he wasn't a New York he's not gonna get yanked around in Toronto the way he did by Tom Thibodeau for one candida loves him  I get it  it's cool it's easy to root for one of your own wearing a Cal Bears hat right now although there's a current Cal bear that's been a little bit goofball but mostly we root for our own up and I think he probably enjoys playing in Toronto  so good you know it's sort of a fresh start kind of thing but do I think he's gonna just magically go from being like a top 180 nine cat guy to being a top 51 now  but I will say this about RJ  he was fringy and points leagues this year he's almost definitely going to be in all systems go points leagues guy because he's just gonna have enough to do the rest of the way  and Toronto moves the ball more than New York does so like he's just gonna be more involved he's gonna have more fun that matters for these guys I know it's like oh you're an NBA player who cares if you're no fun matters  I think the bigger story from this game  it at least from a fantasy standpoint is yakka Turtle got ruled out basically indefinitely yes yesterday we Yepi what if a fun way to start the day  I think the re-evaluation was too weaks but they said they didn't really have a firm timetable on it and so a lot of us myself included was like you know what I'm gonna pick up Chris Boucher see what happens then I  and sure enough  add a nowhere parachuting in dropping in from the rafters like Apollo Creed  except not wearing American flag trunks Thaddeus Young gets the start and 29 freaking minutes  if anybody says they saw that coming they are a liar and a thief  this is that young we're talking about here funny thing is I'm in I think pretty damn competitive fantasy basketball leagues even after last night he still didn't get picked up in any of them  not one  which is amazing  Toronto has no size at all with Jakob poodle hurt Chris Boucher is a string bean Thaddeus Young is strong but he's what six eight  six seven He's listed on the roster it'd probably six nine yeah me too  I'm 5'11 on an NBA roster  boom boom boom boom boom boom but the beauty part of that young and we've seen it here in the Twilight of his career which is lasting forever it's a very long and delicious Twilight is that he's a freaking Swiss army knife now he scores on a good field goal percent he boards he assists these days I mean that magically popped up in Chicago a few years ago and it's continued he's always been an amazing steals Guy one of the best deflections dudes in the NBA  so why are we also hesitant  I think the simple answer is that he's old as dirt  it's not as old as me I guess that's something but he's 35 so yeah he certainly been trending down he's been in the NBA since 2007  like this is a guy that's been in the NBA since  well I was I was out of undergrad by then but not by that much  but then  you kind of have to look at the individual moments with that young and this is to play our actually want to kind of focus on on today's show because it's  there in it there one all that much that happened yesterday we can just keep yelling about it  that young requires that we look at the game by games  because there's never going to be an extended stretch where he's putting up big fat numbers but as recently as last year in November there was a period where the Raptors were missing a couple of front Court players and Thad got tapped on the shoulder and said we need you to play almost starter's minutes for two weeks and dad said  all right coach let me get the Advil  and his numbers over those two weeks we're not eye-popping by any stretch  but they were useful  15 and 5 with three steals first game in that stretch six six and four with two steals in a block 12 and 8  no steals in that ball game 189 and 4 with four steals  12 8 and 5 with two steals  for six and four with two steals he also had 5000 that one so struggled a bit ten seven and three with a defensive stat  and then the Raptors got healthier  that was it one two three four five six seven games he was asked to play starters and close to starters man it's basically like what he did yesterday he was inside the top 100 he was like a top 80 top 90 kind of run  do we trust that he gets these minutes every game  well let's look at the competition  Chris Boucher  who got pushed around like a leaf by the Lakers front Court  sorry Chris Boucher your time is done  Anthony Davis LeBron James Christian would just picked him up moved him like a kid  that at least has a strength he wasn't gonna stop Anthony Davis nobody was but at least he had the strength to stick with some guys  johnte Porter who wasn't even actually in the Yahoo database yesterday  as not that one's no not once not happening  so I think the answer is actually kind of yeah  now it helped a little bit that Emmanuel quickly fouled out in 26 minutes he would have played a little bit more all though I would venture to Guess that those minutes maybe one or two come from Thad one or two come from Schroeder one or two come from Gary Trent  and does that play more then the dude's Chris Boucher or Dante Porter lose a couple of those minutes I don't think those guys earned any trust yesterday  I believe let me double check on this while we're talking about I believe the Raptors stay in Los Angeles yeah they're they're in La again tonight take on the Clippers who are also a very strong team  zubats big dude in the middle  and then you know Kawaii is not as not as much of a Bruiser as LeBron but he'll push you around a little bit then they go to Utah in a couple of days  the Jazz rotations are all out of whack from a head-to-head standpoint you're probably not picking up any of these guys because you've got two games over the next five days from the rodeo standpoint I'm actually okay with Roland that young here and just kind of seeing what develops because  I would argue that Anthony Davis at least over the next like two weeks is probably the toughest Center they're going to face Chris out for Singas is an equally difficult cover and taller than Anthony Davis but what did they gonna do there like I think it's gonna stick with Shay on him  no you probably have to throw somebody in there that can get low and annoy and disrupt and that ends up being that all so  any moves the basketball he's a ball mover those other two guys don't really know how to pass so I actually think as nuts and lunatic level stuff as this was  I think it actually continues  that 29 minutes I don't know about it it getting that high every single ball game but  25 26 very attainable  and if his stat profile holds over what we've seen basically the last two or three seasons this sort of old man  they call him fagot because he's passing now  or the attitude that's what I like to use for a long time  he can get you top 90 ish range stuff as a pickup which again like that's  if you can get it for a few weeks maybe two three weeks that's worth it  so all formats I say pick him up let's see what happens  why the hell not  for the Lakers D'Angelo Russell was driving angry yesterday he and a bunch of guys just kept getting into it all so left without talking to the media for the second game in a row it feels like he thinks he's about to be traded  and so he's  looking irritable and honestly it's probably a good time to hang on to him because if he gets moved someplace he'll likely get to do more than what's going on here I think he probably actually would have played more in this ball game if he wasn't playing so angry because he was making some kind of weird decisions  if Cam reddish has to miss time you probably see more Russell at that point I I fully don't understand what Darvin ham is doing with rotations on a game to game basis because Max Christie was a plus five below is a plus seven those guys barely got to play the bench was playing well Christian Wood did get more minutes because he's been playing well but then they went back to Victoria and Prince and cam reddish because like oh yeah we need defense in those guys really weren't I guess reddish played better yesterday but  it's really weird it's it almost feels like Darvin is so stuck  in a particular pattern and he can't get off of it  in any of event Tori and Prince's warming back up a little bit so you can stream him for threes if you need to Austin Reeves is in a brutal 3-point shooting slump so it's actually kind of a by low right now on Reeves  and then you know we'll see who's healthy for the next ball game if radishes back we know Ruiz getting closer that could mess things up and if D-Lo really is about to get traded I mean you could get him for pennies he is getting dropped in a lot of formats and he might end up on a team that gives him 25 to 32 minutes and says go get him tiger and then you get a top 60 guy for nothing  so hold on D'Angelo Russell Bi-Lo on Austin Reeves frankly you could buy low on Dlow I don't know that you need to I think one more game of him getting 16 minutes you could pick him up off the waiver wire Bi-Lo on Reeves Bi-Lo on Dlow  Christian Wood is a stream while warm guy right now Prince's a stream while warm guy I'm not interested in Camden reddish and  that's the story from yesterday  again I have high hopes of doing a second show this afternoon I haven't decided what it is I guess it's been long enough since Friday we could do another Buy Low everybody loves a good buy low and I just yelled two names at you  so maybe they'll be on it  hey before we get their check out our buddies at
