welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  it's by low time for week five on the Pod get yourself fired up to go make some deals and squeeze out some extra value welcome  one and all  to Fantasy NBA today I am your host Dan Vespers thanks as always for hanging out with us this was seemingly a pretty big hit last week so we're gonna do another Bi-Lo segment after we had a few that cashed in almost right away actually Brooke Lopez probably the largest of the names on last week's Buy Low list that rocketed up the board he's now number 38 in nine cat after sitting in the 90s last week that type of jump  well done usually happen in one week but we just knew because the field goal percent is now up to 45 instead of 39 the blocks have held steady the free-throw percent is up to 79% of in the low 70s and these little things even without a ton of extra usage we knew would shift bodies up the board and those are just the types of guys that were going to be looking for here on today's episode please before we dive into all the names on the list I think I have five of them including a couple of repeat offenders that we might even be able to get one of them cheaper one of them actually slightly more expensive before we dive into the names on today's board please everybody take just two seconds  to flick at that like button that subscribe button however you're taking in this podcast subscriptions goal a long long way so come on over hang out with us a bit more permanently  find me out social media at Dan best person d a n b e s b r i s or just Google search Dan from Sports ethos or Dan from hoop ball and you guys can find me just fine over there let's get to the names on the board here it is the buy low leak list for week five I know this sort of remedial PowerPoint presentation that you guys get to look at but at least the graphics are clear name number one is a repeat offender from last week it's Jaren Jackson Jr who showed a couple Signs of Life over the last week but overall his rank actually dropped Believe It or Not mostly because his field goal percent dropped  the other stuff held fairly steady week over week but his field goal percentage down to now 43.2%  his defensive stats have remained at half of what they were last year  half that's a big drop for someone whose value was fairly well tied up in defensive stats from last season JJ was at three blocks per game very very good one steal per game for a big man powerful word Center all so very good this year 1.6 blocks basically cut in half steals 0.5 almost exactly cut in half  field goal percent is down from 50 and a half to 43 as we mentioned which again I don't know that we can necessarily guarantee the field goal percent comes back because last year was the more anomalous number for him he had never been up in that Stratosphere while also being a guy who took a bunch of three-pointers so let's assume for arguments sake  that JJJ does not get his  field goal percent back up  I still think we can assume that the defensive stats loop around a little bit maybe not all the way to four per game this was sort of the like why would you draft someone like that in the first round who's values so heavily tied in one category  but even if it gets back to some fraction of it instead of a half or less which is what we're sitting on right now is almost right around 50% you've got to figure that those blocks and steals come up a little bit especially because his minutes are actually the biggest they've ever been  so even if the rate comes down the how many minutes how many opportunities he has on the floor comes up and it's also possible by the way that when John comes back this team might actually utilize him for what he's good at more maybe you don't need to take so many shots maybe you don't need to be more this volume guy and we may be seeing an instance of  it doesn't happen very often and usage does not equate to Value it almost always does 995 percent of the time but one out of every 10 one out every 15 or 20 players it's actually better when they're doing less and JJ may be turning out to be one of those guys so on the board his current nine cat season rank is around is in the 60s depending on what board you're looking at 64 on some 65 66 on others that's generally the range right now  I still think that if his defensive stats get back to some range around what we're hunting he can still get up into the second round and maybe we could even say if we want to say top 30 instead of top 24 that's all so probably Fair  the nice thing about JJ is because he didn't really make any progress over the last seven days you can probably get him for a little bit cheaper now  where last week we talked about picking him up for like a 30 to 35 range guy this week you could probably try throwing out someone maybe near 40  and it's gonna have to be a big name near forty Murray is at 40 one that's a big name near 40 Myles Turner at 43 is a similar player to JJ maybe you can try to flip one for the other if somebody's annoyed that Miles isn't getting maximum minutes right now  it may change your team make up a little bit but someone like an Alpine who scoring a lot of points but I don't think folks have really noticed that he and JJJ are scoring within like one point of each other Shen goon's advantage over Jaron Jackson is largely in the assists department but I don't think he's catching him in defensive stats anytime soon Nick Claxton who is gonna be a big-time defensive stats guy but he's gonna wear your free throw percent down maybe not a big enough name but someone you could consider someone like a Jalen Brunson who's working his way up the board he was a little bit of a by low recently but now he's kind of worked his way back into closer to where we assume he's gonna be maybe still a little bit below that Mark but these are some of the guys you can see in that range that that drive the name value in a way where it might be able to get you Jared Jackson Jr the other repeat name on the board and this one is a guy who actually got more expensive I wanted to put two names that I thought you could still maybe squeeze a couple of bucks out of jjj's the the sort of easier repeat offender and then Freddie Van Vliet is the other one who actually has moved up the board although his very poor shooting night yesterday in a loss of Golden State moved him back down a tiny bit so the numbers on your screen are actually not perfectly accurate he was 50 before last night when I was making up these panels for the show he's now 54 so you know what ever done changed things all that much he's at 38% shooting which we know is probably gonna come up to 39 or 40 but not change all that much everything else with Van Vleet parallels or even improves upon what he was doing in Toronto with the exception of one category it's the same thing we talked about last week  Steals and over the last seven days he hasn't really added any steals he still had only points six per ball game and sure we can assume that because the Rockets are playing more of a position based defense guys are not going to be gambling as much but Freddy does always been near the top of the league in deflections and that's the kind of thing that even a team that's going for more positional defense is still going to value by the way he's ranked 48 on the Yahoo board and he's 55th on the basketball monster board so again we can kind of average out the in between but Freddie Van Fleet basically since he's cleared 30 minutes in an NBA game which is like four or five years ago he's been more in the 1.7 to 1.9 steals range know early in his Toronto career he played 20 minutes he had 0.9 steals but even then you're looking at a rate that was more like one and a half to two steals per game and this year would be his lowest since his very first season where he played eight minutes a game  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you

all locations  and if you're thinking Dan  maybe it's age  no I don't think so he's only 29 years old he's not past his prime yet even if you think he's maybe a year on the wrong side of it or whatever you're not gonna see this kind of erosion especially while he's posting career bests in assists right now and he's only taking one fewer one last shot per game then last year  career 40% shooter his shop profiles not all that different year over year I would expect to feel goal percent to tick up just the littlest bit and the Steels that's the big one and the you know again it doesn't seem like a really big deal but one extra steal already for Van Lee you're talking about an extra 12 on the season and that's enough to maybe when you two or three of your weekly matchups right now so this starts to compile it starts to add up over the whole year it's why these low volume stats like Steals and blocks  and even three pointers to some degree or one makes a really big difference doesn't sound like that much one sounds small but the difference between half a steel and one and a half steals from your guy that's multiple rounds of rank related value So for anybody still in that 50 range or a 47 to 60 range again depending on what board you're looking at I still think it should be pretty easy for him to get inside the top 40 once the steals come around maybe you could even hunt higher than that in terms of what do you think is final numbers going to look like and I think right now you could get him for an equally ranked player  so someone else in the late 40s to early 50s that maybe has you've seen settle in a way that we know Freddie doesn't settled yet the great leveling has not taken effect on him  now would I use the same type of guys as JJ know I don't think you needed to go as expensive with Van Fleet I think people value JJ Moore if they're selling him because and they drafted him probably inside the top 20 whereas van fleet was going you know mid to late 30s so right now honestly he's not even that far behind where he was getting drafted but I still think if you look at someone like a DeAndre ayton who's 45th or Jalen Johnson who's 44th these guys that we think might have some slippage over the next little bit even a Nickelback's new we just talked about all though you know he probably continues to work his way up the board as the minutes come around so perhaps that's not the best move  you're gonna need somebody who you think is level off click Appel is probably level off that's probably not enough to get it done Jalen Duren when he comes back if he posted giant rebounding game that might be one to look at Zach Levine there's almost no way he catches Van Vleet but there's a lot of name power there and he scores a lot there are a few names that I think could get it done I would be careful not to overpay you know Jane Lin Brunson he's on his way still on his way up we just talked about that so maybe not the best  pairing their Mark Williams in Charlotte is having a monster of a season maybe that's an interesting one to throw out there but people probably don't trust it if Tyler hero wasn't hurt he would have been actually a really good one to throw out there cam Thomas Wilde hurt might be a good one to throw out there cuz I don't think he shoots 48% on I volume for the year I think that probably turns into a number that hurts you but those are a couple of names we might be able to get for Freddie Van Lord to use to get Freddie Van Fleet  let's get into the new names now on today's show I got three new ones for you guys Jalen Williams of the Thunder is the First new name on the list he's currently ranked a 97 on the nine CAD board depending on what  site you're looking at 88th on basketball monster so somewhere between 88 and 100 is is sort of the consensus spot for Jalen Williams right now he was drafted around 55 or 60 and I still think that's the target for him because the beauty of Jalen Williams right now is that like Freddy Van Vleet everything is right where it needs to be except for one category and it's the same one as van Fleet  last year Jalen Williams over the entire season shot 52%  this year 52%  last year late in the season when he was posting gigantic numbers he was taking about 12 or 13 shots per game this year he's taking about 12ish shots per game  so you know the difference is there are minimal in fact when he was a top 30 play the second half of last year he was at 16 and a half points five boards four assists which again look at his numbers right now 17 and a half points four boards three and a half assists really not all that far off late last year when he was surging he was at 1.23 pointers he said 1.1 right now his percentages were 53 and 85 this year as we mentioned 52 and 88 the big difference again late last year he was at 2.2 combined defensive stats 1.8 Steals and point four blocks so far this year he's at one  that's the difference it's basically the only difference for him his turnovers are a little higher he's at one point seven late last year and he said over two this season but that's a small little blip that might even work itself out  it's the Steals and even a little bit the blocks  this is a guy who's playing more minutes this year he's doing more stuff the Steels are going to come around he's a terrific fantasy basketball player who is just not hitting his Mark so far because he's eighteen point eight steals which is like Freddy van Fleet almost a full steal lower than where he was during a big run late last year and I don't know that he's gonna get to 1.8 or 2 steals per game it's very hard to maintain numbers that high but I think we can safely assume he's gonna get into the low to mid ones so 1.2 to 1.5 somewhere in that neck of the woods were 13 games into the season it really only takes one or two bigger steals games run into a Russell Westbrook or something and get three or four steals  bingo bango you're back where you need to be in less than a week  I think he's a really easy Buy Low candidate because we know he's gonna slowly work his way up the board and he's been extremely productive even without the steels  so I still think he can get into the top 55 range where he was getting drafted and I think right now you might be able to get him for somebody with some name power around 70  who would that be potentially I wouldn't go for somebody who's sort of lagging in the 70s and the guys with big names there are maybe not the easiest to move I'll start Thompson is one that has a ton of Buzz because he got off to that crazy start but his defensive stats have been coming back down to where we kind of assumed that they would crazy crazy start D'Angelo Russell might get it done not after a very slow ball game which he had last time but after he puts up his next big one Kelvin Johnson's been scoring a lot that might get it done even though we know he's gonna like leave Peter out as the Spurs get healthy as just the world it takes its toll sorry one coughing fit per show is sort of where I'm at these days  what other names might get it done you could go farther up the board I guess I don't know that I would do like a like a Demar to me that feels like you're overpaying Zach LaVine these guys are all  in this this nebulous gross little Spurs land  Chris Paul is inside the top 60  some of that is because draymond's been out maybe that would get it done I mean it might be overpaying a tiny bit there  but Jalen Williams was gonna is gonna move forward  and I like us all to be a part of it when it happens  next name we're down to our last two Jared Allen which again this one feels like a pretty easy one because much like with Jalen Williams there's almost nothing that we actually need to fix with him  this this is these are the BIOS that are just like jumping off the page last year Jared Allen who like look he was fine last year he wasn't he wasn't a break the bank kind of guy but he put up top 40 numbers and how did he get there well last year he shot 64 and a half percent this year he's at 63 and a half percent is that different no not really last year he took three and a half free throws a game this year he's at five so he's been a bigger negative there without really changing much of his actual game profile is that likely to come back where it usually is  I would assume so you know he's not really been a five free throw guy before when Cleveland he was at four and then three and change I don't see a big reason why that should change much unless you just got a way better at getting fouled year over year which seems unlikely seals are a little low blocks are a little high right now those things will kind of one will come up one will come a little bit down maybe blocks could actually stay at one point four because he's done one point six before turnovers fine assists actually slightly better the issue for Jared Allen right now is he's not getting as many shots as usual and he's not getting as many rebounds as usual  but the reasons are pretty obvious  he's not getting the same minutes as usual because we were told to weeks ago he's on an indefinite minutes cap at some point indefinite typically becomes defined a definite minutes cap or  doesn't exist  at some point he's just going to get turned lows and we're really close to it right now because his last two games he's played 32 and a half minutes and 29 in a couple of wins for Cleveland a team that's been coming on not surprisingly since Jared Allen got healthy they've been better their defenses way better when he's out there people are like oh what if Evan Mobley just takes his job he does he's not gonna they like Mobly at the four they like Jared Allen at the five they like running a defense where they have sort of a backup rim protector at all times so no one's ever getting any easy shots against them  and so the last three games now his minutes per game is up around 30 instead of 27  does that mean the usage is going to go back up exactly where it was last year no that's not a guarantee but we are seeing Donovan Mitchell's missing games here and there Garrett Darius Garland's missing games here and there cameras Levert is missing games here and there there's a love of available for even a lower usage guy like Jared Allen to go out there and get you know eight shots per game instead of maybe we want him up at 9 but even if there's erosion that's the other part of this even if there's erosion he still shouldn't have any problem blowing past where he's out right now because right now his numbers are built on this low minutes that he's been getting  so I set my target for Jared Allen at top 65 or higher that feels like a pretty attainable number for him he's currently ranked 115 which is absurd  I think you could probably get Jared Allen for somebody in the 80 to 90 range I put 85 to 90 on the YouTube graphic but you maybe you have to go a tiny bit higher than that it's gonna have to be somebody with a little bit of name power as always that's the way you get things done on trades so who's in there that we don't think is going a ton higher Devin vassell a high scoring guy who I think is generally being overrated because of the scoring that probably gets it done  if Terry Rozier was healthy that would probably be a name that I throw out there France Vagner he's out he's right at 100 but people see the 18 and a half points per game and they like that type of stuff these are guys that I feel like if they're scoring they probably get it done  what I go is high as Kelvin Johnson yeah I think I would I think I would I know he's at 78 so baby that's just outside of our our buy range but I think I would do it Dennis Schroder in Roto I think I would give up I know he's at 16 points and seven assists those are hard to find but if you can afford to drop the assists you're gonna get a guy who likely blows past truder at some point this year Mitchell Robinson is not a terrible choice although he's also actually kind of on the way up so maybe you hold off and don't spend him on somebody if someone's annoyed with the annual gaffords minutes in Washington or if you're annoyed with his minutes that's a guy you might be able to throw out there any of the who doesn't have name power but he's been sort of safely in that 80 range so far this year a lot of options that could get you Jared Allen I think you take a shot see if you can get him  last name on the board for this week OG and a nobby I almost missed him when I was making up my list because I couldn't believe that he was down as far as he was he's ranked number 97  on some boards and on others he's 94  call it between 90 and 100 because all the boards are they like in that range everybody is so similar to this like it doesn't really matter the beauty of Ogden and Obey is like some of the other players we've talked about on this list we just don't need that many things to change for him to get back where he needs to be I don't think there's any chance he gets back where he was last year last year he was at 2.6 combined defensive stats in his career he'd never been above 2.2 before that this year he's at 1.9 but the other issues you're over year and this is the really silly one he's shooting 62% at the free throw line  I just see absolutely no reason why that number is going to hold  so I think I expect OG steals to come up because it's minutes have been kind of artificially low due to blowouts and an injury he missed a couple of games or earlier this week late last week  but the threes are where we need them to be there actually up a tiny bit field goal percent looks good rebounds a little bit down again that's just because he's been on the floor about three to four minutes less per game so far this season fine in fact they might end up good once his minutes get into the 3334 range the way we expect them to steals will creep up as the minutes creep up turn over his will too but you know who cares and then you're looking at basically replicating last year even if he doesn't get all the way up to 84% of the foul line which was anomalously high for him he's been more of a mid to high 70s guy since he settled into a starter's role that's still like 16% higher then where he's at right now  OG anunoby what is gonna take though somebody drafted him probably near 50  I think he gets into inside the top 65 without almost any problem at all moving two and a half three rounds from where he is here is super easy the free throws a loan would probably take care of that and then any growth in points rebounds or steals would push him higher I think you can get them for someone in the same range as basically what we just talked about  look at those guys that are in the 75 to 90 range that have some Buzz around their name  I detest Brandon Ingram's Fantasy game he's probably someone who takes up a little bit but I honestly I'd be trying to get out from Brandon Ingram because when that team is healthy he's not going to be a top 50 top 60 Guy this is what I yelled about all preseason long  see Drew holiday I was kind of low on this year and that Celtic spot maybe you could move off of him and switch him for a different guy who does similar stuff who all we just talked about Kelvin Johnson Deni avdija Kyle kuzma would be interesting he just had a what 12 assists ball game yesterday so his name is super busy right now couldn't even mute my mic in time to cover that cough up  oh geez a guy I think you should be moving on quickly and he's probably my favorite Bi-Lo on the board so I saved him for last because I wanted him to also be the graphic on today's show you guys probably noticed that he was all the graphic on today's show and he is our strongest by and all the last one on the list  we're not doing any questions on this remember the BIOS in the cell highs this is just info being thrown right in your face thank you so much for watching Everybody these are guys I think you can go get at a slight discount where there's still an opportunity to get value above what you're paying to acquire them that's the key for a Bi-Lo you never gonna get a name guy the way that we're talking about here you're never gonna get a name guy for what they're actually ranked in this moment you're going to have to pay a little above their current rank but hopefully creating a buffer between what you pay and where you think they ultimately end up that is how you pull off a Bi-Lo don't undershoot on these folks you're going to upset the person with them you gotta go with a name that you think really has a shot Peaks their interest and that's where they'll that they'll know you're serious take a moment again please like subscribe it goes a very long way find me on social you really got to do that that's maybe the most important part it's at Dan Bass Pros over on Twitter we do a whole lot of work on all of this stuff over there polls other buys other cells that sort of pop up quickly we'll hit all that stuff over on social media coming up in a couple hours later today
