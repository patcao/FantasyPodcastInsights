fantasy NBA Today is a Daily Show we run Monday through Friday during the season I know we've got more stuff going right now during the run-up to the NBA campaign but that is  a little bit different  at some point we'll have to go back to normal schedule right now it's it's all over the map  so today I thought I'd do something a little bit different  later on today we have another mock show breakdown with Dan Titus but this morning  I thought we'd do something that I've never really done before and that is drafting a team exclusively for fun  this team is not  attempting to be the best at any one particular category it's not  a team that's supposed to be super balanced this is a team that I think if you drafted these players in each of the first 10 Rounds you would have probably the most excitement as you watch them roll throughout the season  it's a weird exercise I know a lot of these guys are dudes that I wouldn't actually put on my normal fantasy team because I think they're being slightly overdrafted some of them are actually players that I kind of like and also happened to be exciting but we've done so many damn shows over the last month month and a half that I thought this one would be kind of a fun one especially because tomorrow Friday is going to be sort of the big one the coup de gras as it were that is the Dan bastard's old man Squad episode where we're going through the whole damn list from top to bottom it'll probably be a long one I'm going to try to keep analysis to a minimum on that show tomorrow but today we have a little more time because I think this one will be in the kind of 30 some odd minute range  if you're hanging out if you're deciding you want to watch live with us at some point along the way feel free to throw something in the chat room I know a couple of you were there so far but you usually as The Show Goes you kind of see folks began to show up  let's get things going this is officially the dance  all fun team strange thing to say I don't know if I've ever done it before  there it is  Dan's all fun team  first one on the board first round pick this one you guys probably could put the PCS together is Luka Duncan  look at is unquestionably the most fun player to draft in the first round if you're in a nine cat League where you're not punting specifically free throws because turnovers like they're bunch of guys in the first round that average three to four turnovers per game guys that are going in the first round that average three to four turnovers per game Luka Nicola yokich Joel embiid Kevin Durant Steph Curry Damian Lillard the list goes on and on and so that's not really the problem with Luca the problem is that not only do you have one  category that's  a negative but kind of washes out with the other high turnover first rounders you have a second one  he is the only player besides Giannis heinous of the only two players being drafted in the first round that have a negative impact of this magnitude in one category  the other one that's kind of an honorable mention is lamelo ball we don't really know what the field goal percent is going to settle on because it was a little higher than it was a little lower it's possible that he kind of becomes the third every other player going in the first round they have negatives but they're not that big they're medium at the largest  but overall from a fun standpoint it's hard to argue with the guy who averaged 32.4 points per game last year eight and a half rebounds 8 assists 1.4 steals Luca even got half a block last season 2.83 pointers he actually shot 50% from the field which is pretty good but that's not a thing we're looking at in pure excitement mode Lucas a guy who has the ball in his hands on almost every single possession and I don't know that anybody would argue with me on  frankly anyone else that could be the most exciting player in the first round nobody else does what he does in that combination of categories and maybe we should stop and clarify what makes someone the most exciting player in a round it's usually points League type value it's usually guys that score board and assist and Lucas got all of that in droves  in fact as I look at some of the other players across the first round  I'm not sure that anyone quite rolls up the combination and I get it you know it's harder to get assists than it is to get points it's harder to get rebounds than it is points so if you're just looking at sheer  power of the impact and those three categories I think Nicole yokich still kind of wins the day a little bit  but if you just adding them up  Lucas 32 plus 9 plus 8 basically  so we're going to go here 49 combined he is the most of anybody  at all  the meat is pretty close because it's scoring and rebounding are so high but his sister low you'll get to the points a little bit too low so they're just no one in the first round that does more in points boards and assists and that's why in my eyes he's the most exciting player going in the first round  the most exciting player going in the second round is Anthony Edwards and he's a guy like Luca that you probably won't see on that many of my fantasy teams because you know me I'm looking at Old I'm looking at boring I'm looking guys that are not going to hurt me in categories that a lot of people Overlook and Edwards like Luca has problems in the what you traditionally called the points League categories  last year he shot 46% on high volume from the field that was a negative 76% on medium volume at the free throw line that was a negative and had over three turnovers per game which again we talked about guys going in the first round that kind of coming out in the wash as you get into the second third fourth rounds those types of places big turnover guys do start to hurt you because the other people going in those rounds the players that you're opponents might be drafting are probably in the twos that's where you start to fall behind a little bit but with the expected step forward of Edwards and whatever capacity you think it's going to be last year he was at 24.6 points 5.8 rebounds 4.4 assists 1.6 deals and 0.7 blocks 2.73 pointers all of that counting stuff is really excellent you can see the points maybe take a small step forward I don't know that boards and assist are going to change all that much because dude played 36 minutes per game last year but this team does appear to be more and more his team in Minnesota and so a little step forward  who cares honestly if you're hunting for fun he's gonna be fun to watch because he can take over a basketball game he's a wild man other kind of honorable mentions for the second round Trey young is pretty exciting but we sort of seen it  which I know is sort of a weird reason to say someone is no longer exciting and that's probably your other option in round number two  round number three Victor wembanyama something changed on the board there I don't know what something swayed what did I what did I do why did the graphic switch up well done matter it's still looks right Victor when Yama in the third round is your all fun player he's right at the  technically by pre-rank we're going on Yahoo's pre-rank board he's right near the end at number 35 it is 80 p is in the mid-20s and after some of the games you put up during the preseason he's he's definitely going in the mid-20s to late 20s now  do I need to give you guys a reason why this one's going to be fun you get to watch one of the guys who will likely be among the finalists for rookie of the year he's going to put up crazy numbers in scoring boards and block shots we saw video of him nutmegging someone we saw him making a leaping know look past kind of behind him all falling out of bounds  he does all sorts of crazy things that seven foot four dude should not be able to do  promise that they're going to be some growing pains feel goal percent I don't think is going to be all that great all right thank you you're gonna see him run out of gas at certain points I think you're going to see turn over is pretty damn high for a center power forward whatever you want to call him on a basketball team and that's going to be the thing that weighs is overall value down but it's not going to be a lack of fun  I can't stop you guys and honestly like if someone drafts Victor in the third round it's not gonna be me but I am going to be jealous because while I'm diving in and gone okay who are the guys here I can squeeze a little value out of this someone's gonna take one b and they're gonna watch all of his games and they're gonna just be sitting there like rubbing their palms together  with whatever wild thing he's about to do because he's gonna have some absolutely eye-popping games this year of you know four or five six blocks and mid 20s and points and nine rebounds and probably a steal mixed in because like his arm stretched from one end of the court to the other so how could you not get a steal it's going to be nuts in between the mistakes and the low efficiency days it's going to be crazy  the run on Victory is going to be nuts to after this this preseason push he's been on so your third round most fun option Victor one banana and I don't think anybody's arguing with me on that one either  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat your friends turn on you you're forced to

locations  fourth round most fun option is Jordan Poole who also has a low floor and the thing about these exciting players is their exciting because they are high upside low floor guys and Jordan Poole probably personifies that better than the first three things because like really what is the floor for Luka doncic something in the teens or he basically always ends up year after year he was number 16 last year mostly because of free throws what's the floor for Anthony Edwards 40 where he was last year mostly because of his percentages and turnovers what's the floor for one but Yamaha per game it's pretty high actually I don't think it's floor is all that low even if the field goal percentage isn't that great he'll make up for it another stuff  but Jordan Poole is kind of your first very obvious could the bottom fall out kind of guy on this list and the answer is yeah  but at the same time we just saw him put up 40 in 27 minutes in their last game of the preseason yesterday  on Wednesday night  yeah dude put up 40 and it was pretty efficient too and so that's the thing with Jordan Poole like we all saw what happened last year he was in a warrior situation where he wasn't getting along with his teammates he scored 20 points per game he got 15 and a half shots per night so he was actually there but the steals were kind of low and more than anything else the turnovers were high and the field goal percent was a big time negative for him  this year a lot is riding on field goal percent  because the expectation is that he's gonna get 20 shots and I think that's actually  not that insane and scoring 25 points per game is all so not that insane for him this year but how he gets there is critical because if you're in a league where you are attacking field goal percent and you've got a guy taking 20 shots and shooting 43% that is a huge negative impact on your Club  Fair guys that you can compare it to I mean lamelo balls field goal percent last year is not that far off of that he shot 41% on 20 shots per ball game he got into the top 30 but he did it because he had six and a half rebounds and eight and a half assists per ball game as well as 1.6 defensive stats Jordan Poole is not a big rebounder he'll be fine in assist but he's not gonna be lamelo ball good he doesn't get that many defensive stats so  I mean this is obviously the reason why the Mellow ball is going at the end of the first round and pool is going in the fourth but that's  one of those things like what floats a guy falls percentage balls field goal percent was crap last year  by the way pool shoot a better free throw number than ball so that's an area he has an advantage but if you're trying to compare those two guys and say hey why is one dude this far above the other well it's because if the rest of their stuff doesn't look all that different the assistance and the rebounds will and the steals will  and that's that stuff matters  if you took the rebounds and the assists away from lamelo ball and you took the steals away from lamelo ball you have Jordan Clarkson I know people are like is that really possible could someone tumble that far yeah  collection just scored 21 points a game last year  two and a half three pointers so lamelo had a little bit of an edge there but four boards four and a half assists 0.7 combined defensive stats decent free throw number not great and high volume 44% from the field where was Clarkson ranked last season 184  because you have to be good at more than two things  if things break right for Jordan Poole in the sort of excitement Factor thing we're talking about here you get a game like last night where you scores 40 officially bombs in five six seven three-pointers whatever it is hit's a ton of free throws and then you've got three four-ish things that are all pretty big positive  let's keep moving fifth round all fun team is Chet Holmgren he's one of the all fun players that I actually kind of like just in general which I know goes against all the tenets of the Dan bass were sold man squad which I need a Rebrand I need a Rebrand on on that we call it the old man squad because a lot of guys are veterans on that team but it's not that everybody is 3637 years old it's typically guys that are undervalued for some reason sometimes it's because it's a stat set that people don't realize equates to Value sometimes it's because they've just been doing the same thing for five or six years in a row I like Chad Holmgren and he might end up on the Danvers old man squad you'll just have to watch that show tomorrow to find out  the reason is he like one banana  like Jaron Jackson Jr like Brooke Lopez like Myles Turner  these are guys these are bigs who helped you in percentages and get blocked shots  there's more that goes on they can score a little bit they can rebound a little bit but at the end of the day if you have a player who's good at blocking shots good to great even and a positive field goal percent guy but not a hard negative in free throw percent you have a big man who can rack up value and move up the board really really fast and homegood profiles as that fantasy stat set he's sort of oh Kristoff porzingis also falls into that bucket he's the next wave part of this next wave of unicorn basketball players where even a Bad season for Chet the floor is so incredibly High because he will have a decent field goal percent because he's giant he's gonna play near the room he has a good free throw percent because that's what he is he can block shots because he's very tall and has shot blocking ability and he'll get rebounds because he's gonna be the biggest dude on the floor in a lot of ball games tallest I should say dude on the floor  I don't care that he's probably not going to score as much as people expect he's probably more in the Brook Lopez range of 1516 points than he is in the JJJ of 19 or the personas of 20 plus last year  that's fine  if homegrown is Brooke Lopez from last year that was a top 25 guy  per game  will get to 2 1/2 blocks over an entire season that's asking a lot of young dude who still has the spindly body of a podcast host so yeah I think there will be some breakdowns he'll have to get some games off he might not play in 70 some odd games like some of these other players I've been discussing but again like I I don't think there's the floor is still high and it'll be fun  that's the point sixth round all fun team a fellow thunder player in Jalen Williams  sixth round was a hard one by the way to figure out who the fun player was there aren't that many guys between 61 and 72 that are both fun and it's like kind of useful so like Paolo Bank Carroll could be fun  but I felt too gross throwing them in the mix because like  someone that's might finish out the top one 50  same thing with Josh giddey  just not as  okay so Paulo I guess is sort of your honorable mention points League fun he's gonna put up numbers but he's gonna get there and kind of a weird way this to me was a hard round so I went Jalen Williams because I think he's gonna rack up a whole crap ton of peripheral stats and I know that's not the most fun thing for people but he's actually really good and I'm hoping that this Choice gets you guys to watch Jalen Williams can we just say that I think he's gonna have a really good fantasy season and even if this round didn't have that many fun options I think he's gonna be a fun one because he'll help you win seventh round Jalen Duren who just moved up the Yahoo board and we'll probably have to do a last show at some point here on the last Yahoo pre-rank board because they did just move some bodies around that might that might end up having to be over the weekend Jalen Duren who I think is extraordinarily fun and maybe I have a different definition of fun of the than the next guy but I find Jane Lin during fun  because of what he does to other people on a basketball court when they collide with him I find it hilarious it's like watching a car collide with a scooter  okay that's that's a little bit let's assume there was no one on them okay the car and the school are both being driven by by Crash Test Dummies or automated whatever  that's what Jalen Duren on a basketball court looks like  and he still such a young dude that's the part that really blows me away this is like think last year was one of the youngest players in the entire league  he's not even 20 yet  he'll be 21 months from yesterday  that dude was not barely 19 in his first NBA season and he just people just bounce off of him He's listed as 6/11 250 and it is just brick  I know we think of LeBron we think of Zion when we think of like the biggest strongest dudes  Jalen Duren doesn't have that same husk to his core he well he's taller so that maybe that stretches him out a little bit but he is  I think one of the strongest players in the NBA  like he's never gonna win a like pure  like girth wait  kind of rustling match with someone like a Steven Adams who's just bigger  but Jalandhar and has that type of strength just sub that type of strength and the athleticism of guys that leap out of the building like the Mitchell Robinson type of Leaping but with strength it's so in my eyes it's so fun to watch I beg of you guys please watch Jalen Duren watch some Pistons games and just watch what the people around him do when he goes up for a rebound  I feel like I'm watching a  like a synchronized swimming thing like the overhead view is all these bodies laying on top of Jalen Duren and he just bursts through from the middle and everybody else Falls backwards in this delightful swimming uh the and it you know looks like a flower blooming kind of thing that's what his strengths does believe me they're not trying to fall back he just goes up and they all go out  that to me is fun  it's a different kind of fun than Luca where you're just watching somebody pour in points all over and over again eighth round Jabari Smith Jr not a guy that I'm gonna have on a ton of my fantasy teams but a guy that I am interested in this year  because I think like as the term sleeper goes he probably falls into the could be category  let me explain myself because he wasn't very he wasn't at all on my sleepers list and he won't ever make my sleepers list for this year because I think there's two large of a chance that it fails but he is if you're looking for guys that are going later he's a Whopper upside guy with devastating downside all so if you look at Jabari Smith Jr stats from last year over this second half of the season that's where I really want to focus our time because he started to shoot the ball a little bit better you know the first half of the season was a cluster mess I think you're shooting like 38% after the first three months but it got better as the season went on not to the point where he was blowing the roof off the building but the last two months he was sitting just outside the top 100 which you know you've heard me talk a lot about how closely ranked all the guys are between about pick 85 and about pick 115 then there's kind of another drop off after that so he's in that mix meaning you know three four decent ball games and he isn't 110 he's 90 instead  over that stretch was 27 ball games he played final two months of the year he played 33 and a half minutes averaged almost 15 points almost eight rebounds point six steals about a block  he had won an F3 pointers and he did it on 44% shooting from the field and 79 at the free throw line  and this is a guy that we actually know can shoot a little bit and it just wasn't really clicking final one month of the Season let's go even tighter to the end of the year 34 minutes per game at number continuing to rise 15 and a half points basically the same usage still 8 rebounds  1.7 defensive stats and said of 1.5 probably because he just played a little bit more 46% from the field  if that Jabari Smith carries over into this year  or potentially steps a tiny bit farther forward maybe 46 becomes 47  maybe the 7879 percent free throws 80 or 81  those are the little things that you look for could 1.43 become one point six one point seven  could the efficiency boost his scoring from 15 and a half to 16 and a half  so what does that mean what if he became sick and a half 1.73  you know one point eight defensive stats 47 and 80 splits  he gets up into the 60s  so these are these little things you're looking for and now a guy going near 100  could he end up in the 50s and 60s  outside shot  will it be fun to watch and see yes so that's why he makes the all fun board even if again he's probably not one of the ones that ends up on my team by the way at the end of this show I'll tell you which of these 10 guys were going over at ones that could end up on my team probably figured it out already but whatever we'll do a little bit of a summary  number nine is scoot this was an easy call they all fun team has to have  maybe the most exciting rookie which is weird to say when you've got one banana and Chad Holmgren in the mix but just from a  there's something about watching shooting guard small forward size players on a basketball court they the mixture of speed of athleticism of shooting of passing of just having the ball in their hand and operating at that high octane  scoot is that guy  from this draft class at the very least because chat and when banana yeah they're gonna be unbelievably exciting they're gonna put up these crazy numbers you're going to see highlights here and there but scoots could be the guy that it could happen on every possession because as the year goes he's going to become more and more the guy in Portland  will the beginning of the year be difficult from a fantasy standpoint I think that's a pretty easy yes but as the season goes on he'll get better  and it'll be fun the whole way through because he's young and he's really really good and he's gonna get even better  and the 10th and final name on the list is Keegan Murray who got moved up today by the way in the last Yahoo board rearrangement he was going in the 130s they bumped him now into the one teens and in my eyes he was the most exciting player between 108 and 120 most of because the other guys in that mix are not all that exciting  and I don't honestly you know I don't know that Keegan is going to be super exciting to watch like he's still gonna be more of a cog for Sacramento but him taking a step forward is going to be good for him and I think people are going to feel good about themselves that they got on him at the right time because last season it was too soon and this year there's a chance to take a step forward  so you'll get a little bit more of everything as he continues to grow confidence in his the rest of his offensive game I know he's been doing some big stuff in the preseason I do think a lot of that shine comes off because in the regular season things are going to be a bit more fluid the main guys are gonna be there he's gonna be as part of that starting unit as a sort of like feature guy but I do think he's gonna have a good year and I think of the guys going between one oh nine I should say and one 20 he should be the most fun in there honorable mentions in that realm would be Trey Murphy the third but you'd have to stash him there and I don't know that that would be all that fun honorable mention in the previous round if you weren't going to go scoot would have probably been Austin Reeves as an interesting play there Zach Collins Jaden McDaniels also kind of fun players in that mix and that's probably your top 10 now in terms of guys that could end up on my fantasy team I think this is where things sort of diverged a little Dan building the all fun team versus the who can be fun and a guy that's a decent Draft Day value  you're probably looking at Chad Holmgren in the 5th as fun and value Jalen Williams in the sixth this fun and value Jalen Duren in the seventh as fun and value and Keegan Murray in the 10th as both fun and value on this list of the Dan's all fun team  weird little exercise today I know not list of guys that I'm necessarily going to draft but if you wanted to have a team where you looked at it at the end and you were like hell yeah that's gonna be a fun one to watch I think this would be that particular team  folks please do remember to like subscribe rate and review find me on social media I repeat it over and over and over again it's
