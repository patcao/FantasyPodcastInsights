welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast happening everybody it's a weekend quick hitter version here of fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation I'm Dan basis and we are exclusively talking weekend streaming to max out games played  I do want to do just 20 seconds here at the front end to say please do follow me on Twitter at Dan best person I know many of you end up watching this thing actually directly on Twitter so you can just click the follow button there if you're on YouTube please like And subscribe and if you're listening on a traditional Channel Please Subscribe and rate the podcast if you like all this stuff that we've been putting out all so for those on initiated this show is not about rest of season decisions this is about maximizing games played while all so streaming for more than a couple of days at a time in general it's about strategy to get the most games out of your playoff matchups or racing into your playoffs or whatever situation you might be in right now and I'm trying to do as many of these as humanly possible between now and debate you know the last couple of days of the regular season those that are watching get the Grid on your board does make it a little bit easier to follow along and the first thing I like to do is just a quick sweep up and down so everybody can see the color coding that I've added to this this is everybody's schedule in the NBA  first things first let's start with the worst schedule because the first thing you should be isolating this weekend as per usual is figuring out who on your team is droppable  the worst schedule is this week or weekend I guess but we do try to look sick 789 days out when we're making these decisions because sometimes you can stream for a week or more  or anti streaming abandoning ship on the really bad scheduling spots  there are I would argue kind of like a four-way tie there isn't any one team that's way worse than the others right now because teams like the Lakers who we've been talking about the Minnesota Timberwolves these teams have had bad schedules for the last five six days in a row they played tonight so you're not making a move on a team that has a game tonight yes the Lakers still only played two times over six days but it's game off game and then three days off again for La similarly with Minnesota they actually have one of the better schedules over the next four days before their schedule goes back to being extraordinarily light after that with two games over the next seven days after those four so yes those teams overall have light schedules right now and if you just looked at like oh which teams have you know bad Playoff schedules or something like that you'd see them they pop up all over it and Minnesota still in the middle of a two game week but actually in this smaller cross section not tiny four games their schedules actually a little bit better  at Minnesota is one of the teams that we were going to talk about that has that slightly better schedule  the  there's his not the Best Buy the way the better iterations Minnesota is like  so for best get I don't want to do best guys I want to worst first we're schedules it's basically all the same the Clippers the Bucks the Suns and the Raptors so again that is the Los Angeles Clippers the Milwaukee Bucks the Phoenix Suns and the Toronto Raptors  they have the worst schedules right now  but it's also worth mentioning their schedules are not that terrible  there are no schedules starting today that are I would argue worse than basically two games in six nights and most of the bad ones are more like one game over four nights  so for instance Milwaukee who had a really bad schedule yesterday one game in five days now it's one game over four days it's not like you're gonna move back in on them and you probably already dropped whatever fringy bucks you had yesterday so the hell with it the Clippers is probably the one where if you have a move left this is where you move on because they finished up a five and seven yesterday they go into a one in four today the Raptors are a two and six but you know it's one in four all of these teams were talking about that go one game over four days off today on tomorrow so they finish up the week with the game so you could hold through and then they start next week pretty slowly  basically two days off to start next week with for all of these teams that we just talked about so that's the big issue with these clubs is that you back load next week and if your playoffs continue that's something that you want to be thinking about but again a lot of these teams next week they go into a three gamer and there are three gamers for instance Phoenix and Toronto there are three gamer is is wedged between Wednesday and Saturday  so you could actually hold them through Saturday if you really needed to you don't have to abandon ship on these guys why am I making that point well someone like a Gary Trent just resurfaced yesterday and had a monster game three games out of Gary Trent not at that clip but a good clip is gonna be better than four games out of some other guys over the next  effectively weak because that's what it is if you held a Toronto Raptor for seven days right now you'd get you'd get three games out of them if you hold them for eight days you'd get four so it doesn't end up being all that bad  but here's the thing in terms of like if you got to win this week those are the four teams that have the worst schedules this week again it's the Clippers the Bucks the Suns and the Raptors they go for one game over four days a distant second place is the Oklahoma City Thunder I only bring them up because they go  one game over four days all so but it's today this is more of a look ahead after today the Thunder are off for three days so if you have any fringy players on that team would you probably don't because Ludo it's kind of the only one that ever ends up on a roster I guess Josh giddey might be but he's been a drop for so damn long those guys you should not be holding for three off days  what about the flip side of it who actually has a good schedule over the next little bit  sadly not many this is kind of a hard day for streaming and it's why we always talk about using a couple of moves kind of early in the week and then  you know you use a couple on typically Thursday because Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday you can get a three at in four kind of deal or Friday if you want to roll through the weekend at this point Saturday Sunday you should probably only have one move left so you either use it today or you save it for tomorrow you could save it for tomorrow to try to add one game to your Ledger and then maybe you can front load the following week if that ends up still kind of being part of your strategic initiative here  anyway getting to the point the good schedules over this next little stretch  three teams and it's not even that good  Brooklyn and Washington our head and shoulders above anybody else  in terms of whether or not a team has a good schedule  both of those teams have a weekend back-to-back Brooklyn auctions are the only two teams that have a weekend back-to-back and not that it's a huge deal but they also play Tuesday Thursday to start next week so you do get a three and four option you get a four in six option on those teams if you wanted to hold through that but you don't have to  they both go three times next week by the way each of those two teams Brooklyn and Washington goes Tuesday Thursday Saturday so you don't have to hold through it but you could if you really wanted to because you know starting next week with one game in the first two days is not the end of the world it's not great it's perfectly average  and two games over the first four days now you just starting to slip a little bit below  what you'd want to get out of a streamer you typically want to get two games the first three days of a week if you can so if you do pick up a net or a wizard  then you'd probably want to abandon ship either on Monday or Wednesday of next week I would suggest Wednesday just because you want to try to hold moves for an extra day or two if at all possible thing is Wizards probably got picked up on Thursday of this week because they were one of the teams that went three times over the final four days so they're probably aren't Wizards available that's however likely are available because they play just one time over the first five days this week  and that means that players on that on Brooklyn that are fringy may have gotten dropped into the waiver wire pool  let's take about a four second break here  so that YouTube and traditional pod channels nowhere to drop in an ad and then we'll come back and we'll give you the names that you can play this weekend and into next week  there you go  there you go  all right so we were talking about Brooklyn as the they are the preeminent  Club  by the way we just got some news Wizards news breaking right well we're on air that's kind of fun Brooklyn is the team you're probably looking at although now we we can add one other name to the list and that name is is on the Washington side should you because he's almost definitely not on rosters whose Dan talking about was this  secret name well I didn't get him on my list on this tweet that I put out first thing this morning but we can add him now so Dennis Smith Jr and Dorian finney-smith are probably the two Nets got dropped to the waiver wire if they were even added to begin with Dorian Finney Smith was almost definitely on rosters I don't expect these guys to do a lot but low 20s in minutes for Dennis Smith probably high 20s and minutes for Dorian Finney Smith you racked that up over a weekend back to back and it's more than you're going to get pretty much from anybody playing out there  because for Dennis Smith you're talking about probably 4243 minutes between the two ball games specially if anybody else gets a day off but between the two which we know we don't know but maybe and then Finney Smith is a starter who you know at a very worst is probably playing 24/25 minutes so you're looking at more like 50 minutes from Vinny Smith over the weekend and that's very much worth it because what he can do in 50 minutes which admittedly is not massive is gonna be better than what almost anyone else you pick up can do in I'm home how many 30 minute guys are on your waiver wire probably not many and the ones that are probably have a fantasy profile like or slightly worse than Finney Smith so pretend you're taking you know adorian Finney Smith type guy for one game versus adorian Finney Smith type guy for 50 minutes is that a 30 you want the one that's going 50  and it might not be a massive gain  but what I can promise you and I'm starting you're starting to see this because you're getting towards the end of the week I'm looking at some of the League's where I've been doing this power streaming stuff and long streaming and sort of combining this stuff and I'm looking at guys like you know jumaane Kamara who I've sat on for a bunch of games because Portland's had a really good schedule and it's like well each individual game he played felt kind of crummy but over a few games suddenly now you're looking at like oh let's see what did I get here I got 18 points I got 10 boards I got nine assists I got three steals I got two blocks over three games the scoring stinks I'll give you that but getting a steal and 2/3 of a block over three games instead of how many guys are gonna get that  how many guys that you're picking up we're gonna get you three steals two blocks nine assists over two games  not that many  yeah could I have probably found somebody out there who was scoring a bit better probably  but this is where running up the totals in games played ends up  tipping in your favor in the long run it doesn't work every time but it works more often than it doesn't and that's where you just again you continue to just sort of ADD and stack and add and stack  and that's why this method works even if you're getting the worst player you're getting them for so many more games that you end up out in front  Wizards names to of course look at oh I actually did get the wizard name on there look at me actually taking time to wedge it into a tweet the Wizards are Corey kispert bilali who you get these good these guys probably got picked up early in the week but the one that didn't is Rashawn Holmes who just moments ago got ruled available for Washington that's big news if you have a move Rashawn Holmes is a great direction to take it in today a great Direction what I don't know is if he's going to play both games of the back-to-back because he's coming back from a toe issue so we don't know but he was looking very good  and no Marvin Bagley and so they were actually giving Rashawn Holmes 25 to 30 minutes of ball game and this is kind of like an opportunity for him to resurrect his career and I feel like we're Sean knows it the other team that I didn't mention yet that also has an okay schedule as the Minnesota Timberwolves you know I talked about them very at the very beginning of this show but what they do here is they have one game this week but if you're going Timberwolf today you're doing it to front load next week because they are one of the rare teams that goes Monday Tuesday to start next week's action and think that I think they might actually be the only team that goes Monday Tuesday so that's a direction you'd go if  you had this week pretty well in hand  it's a bit lateral in terms of a move for this week because the other team member like the Clippers they all play one game the rest of this week but they go they don't have any games to start next week until Wednesday so you know over that four game span you're gaining two games but they're both next week so that's where you'd go to the Timberwolves if you've already locked up this week and you don't have to worry about it anymore but Rashawn Holmes very much the play of the morning since that news is breaking while we're on air we'll take over to social media to make sure everybody knows that as well and now a very quick look over at the chat room see if anybody else has questions about players pop it up Desmond Bane I not know do you yeah I mean so here's the thing like  first of all you got to wait to find out if he's being ruled in or not which we don't know yet he was out for their last ball game Memphis has been off for a couple of days so it's possible he squeezes back in there and it does seem like they're willing to play their better players against better opponents because they I think they know they're gonna lose anyway but even if you plays you're talking about 20 minutes so that's a move you're making again if you feel like you've got this week pretty well wrapped up Memphis does not have a back-to-back coming up for a while they're scheduled is very light but that also allows Desmond Bane to ramp up at his own pace without any off days so think about it from this perspective you're getting about 20 minutes probably out of Bane if he plays in this one they're in Sacramento on Monday that would be probably about 22 23 minutes for him  24 at Golden State maybe it levels off there in the midnight 20s at San Antonio  is that good enough the answer is probably  but it's not a it's not a guarantee it's not like picking a bane is going to be a League winner if you're League ends this week or next week if your league goes a little bit deeper and he starts to get back up towards like a normal volume of minutes the following week which is another three gamer for Memphis and I don't think he ever plays more than three games in a week because they're back to back some mixed in there now you're starting to get to a point where he becomes super valuable because high 20s and minutes over a three-game week he's very startled in that instance so I think if you're going the Bane route  you it's not for this week and it's only maybe a little bit for next week and hopefully that answers your question of how aggressive you should be there  should I drop Grayson Allen to pick up nickeil Alexander Walker for the first week of the  playoffs next week is is one of the questions  um you know again this is all about whether or not you have this week wrapped up because Phoenix is scheduled the rest of this week is bad one game and then they're off for two days to start next week and the I guess their schedules starting next week is not very good  I would try to hold Grace and he's generally good enough you know one game over four days is just this like you shouldn't drop anybody that has long-term appeal because then Phoenix goes right back into three games in four days situation  but if you're in a tight spot you know you're adding two games Over a Four game stretch and then you have to most likely jump off of nickeil Alexander Walker after that because that Minnesota has two games over seven days so just know that that's what you'd be getting into is Isaac okoro Luke Kennard a better play for Monday or Wednesday of next week I'd probably go Kinard because they don't have any off days so I'm guessing he plays in both of them and for Cleveland they've got guys coming back and I think a coro's job starts to trim as you hear my children yelling in the background and do a brief apparently is on Twitter now Corey Gisborne or Bilal khalily I prefer kispert unless you're exclusively attacking steals then you'd go below but because Corey typically has better percentages more threes more scoring probably similar assists again the one place he loses out is is steals that's my my thought had to head there  and that wrap it up here for this very quick Saturday show  hopefully you guys can continue to roll through do your very best and then take your hands off the wheel  go pick up her Sean Holmes I don't know if there's gonna be a show tomorrow the game starts so early there's almost no opportunity for me to get one in but we'll see who knows anything is possible it might be first thing in the morning like this one  I'm at the investors over on social media you guys know that actually just Twitter who my kidding at the investors on Twitter Sports ethos.com the website this is fantasy NBA today Saturday streaming Edition we'll see you guys later
