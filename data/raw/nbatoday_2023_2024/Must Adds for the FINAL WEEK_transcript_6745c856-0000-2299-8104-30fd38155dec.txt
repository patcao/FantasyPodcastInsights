welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast it's a very last Monday of the season  ladies and gentlemen we've made it  to the very last reverse chronological lightning round Monday of the 2023 2024 NBA campaign  deep breath everyone we're almost there there are no games tonight so you don't have to worry about that at least  there are all the games on Tuesday and  what is that Friday and Sunday or something like that I forget exactly how it shakes out but don't worry we'll have a weekly preview show coming up later on today that'll be kind of a quick one because it's going to be about how to break down your week and the week is basically Wednesday and Thursday because nobody plays on today nobody plays Saturday and everybody plays Sunday and Friday and almost everybody plays tomorrow  so that'll be an interesting show not  yep I am very contemporary with my references this is fantasy NBA Today everybody I'm Dan Bass Pros thanks for listening today every day all season long quick reminder that we do have shows Monday through Friday all off-season long as well we're gonna be going through Lessons Learned From a season gone by we're going to be breaking down the Dan Vespers old man squad from this year where we had hits where we had misses why perhaps if we could isolate that we're gonna do the same thing with Yahoo's board find out how close they got in general and what that means for how we draft going into next year as we kind of look at that and then all so trend lines for Yahoo's rankings over the seasons as they continue to get their information from different sources  different people doing the work that gets fed into Yahoo's engine  it's not consistent you're over year  sometimes I mean sometimes it is your over year but typically not over more of a longer haul because people just move analysts change places  it's not a it's not a algorithm somebody's punching these numbers in  well go through team by team how they performed this last year well do NBA draft prep will do free agency prep we'll talk some betting during the playoffs we have a lot of stuff coming up here over the next couple of months on fantasy NBA today and I hope you'll stick with us for that and to that end please do like and subscribe and if you have a moment please drop a five-star rating on the show I know I should have done all these asks earlier in the year when there were more of you watching or listening to the show because everybody that's watching and listening now is probably a long time listener but you know what I'm gonna throw it out there anyway please take a second to drop that five star review it really does mean a lot  let's talk about the weekend and frankly it's basically a Sunday review because everybody but four teams played yesterday but fear not those four teams played on Saturday so we don't even have to go back to Friday on this one yes indeed  my weekly adventure and who didn't play over the weekend  is a non Adventure on this show  Cavaliers led the Clippers by 20 something points in the middle of the third quarter they blew it they below it you blew it  Darius Garland said finally a decent ball game  it's been a huge disappointment this year Max cruises played well since coming back from his injury just he looks revitalized  Caris LeVert filling in for Donovan Mitchell in this ball game had a better one no surprise there and that's kind of the story on the Cavaliers side We're Not Gonna spend too much time on this stuff that doesn't require too much time because number one and this final week is total Silly Season time so a lot of it's just not gonna matter and secondly I want to make sure we're efficient here you guys don't need a 55 minute show when the key stuff to watch is largely going to be just who plays on night the night basis for the Clippers that player is not Kawhi Leonard right now he's finally dinged up it took them all season long to get there but overall a really nice year for Kawaii he's at 68 ball games I think they're hoping to have him back for you know one or two before the regular season ends but either way it's a win for him because most folks assumed he would barely crack 60 if that and he's got a shot to get pretty darn close to 70 if he can squeeze out another game or two  is there anybody that fills in for him not really know I mean you know Norman Powell gets a few extra shots but that ain't enough for him so it's just a lot of Paul George a decent amount of James Harden some of eats a zubats these days and that's basically as far as you go with the Clippers  nobody else is even remotely close to value  and for zubats it's really more of a big man stream we've talked about this before he goes in these stretches where he plays better for a week or two and that's a nice spot to roll him out in most formats but then it kind of levels off to more of a what we've been referring to as a doesn't matter range or a category stream they're kind of the same general range of player which is like 100 to 150 something in that neck of the woods I'm a Thompson got thrown out early for throwing Maxi Cleaver to the ground in this Houston Dallas overtime Adventure which opened up a whole bunch of shots  for Dillon Brooks and he actually made a lot of them in this ball game so you know kudos to you Dylan for not tanking somebody's percentages but again he's one player away still as we're seeing  there was I think fleeting hope that maybe we'd see a better Camp Whitmore game with almond Thompson gone nope but when Aman's back for the next one presumably then you just go with Thompson Jabari Smith Jr Freddy then Fleet and Jaylene green that is as far as you need to go  Dallas side Kyrie Luka not surprisingly went gigantic Daniel Gafford at 5 fouls and 16 minutes so they had to roll with a heavy dose of Maxie kleeba in this one and you're not gonna read too much that because foul trouble does foul trouble he thinks and Gafford will likely do more in the next one he was all very bad in the minutes he was on the court so they went a different direction  easy you know just switch it up try something new Gafford still the guy to have in the front Court there and there's really nobody else PJ Washington 14 and 13 and over time game he's been fine unspectacular  Percy what's PJ done over like the last oh call I don't know month with Dallas I feel like he's probably kind of all so in that doesn't matter range maybe slightly above it because he went through a heater in there yeah he's number 90 Sol PJ's just barely above the doesn't matter range because he's bad at both percentages but he's been able to float things with two threes 1.3 Steals and 1.1 blocks over that month and that's always kind of been the hope with him it's like oh can we get enough out of those categories and then he runs hot and cold and that's why for a really long time if you guys listen to all season long PJ was on our stream while hot board  which still is  it's not a past tense thing he's a guy you stream when he's hot over the last two weeks he's shooting 48% from the field on more shot attempts and so over that stretch he's like a top 50 but then he suddenly shoots 35% over a medium volume and the wheels come off real quick so  right now he's a yes he's been decent enough lately to get PJ into your lineups but it's going to be wildly up and down with him and it's so annoying because if you can't caught on the wrong week he can tank yeah and as far as Roto goes basically if you're attacking percentages in any way he's a no points leagues yes  and then I hope I think that pretty much made sense so we can keep going PJ Washington is like a soft yes right now because he's been good the last two weeks and just hope that the wheels don't come off before the season ends  Miami Lost Hero Rozier partway through to a sore neck hopefully that turns out to be okay in this particular game Caleb Martin picked up the pieces and Duncan Robinson was awful again I don't know what the hell's going on with him typically he's been a very safe stream  while Tyler hero was back for this ball game so I guess you could put a lot of it on that but Duncan did get the start and we've been talking about how you know when he starts he's been useful with hero back I think you can now pull the plug on Robinson but he wasn't very good coming back from injury even before hero returns so go Robinson or sorry go hero Butler bam and then when he's back to Rozier but I don't think that we if frozen misses a ball game I don't know that I would do anything with it they're just sort of Aren't Enough things to do left so just go with the big names in Miami Indy Myles Turner  TJ McConnell continues to be really really good in this just flamethrower bench role he's got right now see Yakima Halliburton were not very good in this ballgame but the team did enough around them to get the win but those two guys are starting Aaron Nesmith was better in this ball game but he's at the back end of the doesn't matter group  frankly I don't even know what categories you'd be hunting if you streamed him he's not scoring very much he's not really doing much of anything he's doing just a very small amount of a bunch of things and there are other guys doing that better right now  Sunda without Jalen Williams without Shea again in this one it was the Erin Wiggins show Mostly because he had six steals but Josh Gideon lewd been the safer feeling's for SGA and Jaylen Williams  Dort was not as good in this one but giddy had a triple double  and I think you could probably play both of them door is not a particularly exciting fantasy player you're mostly just hunting points in threes on that one so less exciting as a fill in play Gettys the guy that can get you a little bit more across the board and then hopefully she shows up again at some point because you know he's good I would like to get another game or two out of my rotor leaks before the season's over please oh please  I'm not picking up Wiggins I'm not picking up case in Wallace  yeah they're Giddy and then maybe Dort are kind of your two fill-ins there for Charlotte a little bit of an interesting development here Nick Richards was back but he came off the bench Behind grant Williams  and Grant Williams as the starting center is all systems go he's a play in every format because he's scoring more his rebounds were not very good because miles Bridges and Alexey poke chefski took a bunch of them but typically is rebounds are better when he's playing the center position the assists are pretty good he's kind of a point Center on this club  Brazilian it's just your regular point guard but they're kind of running stuff through Grant Williams at times and then he'll fall nose first into a steal or block every once in a blue moon but for Grant Williams if he's the center  and right now it kind of seems like he is because look at Nick Richards is back and he still not and he's still not playing starting center job and he got to go Grant he's a top 75 guy is the starting center and that's worth playing Trey man finally on a better ball game he went seven for seven shooting but he did have five turnovers you know he's  he's been outside even the doesn't matter category hunting group but if your category hunting you're typically looking for a few rebounds a few assists and basically a steal and then anything else would be kind of gravy although I would continue to argue that by and large there are better players out there that do the same kind of stuff  and then it's hitch who has all kinds of nine category holes but he's very good at getting assists that's where you're attacking their he's a category hunt as well  Pelicans got a big win over the Suns this is a this is a game for Western Conference playoff standings right now the pells are tied with the Suns after this Victory Suns had a chance to really push themselves up comfortably into the sixth spot with a two-game lead and instead well two game over the pals it would have been a  no not I think it would have been a two game lead over the king's two or at least one and a half  and instead New Orleans got him woke up at the right time big game out of Zion big game out of CJ  and they needed their guys to step up at a big big game out of Larry Nance Jr and poor yonis Valentine's four minutes in this game four  not for sure we could give them a look with  all the injuries that have gone down there but now Brandon Ingram is not that far away and like balancing this is just cooked man cooked  finally the handicap we had at the beginning of the year has truly come to roost Tremor fee herb Jones you can keep those guys rolling Dice and Daniels is a steals stream if you badly want them but and then Larry Nance know you know I'm gonna I love Larry Nance I love his Fantasy game but you can't rely on this happening night tonight so Zion CJ tray herb are your everyday starts and dice and is your steals attack  monster  Phoenix has their starters right now so you just play those guys that's an easy one we can keep on going Chicago they're down Alex Caruso for this one so that meant Andre Drummond got a few extra minutes that's always good for him Javonte green got the spots start and put up some really big numbers in 22 minutes but the 22 minutes is the thing I'm looking at and going yeah I don't think we're gonna walk this path again unless there unless like unless they just turn it over to him and say go ahead you got 35 minutes Caruso's out for a bit I'm not making that play Drummond is the one that you'd be looking at here because he was getting nine ten rebounds a game even before someone went down and so throw an extra minute or two his Direction and you're basically guaranteed 10 plus boards and I feel like but I even if he doesn't do much of anything else but look 20 some odd minutes for Drummond he'll get you a defensive stat probably more  hopefully the field goal percent will be decent you pray he doesn't go to the free-throw line just sort of catch it on the right moment but I think we can all use that combination of rebound steals blocks field goal percent  in some I mean I guess you know you might have a roto team where those stats are all fine and okay whatever but like most of us could use at least one of those things and so Drummond is likely a streamable play while Alex Caruso is out and he's pretty close to streamable as a category hunt guy even when the Bulls are healthy so one guy going down does indeed make the difference  France Wagner turned ankle in this ballgame I'm sure they'll just like to get him back before the playoffs start their pretty securely up in the not into play in I should say although the East is so bunched three through eight right now all separated by four games bucks a game up on the magic who are tied with the Knicks one half game ahead of the Cavaliers they're a game up on the Pacers who are game up on the Sixers who are a half game up on the heat so if guys can go on these teams I think you're gonna see them go but they also need to be sort of careful because you know a screw around and muck it up so Jalen Suggs is a go window Carter Jr is more of a points League Play points rebounds streamer if you're category hunting Franz you just hope he's he's up to the task and then Paulo is your points League option Jonathan Isaac also only played five minutes dealing with the sore back he'll never be healthy enough to be a true fan fantasy asset but will always keep one eye on him because 20 minutes is all it takes  but it won't pop  a simple water and away we go on this delightful Washington Toronto romp raptors have  enthusiastically won two games in a row Washington is still trotting Jordan Poole out there I just he's putting up colossal numbers now as is Deni avdija these are the sort of The Last Man Standing situation Corey kispert is a play while Kyle kuzma remains out  and I just and Patrick Baldwin had a nice ball game here but it's been kind of an alternating between Baldwin or Jared Butler or some or Tristan vukovich there's like  and  he had three blocks  I'm still hoping that Rashawn Holmes shows up for a game or two down the stretch I don't know if it's gonna happen what I'd like to see happen here with Washington in addition to Roshan Holmes coming back and playing a game is Jordan Poole sitting a few out because then I think we could roll Jared Butler into the mix but for now you go pool you go Abdi you go kissper  and I don't know that I have the stones to play any of these other dudes in if home stays out  you could probably play books of it and  like maybe pray for some rebounds and a block but you really don't know what you're getting there  frankly it's a little bit too risky for me  gradey dick got hurt partway through for the Raptors because at this point if there isn't one to two injuries in every ball game what do we even do it out there growing issue will see if he's playing done really matter for Fantasy RJ Barrett points League only and then you play quickly Olynyk and Trent in nine categories which which they very much did here I had a few of you that were like do I really need to hang on to kill you Linux blue yes you jerk faces  top 70 over the last month despite three and a half turnovers a game top 40 over the last two weeks  and 34th is the rank over the last one week  Kelly Olynyk with usage is a fantasy Behemoth last week is it 16/8 and 4 with over a steel a block 61% from the field of three pointer and 83% at the foul line  absolute monster  Portland not surprisingly got beat up by the Celtics DeAndre ayton and Elena are the two players I feel comfortable telling you to start  Jabari Walker is a rebounds stream kind of the Andre Drummond vane but with Outfield goal percent is an assist play knowing that he's likely going to light a stick of dynamite in your team's field goal percent and turnovers yowza I say no I say nay nay I say  Celtics played most of their regulars in this ball game I think Jayson Tatum if I'm recalling right yeah Tatum was the only regular they got the day off so that means you get a little more Al Horford but against a really bad team you were going to try to roll reserves as much as possible so if you're Celtic player  had an okay game before they pulled the plug on it about halfway through congratulations you survived the Celtics playing a Tango team  and now we sort of have that look ahead moment of okay well what's coming up for Boston yeah they do finally now have a back-to-back again which I know you're like wait a minute when they resting guys anyway yeah it's only gonna get worse  I got Milwaukee tomorrow not a back-to-back but then they play Thursday Friday on a back-to-back one of those two is a non overload day so you just pray yourself to play on Thursday and Friday but who knows  who knows there will be a Pritchard moment in there and a nice ball game in this one in the blow out there probably be a Sam Houser moment in there they might even be a Luke kornet moment in there but can't really do anything about it today you could but it'd be a little silly  Nick's beat the Bucks the Bucks are in free fall they've lost four games in a row and the next for the best team they've lost to and the poor New York Knicks are down all sorts of bodies right now but the Bucks have lost to the Wizards the Grizzlies the Raptors and the Nicks what are you doing up no I go into the playoffs hot the Bucks are the distinct opposite they're losing to everybody the worst of the worst and then  the Knicks also in a surprise twist ogn and Obey is back  for the next so you can go ahead and drop Myles McBride Deuce send him to the waiver wire Josh Hart Isaiah hartenstein  and an Obby Jalen Brunson Dante even chenzo those years starts right now as we wait to see if Mitchell Robinson can get his legs underneath them over this last week  the Assumption I would make is that no he probably doesn't have enough time to do it  for the Box khris Middleton couldn't make it through this ball game it's listed on basketball monster as mouth trauma  oh no  mouth trauma got mouths triggered  they're always gonna go easy on Middleton because he's built out of  paper straws at this point while he's out I would venture to say that Malik Beasley is probably going to do a tiny bit more Beasley's also been really bad lately when he goes cold he goes subarctic so your play is probably to just go Dame pour this will probably have an extra couple of shots Janice and Brooke Lopez I don't think I do Beesley unless you just exclusively need three pointers because that's the only thing you can almost certainly count on finally took down San Antonio without Joel embiid got this one off just resting the knee they need him more for the playoffs than they do for whatever these ball games are and Tyrese Maxey went maximum  Tyrese maximum me 52 points nice game Tyrese but two meta decent ball game but I don't care this was a double overtime game by the way bball Paul had 11 and 10 before fouling out  was nice of them it just go with sort of a traditional Paul Reed at Center lineup so that was useful but as minutes wouldn't have been this high without a bunch of extra playing time  anyway you don't have to worry about it and we will be back so you go Maxie you go in and beat you go obray you go to bias Harris when he comes back and then when Harris is back he take a long look to make sure that you break it actually hang on  Kelvin Johnson came back and then immediately got hurt again turned his ankle which it's like well whatever we obviously a go Trey Jones is a go and then the other name that I threw out their last week was Julie and champagne he was really doing some nice across the board stuff right now and yes he got extra points and extra rebounds and things of that thank you double overtime but he's been pretty good at you know he talked about early in the show Aaron neesmith doing a very little bit of many things champagne is doing a little bit more than that in many things they call him many champagne it's not even good for the year but here's the thing we don't need somebody to be good for the year we need somebody to be good for a minute  and champagne is top 40 over the last week 14 points 6 boards three assists 1.3 steals 1.7 blocks two three-pointers on 4878 splits with less than one turnover of all game and you know it's kind of repeatable because he's likely gonna get starter's minutes because everybody is out and I know what you're gonna ask next Dan what do I do with Malachi Branham and I will say if you need points and threes you can play them  but he's not gonna be inside the top 100 and 9 cat and points leaks you could probably drop him in there and hope for the best but he's not my cup of tea unless again you are really stat hunting hard on one or maybe just two categories where all so there's probably going to be some damage getting done also worth mentioning Devonte Graham played 35 minutes he was kind of a silly season hero last year so keep one eye on him but I ain't doing anything after this frankly the game wasn't good enough for me to jump at him anyway  Sacramento took care of Brooklyn fast Trey Lyles has been playing well he's rendered Harrison Barnes completely useless which I like I don't know why it took this long the king's re-signing errors in Barnes was still one of the stranger moves when you can take that money and go try to get I don't know  somebody that's not Harrison Barnes  and anyway this game was over early if your kings survived it congratulations because a number of them didn't need to play many minutes yeah on Ellis only had 19 minutes in the Ballgame Fox still managed to get up to 34 somehow and he can worry played 38 minutes  kind of weird but no you're not playing Trey lau's you're going to bonus you're going Murray you going Fox and I still think that Ellis is probably playable but he does lean a bit towards steals like defensive stats stream with some threes the way that he gets above the Mark is getting 30 minutes so again a little weird that he didn't hear but I went to line up so that they felt were working he was in one that wasn't and so they pivoted another way I mean Lyle's is a plus 37  on Mitchell was a plus 36 that's what happened here Davey on took Kenneth's minutes these two defense first guys and whichever ones playing better  and look like I think the other thing with Alice and I remained pretty high on him  I think he's a bit out of gas and he hadn't played significant NBA minutes and then all of a sudden was like all right you got to go full power on defense for 30 some odd minutes every night typically young guys can't do it old guys can't do it it's why they play at 85% for long stretches  if that  so I'm still holding Ellis on in spots where I need threes and Steals and blocks and a smattering of rebounds and assists but I you know I would get it if you're like yeah I'm not really attacking a few of those categories so I'll go another way  that's okay not gonna this is not the time of year for me to be chastising anyone for losing their patience because who cares we got a week left  Brooklyn I please just shut everybody down at this point it's time that we started to see it here Nick klaxon took this one off cam Johnson got this one off Dennis Smith Jr has been dealing with some pelvic stuff or hip or whatever it is so we yeah we finally got some new faces in the mix no clowning got 35 minutes he's someone to watch this day Ron Sharpe as someone to watch list  trying to Watford is someone to watch list  I'm a little surprised at Dennis Schroder didn't have enough fantasy value here with everybody out but he shot one for 12 and again just a bright neon shimmering exploding sign reminding you all the dentist Shooters Fantasy game stinks Camp Thomas and Mikhail bridges are the only two players in this lineup that I feel comfortable saying yeah you should go probably play them  but again the game was over early so the minutes were kind of cockamamie on top of everything else but let's just watch Brooklyn  uh you know again  so they're one of the rare teams that does not play tomorrow so you'd have to wait until Wednesday to get another data point on them but it's worth noting because if everybody gets shut down you might want to Pivot into some young dude playing for the first time ever on Friday and Sunday  sometimes those guys do better than the superstars in the last couple of games if a team is just like yeah we got no reason to play our guys right now  hey keonte George didn't shoot 22% for a game he didn't really do anything besides hit a bunch of shots but you know at least he didn't destroy your team  you die Johnny gang had 27 with 73 pointers and George had 25 and then the rest of the team was like I don't know where the hell they were calling Sexton was fine you can keep playing him  oh Mary had seven is a rebound field goal percent play but again he sort of like the lower fund version of that we've already talked about a few other guys that are better than him at that taeler Hendrix doesn't quite have the fantasy game to Warrant a spot by sensible with someone we were watch listing and he can stay on the watch list because Utah's really trying to lose heart  and they do a pretty damn good job of it they've lost 12 games in a row  that's the worst out of everybody congratulations Utah you went from 29 and 37 to 29 and 49  yucky  eew could they fall behind the Grizzlies and anything's possible  just have to keep losing  Jonathan kaminga back for the Warriors Ted 21 and 10 Off the Bench trayce Jackson Davis 167 and 4 Blocks he's still rolling along  Brandon ski filled in for Steph in this ball game  or Wiggins bending on which one up I guess Chris Paul technically filled in for Steph at whatever  so the Warrior's knew they had a freebie against the Jazz and they got a couple guys the day off no Wiggins no staff they'll at least one of those dudes will likely be back for the next ball game Dream On got hurt and they were like you know we don't really need you so don't read too much into this ball game plays a hold Chris Paul's a spot Play When a guard starter is out coming as a play trayce Jackson Davis is a play pajam ski is not even honestly a spot play for me because I don't trust him to do this again and then Draymond Green who actually been playing really well up until this point he's a guy you're playing so that's the quick and dirty on the Warriors  Minnesota no big surprises here Nas Reed really gobert Anthony Edwards all had pretty good games you're holding my Conley slo-mo is a boards assist steals specialist and he really only got you one of those things in this ball game so again doesn't matter range kind of guy category Hunter  and that's your story on the Wolves Lakers lost Anthony Davis at the end of the first quarter he got popped in the eye bye slo-mo actually Lakers were up four when he was left the ball game and they lost the rest of the game by 14 not a huge surprise there because LeBron was also out  I think Anthony Davis will probably play in their next ball game you know he's gotten hit in that same I a couple of times maybe he ends up wearing goggles or visor or I don't know something because they got a big game against the Warriors tomorrow where if they lose it they basically have no shot of getting out of the bottom half of the play in right now the Lakers still have a shot to get to the eighth there a half game back of the Kings Kings have one extra game left the Lakers only have three games the rest of the way King still have four Pals still have four  I think basically everybody else in the Western Conference has four except for the Lakers I think they're the only team that has three  if the pillows in Lakers by the way play on the last day of the regular season if the pels win all three games before that  then they will have secured Aid and upper half of the play-in tournament situation at least  and if the Kings win I believe two of their games  then they secure and upper half of the play in tournament as well  because the late they have the tiebreaker over the Lakers Lakers and Pals I think he'll be playing for the tie breaker on Sunday if I'm not mistaken so it's a really weird little thing Sons also have kind of a complicated schedule in there not to take them out of the mix but those four teams have a very important final week  I would be surprised to see  the sun's fall into the lower half of the play in tournament they pretty much have to lose like three of their last four ball games but anything's possible their schedules tough Phoenix has Clippers twice the Kings and the wolves and all those teams are going to be done informed although the Clippers will see if they have Kawaii so Sons might kind of catch a break there  uh Pals as we mentioned they have the Lakers they also have a very easy gaming against the Blazers tomorrow but then they have the Kings and the Warriors again both those teams are going to be gun and form so again like if the pills go two and one over that stretch then they're 48 and 33 going into their last ball game  and at the Lakers win their two games going into that they'll be 47 and 34 so both those teams get up 48 and 34  and he'll be playing to get that extra play in game so the nice thing about the bottom of the western conference is a lot of teams  almost all of them frankly like one through 10 that are gonna be playing for something all that to say I think add probably tries to get in there for the game against the Warriors Lakers are very bad when Anthony Davis is not on the court meaning if you're like thinking about going and picking up jaxson Hayes you better wait on that he did have a nice ball game but he might not get to play Spencer Dinwiddie filling in for LeBron did a nice job really hachimura filling in with some extra shots for ad and LeBron you know he was gonna have a better ball game and Austin Reeves is buried in a pretty nasty slump right now at some point he'll bust out of it but and you probably need to keep playing him but it didn't go in so great for for Austin right now  all right let's go back to Saturday and before I do I know there aren't that many of you hanging with us here at the end of the regular season live at least plenty of you still listening after the fact and I do appreciate you quick reminder we've got shows all off season long Monday through Friday and if you're new just hanging out for this last week trying to catch a few little nuggets before the season ends Please Subscribe somehow  yeah I said subscribe  whatever  who played on Saturday that didn't play on Sunday we need Detroit we need Memphis Atlanta and Denver  Detroit I told you all to pick up amazing metoo and he's been awesome 27 and 3 3 steals two threes on a perfect 9 for 9 shooting  met who's been great keep him rolling  Jalen Duren sat this one out James wiseman's usually a pretty safe 10 and 10 guy  but it didn't do much else so it's kind of a super low floor also pretty low ceiling play but if you need boards and a few points and decent field goal percent Wiseman is probably all right again that's a category hunting move  Marcus Sasser is on the board as a threes and assists play  not gonna get a ton of either but he's probably not gonna ruin you and then with Kate out I'm assuming for the rest of the season but we don't know Jade and ivy should be playable now in nine cat on top of points as well  Memphis all right well just a big fat question of who the hell is actually gonna play Brandon Clarke has been kind of fun I've been I've been impressed they've got a back-to-back here at the front end of this week tomorrow in the following day he's gonna send out one of those I think I'd probably play Clark in the other in Roto you get some points get some boards get some defensive stats usually get some field goal percent I hope he doesn't go over to it the foul line but I guess you never know  also of note Jordan Goodwin is seemingly playing in all of memphis's games right now  I don't think we see any of the regulars back this week but I've been surprised before  so keep a very close watch on the Grizzlies because you might get Scotty Pippen Jr as a play you might get Jordan Goodwin as a play still don't like Gigi Jackson's nine cat game but it definitely a points League option trade Jameson would probably be a rebounding option and then Brandon Clark would probably be an option as well so stay tuned we'll talk about the Grizzlies again tomorrow since we want to have any games to recap we'll mostly be looking at the injury report and we'll try to get a bead on which of these guys you could maybe drop into a lineup for some of or maybe all of this week I mean you might get this may be one of those weird weeks where you get a better week out of Jordan Goodwin then you do out of Damian Lillard  the last week is super I'm not saying you will I'm just saying the last week is extraordinarily odd  be ready for anything and The Grizzlies pivoting into 30 plus minutes for these five or six guys would be fantasy notable nothing super notable for Atlanta the same old crap uh DeAndre Hunter is just a points play at this point bogdanovich capella Marie Jalen Johnson those are the guys you can actually play every day  and then the Nuggets yeah Jamal Murray came back he played 21 minutes the nuggets have a back-to-back tomorrow and the following day so he may or may not play in both those if he doesn't he doesn't really change anything that I'm doing because I don't like playing Reggie Jackson as a streamer  so you know either you get Murray or you don't but not throwing anybody else at that  situation and that is all 30 teams ladies and gentlemen we did it in about 305 minutes or so after my show opening rant  and that I think is about all we need to talk about today did anybody bring up a name in the chat room  no nobody that we haven't covered yet excellent excellent knew his friends we will have a weekly preview show coming up in a couple of hours today we'll break down that'll be the last streaming show we do by the way for the rest of this regular season so that's going to be a streaming weekly preview show coming up in a couple of hours the rest of the week we're just gonna be trying to analyze the news as we go through these standard recap shows because again lays really only like our Wednesday and Thursday to talk about from a streaming standpoint so there's no reason to do a streaming show every single day when like  today nobody plays Saturday nobody plays  Tuesday Friday Sunday basically everybody  it's two teams that don't play tomorrow  it's well who the hell is Cleveland and it's Brooklyn  Okay so  you know but then they both go on Wednesday  if you wanted to  move to somebody I mean you should be overfilled tomorrow  there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't have at least 10 guys going so there's no reason to make a move today or tomorrow you make all your moves on Wednesday and Thursday and then you just pray enough for those guys are playing on Friday and Sunday that's it that's the whole damn thing I'm gonna just dreaming show later today it's gonna be 22 seconds long  I'm Dan best for us at Dan Bass Pros on Twitter please like rate and subscribe I really need your help as we wind down the regular season and I want you guys with us all off season long  because I really don't want to be shouting into the void to know one have a great couple of hours  we'll see you later
