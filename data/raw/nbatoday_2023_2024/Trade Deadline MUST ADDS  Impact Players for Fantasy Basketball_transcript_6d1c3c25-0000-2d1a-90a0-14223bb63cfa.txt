welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast hey happy Super Bowl Sunday everybody I know this might not be the day for us to put basketball content out into the universe  but I wanted to get this out there today because I felt like  you know with the fantasy week ending and with the  honestly just the sort of impact of things needing to happen almost immediately  especially for folks that are in first come first serve League's or if you have weekly Fab legs or whatever I thought it was important to get this show out there today so welcome to Fantasy NBA today a special Sunday Super Bowl Sunday edition of fantasy NBA today I am Dan Bass Pros please do take a moment to like rate subscribe all that good stuff if you guys are enjoying the content we're doing here that does go a long way and you can find me over on social media at Dan best Bruce d a n b e s b r i s this is a special trade deadline impact names show I had to call it you know must ads or something like that because otherwise you don't get dropped into the search engine deal but the main purpose of today's show is to look at 19 guys who either suited up for a new team last night or had their role significantly Changed by the trade deadline  and we got information on them on Saturday night so this is why I wanted to get this out into the world quickly get it out on Sunday this is not stuff that I felt could wait until Monday we will dive in and I want to give you guys this sort of just this very quick precursor these names are not in a specific order they are in the order that their teams played on Saturday because this is how I saw them as I was going through looking through all the game so let's start at the early ones and I worked towards the late ball game you watched him tape you watch him box scores you see what's happening at different junctures throughout listen to some of them on the radio when I was driving that was Clippers and pistons that was one so there's like  it's chronological effectively so don't be like yeah why do you have this mustad guy right in the middle of the pile that's why because it's chronological I want to get this show done in 25 minutes or less because I also think that's important because you guys don't really want to do basketball today you want to be watching the Super Bowl so let's dive in let's do this quick Daniel Gafford first name on the board from yesterday Mavericks had the early game he is a whole he is a hold first of all Gafford played 17 minutes which I know everybody's gonna be like ah 17 minutes but he had 17 and 9 with a block he's going to have the easiest time of his life playing with Kyrie Irving and Luka doncic now and I expect his minutes to Trend up Maxi chleba had 12 and 12 in this ball game Derek Lively will show up at some point yes there is the risk of a log Jam but you've got a hold on to see how this thing shakes out you cannot make assessments on guys being moved to contending teams in the very first game they played it's just it's too much to ask because they're going to need him to learn their playbook their offense their defense he's still learn all of that stuff he can't just drop in and go like a guy going to a crapper team where it's like I don't care if they make mistakes like what are we playing for this Maps team wants to win  so Gafford is very much a hold do not panic give this at least a couple weeks PJ Washington similar scenario but a very different fantasy player that's why PJ is trending towards A Drop In My Eyes he's a guy that we've always talked about needing a ton of usage to get to Fantasy value he's a 4571 splits guy field goal in free-throw percent meaning that the counting stats have to be extraordinary to get him there in 29 minutes with Charlotte he was outside the top one 40 on 13 and a half points about two threes five boards and two assists yeah a steal points 7 blocks all that stuff is decent but his role isn't about to get bigger  the best case scenario for Washington is that his role stays about the same in Dallas as it did in Charlotte I don't think the number of shots could possibly stay the same at least on sort of like a per minute basis could the field goal percent tick up absolutely because he's going to be more open as we just talked about with Daniel Gafford but watching it just doesn't have a fantasy game that translates well the nine cat so I think in nine category leaks PJ's trending towards a drop points leagues you could probably give it a little bit more of a leash because those categories are less of a thing and that's this deal with the new Mavericks  Marcus Sasser I got a lot of questions about I never really talked about him as a guy I liked I mentioned on Twitter I said oh you know I could see how this thing shakes out with him he had that like pretty good ball game for Detroit when everybody was out and then they were going into the trade deadline but my husband thought was like this guy's coming off the bench he's very much a three-pointer focused dude yeah he had four assists in their game yesterday they're lost in LA to the Clippers  but they're going to want to get a look at their new guys so Sasser and my eyes is more of a schedule stream probably again if we're like we have to classify these guys in a particular way and if someone is just a schedule play meaning you drop them into your lineup when they have you know three and four days or something like that that effectively makes them to drop that's a waiver wire guy who you'll only picking up for three to five days at a time so I don't think sasser's going to be can consistent enough to require our attention Simona fonte on the other hand does look more intriguing he came off the bench when he played 32 minutes he provides a certain size that the other guys off the bench don't have and shooting so it's size and scoring it took 19 shots in the Pistons loss 20 points nine boards 3 threes in a steel we know we can hit threes we know we can get some steals  I don't think he comes anywhere near 19 shots again for the foreseeable future but he played you know fourth most minutes on the team behind Ivy Cade and Duran  those guys are the core and to say all right thank you you're gonna play minutes like the guys with the core  I mean what's to stop him from starting in the next ball game I was Scarlett got the start at power forward in this game and played nine and a half minutes and then fontecchio picked up the rest of them including I think contact you played the last 18 minutes in a row in this game unless he got like a 30 second breather in there but his basically in like from Midway through the third quarter until all the way to the end of the ballgame that's showing a lot of faith in a new guy and it seems like he's sort of part of the building blocks now so fontecchio speculative add this might not stick and it's not yet game is not outstanding it was mostly threes and steals with a smattering of boards but he's not a bad free throw shooter field goal percent will probably be a small negative that can be overcome with a little bit of the counting stuff and so then we want to that's why we call it speculative because I don't know if the counting stuff's gonna be good enough every day but certainly was last night  I saw Thompson is an ad not speculative not anything else he's a guy who's role should just continue to ramp up the rest of the season I don't think we need to go into it a ton of detail on this one because I feel like most folks are just in agreement you play 27 and a half minutes and yesterday's lost the Clippers had 10 points 8 boards five assists in a couple of steals who was flying around on defense which is where they need him  and it just like it makes no sense for him not to be getting significant playing time I I kind of don't care who comes in this is the slow ramp up even if it's not immediate even if it's like it takes him another two three four five weeks whatever it is to get to where we really want him to be and Silly Season it feels like he could really do some damage but even in the short term here with Isaiah Stewart out more than anything that's a factor now does Stewart come back and take the minutes away from Thompson or fontecchio or both that's a possibility and that's why some of this stuff like with fonte were remains more speculative with Thompson we know he's a building block and so it's less speculative like there's I think there's more confidence that he just slowly grows his role but it might take some time so if you have a problem on that front then maybe you could downgrade him to more of a stash ad type but I do think he needs to be on Ross's a chronologically we continue to move through yesterday's Impact guys the next one on the board is Dennis Schroder who looked incredible in his first game for Brooklyn played 27 bench minutes at 15 points 12 assists and three three-pointers which is not a thing that's gonna stick but the points in the assists will he's an okay field goal percent guy he's a good free-throw dude steals are not usually particularly High threes are not particularly high but I expect him to see a lot of time as the point guard and I expect him to be somewhere in between where he was in Toronto at the end of the year and where he was in Toronto at the beginning of the year because remember Spirit got off to a top 60 start this season for about four weeks and I started to think holy hell that I just completely whiff on this handycap and then he was like top one forty for the next like whatever we had like eight nine weeks and then he got worse than that when they brought in more bodies I think he probably ends up somewhere in the 100 to 115 range which in my eyes  in 12 teams is a guy that should be played nightly and his role should only grow as this Team figures out how he fits into things and I believe that he will Dennis Smith Jr his teammate in Brooklyn is more of a watch list guy yet a nice game yesterday with 14 6 and 2 in a block and he's an across the board really interesting fantasy producer I just don't see how Dennis Smith gets more than 22 23 minutes on average the rest of the year they're just too many guys Claxton cam Thomas cam Johnson when he comes back Ben Simmons Mikhail Bridges Dennis Schroder where Lonnie Walker who only played six minutes where are the more than 23 minutes for Dennis Smith Jr gonna come from if the team stays healthy now if Cam Thomas goes down or Schroeder goes down or if Simon says to pack it in for the year then you start to look back and say okay now I could find a way to squeeze another three four five minutes in and that becomes a more reliable number but for now watch list  Trey man as we moved to Charlotte now I think he's a head-to-head league and a points lie add because he started at shooting guard he ended up doing a lot of sort of point guard he stuff with nine assists  but it's percentages are crap which again had to head side I know everybody's punting one of the percentages everybody seems like everybody's punting one of the two and also you know weak fluctuations you can sort of stomach it one week it'll hurt you the next you hope that guy's kind of balance each other out points leagues you're not that worried about that stuff you know 11 shots a handful of assists a couple of steals mixed in that's good enough in head-to-head and definitely good enough in points leagues  I remain incredibly skeptical that he can get inside the top 100 in Roto formats because of the percentages now I know this series at 47% from the field but this is his fourth season in the NBA or third season excuse me in the NBA it is previous two he shot 39% in both of them  it kind of doesn't make any sense that he would jump into the high 40s without any real impactful change to his Fantasy game and I thought yesterday was a pretty good example of that he's a high 70s free throw guy so a small negative there he shot 36% from the field because he got some volume and yes yesterday's game and then also look honestly the nine assists are probably on the high side as well especially if lamelo ball over shows back up again  so I don't think I'm picking him up and sort of like a what you'd call traditional nine cat Rodeo like I'm trying to win all nine categories kind of format but again head-to-head you can probably call him an ad points League definitely an ad and if you're punting specifically field goal percent that he makes a lot of sense Vaseline message doesn't matter I'll mess it up until I actually get to hear the play-by-play guy say it  watch list  watch list he had 18 and 9 which is crazy in 26 minutes but he also shot eight of 12 from the field and they played a Memphis team that's not an NBA caliber opponent I just I don't think see Charlotte getting 30 assists when they play a team that actually plays any defense and you know that's not everybody in the NBA like they're probably five 16s that don't play a lick of Defense at all in the NBA right now but Charlotte shot 58% this is one of the worst offensive teams I've ever seen in my life and they shot 50% in yesterday's game against the Grizzlies because they are one of the worst teams I've ever seen in my life right now this was the like relegation battle so  watch list I don't foresee 18 and 9 being an everyday thing  for him  next on the board is Grant Williams also on the watch list in Charlotte now some of this one for me is because he's a HomeTown kid so is Seth Curry and he only played 20 minutes I don't think there's any guarantee that Grant Williams get significant minutes I think there's some sort of like you know there's a HomeTown love thing going on there where he'll get probably to do a little bit more because of that but he's mostly Corner three-pointers and some rebounds there isn't a whole lot to his Fantasy game so I don't think we need to pounce on Grant Williams Because frankly I don't think anybody else is going to so you can wait see he might even have three four decent ball games in a row  uh and then  crap out which is kind of like what happened Dallas or earlier this year so unless he just becomes a massive usage guy which I don't see coming  probably watch list doubtful and add but you never know here's the easiest one of the day buddy hield who's just been outstanding outstanding in Philadelphia his role will slowly shrink Kyle Lowry just got signed so that'll take a little bit away and at some point to anything will come back and that'll take a little bit away but right now they badly need his scoring  and I don't know that Kyle Lowry Indiana guys that make it so they don't need buddy hield to score anymore  Joel embiid is that guy because Tyrese Maxey Tobias Harris the other guys that need to score out there and Uber and those guys were all there and healed still had 23.56 for Steals and four three-pointers not gonna be that good every game but he's a mustad must play in every format I spent a truckload on him and some families where he had been dropped because he was doing crap on the Pacers and I feel very good about that  Marvin Bagley on the other side is gonna be a tough one but he's a tough hold for me right now I played 15 minutes as the starting center he's coming back from a back injury and I'm inclined to think that there was a little bit of an ease in type of situation but they also realized that they could run a little small it's a couple games in a row actually at the Wizards of run small Denny Avi up picked up a bunch of Center minutes that's not something you're gonna be able to get away with when the opposing Center isn't a non-scoring threat and that's by the way is not to take anything away from Paul Reed but he's not intimidating anyone on the offensive side so they're like all right Denny you're big enough you can probably deal with this and by and large he could this is a relatively competitive basketball game I have to believe though that when the Wizards play a team with a slightly more intimidating Center don't have to be like a superstar level guy but just a sort of Center that isn't exclusively a rim Runner that bagley's gonna get to do more so let's hold on that front you know not of us likes Marvin bagley's fantasy profile points rebounds  field goal percent sorta and then awful free throw but again you gotta wait and find out if he's going to get 30 some odd minutes because he does he's just gonna put up so much counting stuff that the fact that he doesn't do the other things and could be a negative in some of the other ones won't really hurt you all that much  his teammate be out of Kula believe you guys know I am very very skeptical of of B Lau I just I don't I don't think he has the fantasy game Sorry Sorry Bilal I don't think you have the fantasy game so my comment here is skeptical skeptical he had a good game two games back he had a dog do game in his last one percentages that are just you know obliterating you and that's that's the thing with him like  I need him taking a ton of shots but I also need him to not miss all of them that to me is asking a lot and again you know points League some head-to-head formats that type of stuff is less of an issue  but you guys know me and you know this show I have to present this show as a nine category situation and I just I have no idea how he does enough  in nine category formats  to be in a fantasy add it just it doesn't the numbers don't the math doesn't add up you know 27 minutes is here he's number 227  steals are fine blocks are okay well one three-pointer  and bad free throw  you can't be bad at both and not be awesome at the other stuff  he's bad at both and he'll be fine at the other stuff but that won't in my eyes be enough Alec Burks this is a pretty easy one to put on a watch list I don't think he needs to be added I know he had 22 points for the Knicks in 22 minutes yesterday but you know how often do we really think he's gonna get 14 shots make half of them and go for for it the free throw line in 22 if he's only playing 22 minutes there's no chance he has sustainable nine category value and frankly  even yesterday I don't think that's a that's a nine category game you know we had two boards one assist  no steals no blocks yeah the three pointers were good the scoring was good the percentages were good but when everything goes to where it needs to be yeah that ain't gonna happen so that's a pretty easy call I don't think we need to go into much more detail there his Detroit teammate that also came over boy on bug zdanowicz in my eyes is a temporary hold mostly because his minutes were just higher boy on played 33 minutes off the bench and he's liable to get a lot of minutes in the short-term here while the Knicks are without OG and Obi and Julius Randle  when those guys come back  I feel pretty confident in saying that boy on ends up as a drop but if you really is gonna play 33 minutes and he's gonna get between 10 and 15 shots he probably hangs on near the top 100 so temporary hold on boy and bug donovick with the knowledge that this is not a rest of season proposition this is a rest of injury proposition in New York where we can then segue into some of the other names in New York such as Josh Hart or Donte divincenzo who I didn't actually put on this slideshow those guys are holes right now all so  Stephen chenzo I'd have more confidence in calling a rest of season hold because he was there when the team was healthy before but even he might get knocked off with Burks and bug zdanowicz in town because again you bring all these guys back even if Dante continues to start that's just so many mouths to feed right now  and for Josh Hart I think you basically put him in the boy on bug zdanowicz bucket which is he's a hold for now because his minutes are there for now and as guys come back heart probably ends up as a drop as well  Kelly Olynyk and you guys know I can't do go a show without talking about old Kelly old  I have this softest of soft spots in my heart for Kelly Olynyk it's almost the same size as the soft spot in my heart that I have for Larry Nance Jr uh but  first of all Larry Nance he's a backup and I want him I want him to be a thing so bad but I'm also fully aware that he's not a thing especially not while Jonas valentina's is healthy  Kelly Olynyk could be a thing  it's not impossible we know he can play alongside regular centers so like Jakob Pirtle and those guys did play together briefly it didn't go all that well but they played together briefly and yesterday's ball game but more than anything my love of Kelly Olynyk is because he has one of the most translatable Fantasy games in the league  does anybody remember and I feel like I you know I've been moving through the other name so fast and we're on to like our last two names I think on the show here does it so I can take an extra second on a Linux does anybody remember what he did in Houston at the tail end of the 2021 season  he was in basketball hell but he played 31 minutes for the rockets and put up 19 8 and 4 with two defensive stats and two to three pointers on 5584 splits  is that gonna happen again hell no hell no  but even think back to last year in Utah he put up 12 and a half points 6 boards four assists a steal and half a block one and a half three pointers on 5085 splits  and that was on a team again where his job was somewhat marginalized by other dudes that were scoring  I think we have to assume that that's kind of like what the job ends up being this year  and the thing too is like in 20 minutes in Utah he wasn't that far away from Fantasy Valley because he was at 85 and 4 and a half  in my eyes we really only need to get a Linux to about 24 25 minutes a game which is not gonna be simple it's not a guaranteed by any stretch  but he got off leaked clothes it is first ball game with a new team yesterday he got to 22 minutes and put up a healthy fantasy line in them  he's also and I I mean this like a little bit  you know what it's not facetious it's not joking to say that being Canadian is going to help him here like he's a ticket sales guy as his RJ Barrett  Hometown boy from Toronto this is a big deal  116 and 3 with 4 defensive stats and a three in yesterday's ballgame in 22 minutes he's not gonna be that usage every time he's out there but he's a ball mover for a team that badly needs a ball mover  I don't have any point guards really on that team anymore so someone's gonna have to be the facilitator and if it's not gonna be Bruce Brown  and Scotty Barnes should be able to focus on the other stuff some of the time  it's probably Kelly Olynyk  he might end up hurting Yakima portal they may end up sort of cannibalizing each other and then they both end up sucking but in a perfect universe  they find a way to coexist  where Barrett Barnes oolitic quickly pedal  and Trent or sort of like the six guys who get to play and then Bruce Brown and I shy abaji pick up some sort of like chunky minutes off to the side will that happen I don't know but Kelly so good at Fantasy that you gotta at least put him on a roto bench and see what happens and then Gary Trent Jr talking about these other players on the Raptors I think he probably Trends towards a drop he was really bad yesterday's game some of that was because the Cavaliers no one could score on Cleveland anymore they're unbelievable the calves are so good defensively I want to do oh no a show all about the Cavs defense but we don't have time for that I just don't think Trent gets enough shots consistently I don't know that Olynyk is going to be the thing that hurts him it's actually possible that a bhaji ends up hurting Trent because he's better defensively but yeah again this is going to be a lot of guys fighting for kind of the same bucket and that to me makes it tougher I always thought the Raptors needed to unload more players than just shooter to get Trent all the way to the finish line and instead yes they dumped one but they brought in others so I'm guessing Trent is a drop if you want to hang on for one or two more games I have no problem with that maybe maybe he ratchets it back up but I don't think he does  and that is your lightning round
