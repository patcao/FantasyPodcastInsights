welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast I thought if I could get this thing going a little bit earlier I know my afternoon two show days they tend to run a little bit closer to the start of the game so I don't know just  trying some stuff out timing wise you guys are part of it because  again I really only been doing these shows simulcasts for like 14 months  which is so dumb when I look back at it and think oh my gosh what if I just been like simulcasting my shows on YouTube since 2018 or something like that how different would this channel be if it had consistent contact for or content for six years instead of one  that is just  well dumb I'm leaving money on the table is what's happening in there quite literally because you know six years ago if that had we'd started here we probably would YouTube would be generating more than a couple of meals every month anyway welcome everybody it's a bonus second episode here on Tuesday of fantasy NBA today it's the Buy Low episode for weeks 16 and it is a doozy  it's a doozy you guys already saw the thumbnail presumably so you know you know one of the names already  and it doesn't get a whole lot less risky than that  and you know me I'm not like each of these moves that we're gonna go through today they they have a time and a place  so  make sure that you are  taking in the Nuance of what we go through it's not just like a blind you know close your eyes run through the door kind of thing but they are some there these little these will get your blood a boiling a little bit I am at to investors on social media some of you are actually probably watching this live on so social right now so awesome if you are just make sure to hit the follow button if you're not you can navigate over there hit the follow button we also have our trade deadline live show that's well under two days now away from today we're at 712 thumbs up I still want to get to 750 before the show begins I wanted to be the biggest show we've ever had in the history of sports ethos and I need you guys to help me do it so find that link in the show description head on over there hit that thumbs up button that will be a large bonus for us we've got the Discord Link in the show description we get tweet storms in their things that I do on social media that we're able to throw over into Discord from time to time just a nice opportunity to go pop in and have some fun talking fantasy with fellow fantasy enthusiasts  let's dive in onto our week 16 by low board but before we get to what the names for today I thought it might make sense like usual just kind of go through back briefly some of the players we've been talking about last week Chad Holmgren was the name you'd been trending down a little bit mostly because of free throw shooting and I thought that was an opportunity to maybe squeeze a Buy Low in of somebody in the you know 30s it's still you know it was still was gonna cost a pretty penny it just it never felt like whenever the 50 some odd 60 some odd run he was on was something that was going to stick because there were just things that were  lower even though everything else seemed to be fine two weeks ago we had Steph Curry on this board and I know people were like who the hell's gonna punt on Steph Curry well the the people that hit me up on Twitter that were like Steph is washed and now I'm guessing you guys don't think that anymore friends from Twitter he's been going nuts he's been a first rounder over the last two weeks capped by his 60 point was that single overtime or double oh it doesn't matter is a huge ball game team lost but who cares  cam Johnson is dealing with a sore adductor at the time we talk about him right now but he is finally trending in the right direction he's worked his way back up to the edge of the top 100 so that's good let's hope that this adapter thing doesn't slow him down Darius Garland was our injured by low play we had him on the board for about three weeks in a row and now he's back so hope you were able to get him at like a top 80 kind of price and Jeanette Murray was our risky play from the last two weeks he still hasn't been traded which I don't know does that make it more or less risky  I honestly don't know the answer to that but people are freaking out about him in there was a chance you could get him for you know 60 to 70 range 50 to 70 range something that is pretty workable  because he's still a hawk right now and honestly I'm not that worried even if he would somebody yeah somewhere else  okay let's dive into the extremely sensitive first name on our Bi-Lo board this week and I I didn't put Jordan Poole I think a lot of people thought I was gonna put Jordan Poole on the list but he was back on sort of the trade deadline dashboard and it felt like it  that would be kind of recycling a name but I do think that Jordan Poole is a weird little by low of just for the next two days to see if guys get out of his way and he starts to take a few more shots going into the trade deadline but that's the reason that he's not on this board  it's also important that I stress once again  how I've treated Jordan Poole like he's radioactive since his ADP got higher than 60 which was like mid-september  to be locked in on a particular take if there's an opportunity for a little bit of value and  I think I can translate that thought here to Tyreese Halliburton as well  who was the first name on our Bi-Lo list today he's number eight overall in nine cat this is a guy who was number four three four Reigns for a very long time this year  but over the last two weeks he's number 87 and the reason for that is that he's on a minute's cap of 22  and we have no idea when that's going to get lifted he's on record in the media saying he doesn't know how long it's gonna take but he's assuming it's going to be a while  they're getting him to 20 minutes in these games to try to make sure that he can still qualify for the various NBA awards and you know all NBA boards and stuff like that  League leaderboards things of that nature  so how long does it get to go  the honest goodness truth is I have no idea  and nobody does either nobody has an idea  other than Halliburton  and the Pacers and their medical staff who probably have some kind of an idea of how long this thing can go  but here's the thing  they say it's indefinite  but is it really without a defined endpoint  it's only indefinite in as much as they're not telling us what that endpoint is  and I would argue that it becomes pretty definite if the Pacers hit a sort of an irretrievable skin  they're 28 and 23 right now they're the six seed they're a half game up on the magic for the last non-playing spot to go to the playoffs in the Eastern Conference the heat are right behind the magic as well then there's a pretty good little drop off to the Bulls and Hawks so I don't think the Pacers are in any real Danger  of falling out of the playoff picture but they're all so not very good without Tyreese Halliburton they're fine they're probably just a slightly sub 500 Team without him but they're well above 500 with him  and at some point he's gonna have to play again  and we did this exercise on our morning show talking about Joel embiid and him being out for  as you know at minimum four weeks and then the evaluation and then a ramp up or something that nature but here's the short version of All That math  there's almost exactly 10 weeks left in the NBA season it's actually two days less than that there's 68 days left from the time we are recording this Bi-Lo episode  I can't do any of us actually see Tyrese Halliburton being on this Minister's kitchen for more than a month  that being incredibly long amount of time to be limited in your number of minutes with no tweaks to it whatsoever is he getting better or is he getting worse you kind of have to know one way or the other after a month  how long has it been right now it's been four games  it feels like it's been forever  but it's been four games  because remember he played on January 19th play 35 minutes in that ball game and then he missed about 10 days or so came back on January 30th and he's played four games since then 22 22 22 and 20 minutes and those the last one was only 20 minutes because they felt like they could beat Charlotte without him  they could  and so again I understand  that it feels like he's been on this  quoted in definite minutes restriction  forever  but it's been a week  it's been one week  and a day okay a week in a day I guess no I think it's actually been exactly one week  so here's the thing if you're fighting for a playoff spot this probably isn't a move you can make fear the six or seven seed in your head to head division or if you're in Roto and you're kind of like fighting for getting into the money I don't know that this would be the right time to do it either  but if you're  like first of all if you're waiting near the bottom and you feel like your team needs a big time shift to get there this would be an interesting thing to try or if your way at the top  and you can afford to give up a fourth rounder or something to that degree and that's the number that I think we can Target here is a fourth rounder so somebody ranked basically between 40 and 50 give or take  would probably get it done  if said person has a lot of name recognition  number 48  might be able to get you Tyreese Halliburton right now might  Evan Mobley ramping up give it to three more games he might Darren Fox at 39 might get it done because whoever has Halliburton in your league is probably freaking out a little bit  now maybe this again this trade might work better if the team with Tyrese Halliburton is sitting in like the fourth fifth sixth spot something like that and they don't want to fall out of the playoff picture or again if you know if it's over on the Roto side and it's somebody that's maybe not near the top it could be anyone honestly for Roto the the stars are going to have to align a little bit because if the top team in your league has Alan they're gonna wait it out because they're fine they can afford to just maybe not be as dominant for a few weeks  top two teams top three teams either but you know as you get into like the four seed through the 12 seed and I think again this makes maybe more sense in head than Roto  those teams all have something to lose third seed they're worried about falling down  potentially out of the playoffs maybe they want to try to make sure they get into the top two  forth so the same thing 5th 60 they don't want to fall out you miss the playoffs you just done  seventh seed they have Halliburton there's no way they can afford to take half game from other first rounder they need somebody that's putting up numbers  you could probably go a little bit higher even if you wanted to you know like a Jalen Brunson at 35  Monastery bonus at 33 these guys would get it done  CJ McCollum at 29 Mike get it done I don't know if you even need to go that high not that I think CJ's I mean he's been sort of I mean he's been amazing let's let's be honest CJ's been way better than any of us expected but he has been falling slowly for the last three weeks or so very slowly up so again I look at Tyreese Halliburton and  my thought is  the word they're using is indefinite  but there is an endpoint on it  this I don't think I'd be very surprised if this lasted  if this lasts the rest of this season just seems unlikely it's not feasible  they can't do this the whole year there's no point  at a certain point if he's not healthy you stop playing him  and if he is you play more  it just there's like you can't take this weird mid road right now they're doing this so that he stays qualified for things and they believe that he can actually get better health wise while they're doing it  if they thought he was gonna get worse or stay the same because of this they wouldn't be doing it  that's the only logical explanation here is that  they believe  he can actually improve while he's on this indefinite they say minutes restriction which again I don't believe is actually indefinite so if you could afford to do it see if you can go get Tyreese Halliburton a Bonafide first rounder who can be had at probably a two to three round discount right now because nobody knows how long he's going to be on this weird 22 minute bender and or what he can actually do with it which by the way he's been admittedly not very good on this little two-week Bender he's been on number 87 I think but that's also because he's at five assists in those 21 minutes that's probably a number that will creep up towards seven or eight just given his normal sort of assist per minute situation Albert's had a 12 assists in 32 minutes so he should be around eight in 21 minutes so he's actually better like this is a guy who's probably gonna be a top 60 fantasy player in 22 minutes of ball game so absolutely you can give up somebody in the 40 range because you're not even sacrificing all that much in the short term  I know it's freaking ballsy  but  if you can pull it off this is the kind of movie that could end up winning your league if it works  we're staying in Indiana today our two top names the other one is Myles Turner who has not quite figured out how to play with the new pieces yet in Indies number 50  nine overall on the year now he's fallen obviously because over the last month he's number one 155 and a lot of that's because it's been it's been all over the map is production has been all over the map  27 minutes a game but more than anything  not only are percentages down but is blocks are at 1.1 over the last month  look this is a two blocks a game guy  he just is  and if you want to point say oh you know Pascal siakam being in town it changes everything for Myles Turner uh  you know ultimately it won't  he's just on a bad blocks kick right now he had five blocks in Portland on January 19th since then he has five total over seven ball games  guys through go through up and down swings and for a player like Myles Turner whose value is so heavily tied up in shot blocking  if that number drops off by like a half  he's also going to see his value plummet  I'll admit the 27 minutes a game this year that's been annoying because you know he's playing 30 minutes a game each of the last basically four years in a row and that's how he was able to get into the 20s on a per game basis that Myles Turner is probably gone I don't think he's getting into the 20s this year but he's never 59 right now largely because his last month has been so terrible and I think the target should be to get at least inside back inside the top 50  and you know the beautiful thing is that there are teams that are panicking  you can get Myles Turner for probably somebody in the 75 range and there are some pretty good players in the 75 range that would definitely get the job done  his teammate Pascal siakam you know I don't know I mean you might be able to hire that  the Angela Russell probably doesn't get it done  Tyler hero Anthony Simon's maybe probably not hero right now because he's in a slump on Miami he's kind of figuring out how all the pieces fit together Simon's Maybe  or maybe you pair a couple of like a 75 with 100  maybe you go Derek Lively and Anthony Simons together or maybe you go  Jalen Duren straight up as an interesting candidate  how's he been over the last month come to think of it Jalen Duren number 91 over the last month because  in the beginning of the season I love Jalen Duren by the way I should probably try to qualify this this statement with he's one of my favorite young players in the NBA because he's a rebounding Goliath but he's not a defensive stat Goliath that's just not really his thing he got off to a big shot blocking start this year but that was kind of anomalous  who else is out there that might get the job done in that same range maybe you go a little higher with somebody that has less name power like a Mike Conley  eh  Devin vassell it's 68 would probably get it done  um  DeAndre ayton who's kind of an annoying player to roster anyway maybe somebody would just want to make that flip  nerc you think nerd would get it done no but maybe you could pair him up with like a Jabari Smith Jr when he's warmer  or maybe you could sell high on someone like a cam Thomas or a Jonathan comingo right now those guys are going Buck Wild  now the thing with Myles Turner is that I don't think they're quite as many sort of injury stipulations on his stuff he is playing poorly because there's just weird pieces that are being fit together  so I don't think you have to there isn't that whole like how long am I going to have to sit on a guy who's not playing that many minutes I think with Myles Turner you're just gonna see the pieces start to fit a little bit better in Indy and I also think that playing alongside Tyreese Halliburton is an interesting one some of the chat rooms suggested Isaiah hardenstein for for Myles Turner and yeah I mean if you can pull it off I think you should do it Harden Stein's been awesome  but there is this sort of looming Specter of Mitchell Robinson showing up next month  Harvest Time top 50 basically over the last month that's kind of where he tops out and that's where I think we can probably try to get Myles Turner to  so yeah yeah absolutely I would go that direction  last name on our board and this one is if I just want to put them on there because I thought it would be worth talking about is Joel embiid whether or not is this a Bi-Lo or is this a terrible idea and the answer is both  as I mentioned earlier on earlier our show earlier today Joyland bead out for at least four weeks and then there will be an evaluation in likely a significant ramp up time my guess on him is that he's out for seven to eight weeks and there are about 10 weeks left  so take that and build from it meaning my expectation is that Joel embed plays the last two weeks of the regular season meaning if your season is over before those final two weeks you don't do it if your season goes to the very end of the NBA campaign of the regular season then you consider it and the reason you consider it is because you can get a top five overall player right now for pennies he's being dropped in a lot of formats that don't go to the end of the regular season  and formats that do you can probably get them for somebody and then 90 range hey  80 to 90  Derek Lively went healthy would probably get it done right now  Austin Reeves would probably get it done  Michael Porter Jr would probably get it done here's the thing your team's not gonna miss those guys that much  Yakima Turtle John Collins  Max Drewes  your team's not gonna miss these guys that much  what's purple over the last month 139  all right like  you think your team can survive without these guys that bounce between having a week in the top 60 to 80 range in a week in the in the 140 range yeah your team can survive but you also absolutely positively must have an injured slot available probably more than one because someone else on your team is gonna get hurt during these seven or eight weeks and you're not going to want to have to say I can't do it because I got a meat in my only IL slot you need two or more ill slots your season needs to go to the very end of your fantasy season is go to the very end of the NBA regular season and you probably need to be in kind of the catbird seat in your league this is not a movie you make if you're in like five fifth sixth place same thing with the Halliburton one although this one to a much larger degree this isn't a movie make if you're in sixth place this is a movie you make if you're in like a top two or three seed  three might be the absolute best time to do it because you're like you know what I'm probably not gonna be the number one team unless I do something wild but I'm probably gonna make the playoffs so  what's the thing that could get me over the hump when I have to play the number one team I guess three would play two but you guys catch my meaning it will be getting Joel embed for your semifinals  so again with all of this stipulations I laid out needs to go to the end of the regular season you can't be fighting for a playoff spot  you probably don't want to give up more than a top 80 type of player I could make an argument and I think I just did for trying to add someone like a Joel embiid  I don't think it's as crazy as it sounds  Roto yeah absolutely same thing squeeze two weeks out of him at the end of the year  and you know what if he doesn't play at all  you just pretend like oh Austin Reeves just traded in me just pretend he's out for the years something like that  because it's again I promised you losing someone like an Austin Reeves would be a little bit annoying but you know he's top one house seven over the last month 16 three and five and a half on decent percentages it's fine  but you can stream that spot you don't lose very much so you give up a little bit  to take that big Home Run hack how many times right now and it's crazy how many times are two Bonafide top half of the first round guys available at this steep of a discount at the same time the answer is never  and right now you have a shot to buy on Tyreese Halliburton for probably a 40 to 50 range guy and you have a chance to buy and again serious stipulations alert on Joel embiid  for someone in probably the 80 to 100 range because that team is going to be looking for any kind of return  provided again they're not like the number one seed because the number one seed they're probably just gonna sit on him and hope that they can get him back in the playoffs they feel good about themselves already but there are I mean we're again we're talking about like for a bead it's going to be any team basically ranked between like four and 12 is probably going to want to sell him at a discount and one two and three are going to want to try to buy him for Halliburton it's probably teams like honestly maybe three through 12 but probably more like five through 12 are gonna want to sell and everybody else is gonna want to buy that creates some kind of Market thing is I'm guessing some of these teams at the top of their league are like that I don't really want to deal with that that's too much work so you if you're the three seed and you're like you know this is work that I should invest I'm not gonna get over the hump unless I go get myself a first rounder at a discount this is your window  so it's yeah it's a freaking risky day to do it it's a risky number of names  but these types of insane difference makers are rarely available for this cheap and we've had first rounder I mean we talked about Steph  two weeks ago when he was outside the top 24 when he had slipped into the very beginning of the third round or was he number 22  either way people on my timeline said he was washed and I thought okay  if that if even one person is saying that  that one person could be the team that's rostering him in my league  of course he's not washed she's freaking Steph Curry  but you could go get him for a guy ranked around 20  when you know he's gonna move back up into that top probably 14 to 10 range  at worst  Jayson Tatum had fallen into the 30s that doesn't mean you were gonna get him for someone in the 30s but you could get him for someone in the 20s when you knew he was gonna get back up into the teens and that's where he is he's up to number 19 now because Tatum is very quietly started shooting his free throws better  that's the thing  and those guys were way more expensive that Halliburton right now how Halliburton you can get for way cheaper you know Steph was gonna cost you Tyrese Maxey and Tatum was gonna cost you LeBron  or Trey young or something like that Halliburton is going to cost you probably deer and Fox right now  or sabonis  or Jimmy Butler  Someone go do it and tell me about it I'd like to know that somebody  you know whipped it out
