welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right it's a quick hitter weekly preview and streaming episode this one I slightly different name because we are at the start of a new week so for weekly leagues you're applying this to a seven days only scheduling span everybody else in Daily League's this is all part of our long streaming playoff two-a-day battle that I'm fighting against time and availability and childcare and so far so good I am Dan Bass Pros this is fantasy NBA today it's a special bonus episode but we do in these every day so they're not that special anymore I'm at investors over on Twitter if you guys would like to find me over there again all of you that are finding me on Twitter you're canceling out the people that are going into  their offseason and unfollowing it all matters it all matters we want to keep growing  they'll be back  maybe  I'll take a look at the streaming grid for this week this of course is available to NBA pass subscribers who can get the baseball pass as part of the all-sport upgrade for just a dollar for one more day  if you're a follower who also plays baseball make sure to check out  ethos fantasy BB and fantasy MLB today our sister podcast here at sports ethos hosted by the great Joe Oracle  we're gonna do what we always do which is very first I'm going to very slowly scroll through this board so anybody that's watching can see the names of the teams and when they play but then I want to jump into the worst scheduled first  why worst first well first thing you need to isolate as you head into this playoff week is who you might drop  right we all have you can go out there and you can find a bunch of guys that you actually want to pick up but  you got to know who you shouldn't have on your teams right now  the worst schedules starting today belong to three teams in particular the Lakers have the worst schedule  and it's not even close I know you're like Dan don't the Wolves all so I have a two-game week yes the Lakers play three games over 11 days  it's great for old guys on that club and it's horrible for Fantasy Basketball because not only they have a bad schedule this week but they segue right into a bad schedule next week  they barely play three games over 11 days is absurd  under 30%  games played per day over more than a week and a half that's like unheard of without having you know an All-Star break or something  I think the Lakers played more games into and out of the All-Star break then they have over this 11-day span  also terrible schedule the Wolves two game week all the then they go back to back to start the following week so they're scheduled gets a little bit better certainly faster than the Lakers does but it is quite bad for this week and then for non weekly lineup sorts Brooklyn has one game the first five days of this week they finish up the week a little bit better much like we just talked about with Minnesota next week Brooklyn goes back to back Saturday Sunday Minnesota goes back to back Monday Tuesday of next week but really bad schedule is up until those points  there are also four teams who have what I'd call kind of bad schedule it's a shorter term thing but if you happen to be kind of Lucky let's say you don't have Lakers wolves or Nets on your roster or maybe you only have one and you're thinking hey you know what I could probably stream an extra slot at Atlanta Miami New Orleans Orlando and Utah all play one game over the next four days  with the little caveat that after that Utah starts a five game in seven days span so if you can survive this first four they've got a really good payoff on the other side of it  so for those teams Atlanta Miami New Orleans Orlando and Utah the droppable list is shorter you're probably dropping people that are out outside the top 100 basically guys that you were streaming anyway this is the time now to get off of those streams if you have someone that's a reliable fantasy asset on any of those clubs and aren't many on Orlando but you know take enough for example you're obviously not going to drop  deshante freaking Murray United Murray you're not gonna drop Bogdan bogdanovich because of that one in four because it then it gets better after that Miami you're not gonna drop bam or Rozier or Butler or even frankly Dunkin' Robin you could make an argument that you could actually dump in Robinson New Orleans you've got all the main guys and you hold on to Trey Murphy because he's been ridiculously hot and so on and so forth but for the top three teams I listed Lakers wolves and Nets you're dropping every anybody who's not inside the top 75 this is if you're in a playoff battle right now or frankly if you're in a battle to get into the playoffs right now  if you think you might miss the playoffs in your league treat it the same way as a playoff week you gotta survive  for the Lakers that means anybody that basically over the last month not inside the top 75  well luckily has been so freaking good that he does fall into that range lately he's number 37 over that stretch Austin Reeves is number 54 over the last month so someone was asking me on Twitter if Reeves qualifies  so the top four on the Lakers probably stay on your roster and then you just have to cross your fingers and pray that you can survive it but certainly the first of those bunch to go would be Austin reefs  which sucks I know but like think about it Reeves over the last month 16 points 5 boards six assists  1.2 combined defensive stats 2.33 is on good percentages can you find someone on the wife who averages eight two and a half and three with decent percentages and one three-pointers the answer is most of that maybe not the percentage is part but if you get double that  whatever I just said on the wire you equal Reeves over the week if you get anything above double you beat him  what about Minnesota again precisely look at the last month Mike Conley droppable  he's outside the top 100 the last month  shots been off  not quite as many but mostly just that the shots been off  Monte Morris for a little while there was healthy enough to be his backup that allowed him to get a little bit more rest  so Mike Conley you can cut  you've had them all year and he's been fun he's been a really good asset for most of the season but he's cuttable cattley you can cut because he's too hurt  got some questions about what to do with nas Reed he's top 40 basically since cat went down and then you know yesterday's game there was no go bare and no Kyle Anderson either so that gave nausea even more of an opening he's right on the borderline  I think nice probably ends up you know when gobert and and Kyle Anderson are back and I was read probably ends up as something in that like 70ish range between 50 and 100 so yeah I mean if you had to  go bare Anthony Edwards those the guys that you're not cutting on Minnesota right now but everybody else is kind of fair game and then for Brooklyn which you know they're their own weird little mess uh  cam Thomas is gonna take 25 shots a game Nick Clarkson's gonna get all of his blocks Dennis Schroder as great as he's been  he has big holes in his Fantasy game  so he's one that you could consider cutting for the one game in five days if you can survive it great because they do have a three game week at the end of it all cam Johnson you can't really wait on him mikal Bridges obviously you play I think for the Nets you probably play most of these guys shooter would be the one that I would say but it's enough of assists where you try to ride it out  still you can get three games over these five days pretty easily  so if you're really in a bind then that's where you'd go and again they have the third worst schedule and it's quite a bit less awful because at least they get three games out of this week but that's where you're sitting on who may be to cut  who has the best schedule this week Dan which direction do you pivot there aren't many that's the sad news about this week this schedule analysis of this week suggests that it's not a particularly easy week to stream but it's a very important week to stream because not that many teams have amazing schedules so where you can potentially isolate them you can get an even bigger leg up up the best schedule today is the Boston Celtics they go back to back and they also play three and four three games in four nights with the back-to-back immediately so you have the back-to-back for a flexibility you can also hold them for four days and then move off of them on Friday  the second best schedule today belongs to the San Antonio Spurs they have a back-to-back but then they don't play again until Friday as part of a four game week Boston by the way also a four game week they finish up on Sunday just like San Antonio does so the difference is not all that severe between the two teams  other than the fact that the Celtics played for or three games of first four days in the Spurs it takes down basically the whole week to get to these slightly better or the the full four games so if you're going this person you're probably only doing it for two days for the Celtics you could probably do it for four although again they don't have that many Fringe assets more of them pop up because of the back-to-back and because of the Portland to Utah altitude crab and playing tanking teams  and then you've got sort of like and okay alternate option which is Chicago Dallas and Portland the Bulls the Mavs the Blazers go three times in four days like Boston does but it's an inverted three and four meaning instead of they go back to back day off game they go game day off then the back-to-back so Chicago Dallas port in the schedule actually gets better starting on Wednesday when they have their back-to-back but if you wanted to make sure you're picking somebody up for four days if you wanted to do kind of the medium stream instead of just a quick Boston burst or San Antonio burst those teams that I just mentioned Chicago Dallas Portland they do give you the four days span there are no teams that go five times in seven days starting today there are no teams that go six times in nine days starting today there are plenty of teams that have a four game week Charlotte as a four game week so throw them in the mix that starts today so they're not the worst choice in the universe but again like this is not  there's no flexibility there if you pick up a hornet you have to hold them through Saturday otherwise you've pretty much blown the move  it might be the only other one because Portland goes for and six that's it Charlotte Portland at the only two they go four and six so if you wanted to at least important you could Abandon Ship after Thursday if you really wanted to you are stuck for those first four but you're not stuck for five and six so today's a pretty hard day to do  a long stream frankly because the four and six options are limited there's only two there's only four teams that go three and four and only two teams that go back to back but we just told you about a couple of teams that have absolutely atrocious schedules where you got to get out of the way you got to get off of my Conley and you probably had to drop City Bay if you he was on your team earlier today he's out for a while and you probably had to drop like an output in Chene based on his deal though we don't have the exact report on him yet  this is a tough spot  so for those that are watching with us let me change what you guys are getting to see right now you were looking at our streaming grid now I'm very quickly going to bring up a couple of names that I thought were  at least  usable or borderline usable here they are and these names for Boston Payton Pritchard and Sam Houser our possibilities Pritchard would be my preferred play we already know Drew holiday is out today Kristofferson is out today and possibly tomorrow he missed their last ball game he's actually hurt Derek white Jalen Brown Jayson Tatum were all playing today but on the altitude game in Utah I would imagine that at least one maybe two of those guys is sitting so that means a guy like Prichard is probably going to get decent minutes in the back court both days of this back-to-back Hauser minutes probably a bit lower today but if Jalen brown or Tatum is out and porzingis is still out and maybe Horford as well then you probably get more for Hauser tomorrow that's why he's my you know you're sort of grading out how many minutes you think these guys might get and for Prichard it feels like he could get in the mid to high 20s both days so you're kind of gunning for 50 to 60 range over two ball games for Houser you're hoping for like low 20s today and then maybe high 20s tomorrow so could he get to 50 over those two games as a possibility but it does feel like Pritchard probably beats him out in minutes over the next two games by I don't know somewhere in the four to seven range but again both are viable for San Antonio I think I only go Malachi Branham I'm assuming Kelvin Johnson is roster in your legs but he would also be an option there Jeremy Sohan probably rostered these guys are  way over rostered but if they're not they would also make sense as back to back opportunities  Trey Jones if he's on the wire would make sense as a back-to-back guy  but the Spurs are hoping to get Devin he's probable so they're hoping to get him and Wendy back tonight presumably for both halves of the back-to-back although I guess we don't really know they might rest one or both of those guys on the other half and so then maybe some of those Fringe or guys make more sense but Branham is the one guy who's been kind of just scoring regardless of who's in the lineup  and then remember we just talked about some of these other teams Dallas Chicago Portland Chicago doesn't have anybody to stream Dallas has Derek Jones Junior who's just slid into the starting five but hasn't played that many minutes yet Derek Lively who they're hoping to get back as a backup center Tim Hardaway Jr who's also way over rostered but if he's on the wire you could use him for Portland timani Kamara has a half decent Fantasy game he could work for that three and four Chris Murray less exciting could work for the three and four but at least he doesn't hurt you in too many spots and then Toledo Banton who's scoring a lot but is probably going to take a he's gonna pee on your percentage is that once troubling but again if you just rack up enough stuff and then pray that he doesn't destroy your percents and getting three and four out of Banton could work as well I don't think I'd go much beyond that Matisse diebel is kind of an all across the board play we talked about him on the earlier show today so maybe I should have put him on this board because people on Twitter didn't necessarily see my morning show where I said I thought Bible was a guy you could just play I don't think he's a volume play right now I think he's in all formats play so  I got to get another board out with the injury replacement list that's where he falls Bibles a you know top 100 or better stream most of the names that I'm putting up here aren't  but get there because of volume of games played you know they're totals winners as opposed to per game  or really as opposed to both because for thighs on a team with a good schedule and has per game appeal hopefully that made sense  guess I need to clear that up over on social media  I'm gonna leave that graphic up  while we kind of wrap things up on today's show and that's basically it you know if you're  I guess the only thing I didn't bring up yet would be if you're looking at trying to make like a decision on who to start in a weekly format that may or may not be back this week I think Donovan Mitchell you got to sit him Larry marketing you got to sit him Devin Booker it sounds like he'll be back this week so get him fired up for Singas is a really hard one because he missed their game two days ago and ah he got ruled out late Sunday for the game today  so I I don't know that we see poor singers for more than two meaning two is a best case scenario so I think I'd probably sit him Steph you probably sit I know they're hoping to get him back mid-week but we don't have a guarantee of that they may be just getting optimistic it's just a three-game week for the warrior so I think you probably only get one game out of stuff one and a half would be sort of like the  if you're feel like it's a 50/50 shoddy plays in that midweek game against the Lakers ah let's see who else is not been ruled out for the entire week yet Jalen Williams in Oklahoma City I think you got to sit him it sounds like I mean he got ruled out pretty quickly if guys can't play through an ankle sprain I mean it's it's swelling up fast a lot of times guys play through it and then it gets worse overnight and for him it'll probably get worse overnight Jalen Johnson same thing I don't think you can play him this week in a weekly format Drew holiday will probably play in the other three games this week so he's he's generally good to go shengo and I would sit and an Obi I would sit vessel I would start Rudy gobert I don't know what the hell I would do with he was called right hamstring tightness so it doesn't sound all that bad and Minnesota has this super light schedule I think you probably have to sit go bare because if there's any chance at all he misses their game in La against the Clippers tomorrow then you get a one game her and that's just brutal so probably sit him and then yeah you can come back and kick me in the face if he plays in both but even still talking about a two game week so it's not like you're missing out on much again this is a discussion for  weekly League's only here at the end of the show anyways that's a game time decision that you really want to try to get in there their questionable  I think you make that if you can try to make that call later on if annual quickly  I don't like that hip flexor strain  one's gotta think he misses at least a couple of ball games I think I would sit him sit sucks  uh see if you can wait on getting the news on on Jeremy Grand they do that good schedule though so I love to be able to get him in there but it does feel like he's gonna be playing about two out of every three games so probably sit Grant and head to head  I think that's probably about as far down the board as you need to go sit Vince Williams  maybe he plays but you know what do you missing out on  it's not the end of the world there  and that's it that's your weekly stuff  all right we didn't keep it under 15 but I kept it under 20 good luck this week everyone we'll be back tomorrow again probably with the two fur morning recap midday streaming  we're gonna find a way through these damn playoffs and it's going to be because we maximize games or others do not  see you
