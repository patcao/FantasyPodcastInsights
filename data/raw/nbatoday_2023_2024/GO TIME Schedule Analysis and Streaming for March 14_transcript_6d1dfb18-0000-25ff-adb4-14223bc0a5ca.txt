welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast it's happening everybody it's our streaming show after noon Edition here on fantasy NBA Today want to get you guys maximized  volumize  we're like a great shampoo and conditioner combo here on fantasy NBA Today shampoo in the morning conditioner in the afternoon  we go on second we leave the hair silky and smooth  you guys want to know what's going on of course you do it's time to figure out where to drop our schedule plays today  this day is a little bit more clear than other days this week because  first of all there are very few options and then among those options there's some pretty obvious delineations between them  let's start with the teams that have the worst schedule's starting today so you know where you should be punting from team number one worst schedule in the NBA  your Los Angeles Lakers  Laker Girls  I can't do Lawrence tanter no one can do Lawrence Tanner one game the rest of this week and only one game the first four days of next week Lakers schedule is a disaster  disaster  why don't you anymore analysis to that  Fringe guys are obviously gone you're holding on to LeBron hold on an ad and then you're you're holding on to d low and you're barely holding on to Reeves I mean you gotta try to if you can but also if you're really up a creek and that's the guy you've got to us the bad schedule  then you got to do it  luckily they're not the only bad schedule because while the Lakers have a terrible scheduled to start next week there are actually quite a few teams that have an equally bad schedule the rest of this week just provided we don't go any deeper into the board and the Lakers lose out by quite a lot because a lot of these teams you know they got two game Lakers and these other teams have two games over six days like I think two games over five days actually but these other teams all play by Tuesday of next week and many of them roll into slightly better schedules thereafter either way though  the schedule the rest of this week  is awful one game over four days which matches up with what the Lakers have and these teams they're multiple this  multitudinous know  is that a word  yes word  yeah  all right didn't get that wrong Cleveland Golden State Indiana Memphis Minnesota Sacramento  six other teams besides the Lakers 17 in total have one game the rest of this week  luckily for you guys there are three teams that play three times the rest of this week  oh  I know  meaning there are multiple opportunities for you to turn a one game rest of week into a  three game three game rest of week yeah all hopped up on  Tootsie Pops  how many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop three is the correct answer and that's how many options you have this week to move  off the Bad teams seven bad schedules to  three good ones  those that are watching live with us on YouTube or on social media welcome to Fantasy NBA today that's for everybody actually you guys can

that's the promo stuff  what I failed to do here during the beginning of the show was to actually enlarge the picture of the schedule grid on your screen so you can see now we're at March 14th already  today you've got those three choices we mentioned  tomorrow if you were to wait it out there are not that many outstanding options but one very very very very very very good one tomorrow that stands out ahead of the pack that's the Utah Jazz so if you're holding in your league goes through next week you toss the team you want to do starting on Friday otherwise it's the stuff I already told you guys about and then Charlotte has a back-to-back starting tomorrow so that you could guess say is what relevant  but the stuff for today is really straightforward you know you got three teams two of them play it back to back today tomorrow the other one plays it back to back over the weekend and those are the teams where you want to Pivot to  so let's take that screen down for a moment  and I think we'll get a word from one or two of our partners so over on the belief Network  while I pull up your choices that you can use this week  those of you that are watching live just saw me stare blankly into the sky for about four seconds but that's where a commercial is going to go and maybe YouTube throws one in there hell if I know what do you get when you cross an elephant and a rhino  so here's your choices  I've already given you the teams that you need to move on from I didn't go into as much detail as frankly I should let's let's backtrack to that just for a moment here the teams with the bad schedules I told you about Lakers which again not a ton of what you'd call traditional fringy options on the Lakers Cleveland Golden State Indiana Memphis Minnesota Sacramento those 16s do have a bunch of Fringe options so Cleveland your Fringe options are Charis LaVergne George Sam Merrill Isaac okoro  it's probably it your Golden State Fringe options are I would even go so far to say Andrew Wiggins Brandon pajama ski trayce Jackson Davis  even Draymond Green frankly is fringe he's not as good as everybody remembers it's been about two three years since Draymond had a real top 100 season the only non even Klay Thompson frankly but you probably hold on to play cuz you're you know you're hunting threes it does muck up the build of your team if you lose his you know 12 plus 3 pointers every week but golden state has a bunch of guys that are French level Indiana's Fringe level guys would be like an Aaron Nesmith he's Fringe level right now TJ McConnell is fringe level a Halliburton Pascal miles turn to those the guys that you hold through this everybody everybody else basically is French level from Memphis you probably weren't head-to-head streaming many Grizzlies anyway because they're a you know those gonna play on a given night Minnesota gobert is a hold Anthony Edwards is a hold  I don't think in a head-to-head I don't think you need to hold nausea and then Sacramento your Fringe level guys would be Harrison Barnes Kevin herder  key on Ellis  Fox a bonus Keegan Murray those guys probably stay  we'll go above  the cut line  and I know you're like oh damn I only have like one of those guys okay yeah I get it so if you don't have a bunch of these one game weeks then maybe today's not the streaming day for you but I happen to have George and yang on  one team I happen to have a Nesmith on one team I  how do I have out there floating around I think I might I have a brand new pajama skiing one spot I believe know it's a but I don't know dropped him a while back teaching McConnell I have a couple of spots so niang was the one that I have in multiple places because the calves are coming off a pretty good scheduling stretch that's why I don't have that many of the other guys but you might you know maybe you were playing for the back-to-back that Indiana had  or the Memphis back-to-back I don't know you probably don't have any wolves because they're schedules been crap for a while now  Sacramento you probably don't have many other they had a back-to-back so maybe you took the plunge on a key on Ellis regardless of what you did to get you to this point  those guys are all droppable now in a one game week because the options even though there's some what limited mind you there's probably only three or four guys that are  maybe five that are usable and probably only like two of them aren't on rosters right now it's still better to get three games we did this math yesterday three games from a crap player versus one game from an okay one not a star but okay versus crap you almost always go with three because it's going to win out it just always does and other people in your league are not going to see it that way  which is a good thing for you  because they're gonna be out there looking at the schedule of who's playing tonight they're just gonna be like all right who's out there tonight that has an okay fill in Opportunity so Jacqueline Dale's gonna pick up get picked up in some spots out in Houston it Kobe White's missing a game in Chicago so maybe you'll see Torrey Craig or Andre Drummond get picked up and let's see Philly yeah Dallas with Luca out someone's probably gonna pick up  you know Tim Hardaway Jr  which might be worth it because he might take a ton of shots but you might also see someone like a Derek Jones or a Josh green or Dante eggs and get picked up or let's say Malik Beasley is out in Milwaukee and someone decides they want to go take a shot at him  freaking me by the way he's questionable we don't know what's up with Beasley yet but anyway the point is someone your league is going to look at the players tonight and say who's my good fill in option is it Dort in Oklahoma City there's a case in Wallace out there  but you know you're clever  you're looking at the three teams that have three games in four nights the rest of this week which is Phoenix the Clippers and Washington  those three teams play three games in four nights there aren't that many streaming options on them for Phoenix it's Royce O'Neill  that's it for the Clippers Terrence Mann  possibly Amir Coffey if we find out Kawhi Leonard and or James hardener out there both questionable for this ball game  Hailey bones Hyland but I don't trust him because the minutes are 18 to 20 range it's really not very much and then possibly Daniel theis but it's not great so probably more towards the man  coffee and then obviously Norman Powell he's out there and then with the Wizards Corey kispert is probably already picked up but if he's not he obviously becomes a very interesting one belal is an interesting one you probably don't go beyond that we got some questions about Tristan vukovich who's coming over from partizan Belgrade  I don't think he's playing tonight but even if he does I can't imagine the minutes are going to be all that high so you don't have that many choices for maybe what did I say four five players  but almost any one of those guys particularly and like obviously if Corey Kris out there picking up because three games of him the rest this week with guys out for the Wizards that's like that's golden but presumably he was already on a roster  so you're looking more at you know like a Terence man or Roi so Neil those are probably the guys that are on the waiver wire in your league and you're wondering is this worth it  and you're looking at Royce O'Neill's last game where he put up a goose egg in scoring here thinking is this actually worth it  and the answer is yeah  over some of those guys we talked about that were that were Fringe level or ever so slightly perhaps above Fringe level turning those guys into a three-game week even if it's someone that's not very good like a Terrence Mann it tends to be worth it and you can go and you can look at the numbers these guys have put up and you can say oh my God Terrence Mann these numbers are crap over the last two weeks like what is this someone that I really do I actually really need this dude on my fantasy team and the answer is no you don't really need them on your fantasy team but if you roll all three of those games together too bad ones and one good one you got three steals two blocks 30 points  four three-pointers you know a couple of rebounds couple of assists but he did it on decent percentages as well and you're just not gonna get that out of one game week and you're probably not going to get that out of a two game week from some of these other Fringe level guys you might you might get it out of a two game week you might  but it's so much safer to go three because what if you got two decent games out of Terence man what if you picked him up like look at his game log lately and you can see yeah there's some really quiet down games in there's a couple of okay ones what if your three game cross-section instead of being too bad ones and one good one what if it was too good ones in one bad one  what if it was not this most recent three but the very previous you know games two three and four going back  that's 38 points 5 boards six three-pointers this is why you tend to lean towards the three-game weeks  of all of these guys  we're actually Neil's probably my favorite because at least he gets a little bit of everything where you know Terrence Mann he doesn't really  assist he doesn't really get steals or blocks or so Neil does steal does block does hit threes does Rebound does assist its percentages are worse so that's why Terry's man sometimes has the edge there and if you're needing to win percentages that maybe is a reason to tip that direction  but these are guys that in three games you're almost guaranteed to get more than one of your dudes in one  you could look to see if there's a two game out there who's really really good  you know that's not  fully out of the question  if there's a two game or  who's like above way above the cut line  then you think about it I don't know who that would be  who is a guy play in two games or is this week who's really good who's sitting on waiver wives someone's probably pick that dude up all ready  right I mean you're probably in a pretty competitive spot in your head to head someone probably has them you know who are the guys that might go twice like but if Gary Trent played tomorrow that'd be a guy you'd pick up with two games instead of three and you might win out in that spot I'm looking at a competitive league guy man and like sorting by players that are hot over the last week two weeks  the guys with two games are still not good  I mean honestly Chuck lyndale's probably your best option of two Gamers and you're mostly hunting  field goal percent and some defensive stats with him you get two games out of that is that really gonna be better than three out of Terrence Mann I'm probably close  man probably I was out scores him three games to land Dale's two jock probably beats him in defensive stats rebounds  man almost definitely wins three pointers there  it's hard man it's hard to beat the three game or one you got one or two it's just such a massive  advantage to have an extra game or two  all right let's get this sucker posted for folks that are listening after the fact good luck tomorrow we'll have a big weekend review show in the late morning it's my kiddos a day at preschool where the parents come in we read a book and all that stuff so the morning is a bit chewed up we will not have our big week in review show until the later morning and then much closer to tip tomorrow afternoon we'll try to get a second show going that will be again more streamy but also kind of looking towards next week as well so we'll try to take you through the weekend guys that you can stash schedules leading into next week all that good stuff good luck tonight everybody let's try to hold on let's win this playoff week I'm Dan Bass Pro at Dan Bass Pro Sun social media I'll see you guys soon
