welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast and the way we go it is Buy Low Time on fantasy NBA today a specialty episode that I thought would be kind of fun because last time I think we did both bylaws  and sell Highs at the same time it felt like we were jamming in a lot of stuff so I've split them up  and I also figured out by doing a poll that people seem to like buy lows more than sell highs I don't know exactly why maybe it's that there's  more agreement  on Cell highs and with Bilo's the disagreement is sort of  staggered in that people don't know exactly how low they're gonna buy somebody or how to determine what they're going to get to  and so my hope is that we can actually hit on  all of that in today's show which again shot room is open but I'm probably not going to be doing questions this is going to be me lecturing at you we've got I believe five player's question mark that we're going to be covering today as my Bi-Lo's for week four and without further ado  well actually one more little to do one minor adieu I'm at the investors on social media I'm Dan Bass Pros and this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation at sports ethos.com ethos fantasy BK to get your NBA fantasy news over on the Twitter's ethos fantasy BK again I am at d a n b e s b r i s come find me there make sure to like subscribe and enjoy all of our stuff here either on YouTube with Spotify iTunes whatever podcast channels you might get it in  let's rock  Bilo's for week four  player number one and let's just jump right in and we're going basically in terms of ADP by the way I have organized them by where people expected them to be  Jaren Jackson Jr  we talked a little bit about him on the regular episode of fantasy NBA today because right now he is currently the number 46th player in nine category League's  with 20 and a half points one point six three-pointers 6.5 rebounds 2.3 assists 0.4 steals  I say again  0.4 Steals and 1.8 blocks I say again  1.9 turnovers also in the books but that is not a big deal  here's the thing JJJ has been in the NBA for more than half a decade now and  he has never averaged fewer than points 7 steals per game  in his NBA career at least since he's been playing closer to starters and this includes by the way the 2020 2021 season where he played a grand total of 11 ball games and only averaged 23 and a half minutes in those ramp up games even then he was at one point one  last year 1.0 year before that point nine going farther back point seven going farther back than that all the way to 2818 point nine  so that's the thing number one for JJ there's almost no way the steel stay as low as they have been  blocks also low at just one point eight now this is not the craziest thing for him but it is a little bit crazy because he's playing the greatest number of minutes he's ever played and yet blocks have taken a dive I don't know that we could expect last year to be replicated he blocked three shots a game in 28 minutes and 90s at 31 and a half minutes right now but the year before that he was at 2.3 blocks in 27 minutes and basically anytime he's been healthy  he's blocked around the number of shots were looking at right now and and is bigger problem earlier in his career was foul trouble  is at one point six blocks per game but he was constantly in and out of foul trouble and that was in 28 minutes so let's say 1.8 sticks  which I don't think it does I think it turns up but let's just say conservatively 1.8 blocks is where it stands  he's also down to 46 and a half Pursuit percent shooting because his three-pointers has gone back down a little bit he's under his career Mark free throws her around where you'd expect  so why then is JJ a by low well here's the thing all he asked to do is fix the steals alone adding another point six or so steals per ball game and he moves from the 40s probably into the 30s  if he adds any blocks beyond that up to in the low twos that probably gets him into the 20s and now you're talking about a guy who's really not all that far off where he was last year which again was basically because of the block shots we need to be clear about that there's no guarantee that JJJ gets back to top 12 it would take him getting pretty close to three blocks per game to get to that point or getting field goal percent back up over 50 but it always felt a little bit like the better shooting was more anomalous than the other stuff  assists are up scoring is up rebounds are about the same because minutes are up that's generally a good thing  so let's say that we assume JJJ can get into the 20s and I put on the YouTube screen them I Target is 20 or higher but 20 is the target what is it going to take to get him  that to me is one of the biggest questions in these Buy Low type shows because people you can come on you can say hey here's a Buy Low Target then people are like what the hell am I supposed to do with that I don't know what to do with it  I believe that right now  there's enough fear around JJ's low block number that you might be able to get him for someone in the 30s  I may be wrong about that but he ended up getting drafted in the early 20s and a lot of drafts and so early 30s is not all that far off where he was drafted meaning whoever took him wouldn't be feeling like they're taking that large of a hit  so someone like a Miles Turner who's a similar player  probably doesn't quite get it done  mostly because his stats are almost the same across the board other than a better field goal percent than JJ right like that's the big difference between those two guys and miles is 28  so like you can see all it takes to get Jared Jackson into the mid-20s  that's without adding the extra half a steal  someone like does jaunty Murray might get it done he's currently number 30 on a per game basis this season he probably doesn't go all that much higher than that although tonight with Trey young out that maybe a possibility for him to go a little bit sooner does jaunty might get it done if you've decided you don't want to hunt field goals lamelo ball might get it done I'm not saying that that's one that you should because if you drafted lamelo you probably took him around the same time that JJJ went in drafts probably actually a little bit sooner so you're probably building your team around whatever he was good at  so that probably doesn't get it done bam out of Bio who's blocks are up this year everything is kind of up for bam right now he's at 24 that probably gets it done Darren Fox who's averaging 30 and a half points that probably gets it done those are some options that you could throw out there I think that would probably get you JJJ next name on the board Damian Lillard and your eyes do not deceit deceive you YouTubers he basically has the same trade profile right now  as Jared Jackson does  which seems a little bit nuts because Lillard probably got drafted a little bit sooner but he's also been I would argue a bit worse or a bit  inconsistent is the word I'm looking for inconsistent enough to where people might be getting a bit more frustrated with him then they were with JJJ so there's this balance yes he got to Consumer people I think are a little bit more frustrated  as far as nine cat rank goes he's almost right next to JJ also name is number 409 so he's like two or three slots behind Jerry Jackson depending on what board you're looking at  averaging only 23 points 2.33 pointers 4.3 boards 4.8 assists a steal basically no blocks 37% from the field high volume 93% at the free throw line and 2.9 turnovers  so here's the thing about Dame he hasn't taken 15.9 shots per game in a season since 2013 first time in a decade he's been this low  is that a guarantee that that number goes up  no it's not  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no

drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's drizly.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  they have Giannis on that team  if you honest ever misses ballgame again which we saw I left during that Detroit game took 25 shots so that is definitely on the table  but there's no guarantee that game game gets more than 17 shots per game specially when you figure he's getting these you know nine ten free throws at night that's still waiting to the usage stuff but he's not gonna go back to being what he was last year which was 10 free throws in 21 shots in Portland  there's just not that much usage of available in Milwaukee  he shooting very poorly from everywhere that's what you need to be focused on if you're thinking about a Damian Lillard situation the assists will likely be lower this year there's this this backwards way of thinking where people like oh well he's got Giannis on his team now so he's gonna get more assists know  guys that get assisted the guys that have the ball to start a play  Demons gonna have the ball to start the play Less in Milwaukee this year  then he had in Portland last however many years X you've fill in the number and that all of those answers are correct so no he's probably not getting back into the middle of the first round like he was when he was with the Blazers  and frankly  after watching the way things are going I don't know that he gets into the front end of the second round  but mid to late second round still feels like a very easy target for Dame because right now he is a massive massive field goal percent drag  37% 16 shots per game he is one of the worst field goal percent guys in the NBA right at this exact moment  third worst  by weighted impact I believe behind Trey young who's similar percentage but 19 shots and Julius Randle who was all World bad from the field so far this year 34% on 17 shots per game  but that's not what Dame is bent at least not in recent history if you go back far enough he was in the you know 4241 43 range but since 2019 he's pretty much been 45 406 other than the abdominal half-season where he shot 40% other than that 44 456  and 3% I mean if you want to look at field goal percent alone he's shooting 27% from downtown so far this year he's career 37 and when he's more open you might even argue he's more like 39 or 40  free throws fine that's all pretty standard  but again we're making the adjustment for a thing that we feel very confident is going to change and we know that when Lillard starts hitting his shots and he's gonna go on a freaking heater at some point here so  even better if you're buying low  he is I believe on his way inside the top 25 probably inside the top 20 so that's why I put 20 as the target range on the slide that you're looking at on the YouTube screen  I think it's going to take more to get Dame than its that it would to take JJ just because of name power  so I don't think that Deontay Murray gets it done  I don't even know that Batman had a bio gets it done but I would certainly try it Darren Fox might because he's off to it insane start so far this year and I think we can feel pretty comfortable he's not gonna average 23 shots a game all season long so the 30 and a half points probably starts to come back to earth would Desmond Bane get it done probably not if you had gone with Paul George prior to the hardened arrival that probably would have gotten it done Larry Markin wouldn't be an insane person to throw out there because his block number is almost definitely going to slide steals probably also slide a little bit for marketing if the other stuff mostly stays about the same that'll drop him back towards the latter half of the second round  and I know this is gonna sound insane because you'd be giving up durability but Anthony Edwards who's kind of peaking out at around number 25 and 9 cat right now where the turnovers are maybe a little bit high but you know free throw percentage way up feel percent is up steals are good scoring threes rebounds assists all that stuff is basically where you'd want it to be when you drafted Anthony Edwards and now you just have to kind of hope the free throws a hold with the turnovers coming down that's the only way he moves forward where Dame has a long way to jump forward  probably could have gotten him for someone like Kawhi Leonard before the hardened trade that probably won't get it done now lamelo ball I know I threw him out in the last one I would rather have Damian Lillard than the Mellow ball going forward because I don't think lamelos percentage is really changed all that much from where they are right now maybe scores a little bit more that would be the hope there but that teams Well everybody's injured tonight as I record this podcast no Gordon Hayward miles Bridges still not back yet Terry Rozier still out but as they get healthy he likely does similar or less to what Dame is doing LeBron would be someone I'd flip out there he's had to do way more early this season because of three four eight Lakers being hurt if any of those guys you think would get you Damian Lillard I would venture to try it give it a go  next day on the board Freddie Van Fleet so now we're moving down the list a little bit and this one's a small Bi-Lo  son's a very small by low but I think it's one that can be pulled off pretty easily because for Van Vleet the downtick this year is not where everybody thought it was gonna be  so remember last season we got 16.1 shots per game  this year you want to know many shots he's taking 15.3  you want to Buddy the assists so you're over here last season 7.2 this year 7.9 yeah I know 19.3 points last year 17.2 points this year is free throws are actually down a tiny bit that's the biggest gap for him but the threes are almost exactly the same again the assists are up rebounds are ever so slightly down but you know some of this stuff can level off over time field goal percent is within about 1% of last season where is the big gap for Freddy vanderley  steals  last year he was at 2.4 combined defensive stats this year he's eighteen point nine  believe whatever you want about Freddie he's always gotten steals  and we've seen I believe the thing that everybody was most concerned about was that he wasn't getting to do as much stuff on a team that people were like oh they got all these Gunners on offense but Freddy still getting his shots  Freddy to get his  well what Freddie's not doing is getting steals  the last time you was under one steal per game was 2018 he only played 27 minutes per game that year and he was still a point nine and the year before that he was eighteen point nine while playing 20 minutes a game which is basically like the beginning of his real NBA career since he's played starters minutes largely under Nickerson Toronto which I get everybody sort of whacking away at Steeles 1.9 one point seven one point seven one point eight maybe he doesn't get all the way into the ridiculously high ones in a different defensive setup in Houston Under email but he ain't gonna be at 0.6  so this is a small Bi-Lo because folks might be looking at Van Vliet and thinking oh he's outside the top 50 what's going on with him he's just not as good this year but again the tweak on steals getting him from 0.6 to say 1.2 or something like that that jumps in by around and a half or even two rounds and everything else levels off  and that's the difference between last year and this year you heard it everything else is almost exactly the same  and last year he was number 20 basically well what was the actual number  19 and this year it's a 64  all because of basically  you know one and a half to defensive stats per game  that's gonna Trend up for him he hasn't like lost so many steps that he can't come back  and I think you could get him for somebody who's ranked relatively close to him because I think people are like oh Freddie Van Fleet is like 50 to 60 range guy this year he's just not gonna be that top 20 dude anymore so look around look at a Drew holiday whose number 54 I think Freddy passes him on his way up the board  look at ah something these guys are not gonna get it done DeMar DeRozan who's 45 and now Chicago's got all these these trade things flopping around he probably is an opportunity to net you Freddie Van Vleet looking up the board I don't know if I'd go as high as Michael Porter Jr who's off to a crazy good start this year that might be an opportunity to be to grab Tyler hero if he wasn't hurt so maybe as he gets closer to coming back you could throw them in the mix  I don't think to buy his hair is gonna be enough to get it done but obviously if you was you would certainly do it and if you look at guys that are behind Van Vliet on the board or really close to him other names I would consider Jalen Duren you get out from wherever this ankle stuff is I love Jalen Duren but the ankle stuff does actually concern me who else is nearby Freddie Van believe that might get it done  not many of these guys actually so you probably have to look a little bit above him Keegan Murray's had two gigantic games in a row that's a possibility us our Thompson I'd hate to treat him away because he's been so fun so far but that would probably get you Freddie Van Lee and so all of these guys are just gonna get you like two rounds of value on a small Buy Low but one that I still like a player number four do I have two more guys yeah two more guys Brooke Lopez we've talked about him plenty on the show the main episodes of the show but let's get him in there he's nine rank is his nine cat rank is currently 97 or 96 depending on where you're looking 10 points four rebounds two threes over two blocks 0.8 steals shooting just 40.7% from the field and 67% of the free throw line I know he doesn't take that many of them but this is just not the Brook Lopez that we know is coming  yes his usage is definitely down  like you know I'm not all that concerned about it  because I think eventually you see his minutes creep up a little one maybe two minutes per ball game to get him back to kind of you know more like what he was his first season in Milwaukee nine and some odd shots per game even 45% from the field which by the way would be somewhat surprising because since he's been healthy without a back issue in Milwaukee he's shot 50 and 53% in those two seasons since his shop profile became a little bit more two pointer heavy and this year it's all three balls right now that's why the field goal percent is down five of his eight and a half shots per game from downtown they got to get him a little bit closer to the rim but everything else is about where you'd want it you know almost two three pointers a game over two blocks per game the Steel's number is solid the rebounds are down mostly because the minutes are down from last year but I think between four and five was always kind of what we expected right now the big thing to look at is field goal percentage again although free throw number is also very low for him he's a career 80 percenter and I know you know one to two free throws a game doesn't feel like a lot but  you remove what's been a small negative on his value and turn that into a neutral and you take the field goal percent and take that negative out and turn it into a new troll all of a sudden he just it's like you don't even realize it's happening he creeps up the board in little itty bitty stages and he goes from 90 to or 95 to 65 that's all it takes is for him to get back near his career percentages basically to go from 90 to 60 and then any small increase in usage over that is kind of the gravy so I put the target rank of 75 I think he can beat that but I also think that you can get him for less than that right now so look around your board Brook Lopez is in the 90s there's some guys in the 90s that have more name power than Brooke Lopez but aren't gonna move up the board the way that I think he is those are the guys you should be looking at like a Franz Wagner who's scoring 19 points per game I don't think there's a whole lot going on there shaedon Sharpe has been putting up a big scoring numbers but his field goal percent is a drag his turnovers are a drag  maybe you hold on to Sharp because Portland goes into full tank mode but you're kind of seeing full tank mode right now dude's already playing 40 minutes a ball game which that ain't holding without him getting hurt if you have Zach Collins that's someone I would throw out to see if you could get Brooklyn Lopez if you have John Collins that's someone I would throw out to see if you could get Brook Lopez for him  even someone like a Dennis Schroder would probably get it done because he's a big assist guy people love assists and forget about blocks all the time I think Brooke Lopez passes these guys over the next few weeks and that's the way that you can potentially cash in on that here's our fifth and final oh no what happened  where's my last one did I skip a person oh for for Pete's sake well I have one more and I seem to have misplaced the slide because apparently I'm a moron what did I do with it  ah I wrote over the slide oh poor form Dan well the last slide that I didn't get a chance to put up was cam Johnson so let me see if I can find him on Yahoo we'll just share that screen and you guys can see Cam and his face in very large fund  here we go hold on everybody hold on I get this act together here  all right there's Camp Johnson we'll just pull up his Yahoo page he's averaging only 12 points five boards and an assist  so far this season his current rank is like 250 or something ridiculous like that but we know that that's not gonna stick and that's that's what makes this so simple is that  he's shooting 36% he's career 45 percenter he shooting 29% from from downtown on Seven Trees per game he's a career 39% from downtown he's shooting 75% at the free throw line he's 84% in his career and we just got news today that Ben Simmons is likely out for we don't even really know how long also cam Johnson uh  when he plays 30 some odd minutes a game he's like a 1.2 1.3 steals per game kind of guy and right now he's eighteen point seven hasn't blocked a shot yet in the only three games he's played so expect an uptick in minutes expect an uptick in blocks steals  not assists or rebounds those are fine free throw percent threes and field goal percent his whole game almost isn't equilibrated yet and I get it people are probably not going to be all that inclined to trade him away because if they sat if they drafted him they sat on him during this early season injury they're probably gonna want to see what they're going to get out of him  however there may be a little bit of fear that he's not going to get to 60s or wherever they drafted him and so if you can pry cam Johnson for some of those players we were talking about in The Brook Lopez range you do it like a shade and sharp or Fraud's Wagner or even a Brooke Lopez himself all the he's not really exactly a sell high right now  other names that you could consider I mentioned John Collins kcp he's probably not gonna get it done shrewd um D'Angelo Russell would be an interesting one because we've seen the Lakers kind of go away from him down the stretch Mike Conley if that would get it done Draymond Green who is not going to shoot 89% at the free throw line up there are a lot of names right now that I think could get you Cam Johnson Jonas Valentino's would be a great one because he's averaging one and a half blocks per game so far this year that ain't gonna stick Aaron Gordon who's shooting 55% from the field and has two and a half defensive stats a lot of these guys are on their way down if we were to do a sell High show wink wink nod nod that's a guy you could pair up to go get yourself cam Johnson and basically steal like a sixth round draft pick for someone that was a late pick or even a waiver wire grab at this point so somebody's getting sick of him that's the way you go  some of the chat room says cam Johnson looks slow yeah it's because he hasn't been healthy yet this year  that's the perfect time to get him you know he's folks can see on their screen he's 27 years old he's in his prime I promise you he's not slowing down yet he just hasn't gotten his legs underneath him what did he play two games got hurt and then came back and and had a game where what did he play in his last time we played one game got hurt and then come back play 25 minutes and then 35 minutes and his shot is all over the place  but he got steals in that first game of the year and he hasn't had one sits all this stuff is going to come around for him we know enough about his game to know what's up and again with no Ben Simmons around that's just more for everybody so have at it ladies and gentlemen and that is me for getting to make that last slide I want to keep the show to a half an hour which is basically where we're at right now thank you everybody for tuning in there was no promo in the middle of the show but I am gonna remind you all
