welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  oh we got no games on this Tuesday but why not make it too far on the podcast front this is episode one of two on this lovely Tuesday Morning fantasy NBA today I'm your host Dan Vespers and we're gonna demo kind of a new type of show I've been wanting to do this actually well frankly for a couple of years but it's only this season that my younger child is finally in preschool for more than three hours a day and that opened up a little bit of time so it's the official first episode of a buy sell weekly feature here on fantasy NBA today and I am very excited to have a guest for the first episode of this by selfie feature we'll kind of see how it goes the great Raphael Johnson over at Rotoworld NBC what's what's accurate right now it's back to Rotoworld right it is back to thank goodness confusing for us to but yeah we're back to I guess you'd say square one so it's a good Square to be here first episode yeah first Buy sell show by the way can I just and I don't want to spend too much time on the whole name change thing but I know we went through one as well we were hoop ball for a while became Sports ethos when we added other sports to the mix because we weren't just Hoops anymore but for you guys Rotoworld is such a strong powerful brand I mean that was like basically the only site in fantasy for the better part of like a decade and a half so it's really nice to have you back to Road a world that makes all of our Lives I think a lot easier but by the way you can find Ralph on Twitter at Rafael j r a p h i e l e j I want to spell that for the folks that are either not watching or listening after the fact and I'm going to just basically be kind of lightning rounding it a little bit here with names Roth and I want you to let me let everybody know  is what we're seeing real is it going to get better is it going to get worse is it going to roughly stay the same we'll go through some of the Buzzy name some of the big news that's going on right now and then maybe the thing that people are most interested in which is some high draft picks that have been underperforming pretty dramatically through the early part of the season is it time to panic is it time to wait is it time to buy potentially are are you comfortable is my only question before we dive into this I am comfortable all right we can help the listeners and viewers too all right let's get it going um I don't have any visual aids for today's show so folks are just gonna have to remember the names that we're talking about and the first one that I wanted to start with we'll go rookies first because everybody knows that I am generally afraid of them I did have Chet Holmgren on my target list which is very weird for me it felt strange and unusual to not have a super old player as one of the guys I was looking at but let's just start with Chet is what we've seen so far a sustainable number for him he's number 11 in nine category leaks right now 17 points 8 boards a block two and a half blocks a steal two three-pointers 56% from the field 90% at the free throw line some pretty juicy stuff going on there can he maintain that or are there things that are likely to come back down to earth a little bit I don't think he'll be a first round guy for the whole season that's more byproduct of some of the guys behind them I think you've seen some slow starts guys make possibly rebounding as injury situations in the like clear up but in terms of hungry and you really have to like the defensive production you know the high percentages that he's putting forth those are areas that I think you can maintain so I think if anything it's just more thinking about who's behind them and who can possibly surpass them guys with higher usage rates who may be underperforming right now  I think he can be like a third round guy I think a few of us like there's no way there's two rounds difference between him and Victor woman is good as Victor is and has been thus far chat to know standing player himself and his own right and I think that may have been forgotten do the fact he missed all of last season so  I'm not buying him being a first round guy but I don't think he's gonna fall off very much Beyond do you think and this is gauging public perception which is kind of a hard thing to do especially this early in the season do you think that there's a sell Market on chat or do you think the best move is just to ride it out because it's going to be pretty darn good even if it's not quite all the way this good I'm holding um because we also haven't seen him with the other Jalen Williams in the rotation you know who had a very good rookie season out of Arkansas I think he led the NBA in charges drawn last year to use kind of his selling point in college as well being able to pair up chat with like a physical big that may be able to take his game to another level in some respects especially the shot blocker being able to play off the balls kind of like that center field type player in a sense so we haven't seen that yet that would be the reason why I would hold because if that works out maybe I'm completely wrong and he will be a first round player for the whole season  let's move over to Victor who was the next one on the board that we were going to talk about and you mentioned him anyway in passing their weapon Yama right now there was fear that he might sit out the back to back he did not his numbers are not that different than homegrowns other than the percentages in fact right now there within two and a half points of each other they're rebounds are almost a dead heat I think home we're going to have like maybe one assist on him when banana something like point two or point three defensive stats but Victor 46% from the field 76% at the free throw line and then not surprisingly much higher turnover number because well the ball is just sort of in his hands to begin plays a little bit more often he's currently ranked 40th and 9 cat higher than that in eight have we seen I mean I it's like putting the ball on the tee with the way I was about to phrase that question but have we seen the ceiling yet for Victor and assuming you're gonna say no to that first part how long how long do folks do you think need to wait to see even more out of him because it's pretty impressive already mm-hmm yeah we haven't reached that point and I don't think the ceiling is going to be dependent on what he does the reason why I say that they've been playing without a true point guard and it starting lineup you know it's been Jeremy Sohan so he's effectively learning on the job I thought with trade Jones is to starter even though he's not the sexiest point guard option having a true point guard out there can be beneficial to Victor because we've seen it times where he's gone stretches without the basket ball I'm kind of just floating on the perimeter maybe looking for the blog guys not finding him I think that's something where the healing where he can you know push things up even higher than what he is right now you certainly have to like what you what you're seeing that's far  I think the biggest question is going to be just Gregg Popovich stick with sohn at the point all season long and if he does this is so hunt and terms of getting advice guys involved or does he go back to a more traditional point guard so I think that's the biggest question for me is there any kind of trade market for Victor wembanyama I'm assuming the answer to this is no because people basically drafted him at whatever it was 15 18 range like you can't buy on that no one's gonna give up Victor right now it feels like the only move here is wherever he is just see what happens because it's gonna be fun  yeah pretty much I'm sure we'll get into some big sort of kind of underperformed as far later in the show but you're not going to be able to put them on the board in exchange for victim women Yama at this point yeah that's kind of what I figured I want to do one more rookie because Victor and Chet those are the giant named rookies but there's actually another one out there who's in my eyes been maybe more impressive which okay fine perhaps that's a bit hyperbolic but whatever and that's awesome our Thompson who's been unbelievable so far his Fantasy game I think we like we knew that there was this  this this like defensive stats we were going to be rebounds you know they're going to be a but I think at least me personally I thought there was gonna be this big learning curve at the beginning of the year and we already got this this unbelievable line from him and in what game sicks for steals four blocks nine boards four assists in that ball game he's been he's been crazy so far what do you think the rest of this season holds for us our tops and he's been outstanding I think he became the for either the first Pistons rookie your first Pistons player since Grant Hill in 94 they have Force deals and back-to-back games and you watch his defensive instincts the young man clearly knows what he's doing on that end of the floor just why Monty Williams put him in his starting lineup and he's not going anywhere anytime soon I think maybe we underestimated him just because of the fact that he was playing off the ball a lot over time Elite was twin brother was on the ball so maybe we the offensive questions overrode what else he can bring to the table you know so I think that may have played a factor into it  if you have him I don't think there's any way on selling him because you're in a category League  this guy can win you steals almost by himself in the giving weeks so  the percentages have been solid  I really like what he's doing this far so yeah he's a firm hold  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game-winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily

drizzly.com that's dri z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations for me I'm blown away like you know the free throw percentage at 82 the field goal percentage has been at relatively low but he's not taking that many shots so far and it feels like that's a number that could even go up as this as the season progresses I agree that because he he's already earned the trust of money Williams and I think the more minutes you get and under those circumstances the more opportunities you will have to score the basketball now I just need to get Cade Cunningham to stop giving away possessions and I think we'll be on this up yeah and he's actually one of the players that we have dialed up for later in the show and actually frankly we can just we can just jump to Kate let's just stay in Detroit on this one because it has been a rough start for him this is I don't want to say a little bit of an I Told You So for me but it's a little bit of an I Told You So for me because he's he went he was starting if we go back to all the way to think when leagues opened in in early August at Yahoo at least that's where I was running off of and his ADP was something like 5th 50 and every two weeks it seemed like he was going six seven slots sooner and at a certain point you're starting to think okay well this is like how far can he get pushed up the board a guy who does have those turnover and feel  goal percent issues but this isn't about knocking Cade because right now he's at number 193 I think we all know that's not something that's gonna last and in eight cat he jumps like 110 slots because he's at five and a half five and a half I repeat again five and a half turnovers per game this is like rust playing with his eyes closed type of number 23 still has 23 points two and a half threes seven assists the defensive stats are not where they were in his rookie season you got to figure those are coming back this as much as I like to again this is a little bit of like an early season Victory lap for me at the same time it also feels like a pretty intense by low on him both of those things can be true right  yeah I would say so um because like you meant the turnovers or what's playing and down right now now the field goal percentage in great things little under 42% but I can see him getting that up to 44 yeah I don't think it's out of the rental possibility because he's a gifted offensive player it's just that the decision making right now hasn't been on maybe that's partially due to the rest because he missed a large chunk of last season yeah getting getting used to different pieces on that on the floor and also you don't have like a boy on bogdanovich not like the greatest player in terms of fancy value but he's a consistent offensive option if they don't have out there right now so maybe getting him back eventually can help but if that comes at the expense of us our Thompson I don't think that's going to happen you know so it's he's gonna have to figure something out but the decision-making really has to improve  no way can you averaged five and a half turnovers per game for an entire season I sincerely hope not yeah I think you just kind of banking on turning things around in that category if anything yeah I mean that's like such a severe weight on everything that's going on right now this is here's the tougher part for Cade by the way he's number 69 and 8 cats so the difference there 130 slots because of the turnovers but that's not even the main point the main point is like you said it's sort of him against the universe right now on offense with no boy on and  I don't want to give Alec Burks too much credit but he was actually kind of helpful Yeah couple of ball games he was upright before he got hurt those things matter to have guys that can space the floor guys that can do stuff with it on offense when you get them the ball and so for Kate it's like I don't know where anybody's gonna be I don't have spacing around me all those things feel like they're gonna get better but now my question for you rock and again talking to Raphael Johnson of Rotoworld at Rafael J on Twitter how high does cade get does he get to where he was drafted which was like 25 to 35 range or are you buying now maybe with more of a Target like 50 or 60 what are you looking for him to get to if you were gonna try to buy low on him right now  yeah I don't think he's he's gonna get to where a lot of people drafting I had him like mid-30s I don't think he's gonna get to that point you're hoping he can get to top 50 by Seasons end  but I don't know if it'll be there so I'm thinking like top 75 you know if you're looking to buy low you're kind of hoping for that type of ceiling for him in 9 cat  yeah but I think the point you made about spacing is is huge because Monty Williams is really valuing the defensive end of the floor killing Asia starting for that reason but as we all know he really doesn't offer much from a spacing stamp he does not so the one guy who could potentially do that as Jade and Ivy but he's been out with illness recently and even before that his minutes were decreasing because he's a liability defensive width so if anything would a potential Partnership of Kate and Marcus Sasser makes sense you know the market Saturday didn't play well Tuesday but he had a good run of games there recently he can she's a capable shooter but does that make sense you know that I think there's so many questions there from a spacing standpoint that if you buy low your banking on the Pistons kind of figuring it out eventually  let's go to the next at I wanted us to talk about James Harden for a minute but we're sort of into these underperforming Stars mode so let's actually let's just keep going on that front and I'll work my way up a list of that I sent Rock before we got on air the next name is Pascal siakam whose he was another one that was kind of a weird Draft Day play because we didn't know if he was gonna be in Toronto All Season the Hope was that if he was in Toronto All Season that with Freddie Van Vale gone that everybody would just sort of get a little bit more so far basically everything that Van Vleet was doing has gone to Scotty Barnes almost like almost everything and Dennis Schroder who's doing way more than I expected this year too what's what do we make of Pascal's slow start because not only is he shooting the ball very poorly which is the kind of thing where you can say okay that's like 41% from the field that's not a number that's gonna hold but the field goal attempts are way down for Seattle come right now are you concerned are you buying are you selling where does the season go for soccer  I'm very concerned and I'm selling I'm interesting  because the reason why I say this like there's also the variable of not knowing what type of offensive system they're going to run and new head coach obviously so things changed the spacing  hasn't been great I would say it's been more geared towards Barnsley I don't know if Barnes and sustain a perimeter shooting that he's that he's provided thus far see him used to just drop like six percentage points yeah and you talk about a guy who's had the ball in his hand so much that's a serious decline so if you're buying on him I think you're kind of banking on a on an in-season trade  and at that point you have to assume that he would be moved to a contender  and what's his usage going to look like there you know I don't think there's a guarantee as you used to just gonna you know Spike up with a change of scenery so  the skill you would expect that he has enough in his toolbox kind of make up for the poor shooting and other areas but it really hasn't happened as far so  I'm leaning sell right now to be honest with you see a yeah I'm a little worried myself I think maybe it's a little bit like what we just talked about with Kade where he is going to be better than he is so far but is he gonna get to a point where buying on him makes sense and it feels like the answer to that is kind of a know like you could buy low on him but you're still gonna have to pay a decent price in a trade and it might not be cheap enough yet now if he keeps this up for another week or two then you might get to a point where that price is so the price is right kind of thing maybe there is then value for him to to exceed that a little bit let's keep moving up the board Karl Anthony towns is the next one I wanted to talk about he's off to an interesting start because his team is winning which I also feel really good about it I was high on the Wolves this year I thought Mike Conley was gonna be a nice stabilizing force a lot of things for cat look pretty good so far it seems like the the main pieces in Minnesota are are coexisting better than they did last year the Steals and blocks haven't completely evaporated like they had I think the year before like the steals are a little higher blocks are about the same this last year rebounds are ticking back up a tiny bit assists her little bit down  and it really feels like we're off the one thing that's jumping out as a ridiculous number is that cat is shooting what like 38 39% from yeah that's that feels unsustainably low right yeah yeah I think it'll bounce back the man did Proclaim himself the best shooting big man of all time gotta be confident man yeah I I respect the confidence I'm a Dirk Nowitzki guy personally but you know whatever um yeah he's not gonna shoot 38% for the whole season I think it'll be okay I think you can get that back to mid 40s at minimum so I'm not too concerned about him you know as you mentioned he's doing a lot of the other things well so I think he'll be okay personally I think you can afford to wake this out if you have him roster yeah and just like scanning all these peripheral numbers he's probably not going to be the cat of four years ago or whatever when there wasn't an Anthony Edwards there wasn't a Rudy gobert you know he was taking 18 shots and seven free throws a game and he was basically just trying to do everything for that team but it feels pretty reasonable like right now his field goal attempts are pretty much in line with two seasons back and the big drop off there is 14% field goal largely because he couldn't throw a three-pointer in the ocean right now is it I think 24% from downtown but everything else seems kind of fine for him so then this gets us to the second half of the caddy equation which is what do we think it would take to get him because he was largely drafted in that kind of I'd say 18 to like 26 range you're not gonna spend that much to get him because then you're just paying Draft Day price if you could get him Ralph let's I'm going to throw some numbers out here if you could get him for someone rolling at Top 40 is that cheap enough to do it for you  I think it is I would definitely do that you know if you go top 40 player for towns even though we know his shooting struggles right now he's still top 100 so we're not asking him to do too much to make that leap to where his Draft Day value was as opposed to see him like earlier outside of the top one 50 and you want him to get the 30 I don't think that's going to be manageable even if this early point in the season so yeah I would definitely spend time for you to get towns like I could use a couple of names I'm just gonna hit you with a few names Guys near that range that might get it done would you give away Evan Mobley to get cat back oh yeah I'm gonna try to make these kind of hard I think I would I think I would but it's tight  yeah that one's tight just because it's a similar situation in terms of the roster construct you know he's playing next to Jared Allen cats playing next to Rudy gobert so I think that one's kind of a toss-up  yeah what about  I think I'm going cat on that one by a nose what about miles miles Turner is number 39 ranked right now which way do you go on that one  that was a hard one for me all so  yeah because of the blocks yeah and Miles has been in a bunch of blowouts so it's only playing about six minutes a game so far I might  might still go cat  bearly  yeah it'll be tough because within the span of a week that patients have been involved in two games where the winning team is scored over 100 yeah it's crazy that doesn't feel like something that that roller coaster getting blown out one week and then you blowing out the next I don't think that's gonna happen throughout the whole season so  I think Turner's minutes will improve yeah that's tough yeah it's a hard one Alpine Alpine shengwen here's another hard one I'm going I think I'm going cat there as well  yeah shingun has been really good thus far he doesn't bring that as much defensive production as I'd want from a center  yeah and plus he's got other variables around him down there in Houston I think cat would be a bit more sustainable so I would make that move but the other two I'm not so sure about all right let's do a couple more of underperforming superstars so far I probably should have organized these better because I I think I I think I put all of the ones at the beginning that didn't seem like they were coming back and now I think I've got all the ones at the end that do kind of seemed like they're coming back but let's talk about Trey young is the next one of the board um it's not that it's been like a bad start to the year he's number 75 and 9 cat and a lot of that is because of the two categories we were gonna be problematic for him turnovers and feel goal percent let's keep this one simple I'm gonna I'm not even sure I need to put his face up on the screen is Trey young gonna shoot 33 and a half percent all this damn season no yeah that was an easy way  but okay so let me actually let's go straight off let's go straight into the harder part of this which is what do you think it would take to get him in a trade right now because I don't I feel like the person that has Trey is thinking well I'm basically getting what I drafted at this point  hmm yeah  yeah I don't know you have to give up  I don't know if you'd have to give up a little more than towns in terms of that that draft value but I think you're in that ballpark  just because we know what trade brings to the table even with the shooting intern over issues you know he's averaging what 22 and 10 based on what you got on the screen there so  yeah you're not gonna be able to get him at a discount even with the shooting struggles because  he's gonna get over 40 I would assume you know at some point so yeah I don't you're probably gonna be giving up say third round value I think if you wanted to trade for them at this point yeah but maybe worth an exploration I don't know that it's gonna get done because someone's gonna be probably clinging to what he does very tightly they drafted him saying look this is a guy where I need the points I need the assists I don't really want to mess up my team construct and it isn't really like there's a guy near there in that 30 range that's a big assist dude you could give back that you think is gonna finish behind Trey I think most of the assist guys that are ranked in the 30s right now are also guys you think probably are headed up the board or at least I do like Kyrie at 31 is 8 assists a game right now I probably finished his head of Trey Young on a per game basis this year little things like that so I don't know that there's a great match for this one this last one I think could be more fun and that's demonic bonus and I don't know that anybody's really noticed that he's gotten off to a slow start but because probably because the rebounding assist started  as high as usual he's at 13.2 boards per game he's at almost six assists per contest  but his ranking is not where people expected and so that has if the the manager if so bonuses manager and a fantasy league is aware it may have created a little bit of a bubble here I think he's ranked at like 80 I mean double check myself on this 906 yeah or 92 yeah a lot of it feels like it's free-throw related so are you are you buying a turnaround for sabonis do you think he gets up into the you know near 20 where he was last year do you have any concerns about what you've seen so far with him  I think the free throw shootings are concerned just because his attempts are slightly higher than what they were last season things five five and a half per game last year that 5.8 right now  he's like a 73% career foul shooter so you have to assume that the Improvement will come at some point  man I would if I have him I would hold just because a lot of the other numbers are still fine the biggest thing in addition to the free throw percentage is biggest things actually deer and fox ankle injury for one because they they look like a ship without a captain without him those two blocks in Houston to clear examples of that and so they're checking out sabonis is left knee on the bench the fourth quarter of Tuesday's loss of the Rockets that's the other concern but I think I would kind of he's a hold for me right now I think the free throw percentage will come back around eventually all right last question for you off before we wrap things up what do you make of the James Harden deal with the Clippers just from a broad standpoint and then all so we got our first look at the James Harden Clippers yesterday which again everybody's gonna be wildly overreacting to trying to insert a player like that into it a team that has all these so many moving pieces of course it was going to be ugly I if I wasn't chasing multiple kids around I would have bet my house at the club was loose that ball game last night so with the  with the sort of pre copy of that people should not overreact to one ball game what do you think happens from a fantasy standpoint with hardened with Kawaii with Paul George even with Russ who had gotten off to a surprise him with efficient start this year I gotta give credit where credit's due he was way better that first two weeks how much of a hit do you guys take do guys take a hit what what's your how do you play this out because there's this Arc that happens with things like this yeah I think you have to exercise some patience here a lot of us may have assumed that that Westbrook be the one to take a hit I thought he was largely fine against Nicks on Tuesday it felt like all those guys still trying to feel each other out in terms of where they want the ball  when you attack for their own when they moved the ball what not so it's going to be a feeling out process in terms of Westbrook that could potentially be a good thing in a short term because less time with the ball in his hands may keep the turnovers and check we see that but an issue be an issue with him throughout his career  yeah I think I'm exercising patience here I think  I still believe he's the one who potentially takes a hit if anything Leonard and George should be fine because they do so much defensively and they're efficient basketball players offensively too where the old boy too much of a drop off  hardened the days of him being that first round fancy play I think along gone um even though he was very good last year in Philadelphia  with the Stars they have is he gonna have the ball in his hands enough to be that type player with the Clippers I don't know if he's gonna beat that but I think he can still be an effective fancy guy we got a lot of questions in the chat room but I want to just highlight one that sort of Buy sell related and to those that are are watching live I probably should have been clearer if you have questions for this show I was hoping that they would be more of a buy sell variety as opposed to like who should I bench tonight if you guys have those questions feel free to bring them over I'm going to be still doing a daily recap show that's coming up I'll probably start that 15-20 minutes after the conclusion of this one but this question from Ryan do you see Dame Lillard making a big jump with his current play he had a gigantic season opener had a bunch of really quiet ones and then had another good one what do you see the rest of his season Roth looking like as Damon in the Bucks sort of figure out how to jail  I think we'll be fine I know a lot of us had him like late first round once the trade went through  I think he can be that player right now he's a third round player and Nine Cats so it's not like yes too far to go to reach that point  I think this is going to the process when they continue to feel each other out figure out how the rotations are going to work I think he's going to be fine so yeah a big jump for him would probably constitute like top five I don't know if he'll get that high but I can see him being a top 10 player in the season yeah I'm not too worried about him either just to throw in my own two cents on that one he's Dame I was right there with you off I thought end of first round and type of thing figured there was some kind of usage it coming but like  it's Dame and the nice thing about it is now that he's in a place where he's he's gunning for something he was always super duper healthy he had the abdominal stuff but it all a lot of it in Portland just felt like I can't I can't win here anymore so yeah like enough's enough sort of deal actually sort of while we're on that one how long do you think before Giannis figures out how to settle in this year because he's been quietly and it hasn't all been free throws this season he's just sort of quietly been doing a little bit less in a lot of different categories I think it's the other thing in terms of feeling things out is that 26 points per game which obviously isn't bad but we're talking about a guy who is well over 30 years past in terms of scoring so I think that's another thing where it will come in time the biggest thing for me is a free throw percentage you know that's going to be something that if you drafted him in the first round you're pretty much in a free throw punt bill from jump because you know it's not going to be that type of an area of strength for him shot below what 70% I think for the last five seasons or something to that effect and he's well in a way to doing that again this year so  I don't know be first round I just hope he's not outside of the top 100 as he was last season yeah and I'm a little worried about the fact that his field goal attempts are down from from 20 to 717 and not that not that I wanted his free throws to be at 12 again this year but they're all so under 10 so there has been so far a bit of a he doesn't have to do quite as much kind of thing now like you know all these guys are gonna slowly figure things out and and all that good stuff but I think that was the only question that was specifically Buy Low sell High there's like 30 five other ones in there oh hey here's one I know I said I was gonna let you go but I want to swing one more question there Zach Collins is he a sell high or a ride out for you oh that's a good question by the way I'll throw in my own my own two cents on this I'm I'm good with just riding it out  yeah he's at where I thought it would be you know just outside top 100 maybe you can sneak within that that range in terms of the ceiling but yeah I'm fine if you have them I think you just hold on to yeah I I inclined to believe that is three turnovers a game probably come down and the 65% free throw shooting probably ticks up he's not going to be like a world leader at the foul line but 65 and I gotta look it up to make sure I'm not talking out of my rear end yeah he's a 75% career free throw shooter so that like there's a few things within that feel like they're going to move in the right direction if anything maybe you could even buy on Collins if someone's like oh no he's number one 20 right now after two weeks in a couple of days that's kind of buying into the weird turnover low sample size theaters thing Rafa I took more of your time than I said that I would so I'm
