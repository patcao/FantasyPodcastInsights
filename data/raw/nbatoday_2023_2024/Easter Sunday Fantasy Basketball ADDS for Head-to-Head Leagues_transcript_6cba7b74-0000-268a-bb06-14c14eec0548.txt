welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right we're going quick hitter today folks  not that much should be surprised Easter Sunday happy Easter to you all welcome to Fantasy NBA today  your playoff head-to-head streaming Edition I am Dan Vespers at Dan best person over on Twitter  I know one just one of you  maybe only one actually this time of year is a new viewer or listener so welcome happy to have you please take a moment everybody to like rate and subscribe as we immediately dive into the meat of today's show and that is what should you be doing with your roster if you have a weekly roster move left here as the week wraps up first things first who's got a bad schedule today March 31st we're rolling into next week  the bad schedule today  belong to  I need to know nobody here there really isn't a team that has a schedule that's that much worse than anyone else Milwaukee is kind of the closest because they're off today and tomorrow  but then they go right back into a back-to-back after that  so yes if you badly need to try to squeeze something out of the next two days it's the Bucks  but there really isn't an obvious choice for who to drop  which gives you a little bit of oh I don't know maybe opportunity  because if you need to drop someone today it can be somebody who's just not that good and isn't playing today look for anybody on your team that's not playing today  and is also  not particularly good at Fantasy Basketball because this is a time of year where you might have some guys on your team that aren't that good  guys that had a good schedule  but  weren't putting up much in the way of fantasy stats  or someone who's hurt that's obviously the other choice if somebody's hurting you don't know when they're coming back if it's you know it's a day-to-day thing maybe they miss a game maybe they missed two that's an opportunity to maybe get off the badge schedule good schedules give you a few choices today you actually have quite a few actually there's the best of the best which is still not that outstanding but pretty good Brooklyn and Charlotte go back to back today and tomorrow Sunday into Monday of next week plus they play Wednesday plus they play Friday but Friday's kind of a mess as you guys know it's an overload day next week as is Sunday so if you're going Brooklyn Charlotte you probably go four days get your three games in four nights after Wednesday you make a move you want to get somebody playing on Thursday and preferably Saturday of next week that's when you'd make that next option for next pivot  also decent schedule and not great Chicago they go back to back today and tomorrow but then it's bad after that they have three days off so that's a that's very much a two-day option and then you've got this this sort of cluster of other teams Cleveland the Cavaliers the Lakers the Wolves Oklahoma City Thunder the Raptors and the Wizards all of those teams play today and then they're off tomorrow and then go into a back-to-back Tuesday Wednesday of next week so it's three games in four nights but it doesn't give you that what's the Rob palinka term that optionality to get off of them after two days the way that Brooklyn and Charlotte do is again with the Nets and the Hornets they go back to back and then you could hold for the game on Wednesday if you want to but you have the option of dropping earlier for those teams I just mentioned again it's Cleveland Lakers Minnesota Oklahoma City Toronto and Washington if you pick up someone on those teams today you basically have to hold through Wednesday because then you get their better part otherwise you're getting one game out of two days instead of three games in four days that's where things pick up  so those are your good schedules coming up you've already got as I mentioned no real obvious bad schedule team to deal with  and so then that I guess takes us right immediately into who on those teams is the reasonable pickup  luckily with that many teams you've got choices  not a ton on Brooklyn Dorian Finney Smith is probably the only low rostered guy that would make sense as an ad there I'm assuming the four dudes that are putting up numbers right now are already on rosters for the Brooklyn Nets meaning uh Mikhail Bridges Nicholas Clarkson campus and then Dennis Schroder would be one that probably is on rosters their schedule was fine this week they've gone every other day so again probably on a roster Dory Infinity Smith is someone that might very well not be Hornets you probably got a few more options Charlotte their schedule was also fine this week but I've seen lots of Trey man and vasilia it's such and Grant Williams bouncing around on Waiver Wires I've seen Nick Richards bouncing around on Waiver Wires these are not guys that are gonna blow the roof off the building the teacher kind of specialists in their own way with the exception of man who is maybe a little bit better than that but it by and large these guys are specialist level dudes which is I mean those are guys that pop up on Waiver Wires because sometimes teams just don't need what those guys provide which is nice because you got all these 125 to 150 range dudes that are available now to give you three games and four nights and all of those guys make sense as possible ads specifically if you need the stats at their providing but just kind of overall the Hornets have a lot of choices the Bulls for the back-to-back the only real option there is Andre Drummond you were gonna really badly need rebounds to make that move because again you're gonna have to make another one on Tuesday Cavaliers Max struss my fear of course is that he doesn't play in the back-to-back on Tuesday Wednesday but overall he's putting a decent number since he's come back Georges niang if you need some three-pointers Carousel vert if he plays that's something you're gonna have to sit on He's listed as probable so the assumption is that he's going but you can't make that move until you know for sure and then when you do now these gonna put a big numbers with Donovan Mitchell around but you never know people might rest again for the Cavs on that back to back next week and that might be an opportunity for him to get kind of two black games and one better one  for the Lakers really hot tomorrow is the obvious choice there Spencer Dinwiddie would be kind of the next one although Gabe Vincent is due back for the Lakers today in Brooklyn I don't expect him to play more in about 15 16 minutes if that didn't Woody's kind of take in Gabe's job to some degree all the you know we'll see how the Lakers deploy those guys Vincent all right there's kind of repeated  in terms of what they provide so we'll see I don't know that I would extend myself to any of the guards on the Lakers but Dinwiddie is the one I would go to over Vincent if you're really hard pressed for whatever it is that that dude provides for the Wolves The Only Name that I think pops up here that's decent enough would be Kyle Anderson slow-mo I don't think I would go to kill Alexander Walker there and unless we found somebody that was going to be out for Minnesota the options really thin fast after that  Jaden McDaniels I guess would also make sense if he's on the wire probably should have thought of him in the tweet that I sent out yesterday Jaden McDaniels if he's on the wire he would fit there for the Thunder Lou Dort Josh giddey has been the stream with Shae Gill just Alexander out sounds like she's  got upgraded  like an hour ago from doubtful to questionable and when guys get upgraded from Doppler questionable I tend to think they're gonna play  so I'm thinking we probably see SGA today there in New York nobody wants to miss the game at Madison Square Garden button giddy would be the sort of Fringe level guys on the Thunder Raptors Gary Trent Kelly Olynyk possibly gradey dick I don't like his fancy game very much but you'll probably do enough here giving the better schedule and then for the Wizards it's kispert it's badly and if Roshan Holmes is back it would be Rashawn Holmes those are kind of your three choices on the Wizards uh yes I think that someone on Washington probably sits out that back-to-back next week it's that someone is probably Kyle kuzma again so keep an eye on things that would give a lot of these guys a bump it might even give a Baldwin a bump and you know that there might be some other choices in their butt on the other two days in this three and four those guys aren't gonna do very much that's why I didn't put them on the list as possible solutions to your streaming needs problem on the Washington Wizards  no questions in the chat room this morning because it's Easter Sunday everybody's got their own stuff going on so I think we can keep this one to about 10 minutes this super fast quick hitter Edition I'm gonna try to do this folks for one more week I'm not going to do this I don't believe on the last week of the regular season I just I simply don't believe that there's enough streaming that you need to do there you're basically just trying to cover up any guys that are resting and get as many healthy bodies into your lineup as possible so this is the last week we're going to be doing these streaming shows for the final week of the Season we will do a weekly preview show so that'll probably be either a week from today or a week from tomorrow but it won't be too every single day it's just like I'm first of all I'm running out of gas on it but second of all I don't think it's helpful because picking up these Fringe streamers is sort of dumb when 15 guys are gonna get ruled out at 2 in the afternoon and you're going to have a bunch of other dudes you could probably pick up on a whim basically that last week you're just waiting until the last second  and I pray your head isn't even going to that last week even Yahoo's publicly just smart enough to wipe out the last one week of the Season even though they should Wipe Out the last four  I'm gonna I thought it was three it needs to be four things got nuts three and a half weeks from the end of the season so next year we got a wife out the last four weeks which sucks because your wife and a month now out of the damn season but you got to have a fair head-to-head playoffs and right now it's just it's not it's really not fair the way that head-to-head playoffs go the fact that we have to do all of these things right now that we talked about on these streaming shows is nuts  because guys are just in guys are out teams at the top of the board resting guys Boston's resting guys here and there Denver's resting guys here and there like you're seeing it on both ends the Tank teams and the teams near the top  the only way to win a head-to-head league is to have players on the teams fighting for the last playoffs spots you need to have guys on like the five through the 11 seeds in each conference or you're doomed  if you're Superstars aren't on those teams they might not play  Sorry  luckily a lot of the really good players are on those teams so like you know  80s trying to play through a knee injury in the Clippers guys are going in the Mavs guys are going  the sun's guys are going  to at least he got a few  still sucks still think y'all should play Rodeo but I'm doing these shows despite that  so you know you're welcome Harley asks who is the ad tonight in Utah well Larry Martin got ruled out for the season basically said he was gonna be reevaluated in two weeks but spoiler alert the season is over in two weeks  so it's probably taeler Hendrix  I would think  yeah that's probably about as far as I'd go there  Jess says I'm down by 52 points I got eight players versus their nine you think I win no sadly I wish yeah I mean things happen in these head-to-head playoffs I'm in a head-to-head playoff match that I thought I was gonna win but my opponent is shooting 51.3% for the week and 83% at the foul line and so if I lose both percentages there's just I got no I got no prayer in that one I probably then lose five to four if I could have won one of the two percentages I probably would have won that league but you know it is what it is and I lost another Head to Head League that I was winning field goal percentage until the last day and then Jaylen I don't know if you guys remember this but I'm gonna remember this until next year Jalen Duren and Nicola yokich combined to shoot like seven out of 20 on that last Sunday and I was like oh great I got my two field goal percent guys I'm gonna lock this thing in and I lost it sometimes I want to sometimes I just want to lose my mind such as head-to-head though you can do everything right and still lose and it's why I like Roto so much more if you do everything right in Roto you might not get first place but you're probably gonna win money because the top three payout and fantasy in Yahoo publicly  some names for a desperate stream in rebounds and threes in a 16 Team league  uh Dorian Finney Smith Grant Williams if they're these guys are probably on rosters all ready niang  gradey dick I don't know I mean I don't know how deep you guys got to go I if one of those names that I popped up Dorian Finney Smith or tree man and a points League get me Trey man I mean that across the board floor that's always kind of useful  thanks for coming out of the woodwork with some questions of the last second here extended the show to a robust 15 minutes now all right everybody enjoy your Easter and go find some eggs filled with chocolate  Nature's finest production  or peep it's gross  also am I  a bad person for saying I don't really like Cadbury Eggs I just like finding prizes  people are always like oh you're Jewish Dan you must not care about Easter hell no man everybody loves finding an egg filled with candy  I don't care what  Temple you go to what house of worship if you don't like an egg filled with candy you gotta get out of my stream  all right everybody have a great Sunday have a very happy Easter good luck with your matchups we'll see soon
