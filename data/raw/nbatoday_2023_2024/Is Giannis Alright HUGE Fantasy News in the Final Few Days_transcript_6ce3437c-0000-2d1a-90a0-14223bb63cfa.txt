welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast sorry friends I know this one's a little bit later than usual it is not by Design  poor older kid has strep he's making a YouTube video actually two rooms over not live He's not alive on Aries taping it we have a secret private Channel just for him  my heart my heart poor dude man he's  he's hanging in there a lot of meds coursing through the veins of a seven year old and now because of that as soon as his over we got to go pick up his younger brother from preschool and go get him profiling tested to see if he has it and is just asymptomatic with strap so we're having a great time here in the best Bruce household today  spent the eight to 11 hours getting the test that only took like 30 40 minutes because we have an amazing pediatrician and then we spent two hours literally driving all over Los Angeles because no pharmacies have Sefton are right now because every kid in the whole country has freaking strep literally out of the antibiotic so then we went back to the doctor they changed the prescription to a different antibiotic and then we finally got things going and so that's why the day has gotten off to an extraordinarily late start but that said we also are a condensed today so we got to get rumbling we got to get rumbling quick  let's do that now I'm Dan Vespers this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation we are going to haul our rumps through a 14 game recap make no mistake we'll still pause worth things need to be discussed but where they don't we ain't wasting a second  Detroit lost again no surprise is there my good friend she's amazing metu had seven and 11 with a three-pointed in shoot the ball that well though it didn't get any defensive stats so I ended up as a bit of a Down game for him  I'm still good with Roland Meto he's been really good lately I'm not picking up Evan 48 after a 21 point game Off the Bench everything else for the Pistons stays the same Marcus Sasser is your very light threes and assists a little bit of each combo categories only type of play  Campaign got the spot star for Kyle Lowry was sitting out one half of this one for the Philadelphia 76ers won half of the back to back Joel and bead played 36 minutes he's just looked like himself I don't play Campaign I know he had three Steals and floated his value but overall he's a low  ceiling nine category guy he's not going to be very good the next one Tyrese Maxey also sat this one out so another reason that campaign was in there um  and another reason that Kelly will break continued to get 16 so continue to play ubra play Tobias Harris play Joel embiid nobody else is worth a stream on this team play Maxi obviously when he comes back and yes but he healed at 18 points no I don't care cuz it's his first decent game in a month  Uber is the guy you're watching to see if he tapers off when all the superstars are back together  next Indie put up a buck 40 he'll be topping at 23 Off the Bench he goes through these shooting heaters every once in a while and if you really wanted to do something with it you could but I don't have the patience for that nonsense I'm still rolling with my usual few Myles Turner who had a down ball game I don't care he'll be fine TJ McConnell who's just been kicking butt over the last month now and other 17 and 7 game for TJ Halliburton and Pascal siakam and on the Raptors side everybody in everybody outline change Raptors depending on who's getting rest on a given night if they're healthy Olynyk trend are basically your and the manual quickly are your three guys you can play in nine cat RJ Barrett is a points League option  not playing okay abaji you're not playing Bruce Brown Javon Freeman Liberty had 20 and 8 in this ball game but not gonna take a punch down that route  looking at the next ball game however it does seem like a Linux and bear it and Trent they may all get the game off and if that's the case and you've got a manual quickly  and then all these other dudes maybe you try Jordan Laura out  I find it very hard to say you should play Javon Freeman Liberty because I feel like in the next ball game is gonna shoot two for 11 and the whole thing's gonna come crashing down you could also just ignore the nonsense  it wouldn't be a bad idea  Dallas you've got a top three Luca Kyrie Daniel Gafford that's an easy one keep moving Charlotte Brandon Miller miles Bridges top two that always works Grant Williams 32 minutes as the starting center this game was a little bit quieter because the Mavs stretched you out and just destroy  anybody that's trying to work out towards the perimeter as a big man but Grant Williams says the starting center is a hold and a start I have no problem with that Trey man and vakharia mitsch are more along the lines of the category types man you're looking for boards assists and steals a little bit of each of those midgets you're more looking for just like straight assists and hoping that everything else is good enough  but your three every day guys are Miller Bridges and right now Grant Williams  Boston got beat by Milwaukee side is certainly the easier or the the more interesting one from just like a what does it mean the rest of the week standpoint for Boston they played a handful of their regulars Drew Derek white Jayson Tatum Jalen Brown in there but both big men were not know Al Horford know Chris duck singers  so Xavier Tillman got the start Luke core neck got 21 bench minutes but it was actually Sam Houser that got the big bump in playing time for Boston he had eight points in 28 minutes off the bench I mean you guys know what to do if the big men are back in the next one but Tatum Brown Drew white if any combination of those guys is out you don't roll Payton Richard out there and you could probably go Hauser again  and frankly you should probably go poor Singh and Horford when they come back but again like the issue here of course is  who's going to play its back to back for Boston tomorrow in the following day they got the Knicks and then they got the Hornets and feels like the probably play the next and not the Hornets but who knows season means nothing to them right now  they're the comfortable number one so these games are  pointless  so yeah you waited out you see what the hell happens and then you make your call plenty of streaming options though with the Celtics and for the Bucs the streaming options went from stream to maybe a little bit more than that Patrick Beverley got the start which initially was just because they got tired of playing Malik Beasley with the starting five and you know as Pat Bev always does he brings a whole bunch of energy and they got off to a better start with him  and the boxer in the middle of a back-to-back they've got our Lando in the next one and then Yana's exited with some lower leg and achilles stuff they call it a Soleus strain as well we're at right now and we have no idea if he might miss the week a couple weeks more  but we do know is that we're gonna get a lot of Damian Lillard when Middleton plays which he won't in the back-to-back he'll be doing a lot  Brooke Lopez is going to be asked to shoot a little bit more and Patrick Beverley  in more of a feature role which seems nuts but that's kind of what happens here because you take Giannis out of the equation a lot of rebounds get put up for grabs you're going to see a lot of Bobby Portis he was a great play last time and if they really have gone but Beverly over Beasley that probably a play all so so Middleton when he's in Dame Portis Giannis when he's in obviously but he's out Brook Lopez Pat Beverley that's your that's your list right now for a Bucks team and that's the kind of the beauty of a gigantic usage guy going down is it sometimes bumps two guys over the cut line  Miami took care of Atlanta with bonus time Jimmy Butler bam adebayo Tyler hero all very safe choices Terry Rozier sat this one out and it was totally yovich who had the big fill in game but you're not gonna try to guess that's bad  that's bad don't try to guess who's gonna have the fill in game just go with the big names there and stick it out  Jalen Johnson heard his ankle again again with the ankle crap which means DeAndre Hunter is back in everybody's good grace is and you'll go bogged on both zdanowicz he's John Tay Murray DeAndre Hunter and Clint capela all the way it sounds like Trey young might be gunning to make his return  if that's the case I don't really know  if Hunter stays above the cut line they like his defense but he's not gonna get 23 shots when Trey's back in there with Murray  I think you could have a hunter see how it goes I don't think like I don't think it's gonna be that bad necessarily of a ballgame  but it certainly does take any of the upside out of the equation so he becomes more of a 50/50 play more I think of a point stream and don't expect to get much else which in this one he got much else but you know crap ton of extra playing time did the trick there  no calcasa again for Washington still playing Jordan Poole though so we haven't been able to attack our favorite bench player which is Jared Butler yet  Anthony Gil got the start at center with books of itch and or Sean Holmes out  I'd be reticent to go Gil because they played a very large opponent  and so they had to go a little bit bigger when they played smaller teams you seen any audio run at the five Patrick Baldwin got a bunch of playing time he had 156 and 4 with a couple of steals Wizards you know I mean look they're not gonna put up a bucket 21 against everybody as expected I think I said on yesterday's podcast I thought the Wolves would take this game very lightly and you'd get an okay game out of Washington and you did because wolves had that big Lakers game so this is the sort of prototypical yeah we can go at 80% and we'll be fine  your safe place are already a pool and kissper that's the safe place I'm not confident enough to go with Jill or Baldwin  that's just me  nazri got punted early so that meant that someone was gonna step up and the question of who was gonna be between Kyle Anderson Jordan McLaughlin and Aquila Alexander Walker and it was Alexander Walker but for the most part now you're playing nazri Mike Conley Rudy gobert and Anthony Edwards and that's as far as you go in traditional nine cat if you are category hunting slo-mo gives you that sort of boards assist steals combo but there's no guarantee that he puts up decent numbers on a given night and so my valuation on him hasn't changed and I'm certainly not doing anything with Alexander Walker  see we're moving fast today guys no room for slow down  Nick's beat the Bulls this game involved one of the dumbest plays you'll see all year  wasn't on the Knicks side  Jalen Brunson Monster game Josh Hart Monster game in 46 minutes good Lord  Isaiah hartenstein quality game to even genzo Ogden and Obey all these guys had nice games you're starting to starters for the Knicks for the Bulls Andre Drummond who back to his sort of traditional it was gonna be probably about 18 19 minutes off the bench because Alex Russo was back only played four minutes because Tori Craig tried to throw an alley oop to himself Drummond thought it was to him they collided looked like morons and a very next play drum and turned his ankle it was like the basketball God saying no more  the question of whether or not to play Javonte green is still kind of lingering out there  we're waiting on iO soon move  I think I'm still leaning towards no on Javonte but  you know if you're  he's had a couple he had a couple of good shooting games before this one  and 30 minutes is enough to get some energy stuff  I'm gonna lean towards know we might miss a decent ball game and with Drummond out it probably Secours Green's minutes a little bit more because the no choice but to run a little bit smaller so he's probably right on about the 50/50  coin flip as to whether his next ball game is going to be decent  and I would rather  skip it and miss out on an okay game as opposed to playing Green and getting a stinker so give me the four regulars  and not Javonte and you know what if we miss out then then we miss out oh well  San Antonio took care of Memphis snapped a losing streak against him when he 18767 blocks again he's crazy  Julie Anne champagne and other nice ball game 17 3 and 1 2 steals three three pointers on good percentages to like their Malachi Branham had 10 points in efficiently before leaving this one early  and Trey Jones should be fine Sandro Mama's Billy  I'd 11 and 16 and it started power forward here but no  no I'm gonna pass I'm gonna pass on Sandro in nine cat if Wendy and Wendy has by the way been ruled out you can you can try Zack Collins for a game that's all so okay very short-term stream  talking this fast is making me lose my voice quickly Brandon Clarke had 14 didn't do much else in this one good percentage on the field goal percentage get a steal in a block so not all was lost but certainly we wanted more Jordan Goodwin seems like he's playing nightly right now as they've embraced a full tank he had 10 and 19 with five assists so go ahead and play good win  trade Jameson is playing with Jaren Jackson out this is probably a better line for him 149 still a block I think I would shy  well with Clarkson out the next one you could probably go trade Jameson if you need mostly points and some rebounds but not that great on the percentages side  my favorite Grizzlies to play right now are good win  Clark and Scotty Pippen Jr who's been putting up some pretty nice across the board numbers he shot truly horribly in this ball game and still somehow had a pretty damn good fantasy game because of Seven boards five assists for steals a block six out of seven free throws as well so give me Scotty Pippen give me Jordan Goodwin give me Clark when he's healthy enough to go no to GG Jackson notice if you're Simpson No Doubt white who apparently is abandoned his music career know Tim Allen  I I wanted to make a home improvement joke but I think Josh already made it so I can't do it all I would love to go can we do that we'll do that uh oh trade Jameson  is the other one that's kind of the 50/50 he's my 50/50 guy with Clark out there's kind of no backup center  so I would say Jameson is probably a go if Clark and Jaron Jackson are both sitting one of those guys is in and JJ might be done he's probably done Bane is almost definitely done then I would be a little more cautious so Pippin Goodwin Clark the three guys that are yes is for me and then Jameson when there's no competition at all  or Lando don't really care no Franz vloggers so it was kind of like a hey you want to do some fantasy value and Mark helps was the guy who kind of got close but mostly was just another good game for Jalen Suggs John and I think played 20 minutes so that was gonna be good enough but we never know ahead of time  if he's gonna play 20  that's the issue with Jonathan Isaac is that you know the previous game he played what four minutes something absurd like that  he still makes a lot of sense as a roto games cap guy but you just I just no way to know when to deploy him  I know Carter Jr points and rebounds stream only and you could see from this ball game why you don't go full bore on him Freddie Jabbar Smith Jr I'm in Thompson are your safe place for Houston green has cooled he's gone cold the month of March is over March green has turned into April Showers  bom bom bom  which is a shame too because if he kept up his Pace from last month he was gonna get so violently overdrafted next year now he'll probably just get a tiny bit overdrafted  I would love it if Jaylen green had taken a big step forward but yeah you know guys have seen heaters sometimes and  he's a guy that when he gets nuts he gets real nuts but yeah that's  in the words of Arnold from The Last Action here oh to be or not to be on Jalen green  not to be  Sacramento got to a quick start and then feed it as the Thunder with shea Gill just Alexander back and Jalen Williams all so look like a good team again  how about them apples demon is a bonus is double double streak came to an end in this ball game wow I just realized that while talking about it  by the way if you're wondering why Dan me talking in the third person is so high on key on Ellis  that is why  that was my very bad half-hearted Ladies Man impersonation that is why I call this the Great Western Forum 26.6 boards five assists two steals two blocks and eight three-pointers for Keon Alice but one enough  that's why he's a play  ladies and gentlemen that's why he is a play for OKC you can go back to going shade Jalen Williams and Chad Holmgren I know Dort had 18 points but I don't care  and Josh giddey went back to being  trash  Denver I can rotate one guy in and out of the line of if they like but I'm not gonna do much with it Christian Braun got the start for Aaron Gordon in this one and he was fine but inconsistently so  just just go with the regulars Casey P has been borderline all year he's kind of a threes and steals stream for the most part but mpj Jamal yoke which shows your 9 cat guys and then you know what to do with them all year I don't need to tell you what to do with them on April freaking 10th  and if you're wondering why I was sort of semi a little bit high on Omar yurt so then even after a couple of bad ball games this is the reason they went up against they legitimate Center and they were like Look it's even we got no shot at winning this game anyway but we're gonna blown out by 45 if you don't play and so he got 37 minutes and had a really big 20 and 11 double double with nice percentages and a couple of steals this is also why I don't trust anybody else on Utah  these guys Fantasy games stink  Baisley he's been terrible fantasy wise for years tailor and Tucker had 24 points but you guys don't need me to tell you how bad he's been a fantasy  Luca semantics as our samanage samanich had 15 and 10  in sort of an out of nowhere performance but you ain't gonna do anything with that until you see it three times Hendrix no sense about no Jews and no keyonte George is ruining team so it's Yurts of in and then if we happen to see Colin Sexton again  or bust  hell's got their free be the rest of the way here over Portland Trey Murphy CJ mccollum's ion her are your safe place JV actually got 21 minutes so that was kind of nice  presumably because they had DeAndre on the other side but also maybe they just felt bad about killing him against good teams and they're like all right JV you can play against this crap or team go ahead go do something jv's a drop these days sadly and Brandon Ingram is not that far from coming back you know if the Pelicans have a game against a massive opposing Center you might see a little more JV but it's just not consistent enough for the Blazers DeAndre Aiden continues to be a monster down the stretch why he's still playing I have no idea but he missed a lot of games earlier and probably just figures you know what I'll make up for it now scoot got 15 assists while tanking your turnovers and field goal percent and kind of the classic do you need assists well do you need anything else  that's what it is right now but it's a glimpse at to what could be  can the turnovers get down to three next year can the field goal percent be loaded 40s  instead of garbage  that's all it would take because the outlines of incredible Talent are pretty obvious  do I walk right 10 more rebounds and nothing else telling had 133 and 3 with the block quieter game for him but he's been good enough from a usage standpoint to overwhelm the bad stuff so you're going eight and you're going Banton if you need to assist and nothing else you're going scoot if you need boards and nothing else you're going to party Walker and then Chris Murray is did you not get a chance to pick up Julian Penny well here's your other  no that's amazing to here's your other other  Julian champagne it's Kris Murray I think of Fat Bastard when I do that babies  Clippers winners on the road without most of their guys this was Paul George versus the world  next you will take on  the space mutants Russell Westbrook got to start and triple-double  as if to say I'm Not Dead  hi Russ  had five turnovers missed a bunch of shots but you know what the energy was there and that's kind of what the team needed in this one and they're resting everybody in the in the second half of this thing  what does that mean well um you know no Paul George know James Harden no Kawaii it's not clear of Kawhi Leonard he's been gonna play again the rest of this regular seasons so he might sadly be droppable I mean Roto you just hang on until The Bitter End head to head if he's jumping sort of clogging up a eel spot you need for someone else Kawaii doesn't look like he's playing again  who's gonna do stuff well with all those guys out rust if he plays is going to have a giant counting stats game and then just pray to the fantasy Gods he doesn't shoot 12% from the field of nine turnovers and you've got to figure that Norman Powell is going to do more than have 10 points on 12 shots how could they possibly compete if he doesn't Terrence Mann double doubling seems unlikely to happen again it's got to be Norm it has to be  Phoenix looks like they're gonna play there guys because they're playoff seeding isn't all locked up it sounds like nurkic just back so go with the starters  and finally the Warriors took out took care of the Lakers  you know this is a ball game with Warriors had their main guys in the Lakers didn't  like Lakers were down at the Davis  Kyle Anderson popped him in the Noggin in that previous ball game and now he's got headaches and nausea sounds like he probably has a concussion even though they haven't said it but as long as 80s out jaxson Hayes is going to get some points and boards and field goal percent so if you need those you could stream him really he's gonna take way too many shots against the good defense as we saw here so you go jaxson Hayes you go dealo you go Austin Reeves you go LeBron you go really for the Warriors Steph was back clay he's been rolling in the second half of the Year Andrew Wiggins everybody for the Warriors this is a record setting 3-point performance by the way so try not to read too much into it Steph Klay  Draymond and probably trayce Jackson Davis are your everyday guys right now Wiggins is  kind of 50/50 I would lean towards yes because he's playing well but gemski know Chris Paul had nine assists mostly because the Lakers had no Anthony Davis so they couldn't guard anybody so Chris Paul's a no and then kaminga is kind of sort of work himself back into shape but he just hasn't and we wouldn't get nearly as hot as he got for that one little stretch hey he's probably an outside the top 100 guy when it comes down to it  I don't know that any of you believed me when I said expect a like a reversion to the mean that will explode your brain but we've seen it  over the last month these won 30 rains last couple of weeks he shot 58% so he's bounced back up a little bit and it all comes down to whether or not his shot his falling  when it's falling he's been good when it's not he's not  I'm probably being too hard on him go ahead and start coming all so that's fine so come in get trayce Jackson Davis dream on green is playing much better at the end of the year Klay and Steph are you definites and Wiggins is probably a yes you probably have six guys you can play on the Warriors right now  and that is your speed run through yesterday's 14 game card oh my goodness I do not have time for questions today for that I do apologize I got to get things tidied up I gotta set my lineups I got to make sure my kid is  swallowing effectively with strep and then I got a load them up get the other kid and take him to the doctor and I don't know man so apologies I know I'm not really around
