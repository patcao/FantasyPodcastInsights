welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  we need to switch up my wardrobe a little more I think I wore this shirt on a show not that long ago but it doesn't matter what's happening everybody it's by low time here  on fantasy NBA today it's week 8  and I gotta say gets a little bit tougher every week to come up with those names little bit tougher every week because the Saint the great settling the great leveling has occurred  but don't worry we have a few left in the hopper  and lately we have been churning out some serious profit it doesn't always work like that sometimes you and this was the case for us a little bit early in the season we had like a say Aaron Jackson Jr and obey on the list three weeks ago  and their turnaround was not immediate if you bought low on JJ it took another week and a half for things to start to get going right it took for OG it took until like two games ago for things to start cooking in the right direction but luckily they have turned and what we're going to do here first we're going to recap where things have been for our bylaws over the last couple of weeks  and then we'll turn our attention to a few new names we can throw up on the board  I am Dan Vespers make that bigger for you guys watching so you can see it there's the handle at Dan best persons on social media please do take a moment to find me over on Twitter and please take a moment to like  subscribe and if you're listening after the fact on traditional pod channels please take a moment to drop a five star review  let's start looking at some of these names here and again we're gonna look at it sort of from the back four word which I say it out loud and I realize that was sort of odd nomenclature but let's start with what's been going on on our board lately first of all Jaren Jackson Jr Jalen Williams Julius Randall up big basically since the last time we looked at on some of our Bilo Rex Julius Randle took off immediately that was a pretty easy one because he was shooting like 39% and you that wasn't going to hold all year he's still only up to 158 overall on the season but over the last two weeks things have to improved dramatically he's the top 35 play over that stretch while shooting 60% which again that's not a sustainable number but you knew a good stretch was coming after such a prolonged quiet span Jaren Jackson Jr is top 20 over the last two weeks on averages of 24 and a half points 50% shooting not an insane number there but now he's up to 3.3 defensive stats over that stretch he's raised his number into the 60s on the season and Jalen Williams who his turn around has not been quite as Stark he's number 76 over the last two weeks but he's better than that over the last one week where things really started to improve for him he's pushed his way up a couple slots on the board as well that's been a nice series of wins arguably the biggest win we've had over the last week is ogn and Nobby who jumped from number one 13 to number 82 over the last like about  a week which is weird because the week before that he kind of didn't do anything he was like top 90 100 range in fact he might have even slipped a spot or two but he's number 28 over his last three ballgames again small sample but you always knew these better games were coming the Steels haven't even really fully come around for him yet but other things are starting to look more like the guy we know he's working his way up the board some of these buys are starting to cash in we do have three names that didn't really move over the last week DeMar DeRozan who is having a strange time with hitting free throws I still can't fully understand that one over the last week he's taking 12 free throws a ball game but he's only hitting 78% of them he's only shooting 39% from the field over that stretch he's averaging 30 points and eight assists but the percentages are just not where you expect them to be and the beauty of Damar is that they'll come around I don't know why it's taken longer this year I don't know why he's at 44 and 80 when we expected him to be in the high 40s and the mid-80s but eventually they'll start to take that way  and I've heard folks say oh well maybe he's just washed now fine okay fine if you want to put the field goal percent lower than before that's fine you can do that but even if just the free throw percent comes up he jumps past his ADP and makes him a pretty easy buy opportunity again cam Johnson kind of nothing there he's been at a total nothing story he'll be fine and then Walker Kessler who's now back out again right after he got moved into the starting lineup which is kind of amazing because he was about to go crazy and then ended up dinged up here and that's pushed him back down a tad yeah he's up to 29 minutes a game prior to that if you can get him now is your last chance to do it truly the last chance  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing

not the only one believe it or not we got another short recap Keegan Murray was on our by board he's up 10 spots over the last week with Zach LaVine sadly was on a Vibe board two weeks ago and then he got ruled out for another month so that one's turning out to be a very bad recommendation hopefully he gets traded before then that would then fix that recommendation but for now that one is headed the wrong direction but let's get into some new name oh sorry these are the repeat guys this is the guys that I think you can still cash in on Keegan Murray I think it's still gonna go higher tomorrow we just talked about cam Johnson Walker Kessler and also Jalen Brown who was on our Bi-Lo board I think two or three weeks ago and he's just been kind of slowly working his way up he was like 90 or 97 I think on that board and now he's up around 80 overall and it's just gonna keep very quietly working towards where he'll probably end up which is more in that like 40 to 65 range depending on where his percentages settle where his usage settles they are  more options on that team which makes it a little harder for him to find as much stuff to do still plenty still 18 and a half shots game but the free throw number is really low for Jalen right now field goal could also come back up a little if and when they do I think that's how he continues to move up the board and why he's on the repeat buys let's get into our three new names for this week first of them is Damian Lillard who's in a funky Funk shooting slump right at the moment that's pushed him down to number 21 on the season  42% pretty high volume from the field 17 field goal attempts 92% high high volume of the free-throw line is kind of carrying his numbers but a lot of this stuff for dam is fine 25.7 assists a steal 4 1/2 boards 33 pointers a game usages not surprisingly down because he's playing next to honest onto the ball but that 42% from the field is a number that in my eyes is going to work its way back up and why am I confident of that well it was just there like a week and a half ago  all so we know enough about Dame over the years to know that he hasn't shot this poorly outside of his oblique plagued 29 Game season 2 years ago since all the way back in 2015  and it started just doesn't make any sense and if you like oh no shop profile well last year more than half of his shots were threes and he still shot for 46% and he's done that a couple of times recently where half of his shots were threes and he shot 46 445 percent from the field and this year's died of 42 I don't think the scoring is getting back up into the high 20s to low 30s simply because he's not going to need to take 19 to 21 shots a game 17 could end up the tiniest bit higher but I don't know that we can even really Bank on that because the free throws are also extraordinarily High one of the highest numbers he's had in his entire career so that's soaking up some of his usage as well and so I think what you need to rely on all so again looking at the assist being as high as they are pretty similar to what he's been doing in Portland the steals are normal the blocks are normal the turnovers are normal the only thing you're looking at right now is the field goal percent  but luckily because he's a high volume guy the difference between 42 percent from the field and 44 or 45% is actually fairly notable when it comes down to his actual fantasy value turning that big negative into a smallish or medium negative basically kind of the same amount that CJ McCollum is sitting out right now is actually pretty big bump  that probably moves Dame from where he is right now to like number 18 or 17  and then with it you call of forget this it drags the scoring up as well an extra whatever it is you know one out of 17 shots per game is probably a little bit bigger than the number you're looking at like half of that it's part of a three-pointer small fraction but you know it's fractions of a point and it all just slowly floats together now how do you acquire a guy like name is probably the harder question here because it's already hard enough to get a big name player like that what would you have to give up to get him you kind of have to look at the board around Dame and see which players are potentially around him but headed the wrong way  someone like a car Anthony towns might get it done he's number 29 he's behind name but maybe somebody's frustrated with lizards poor field goal percent so I think that's a name that you could probably throw out there  I don't think I would because James Harden is actually on the rise right now you know you look at the last couple of weeks and he's beating him the other guys in front of Dame that maybe are headed the wrong way would be someone like a Devin Booker Bradley Beal is back for the Suns tonight Kevin Durant is still out so we're still not quite at the okay these guys have to share it three ways portion of the proceedings  I really like what Paul George is done this year but remember he got off to a top six start and then over the last call it like  three to four weeks Paul George has been more like a top 35 to 50 range dude because the field goal percent and steals have kind of come down now that could bounce back up a little bit but in my eyes it still feels like Dame probably passes him before The Season's done LeBron's been on a crazy heater lately in defensive stats threes and field goal percent he's a guy that probably starts to taper at some point we started to see it happen and then he went crazy for like two games any blue his value right back up through the roof Anthony Simons is off to an absurd start to his year shooting 100% at the free throw line like if you think he finishes the year with a better feel goal impact number than Dame I got a bridge to sell you the other stuff with Simon's like the flow field goal percent probably sticks I don't know about the 30s per game because remember most of the games he's played right now have been without Brogden without Jeremy Grant without DeAndre eight eighteen the played with most of those guys on the first game of the year  sometimes isn't going to be able to keep doing what he's been doing here lately  I doubt that to be enough maybe you could use him and pair him up with like a top 40 guy to get game if you're going to for one edition  I don't think I give up more than that you know most of the other names on the board could probably net you more like Tyrese Maxey at this point could probably get you more than name which seems insane to say like four weeks ago but it's probably the case marking it if he wasn't hurt would be someone I would think about throwing out there for Lillard  Scotty Barnes maybe I don't think you're cashing in quite enough there I don't know that there's actually like a margin of profit so my favorites are probably Booker before he has to play with two other stars PG who's been very slowly trending downward Braun who at some point is going to miss some games here and all so like the I just can't imagine he keeps up this  level of efficiency we're talking about one of the maybe the most efficient season of his entire career happening at age 39 McCombs not gonna get it done but maybe you could pair him with Anthony Simon's Desmond Bane is right around him that's another guy you could maybe pair up and those are the guys that I think I would consider trying to put together in a package for Lillard  this stuff on the board that I got a couple of questions about what it actually means we talked about the sort of for those that are watching for those that are listening I'll read it aloud I listed the current nine cat rank for Dame which on Yahoo's 25 on basketball monster I think it's 21 or 22 my end Target  is somewhere between 15 and 18 and the Bi-Lo price is 20 meaning what can you get for to or pair up guys if you need to to create a player to round 20  next player on the list is Jared Allen who we actually on this board like a month and a half ago before he was getting his minutes ramped up and then he cashed in on that and now he's tapered off again mostly because of foul trouble  he's had a couple of ball games in a row where I think it's too straight or two of the last three we should dig in on that or possibly three in a row  no two of the last three he's been in intense foul trouble the other one he just it wasn't as great of a ball game and his team was in was kind of coasting along but you have this weird artificial deflation going on he hasn't blocked a shot in the last four games in a row but two of those he's played under 20 minutes because of fouls last game he played 15 total minutes in Orlando fouled out 4.7 born so he's in a deep lull right now and whoever's rostering it might be feeling kind of annoyed by that beauty of it is you we we all know better than to buy into a three-game lull and how that can impact somebody's rank Jared Allen at 83 on basketball monster 97 on Yahoo such as the you know differences between some of the rank boards it does kind of change the what you're hunting for but I still think he can get up to number 65 or higher on the season and I think you can probably get him for someone around 80 to 85 on either board depending on what type of player you're looking at  I would have said Jalen Duren but he's out for another week and a half at least with his ankle thing Jabari Smith has been kind of on the rise but I'm pretty sure I'd rather have Jared Allen looking at guys that maybe our slightly behind him who gets it done Kobe White's been running crazy hot with Zach LaVine now but now we're hearing that the Bulls might actually try to add players so he would be an interesting sell High you could probably even a higher but he healed as a cell High boy on bug zdanowicz would be my favorite of the bunch if he could get you Jared Allen I would do it in a heartbeat kuzma who's falling to number 94  I mean like I get it you guys seem to think something magical is gonna happen there but we know the percentages are what they are  um let's see who else is in that range that's probably headed down instead of up but I guess that's kind of the board in terms of guys headed down you're not gonna get Jared Allen for Eric Gordon  whatever board you're looking at it can be pretty different  like we said basketball monster has him higher than Yahoo's got him in 97 basketball monster 83 if you can get him for someone like we just talked about I think that'd be a pretty good range and just assumed that his minutes are going to be a little more consistent  I guess we can't promise that they're going to be more consistent but sure feels like it  if based on nothing else then the fact that two or three low minute foul played game can really impact what your overall numbers are when you're only 18 I think he said it's 18 games into the season and that's what he's out right now  all right let's do one more name I know again like I said it's been getting a little harder to dig up name this one is a strange one it requires more explanation and the player as us are Tom Simpson who you may all remember I had on my cell High board three  weeks ago when he was rolling and he was just starting to show signs of cooling off  and we had him on our cell High board and then like three days later he got benched  and  I would love to come out and say that I'm the smartest person on earth  but I'm not  I'm not I mean maybe I am but I'm not  but am I know I'm not  all that's a joke I'm obviously not thing is I didn't know he was gonna get benched I had no idea that that's what was coming next I figured he was just running out of gas rookie coming out playing like gangbusters all of the adrenaline high flying steals blocks rebounds all this stuff that's like pure energy stats for a guy that has not lived through an NBA season it was there was a pretty easy call to just assumed he was going to hit a wall  what I didn't know is that the coach was actually going to be the one to slam the wall right in front of him Womble he saw the wall it was coming it was down the lane and he was slowing down as he approached it and then Monty Williams was like you know what let's just bring this Wahl super close without  actually telling him and let's make sure his eyes are closed when it happens and then smaco right into it  and in that moment I even put it on Twitter I said you know the funny thing is I just had him as a sell high but now with this benching he probably flips over to a Bi-Lo  and sure as heck he was a pillow not because he's gonna magically do something better but because now we've seen a couple guys go down for the Pistons then Thompson got dropped right back into the starting lineup  how does this all get sort of cinched together because it's a complicated Tale  not to mention the fact that  he probably ends up back on the bench when Jalen Duren comes back Mighty even up on the bench when Marvin Bagley comes back which you know makes you shutter and sends a cold chill up your spine maybe he sticks in the starting five maybe I only think we can promise it  the price range to acquire Thompson  and what I put on the YouTube slide for those that are listening is a pickup because he got dropped in a lot of spots  and I understand it he was doing nothing  he moved to the bench and did nothing  it in that moment it was like all right well this is the opportunity of a lifetime because at some point this dude's gonna get to play again we've seen him he's legitimately good enough to play at the NBA level already but there's an energy element at play here can you pick them up right now I don't know I don't know how many legs you got dropped in some I don't trust the Yahoo ownership numbers that's cacamamie you know you got deep leagues mixed in you got points leagues mixed in you got eight cat mixed in you got crapper leagues mixed in that that thing doesn't really answer any kind of questions for us only you know first of all check your way for if he's out there you should probably pick him up because this kid has an incredibly bright future  if he's rostered right at this moment is a very hard time to buy low because he did just drop into the starting lineup and have one good ball game and kind of ruin this this segment for us but I want you guys to be aware of what could happen here in the not just in future and what that is is guys come back for the Pistons Thompson gets moved back to the bench then he becomes that buy low again because No One's Gonna trust him playing 16 minutes off the bench but that's just not gonna last forever it's simply can't  he creates a spacing issue and that's why they want boy and Bug Donovan in there as often as humanly possible but also this team is awful and Thompson was fun  and at certain point you kind of have to go fun if you're gonna be awful you might as well be awful and interesting  awful in the absolute worst  I don't think Thompson is going to have a knocked your socks off eyes bug out of your head kind of season  not this year at least maybe next year possibly or could it be the year after that I don't know I mean you know trying to grade out how players development happens is pretty complicated  what we do know is that you get another look at some point and when he does it feels like top 100 is a pretty reasonable range for him based on defensive stats and rebounding and you know as long as he's got the energy to do it that's where you're hunted for  but what would it take to get him right now honestly I don't know that's unfortunately where I can't really feel in the blank on this particular one because what do you gonna do you gonna give up  someone in the 15th I don't think the if somebody on your in your league is still hanging on to Thompson  they're probably not gonna give him up for some warm waiver wire type of guy  they're not gonna give him up for Josh Hart  they're not gonna give him up for an injured Marcus Smart  or  I don't know  maybe they give him up for Gordon Hayward who's been better lately with lamelo out lamelo's not that far away maybe you could sell a high on a guy like Heyward and he might very well be on our cell High show tomorrow just things to think about what would it take who would be more interesting for your team like three weeks from right now  problem of course is that if you pick up Thompson today and that's why this is sort of not a super accurate name to put on the board if you get him right now you're knowing that there's gonna be another I would think pretty significant dip before things eventually get back to a decent spot so calling him a true Bible is inaccurate  is where I want everybody to make sure they're paying attention to what I'm saying you don't need to go buy low on him right now he's a player that I just wanted us all to really be focused on because his value bottomed and it's probably gonna buy them again before it actually gets consistently decent  if you can pick him up you can sit it knowing that you may end up dropping him again at some point right now he's more of like an on and off waiver wire type of guy but there's gonna come a point this year where it's gonna be worthwhile and he just wanted to make sure we're not behind that and all so this is this opportunity you know with the different guys injured it's less so but right before that happened this is an opportunity to look at this player and say I know this guy can play and I know this guy can do fantasy stuff how can I get my hands on him the easiest way possible  right now I think the answer to that is to wait don't buy them right this second wait until guys start to come back he starts to lose that gig again and then you can make your movements  and that is our Bi-Lo list for this week I know it wasn't super  outstanding they're gonna get harder every week they're gonna get harder to put this one together  Damian Lillard that's your first name on that board again I know it's like it's not perfect  because there's just like there's such little wiggle room there and then Jared Allen is probably the easier one and then Azar Thompson is your don't necessarily go buy him right this second but just understand that there's going to be this little upswing with everybody hurt and then there's going to be the dip that's the point where you want to strive to think about there's kind of strategize the attack all right okay I think we're all clear on that I'm
