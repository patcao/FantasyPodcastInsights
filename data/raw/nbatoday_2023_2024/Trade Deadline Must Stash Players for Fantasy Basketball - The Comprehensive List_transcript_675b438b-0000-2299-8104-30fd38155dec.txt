welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast hey happy Saturday everybody little bonus episode on a weekend figured if ever there was a time  to squeeze in one more episode of our show it would be the weekend before the trade deadline I don't know about tomorrow that feels like we're asking a lot but trade deadline less than five days from right now in fact the actual deadline is four days and 23 hours from the moment that I'm recording this show I don't want you guys going to be taking it in but we're getting close and so you know we've done a couple of shows  in this feed however again you're taking in the content Live on YouTube or Twitter after the fact on one of those two sites iTunes Spotify whatever all the traditional pod networks however you're taking in the content first of all thank you second of all like rate subscribe but third of all you guys have seen the two previous shows I assume we did one like two weeks ago where I gave my first four names we did one last week or like a little more than a week ago I think right through four more names in the hopper and what I thought I'd do today is kind of wrap up the whole thing put a bow on it this idea of trade deadline statues which I went into a little bit of detail on on the first of those two previous shows but I don't think I took as much time with the last one because there was other stuff I wanted to sort of figure out how to scoop it all into one  so let's start at the top  first of all  what's the point  what's the point of a trade deadline stash the point is to try to get out in front of somebody who can take a big Leap Forward  typically a trade deadline stash roster slot is not for somebody who takes a small step forward  because for a couple of reasons number one like if there's a guy who's just outside the cut line who moves just inside the cut line This Is Not A Difference Maker for your basketball team this is not someone you need to squat on for I mean now we're close enough to the deadline where squatting on someone like that for four or five days is fine that's easy and if they're playable anyway whatever  but typically the main purpose with this idea  is to find someone who is not really playing very much who can step into a gigantic role someone who goes from being well outside the cut line to inside of it or someone who goes from being just outside the cut line to being a  big time difference maker  so this idea of like could someone go from you know 125 ranck to  50  that's the kind of guy you're looking for could someone go from 200 to 100 that's all so a notable one or 175 to 100 someone who is not on the radar  who then becomes a startable asset the rest of the year or someone who is barely on the radar who becomes a must start every day you know dominate your opponent's kind of do  and the reason that's why you do it is because it's going to take up a roster slot  you're in a lot of cases picking up someone who's not producing you're putting a losing  slot on your roster  with the goal of having some sort of payoff in the future you're sacrificing in the short or is small to medium term for a big win in the long term  how do you find a player like that well  typically you look at teams that are sellers at the deadline and you try to figure out what might get either a left behind or how does a piece that they sell off fit in a new location that's kind of like the starting point good example last year we all knew the Hornets we're going to have to move Mason Plumlee there was absolutely no reason why he should be there so then you're like all right there's a seller they've a veteran they can get something for him they didn't get nearly as much as they probably could have  whatever because everybody they were desperate to just take anything  say anything  and then you look to see who's behind him it was Mark Williams and Nick Richards and they ended up going into kind of like a rotation of centers on that club but this is the general idea  and you can do this kind of thing and annually and try to figure out who are the most likely to be winners in those scenarios now guys don't always get traded we've been thinking personally like  Zach Levine basically got shut down in November it's February and he's still a member of the Chicago Bulls  you never know seemed like he was gonna get traded any day oh he's on the Block November he's on the Block and then it was like oh he's got a sore foot we're gonna shut him down for a month then he turned ankle we're gonna shut him down for three more weeks oh no he's sorry again  they're not getting the deal they want so they're just plot you know plugging along here anything can happen or like in a Flash Terry Rozier gone out of Charlotte sometimes it happens overnight sometimes it takes a freaking season sometimes if you're John Collins it takes three seasons to get traded  so you're weighing all of these factors at the same time what are the odds a guy actually gets moved if he does get moved what are the odds that the guy behind him sees a large enough jump there's so much that goes into this that when you now look at the list which I think and I probably did this backwards so looking back  for next season try to remind me if I don't remember this myself this is probably the show I should have done first where you take all the perspective names and you put them into a lot of drum and you wheel them all around and you just look at him and say does that make sense does that make sense does that make sense and that's what we're doing on today's show  we're gonna look at all the names basically a fairly comprehensive list I think I got 12 all together here  and that's not let me be very clear you do not need to stash all 12 guys  nor could you because that would be your entire roster  our goal here is try to find the best odds of making some sort of jump forward and then is it going to even be worth it  so with that intro out of the way welcome to Fantasy NBA today this special bonus weekend edition I am Dan Vespers at Dan Vespers over on social media many of you have found me over the last day because I got a quote tweet from ball sacks Sports I did not think that was coming at any point in my life but here we are so that's kind of fun again that's at d a n b e s b r i s again please do take a moment to like rate and subscribe however you take into the content also please check out the show description for our trade deadline live show link  trade deadline live show link I just threw it in the chat room if you're watching on YouTube you can see it there as well that show is starting 7:30 a.m. Pacific time on Thursday February the 8th We Are The Early Show going live and we got a five-hour show all going please take a second to pre like that one we're up to 6 7 1. 5 0 if you are watching live and you have a question on a player a possible stash feel free to throw that in the chat room if you're asking other stuff I'm not going to get to it only about stashes that's what the chat room is for today the comment section same thing let's really try to keep this focused on the task at hand and that is figuring out is it even worth it to stash somebody leading up to this trade deadline and if so who might they be  I'm gonna make that board bigger for those of you that are watching with us here so you can make sure to see the names that I'm bring it up but let's get into the slideshow  first player on the list on Yoko we talked about on a previous show I am going to be repeating myself a little bit on today's episode so if you watch the other ones you might end up fast forwarding two or three minutes at a time  but I'm gonna break down each one of these and there's 12 guys that I'm about to go through  and I'll tell you why it makes any sense  I'll call makes a lot of sense as somebody to have on your team right now but that's not even really the question because  he's number 89 on the season  this is a guy who has been roster durable and startable  because his totals value sits inside the top 100 but if you're not a fan of like the platters which is technically what his job's been so far he's number one hundred and fourteen on a per game side that's sitting right on the borderline of 12 team every night startable and he's actually been on the way up the last two or three games he fell into the like 130s prior to that  so all season long  I had to come on these shows and remind everybody he's a hold and now  and the fact that he's actually had two or three good games in a row has made this a much tougher thing to do but I actually think he's he's a buy leading up to the deadline  meaning if you've got someone else who is maybe worth just a tiny bit more like a buddy hield or  man if he eats a Zubaz was healthy he would have been a really good name for this Derek Lively is an interesting name here he's hurt all so that all so makes this kind of complicated  John Collins is on a little bit of a warm stretch Dante even chenzo's on a very warm stretch with the Knicks all kind of banged up right now if you got somebody that maybe you don't think is going to close the season super aggressively  that would be a name you could consider giving up for a coma because he's not going to be on Waiver Wires that's the problem here this isn't a guy you can just pick up he falls into the category of okongwu does guys that are already borderline everyday playable  that if Clint capela that's the the pairing we need here if capella gets moved okay who jumps from being borderline to being probably top 50  hell maybe better if his block rate comes back up at all which is it's much lower this year it's been a little better lately but both percentages good which is I mean that's like the extreme ticket for a center to have value is to be a positive both percentages feel goal and free throw  but he just needs more than 24 minutes right now that's where you stuck compelling gets out of the way that goes into the low 30s almost by default and he's a behemoth at that point because now he's all so getting all the playing time with the guys that are going to feed him lobs day in day out minute in it out  but again because he's had a couple good ballgames it's harder I think to get him right now you're not gonna be able to pick him up and so  this is a guy where and I can't put percentages on it I wish I could I wish I had the you know inside info to say oh well there's like a 20% chance capella gets moved I don't know  I don't know but then I think about a Kong is even if you trade for him and you give up somebody a slightly better than him and they don't move capella at least you're getting somebody back who you can play during the rest of this season  next time on the list is Iota Sumo this is another really easy one I'm starting with the easy ones because they're my favorites and for Aisle this was one that  kind of popped up like a week ago  and we've been talking all season on this show about how I always two players away from being a fantasy asset  one of them being Zach LaVine as basically not the entire season but he needed one other guy down whether it was DeMar or Caruso and lately it's been Patrick Williams and because all of those guys are hurt right now just been putting up tremendous numbers the last two weeks  he's been awesome  and so again this is a guy who's already gonna be rostered  I don't even really know how you get your hands on him because whoever has him right now is probably smart enough to know that this is a guy you hold through the trade deadline because of Chicago moves Levine which sounds like they have a decent shot of doing but hard to do so because of his giant contract and if they cash in say on an Alex Caruso then to someone was probably just starting the rest of the way yeah I know and then tomorrow we know is possibly on the Block there's a lot of guys that could kind of clear out here to give to sumu this incredible run he's been top 40 over the last two weeks yeah he's shooting 60% which again that's not a thing that's gonna hold but even if that drops back down to 50 which is where he's been so far I know he's a really good efficient player that's still puts him well inside the top 100 and a guy that prior to a couple of weeks ago was a little bit of an afterthought not entirely because the minutes were okay he just wasn't really getting the touches and that's why he needs these guys to get out of the way  so Levine being out of the way got him minutes Patrick William's out of the way God hymn consistency and then the confidence kind of comes with that because they're trying to play fast you just get him in there and he started to take 11 shots a game instead of like six or seven and that'll actually be the case for a few of the guys we talked about on today's podcast how it's not always about just the minutes but also the touches so this one just like okongo if they happen to be on a waiver wire which I don't think they are in your league but you can check if you're in a less competitively it's possible that they're still out there intermediate and expert leaks there's no chance they're on the waiver wire a Congo someone you try to buy on to soon move I honestly I have no idea what it would take to get him right now and I don't have the most confidence in the world that the Bulls are gonna trade to players at the deadline that I mean that's a big thing but Orlando like they blew it all up at the same time you almost never see that happen  so I don't think I would go out and try to trade for Iowa  he just sort of has to be on this list because otherwise it's not a comprehensive list  so let's keep his discussion a little shorter let's go to the next guy and that's Marvin Bagley Marvin Bagley who his Fantasy game I hate it  I hate it absolutely detest his Fantasy game this is a guy who over the last two weeks is averaging 15 and 8 and is outside the top 200 on by the way not horrible percentages 61 and 75 are the splits there but he doesn't need anything he didn't hit any three he's over that stretchy is one assist and he has a combined 0.4 Steals and blocks but here's the thing that's not a perfectly accurate representation of what his Fantasy game is  Marvin Bagley is historically a high-scoring  decent rebounding  okay field goal percent bad free-throw shooter  who doesn't get that many defensive stats but if he saw a full starters minutes they would be acceptable probably like a steel and like 0.6 blocks or something like that or like you know point eight and point nine or something and not great but not horrendous  and we've seen it in Washington you know 24 minutes a game here which is like the second almost the second most he's averaging is career if you go all the way back with Sacramento he had some stretches where he was at like 25 26 minutes  and he was not a nine category guy in those mostly because his free throw percent was at 69  it in Washington it's a 66 right now lately his more recent career last couple of Seasons he's been more like mid 70s hard to know what that would be  but he's never in his career consistently played 30 minutes of ball game let's just assume that the free-throw percent stays at 70 and the field goal percent comes back down to you know 52 to 54 range which I think is more predictable more expected I mean I know is it like 60 this year I don't think that that's something that's going to stick it helps that he's not taking any 3-pointers this season because he's bad at them but you know who knows if he ends up becoming a chukar on this washing machine or again  the nice thing about Bagley despite the fact that I don't really like his Fantasy game that much if he gets 30 minutes  he's gonna take like somewhere between 12 and 15 shots a game  you know he doesn't mess around out there  when he's on the floor  he's firing  and that right now is on a team that still has Kyle kuzma and Jordan Poole and tyus Jones  and anyone or combination of those guys could all be gone but of course this one for Bagley comes down to whether or not Daniel Gafford is still with the Wizards after the deadline  I love Daniel Gafford you guys know that about me he's been an incredible fantasy value this year he was a member of the old man squad drafted at 100 he's number 34 in nine cat he's played in 43 games has a bad rap for missing a lot of ball games but he does the whole Anthony Davis bit where he goes in the locker room and then you know has stomach cramps and then comes back out or I don't know what the hell's going on but anyway he's on a really good contract too  he's agent should probably be fired I don't know who that is but Daniel Gafford is only making about 13 million dollars a year for two more seasons  this is a really good  like field goal percent Rim protecting Rim running big man  making  not much  so that's a contract that even though there's two more years on it is fairly movable there are a bunch of teams out there that could use a competent big man I keep talking about the Dallas Mavericks on these shows because that's the one that jumps into my head  but there are others  it'll cost them though because God's good and again he's on that nice contract so like his contract could even push through some of this Wizards rebuild if they didn't want to move him but let's say they do let's say somebody offers up a first or  first in a second or something like that was would be crazy not to take a first in a second as part of a rebuild like you want to get first round picks that's what you're trying to collect as you rebuild a team because typically those are the guys that have the better shot of being different making actual real life basketball players let's say somebody comes out of the woodwork with the first and then it's just Bagley against the universe because the Wizards don't have any other centers on that roster  and we saw it  Gafford missed what two games back in the middle of January  Marvin Bagley just joined the team  and played 39 minutes in the next ball game he had 20 and 11 with five defensive stats and he went over five the free throw line  oh  there are holes make no mistake there are gaping holes in Marvin bagley's Fantasy game and it's why I've never suggested putting him on a roster until this moment  because if he plays 30 plus minutes he's just simply going to be on the floor long enough to average a pretty meaty Double-Double and then anything above that is just kind of gravy  and that makes him one of my preferred believe it or not stashes because I think there's at least a marginal shot that Gafford gets moved and if he doesn't there's just like there's no gray area with this one if he gets moved Bagley makes a huge leap forward  from being top to 200 it's being top 100 or better and he doesn't you cast him off into the ocean it's easy peasy you know no fuss no muss  Bilal equally  oh I've taken a lot of heat for saying he was not a player that I wanted anywhere near my roster back in November and in December and it's like half of January but about two and a half weeks ago those of you that follow this show closely I said now is the time  if you want to stash cool to believe Now's the Time would like a week and a half to go in January January 20th or thereabouts I said okay it's fine  but I'll remind you all of the things that I've already said about him  I like his deals I like his blocks I'm okay with this field goal percent I hate his free throw shooting I don't like his General lack of aggression on offense his rebounding is fat his assistant  so to get cooler believed to actual fantasy value  I believe the Wizards need to move not only tyus Jones but also somebody who takes a bunch of shots meaning either Jordan Poole or Kyle kuzma  if kuzmin pool are still on the Wizards after the trade deadline I don't think coolie hits top one 15 or top one 25 or better I don't think it can I just I don't see how he gets there without taking a dozen shots and we saw it two games back Jordan Poole missed it with a late it was a late scratch with a cold cooler but he got out there took a bunch of shots and had a really nice Fantasy game scored a bunch had some Steals and a block  and that's the combination you need but without the points and not that many three pointers and not that many many boards not that many assists he's a 3D guy without the three  just d  now he's Matisse that bull with the three-pointers  and much lower defensive stats he's her Jones without any scoring or rebounding  and that's just unfortunately it's not quite enough on all a really bad for free throw percent which those other guys don't have he needs to be better than those other three Indie guys because he can't shoot free throws yet  but he's got to be on this dashboard because if Kyle kuzma who sounds like he's the more likely of the volume guys in Washington to get moved if kuzma gets moved  then there's enough shots forever buddy and not only cool to believe it's more for you know depending on whoever else is left probably a lot more for Jordan Poole if you still around let's say Ty is Jones gets moved all so Corey kispert who's not on this list is another guy that needs probably two dudes out of the way he's just not that interesting cassper is not that interesting it's a bunch of three-pointers and you know you're sort of attacking one category but I mean honestly if this was a truly comprehensive list then he probably should have been like the honorable mention right behind cool belief for the Wizards because if kuzma gets moved and tyus Jones gets moved  kiss Birds probably the next guy in  unless they go Dylan right I mean maybe they might need a veteran to sort of  mellow things out  I just don't know how many pieces the Wizards can reliably sell off at this point who would be left what are you  I mean you I guess you could sell everybody but  could you even feel the team at that point  play bunch of guys in the wrong position they learn poorly they won't develop right  all right let's keep moving here I we got a lot of names to cover and I'm piddling along and there is Jordan Poole I threw him in there because he's not a traditional stash because look I mean he's rostered in  still far too many leaks considering how bad he's been this year he's you know top one 70 but he's still 86% rostered I put him on here and I put him on a Bi-Lo tweet the other day because  look  it's hairbrained but hear me out on this  it's I don't think this is a hot take this is like this is really legitimately thought through so please hear me out on this one  Jordan Poole has been awful the entire season anybody that has him is sick of him  and and they might be right by the way in what I'm about to say they're probably don't think anything is going to change between now and the end of the season for pool  it's possible he just continues to do the same general crap that he's done all year which is take 14 and a half shots miss most of them make bad decisions  it's like a college sophomore on spring break make bad decisions Jordan Poole 16 and a half points two threes three and a half assists in a steal that's basically the number and then the free throw which is supposed to be a nice positive for him is but he's not taking enough of them  look here's the thing  and I had somebody my Twitter mentions say this back to me and it made me sort of think a second time about it  by the way I appreciate you guys when you have like constructive reasonable feedback I read as much of it as I can he said look I believe what I I believe what I've seen over the last 46 games that's just who he is  here's why I disagree after I thought this through sort of like a ninth time because I went through this one a million times in my head to be like do I really want to put this out into the world and seemed like a complete moron yes yes I do I do want to put this out into the world and sound like a complete moron  Jordan Poole is in straight up cruise mode right now his team is terrible nobody cares if they win or lose  but he sort of like staying almost the tiniest bit under the radar lately  because he hasn't taken that many shots  and that's all fine  but  like I don't care how passive he's been  if Kyle kuzma gets traded and that's the big one here  if Kyle kuzma gets traded Jordan Poole will have no choice but to take probably three maybe more additional shots per ball game because kuzma right now is taking the most shots on the team highest usage on the club he said 19 shots a game and three free throws and 4.3 assists roll that all together nobody else in the club is even close if you drop that just straight back into the pool  the Jordan Poole as it were and you know we've heard the Kings the Mavs both linked to kuzma someone would come back to Washington but it's not anybody that they'd be liable to hold on to like  you know you know Harrison Barnes coming back from the Kings with a bunch of picks you think they're just gonna play Harrison Barnes out  doubt it  he wouldn't want to be there hell no he adopted out in a heartbeat not opt out they'd asked out  please try to move me whatever you can get in the next like 20 minutes please try and then you know buy out Market  some of these teams and by Mark is weird but I don't want to get into that on the show but like this apron stuff has to do with where guys can go on by outs  Okay so  I get it you know some of that's going to go to Little League or Bagley or whatever  but some of its gonna go to Jordan Poole who's basically not a movable basketball player right now because he's been so bad and he's making a bunch of money they just he's not tradeable unless they attach a ton of assets to him and I think for a Wizards rebuild they'd rather just ride it out as a post to giving up picks to unload a bad contract they're going to be taking on bad contracts that's how teams work through rebuilds you don't think Kyle kuzma's 19 shots and four assists and three free throws going back into the main puddle  wouldn't  I don't even say wake up Jordan Poole because I don't know that anything is gonna wake up Jordan Poole  but he's gonna have to do more  he'll just have the ball  they're gonna have to have him ending more possessions and his field goal percentage is going to be a train wreck as if it wasn't already  but I think last night was a perfect example and kuzma was in for that ball game but last night was a perfect example of the day of the kind of game that a lot of folks thought they were going to get out of pool this year 21 off of shots tennis assists at a couple of steals  team from 3-point Lane in that game  you don't think that that Jordan Poole is still in there somewhere  you don't think that when kuzma if if kuzma gets moved that Jordan is going to be like all right my team now  you don't think there's even a chance  that that's what happens to his brain  that he just starts seeing green boom boom go light  gun it Jordan  hit the gas see what happens  I think this is a possibility and and the reason that I'm going to so much detail on Jordan Poole is that  he's so cheap right now  you know he's number one 70  you can get him for anybody with a pulse  I don't think even the people that have Jordan Poole right now are like well maybe it's gonna get better at the trade deadline they're almost definitely resigned to the fact of I can't drop this guy because I spent a top 40 something pick on him  but like what if you have killed in Johnson who's number one 16 but he's generally been awful after the first Waffle that was a Brooklyn night since the first five and a half weeks of the year  or  I don't know Kelly oubre Jr who's gonna be good here in the foreseeable future while we wait on Joel and bead for a month or a month and a half or whatever it turns out to be or Denny Ave who's just sort of quietly been kind of fine all year  or Tim Hardaway Jr who has all these nice filling games when that team is healthy is wreck or PJ Washington who's been putting up numbers while lomelo balls been out but I'll plays that goes down the toilet It's gotta be someone you could find that the person with Jordan Poole would be like fine I'll just take a guy who plays Jalen Suggs Max druze  Dennis Schroder  these guys don't have upside not that pool has a ton of it but I mean if Jordan Poole comes out he's just like all right it's 20 shots a night Jordan now  then hell yeah  they could jump 100 slots  or it could be a train wreck but luckily you didn't have to give up much to get him anyway this I believe on a player that I've wanted nothing to do with told you to avoid like the plague on draft day  this is the time to go try to cash in value is at an absolute lowest point is that the Zenith am I using that I think that's the wrong thing at the top of the bottom doesn't matter it's bottom  now get him cheap he only got to do it for a week  Dennis Smith Jr so we continue to plot along here this shows gonna end up going longer than I planned but whatever I want to I want to cover it all Dennis Smith Jr this one we know the Nets are trying to move Spencer didn't witty Dorian Finney Smith and or so Neil and we all know Ben Simmons is just not gonna stay healthy the rest of the year and so they do happen to move those guys and they don't get anyone back that covers the point guard spot Dennis Smith Jr is a perfect example of somebody who you might not even need to squat on right now because basically nobody's looking at him but he's the kind of guy that can go from 200 to top 75 if the right guy gets out of the way so I would say and I don't think we need to break down in excruciating detail like what is fantasy game is I don't know that that's even the point you guys just kind of have to take my word for it but like if you look back at his time in Charlotte  he had a nice stretch early last year where he was a top 75 guy that was one little Bello ball was out for a while and he was just kind of running offense but again like he needs multiple dudes out of the way in front of him so you don't need to use a roster spot but if you're cruising along this week and you see Nets involved in trade the first thing you should do is get Dennis Smith queued up as a positive at because if Spencer didn't witty is out  Dennis Smith Jr is going to play more  provided they don't end up with someone like you know D'Angelo Russell coming back like if a point guard goes out and point guard does not come back in  Dennis Smith Jr is worth a an ad at that point but I don't think you need to preach him and I probably should have been clearer about that on some of these other guys but like two or three of the names I've talked about are basically on roster anyway  so let's keep going  well clustering Dennis's on the show right now the other one is Dennis Schroder who is number one 15 was a top 50 for the first month he's been much worse than that since he's at a couple decent games not so much the most recent one prior to us doing this show but the two before that with the manual quickly out and unfortunately that's probably what's going to take for Schroeder to post value the rest of the way he needs Bruce Brown to get traded that's a gimme the like there are way too many guys in Toronto right now and then he probably also needs Gary Trent  to get moved and he probably needs to not get moved himself  that's a lot of Hoops to jump through do I think that means you should be holding on to Shooter right this second  the answer is maybe if only because with RJ Barrett out there should on a night tonight basis be enough for him to be like a top one 25 guy so that makes him kind of easy to roster for the next five days to see all the trade deadline shakes out so he's like an active stash  where you're like hey maybe this gets better maybe this gets worse but he's a guy I think who could see his value swing a little bit I'm not super excited about it I don't think that his value gets any better than like top 80 even if Bruce Brown and Gary Trent get moved but he's very much at that point and every day all formats kind of guy and that's why I think like if he's on a roster right now I don't think that I'm going and hunting him unless I can get him for somebody who's in that same range who has no real prospects of getting better  if that makes sense  and frankly I might not have  DeAndre Hunter this is the example of the guy who goes from being just outside to just inside the cut line  which makes him not super exciting it also makes him his injury history makes him kind of a difficult player to roster anyway because he's getting back to backs off right now and so head to head I don't know that you can actually go down this path  but certainly on the roadside you know hunters in the 120s right now in about 29 and change management is per games some of that is impacted by diminished minutes in these games returning from injury and blah blah blah  this one comes down to deje Murray plus one  so I don't know that DeAndre Hunter posts value if only Deonte Murray gets traded and Hunter comes in and just has his everyday role back again I think he's pretty Darren close probably between 100 and 120 in that zone but look so he met turned ankle in the last ball game so let's say he misses a week or two and Deontay Murray gets traded that's enough what if Bae gets traded all so that's enough  what if dejounte Murray gets traded and  I don't know Bogdan bogdanovich gets traded that's all enough  so Hunter is what we've been talking about on the show we're calling them two away guys meaning you need two guys reliably to get out of the path for him to become a an everyday all formats dude  but I do think that even if only Deonte Murray gets moved you're still talking about Hunter as  probably startled in most formats  and the downside of course becomes the injury history the rest days the minutes Cap all the stuff that's going to be a much bigger issue and had to head versus Roto so I like it more as a rodeo play because you could just put them on your bench right now and see how the next few days shake out  but also understanding that you know unless he goes on a sick 2 point shooting heater which he has had a couple of those in his career this one is one where Hunter probably maxes out at getting to like top 80 and that's if a couple of guys got it get out of the way so this is like  this is like the bunt single of this play not usually the spot you use a roster slot for in terms of stashing because the upside is capped but you know there is an okay likely hood that he turns out to be slightly useful  I think fantasy analysts typically refer to this situation as a high-floor low-ceiling kind of guy like a narrow band where he'll probably not gonna be awful but he's also not going to be all that great and he has one of the better chances I think of having a small value bump because we know dejounte Murray is one of the more likely players to get traded at the deadline  I'm putting Patrick Williams on the list he's one of the new names we haven't talked about him on on these previous shows  and I honestly don't know why we hadn't talked about him on preview shows  because  he's been right on the borderline of startable I always hurt right this second so let's try not to hold that against him but he's been basically right on the borderline of startable with just Zach LaVine out so let's say Levine never comes back meaning Pat Williams is basically one more guy away from being in every day start whether that's Caruso Ah that's less exciting I would rather it be tomorrow to Rosen that also gets moved because then you're talking about a lot of usage getting dropped back in the bucket  the Bulls are not moving Kobe white so you can't assume assume something like that's gonna happen they're not moving I owe to Sumo so you're looking at Caruso and erosion  and so does that make Patrick Williams kind of a two-way guy just like IO yes I like IO more because I think it's Fantasy game translates quicker  Patrick Williams is you might get you a three a steal in a block but he has a lot of trouble doing anything else at least a Sumo he'll go out there he'll score he'll get you some assists he also gets deals and blocks his percentages are better than Patrick Williams even though he's a smaller dude  and Williams is out for another week and a half so you got that other thing hanging over it but again it's the same phenomenon if Zach Levine and another bull regular get traded at the deadline Patrick Williams and I was assume both likely become all format guys it's just that I owe  will be better between those two so  that's why we prefer him and that's why Patrick really is much farther down the board  I think this is Player 11 I've kind of lost track of where we're at on the slide show now this is player 10 jaborandi  he's he's getting minutes right now and he's just not even remotely close to Fantasy values number 216 and nine cat in 29 minutes a game on 9th else low defensive stats bad percentages no assists not many threes  I just I don't see the path for him  because look shaedon Sharpe is about to come back so that's going to make life even harder on Walker let's say Malcolm Brogden gets traded that opens up a little bit of a path I mean Jeremy Grant was out for the Blazers in their last game and Walker still didn't get enough to do because scoot was better that night  so Jabari might even be a three-way kind of guy unless you are specifically targeting rebounds because he has shown a pretty good neck to grab boards but you got to be talking real specialist type this stuff there because he's hurting more in you know just the percentages really then he the good he's doing in rebounding on a night tonight basis so you really have to be like Oh either I don't care about the percentages or they're either locked up or whatever and you know it doesn't take that many of them but they're still negatives and just like look I'm like six rebounds behind my head to head matchup I got a risk one thing to try to win the other that's where that makes sense but I don't know how you  play that every single day unless sharp misses way more time and Grant gets traded and bragged and gets traded now it's like okay three guys are out of the way  now he probably puts up numbers which is similar to what we saw remember there was that one little Narrow Path early in the air Simon's was out and Grant I think had a concussion and had his thing going on so three guys were out  and Jabari Walker put up a few good ballgames but that's my feeling is that he's not even a two-way he's a three away  and then finally oh wait two more names Gary Trent Jr is the next name he's kind of in the same bucket for me as Dennis Schroder just  less likely to take a small step forward  because with Gary Trent like Schroeder was seeing activity and usage  anyway  Trent sort of wasn't we've seen Trent do more since Toronto  swung their deal with Indiana  and New York I guess I should say both deals  that's been a benefit for Gary Trent but the only way he's seen enough shots has been when RJ Barrett or quickly or both have been out so much like with truder and you just have to like rearrange which players you're talking about when we were talking about Schroeder I said Bruce Brown and probably all so Gary Trent need to get moved for Trent it's probably got to be Bruce Brown and Dennis Schroder that need to get moved because quickly in Barren aren't going anywhere Scotty Barnes isn't going anywhere so those are the only three names Schroeder Trent Jr and brown those are the only three guys that you would think have a chance to get moved that our currently playing meaningful minutes and so it's like all right well do I stash this guy thinking the other two guys are gonna get moved to me that's too many hoops it's too many Hoops to jump through if you need two guys to get traded for your dude to see value that's not a stash that's a trade deadline like heater list you know it's smart to have one tab open on your browser that just has like basically this list that I've just given you guys this is 11 of the 12 names have the list of these 12 names if anybody else you want to throw them on there have at it and just have that list open on your screen as you're watching our trade deadline live show and then when the right name pops up  boom you make the move  but I don't think you need to do anything now I think that's that's you're getting too far out in front of it  and then the last name on the list is one that I mostly just mad about this I don't think there's any reason to actually stash their Thompson going into the trade deadline this to me is a player who likely does more at Silly Season which is still a month and a half away as a post to five days away but I mostly just mad at Detroit because you know Isaiah Stewart is out and they're still insisting on starting Kevin Knocks  do I need to say more  Thompson is the future in Detroit and I don't know maybe there's something going on behind the scenes maybe he's exhausted or you know rookie season is worked him out or he in the coach or feuding or whatever I don't know I don't think you need a stash Dr Thompson here I don't think that's something is magically gonna change the trade deadline  I mean maybe the Pistons trade boy on bogdanovich they're finally a little bit more competitive lately  anyway yeah this one is just me venting I don't even think he needs to be on your board I almost don't see any path for him in Detroit right now the fact that they'll play Kevin Knox and Marcus Sasser and all these other guys a bunch of minutes before they just let Thompson figure it out it's just  it's just nuts  and let's get them all on the screen together for you guys and a lovely shade of blue this is the final board in approximate order of intrigued  approximate order of NT intrigued  on Echo Congo Iota sumu Marvin Bagley bilali Jordan Poole Dennis Smith Jr Dennis Schroder Danbury Hunter Patrick William's Jabari Walker Gary Trent Jr and USA Thompson that's the approximate order of intrigued because look the first two guys are already rostered the 5th guy is already roster that was Jordan Poole Bagley and coolie Bagley in particular probably my favorite of the guys that are not particularly well rostered right now  because again he's a one-way kind of guy cool to believe is more like a one and a half away kind of guy Jordan Poole is a one-way but he's also mostly rostered and then you get down to these guys that are either two away like Schroeder Gary Trent JR Patrick Williams DeAndre hunter three aways like Jabari Walker  and Dennis Smith Jr who it's not entirely clear how many guys need to get out of the way there probably two but maybe more  and now what I'd like to do before wrapping things up first of all is remind you guys to check out our buddies over at manscape.com manscape is the code over there is ethos 20 ethos 2-0 20% off and free shipping on your order over at manscape.com check them out immediately again a reminder to come follow me over on social media at Danbury d a n b e s b e r i s and follow Sports ethos.com ethos fantasy BK and all that good stuff and of course our trade deadline live show coming up Thursday on February the 8th and I do quickly want to take a look at the chat room to see if you guys brought up any names that I didn't hears a good one keonte George um yeah I didn't put him on my list because I don't think Utah is in maximum sell-off mode the name I've heard for them is Jordan Clarkson  and getting him out of the way would indeed help George a fair amount but I don't know if it's quite enough because he's mostly splitting his minutes right now with Kris Dunn you still got Colin Sexton there it would help a little  but I don't think we'd be all the way there so you probably need  two guys out of the way for keonte  maybe three even and I don't know I don't see the obvious other one for a jazz team that has cooled considerably over the last two to three weeks they're back down to the 10 seed tied with the Rockets trying to get into that last play in spot in the Warriors are trying to catch up on him as well so anything could happen in the Jazz could fall apart down the stretch but the trade deadline is five days away so they got to make a call right now do we care or are we gonna go into late season Uber tank again  well last year they had Mike Conley they had Jarred Vanderbilt they had a bunch of guys that they could Shuffle around and get pieces for they don't have that many of those guys right now unless they really wanted to pull the plug and I feel like that would be frustrating for the players  and honestly how many more assets do they need  you know they're almost at full Thunder mode where they just got first rounders coming out of every orifice on this club  I mean maybe could they move John Collins again maybe Kelly Olynyk is someone that could maybe draw some interest kind of a veteran floor spacing passing big man  but does that move the needle on George I don't think so I also think there's just way too many gaps in his Fantasy game like  the  you know he's he's not even in the side the top 200 over the last couple of weeks if you look at the last month  I don't think he's there either yeah not even inside the top two like he's still so far away and that's why I can't a George is not on the board Jaden Hardy with the Mavs trying to get Kyle kuzma  yeah I mean that's interesting if that's a player that goes the other direction headed to Washington he would step into a bunch of shots more of a points League Target if you guys have watched out and Hardy's numbers of look this year he's had those couple of filling games where he's taking a lot of shots but he's shooting 39% from the field 70% at the free throw line and no real defensive stats to talk about so I just don't like his Fantasy game all that much Cole Anthony question mark ah  I don't know where he goes where he suddenly gets a whole bunch so no he's not on my list Wendell Carter Junior  are we talking about like if Mo Wagner gets traded or golgo batad say gets traded  yeah I mean I guess so he's probably he's mostly rostered already  he's a guy that could go from being like a top 150 to a top 125 that just not super interesting but also again he's like heavily rostered so it's just not a guy that I go out and attacking but that's why he's not someone that I even really considered for this thing  um let's see here any other name's on the list here you guys to do a really nice job of talking through some stuff yourself I appreciate when the chat room is its own living breathing entity that's fun I like this nickname Bilal just Doula believe that's where he's at right now  Zach LaVine not a trade deadline stash but a trade deadline by low I've had my Bi-Lo board earlier this year when he was coming back from his ankle injury and I looked really smart for like a two weeks and then he got hurt again now it looks like a moron I don't know why Chris is talking about Santi aldama  he's not on my trade deadline dashboard because he's just playing a lot right now  basically what I've said about aldama is what I'll continue to say is that we need him to be you know 45 46% from the field and low 70s at the free throw line he's 43 and 63 so far this year but last year he was 45 and 7 or 47 and 75 and so if that aldama shows up and he's gonna be awesome down the stretch because he's getting a lot of opportunity but if it's the 43 603 aldama then he'll be a points League only guy so I believe I'll Damas actually points League add regardless with nine category appeal should the percentage is B last year's in this year's I don't know which one it's going to be because he's a young basketball player and we sorted don't really know what the reality is going to be  like this last ball game he took eight shots and six of them were three pointers so of course his field goal percent was trash he rebounds he passes he gets Steals and he gets blocks and he scores and he hits three so it really does all just come down to his percentages but he's not a guy that was on my dashboard because we're talking about Santi aldama right now sorry I should have put that on there  because I think he's a guy that should be held right now to see what the next couple weeks look like because they're just like  seemingly kind of force feeding him and Memphis is looking to even get thinner  Dan would you take the over under on 13 trade made this season well are we counting the two or three that have already happened  I'll go  under  I haven't seen many creators do this show this year hell yeah well I mean so that's the thing like  one of the reasons that I don't think this is getting done a lot this season is because look at the names on the board right now that we just talked about oh Kong to sumu  Jordan Poole these guys are already rostered so that makes them kind of difficult to call it trade deadline stash they're more of a trade deadline by low right now Marvin bagley's Fantasy game is trash but if Daniel Gafford gets moved he makes a flying Leap Forward the problem is that it's very hard to justify having Bagley on your team prior then because he hurts more and he helps right now  same general story for cool blee who again and a lot of these guys they'd other thing is that cool to believe Dennis Smith Jr Dennis Schroder Gary Trent Jr DeAndre Hunter Patrick Williams Jabari Walker all like seven of the guys that we talked about today need at least  two things to happen for them to be guaranteed value  in my opinion Hong Kong to sumu Bagley and pool are the four names out of 12 we talked about today they only one thing to happen for them to see a value shift for pool it's kuzma for Bagley it's Gafford for December I guess it's two things actually but right now it's assuming Zack Levine doesn't play another game for the Bulls it's someone else gets moved  and then it'll Congo it's capella  and that's probably why there isn't that much content about this out there is because you know 867% or more of the names of people are talking about right now need at least two things to break right for those players to have value and that's unlikely that's like a 5% 10% type of chance or less and of the four names that only need one thing  three of them are probably rostered already  it's hard to buy low trade deadline stash and so that's what we're talking about one guy left who's probably a free agent or possibly one that only needs one thing to happen  for him to be maybe playable and that's Marvin Bagley  so rather than do an hour-long show which I just did people probably were just like you know what I could just like type the only guy left is Marvin and that's like it I mean you know I'm sure there's other things that are gonna pop up and you know weird things always happen at the trade deadline and even weirder things happened in March and we'll we'll attack them when we get there but thank you everybody for watching thank you for tuning in thank you for paying attention no matter how you take in this content  I hope this one this wraps up our trade deadline discussion was far as YouTube is concerned I'm sure we'll bring it up sort of in passing on shows over the next few days I hope you guys have a really lovely Saturday Sunday whatever and you know I'll be back with you on Monday at the absolute latest if magic happens I might be able to do a weekly preview kind of show tomorrow we'll see no promises on that front but we'll obviously continue to do things over on the social side again that's at d a n b e s b r i s or just Google search Dan from Sports ethos Twitter and it'll pop up that way as well  I think that's it make sure to please go navigate over hit that like button on the trade deadline show follow Sports ethos in all of its facets and come hang with us on the free Discord forgot to put that in there that's a fun one that is all so in the show description you guys through some more names at me but we'll deal with those in other time oh Andrade Drummond through into the names  I don't think which is getting moved but obviously yes that would be that would be one of note I just don't think much is is getting dealt there's there's too much left on his contract and people are seeing that he's actually kind of slowing a little bit and that's why what is there a Lightning round of a couple names here I'm in Thompson and Houston like him a lot don't think that's happening unless Houston starts to go into a losing spiral Trey man I don't see it happening Thunder if anything will be moving guys to get more dudes in that can take shots and be impact guys so I'm not fully on that one um  unless something magical happens down the stretch or they're just like oh yeah you now but I don't I don't think that happens without some other reason why isn't any idea on the list oh you know what that's a good question I think it's mostly because he's rostered already  um also he's a candidate to get traded so I feel like there's almost like a 50/50 shot he gets better or way worse  but this is a good point you could throw off the on their  if he's a free agent you can throw them on there yeah good call good call Tang Avia makes sense is kind of like a like a fringy one  let's see what do we got here and I think that's it yada says shalom  hello and did Josh giddey question mark I don't know why his role would change all that much no I don't I don't unless they I guess they could trade him away  is that the thought they said Giddy and Trey man somewhere for like a more reputable player  I don't think they're going to trade giddy right now I feel like his value is low but I guess I could be surprised um he's rostered so that makes giddy a tough one he's generally on rosters right now so  not a guy that I'm targeting with one of these sort of deadline by low type of ideas I get where you're coming from but it ain't for me  and that's the end of that chapter thanks everybody this was a blast we went longer than expected but whatever we were talking basketball so what could go wrong have a great Saturday I will see you either tomorrow or Monday here on the Pod and I'll see you guys on social in the next seven minutes later
