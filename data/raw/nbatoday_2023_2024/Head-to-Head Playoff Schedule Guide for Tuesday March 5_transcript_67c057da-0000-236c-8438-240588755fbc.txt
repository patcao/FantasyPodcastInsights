welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right second half of our Tuesday today  technically becomes  a two for Tuesday  oh how delightful  and this is the streaming half you guys saw that in the thumbnail already so I think you have a pretty good idea of what to expect if you've watched or listened to either of our first two versions of this show we did one on Friday we'll do we did one yesterday we will have one again tomorrow and Thursday we will likely not have a streaming episode on Friday afternoon  unless I do one from my car  I won't I won't be doing one from my car what's happening everybody welcome to this bonus episode of fantasy NBA today hope you guys are enjoying our head-to-head playoff streaming episodes of the show 15 minutes or less is the goal on these bad boys I'm Dan best price you can find me on Twitter at Danbury this of course is a sports ethos presentation  Sports see those.com check out the baseball draft guy immediately in our palsy manscape.com with promo code ethos 20 for those that are watching  the video feed you will also see the streaming calendar which I have been adding color coding to a little bit more every day as we go here and this is given everybody a look at this week and next week as we plot out a course on the fantasy NBA landscape  the format for these shows is we're gonna look at the schedule we're gonna look at the teams that have the best schedules and you can kind of see them in a visual sense and then we're gonna talk the  players that fit that mold  so very quickly here here are the teams and how they stack up and we'll sort of roll through them as we go good schedule starting today the best one on the board is the Cleveland Cavaliers they start a five games in seven days stretch tonight hosting Boston they're in Atlanta tomorrow they've got Minnesota on Friday Brooklyn on Sunday and then Phoenix on Monday in sort of on the other side of a weekly turnover but it's still five games in seven days that's the only one of those that starts today there are a handful of teams that go four times in six days starting today which is also quite useful especially those that begin with the back-to-back those teams are the Atlanta Hawks they Houston Rockets trying to scroll to keep up with what I'm talking about the Orlando Magic and the Philadelphia 76ers there is one other team that has four and six starting today it's the Miami Heat but they're back to back is on Thursday and Friday which doesn't afford you quite as much flexibility at least in terms of if you make that heat pick up you kind of have to hold through Friday or as for those other teams we mentioned you may not have to things that you're looking forward to here today and if you're not using moves today one thing to keep in mind would be Chicago they start a six games in nine night stretch tomorrow which is generally like a back-to-back then two games over kind of five days in the middle and then another back-to-back on the sandwich side of that Charlotte as folks that are watching can see they all so start a six games in nine nights stretch that's on Friday and if we scroll down a bit you'll see the Clippers actually start a five games in seven Knights stretch on Saturday of this week so those are sort of the very heavy schedule notes coming up as well as the Portland Trail Blazers who we talked about on yesterday's show there in a list of a very good scheduling block which of course is highlighted by a five and seven that starts on Friday of this week  so what do we do with that information well there are some players that you can use in these scenarios and I'm going to try to very quickly switch what you guys are seeing on your screen so you can see the players that were talking about  as possible use case guys here we go let's get that pulled up nice and gigantic on the screen everybody can take a look at it in real time basically what we're looking at here for this this other half of things is  okay well let's say we're streaming from these teams how do we decide what players make sense in those scenarios and there are a few parts of this that you that we kind of have to look through number one is you know are these guys even playing so you know that some of this is still a little bit up in the air  let's make sure that we can get this all up there there we go there's all the names on the screen at the same time so you gotta wait until the very last second if you can to try to make sure that these guys are actually active for the games you're picking them up in but if you're looking at the Cavaliers for instance they go five times in seven Knights Isaac akoro if he plays would be a very good one with Donovan Mitchell out and cares little birds still questionable same Merles the other one where you really need both of those guys out for him to sort of hit his stride I think if if Levert say comes back you'll still get an okay line out of a coral I don't know that you'll get much out of Sam Merrell which makes him a little bit tougher because you're looking to add whoever this guy is your picking up for a full seven days  so not a lot of flexibility on that front but a lot of games played five times in seven days you can use somebody that's not doing very much and you can still get a lot out of them if you're looking at for more flexibility you'll probably look at those other three teams we mentioned which was four teams excuse me the Atlanta Hawks the Houston Rockets the Orlando Magic and the Philadelphia 76ers those teams all have a back-to-back tonight going into tomorrow you can continue to hold for as many as Six Days on those which would roll you all the way through the end of the week but if you need to do Abandon Ship earlier you have that opportunity because you could just go with the back to back and then make a move say on Thursday or you can hold them through through Friday make a move on Saturday for a weekend back-to-back or just to change up what categories you're attacking or to try to set yourself up we just talked about a moment ago the five games in seven Knights team that begins on Saturday that was the Clippers  so there are the it gives you a certain flexibility here but does also require using up more of your weekly move moves the players that you could eyeball that go back to back and also three games in four nights and also four games and six nights on the Sixers Paul Reed and mo Bamba as well as Kyle Lowry now who wasn't on this list earlier today but has since been added with Tyrese Maxey being placed in concussion protocol so that's a change that happened from my tweet earlier this morning so add Kyle Lowry to that mix we were talking earlier on yesterday's non streaming show the recap episode on Monday that Kyle Lowry is very close to just being a standard add very good injury fill in here with maxi likely to miss at least one ball game we know one maybe more than that which is a devastating blow for teams that are in their playoff hunt because  concussion stuff you just sorted don't know but Kyle Lowry gets in there provided he can actually play in the back to back and I think they're going to try to force him into it I think this is going to be Nick nurse saying look we need whatever we can get out of your Kyle until we get Tyrese back and that's when they would probably give him a little bit of a breather so read Bamba Lowry are the Sixers you could look at the Hawks I you know you can check your league to see who's roster and who's not it's possible that nobody on the Hawks is low enough roster ship where you could then go uh and assume  that not even an assumption I guess where you could turn them into a streamer they might just be on rosters already because like Sadiq bass playing 25 or 35 minutes a game DeAndre Hunters around 28 minutes a game lately they are going a pretty short rotation it's sort of six guys getting a lot of minutes Bruno Fernando  would be the only one you might consider in a tight spot but Clint Capella's minutes have been trending up with his minutes caps slowly lifting and so I don't know if you're gonna get more than 17 or 18 minutes out of Fernando which you know fine in a back-to-back that might give you a 16 points on you know like seven out of nine shooting with a couple of free throws and he might get you seven or eight boards and he might get you four blocks over those two games but you know that's using a lot of roster move to get not a ton of stuff back so that's why I didn't put Fernando on this list if you're going Rocket's Direction I'm in Thompson and Dillon Brooks would be the fringy guys that maybe on or off of rosters in your legs that would fit the mold here for a back-to-back or three and four or four and six and then the magic probably have arguably the the sort of easiest pick or lot to pick from uh if only because they just have more guys that have been fringy  all year  guys that in a nine cat scenario don't really belong on rosters day in and day out but do just enough  otherwise to be like all right I guess so those guys would be like a Jalen Suggs who's probably rostered Gary Harris who might get it back to back off but he could sort of flit a float in there I didn't put him on my list because we didn't know if he would play in their back-to-back moving her my favorite one to throw in that mix he's been pretty good lately faults is not going to play in the back to back so that's why he's not in the list and so then you get coal Anthony who likely gets about a six seven eight minute bump when fultz sits out so then with Anthony you get you know 20 some odd minutes it's one game maybe High Teens the other hopefully that gets you about 40 to 405 over the back to back  I don't really want to hold on to call Anthony the whole week Wagner mobile I probably could consider holding on to for the entire week but  it's again you have that flexibility built in with these back-to-back slash  slightly longer medium or long streaming on how you want to play this thing out so that's basically the that's basically the look here is and I did it in ten and a half minutes today so that's pretty good that's the direction you're going if you're thinking about tomorrow there isn't a lot you want to do tomorrow a lot of teams have three games the rest of the week but at that point you probably should have made your move yesterday or today Wednesday is not a day I typically like to make moves when I'm long streaming Thursday I might consider it again but if all possible I'd like to try to hold off the reason you'd look at Thursdays because there are a couple of teams that have three games over four nights to finish the week which is special because you know you just aren't that many I think it's maybe three-ish teams that can boast three games from Thursday to the end so like if you had a team that went yesterday and tomorrow but say only has one game after that you talk for instance they go Monday Wednesday and then Saturday you could take a jazz player flip him for  well Brooklyn everybody on that team has been picked up all ready but there's a couple more actually Miami and Minnesota our teams that go three and four to finish the week so then you turn that three game Utah week with one move into a five game slot that makes sense because like Miami Minnesota they only had one game the first three days of the week and then three games the last four days you pair that up with Utah that has two in the first three and one in the last four that's how you use one move on the perfect day you turn a three-game week into a five game week anytime you can use a move to add two games to your week in a long streaming Universe you pretty much take that opportunity nice thing about Minnesota too if you wanted to go that direction is they play on Tuesday of next week so the schedule doesn't get crummy until after that and that's really the today through Thursday look but again if you want to sort of hold off remember Portland 5 and 7 starting on Friday Clippers five and seven starting on Saturday and then you actually have a one or two more that starts for  its Utah towards the end of next week and Boston towards the end of next week as well so those things you can kind of look ahead too and that is your lava lava Lightning Fast streamer show quick look at the chat room before we turn this thing off  do I think Julius Randle Randall or Joel embiid is going to return before the end of week 20 one so first of all it depends on which week 21 you're referring to because technically this is the 20th week of the season but a lot of sites combined the the All-Star break into one week so if you if you're considering this week 19 and you considering March 11th we 20 and March 18th week 21 I think there's maybe like a 30% Randall chance Randall's back by then I don't think there's almost any chance to L&B his back by the end of that week  uh  johnte Porter or Clowney today wow that is a very deeply I wasn't ready for that one um all right hold on give me just a second here  wolf  I guess I'd go Porter  because he at least played Seven Minutes in their last ball game after Turtle went down so you might get like fourteen to 15 minutes out of Porter possibly  I don't know I know day Ron Sharpe is out for the Nets  so it's Clowney play I know you're taking a shot there that he jumps into all of Sharps minutes and I don't know that he gets all of them he might get a few so I think I'd lean Porter in that ridiculously deep discussion  should I drop Trey Murphy for Andrew Wiggins no I mean remember how Wiggins came back from his family stuff last year  took him a full damn season to shake off that rust so I'm gonna say no stick with Trey Murphy for now  but look I'll tell you what like and this is the cop-out answer if Wiggins looks like he looked before he took his personal leave then yes he was doing better than Murphy at that point but Trace gotten really hot since then with McCollum out and he sort of carried that over into now the Pelican situation with call him back and  I don't know that there's a perfect answer to this one Wiggins is probably the better long-term play but Trace so hot right now I don't know how you can  do this discussion with without quoting Zoolander thanks again everybody like rates subscribe all that good stuff on the way out wanted to try to get these things done in 15 minutes where at 14 minutes and 55 seconds I'm Dan best burst at Dan best person on Twitter talking really fast on the way out we'll see you tomorrow another two on Wednesday later
