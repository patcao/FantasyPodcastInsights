welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  oh my laryngitis is never going to forgive me for the choices I'm making this morning welcome to show two on this Tuesday morning it's a two for Tuesday  to shows within the same hour  what am I some kind of idiot  the answer that question is a  resounding yes  I'm gonna do my best  there may not be the same vocal excitement level that you guys are used to with me this sort of broadcaster way that I like to try to bring you these shows but we're gonna get through it damn it  and we're gonna keep it  smidge Lively I'm Dan Bass Pros welcome to Fantasy NBA today this is the Monday recap show and short Tuesday preview just the three game card tonight if you're looking for the James Harden breakdown we just did that show aired about  finished airing about a half an hour ago it's available on all podcast channels it's also available over on our YouTube page if you're not watching the show live or after the fact that is youtube.com slash Sports ethos so I'm going to mostly keep this show away from the hardened stuff because we just did a half an hour on that all by itself  and so I don't feel like I want to go too much deeper into it we're seeing  rumors starting to emerge the only thing I'll say on the James Harden front is that we are seeing rumors starting to emerge that the Sixers are going to try to go get some other big name player that NBA Central Twitter account that mostly Aggregates posted that Zach LaVine and ogn and Obey or two names that have already come up in rumors  Sixers do now have some picks to move that they just acquired they have a bunch of contracts that they could move  honestly I thought it made more sense to go try to get Zach LaVine when they still had James Harden but for now we'll operate as though none of this stuff is imminent  and that gives us the opportunity to roll right into the stuff going on from yesterday so let's share that up on the screen for those watching for those that are listening don't worry I'll read through all of it as well it was a big Monday what the heck did we have 11 12 games something like that last night doesn't really matter let's just start working our way through it and we'll see when my voice poops out on us today Boston beat Washington this game was a big big blowout I'm kind of surprised that Jaylen Brown played 31 minutes there was just no reason for that but he did now kind of break out of his season opening slump this game move Jaylen Brown up to number 35 Allegheny game these days guys when early going you can move a whole lot of distance with not a whole lot of  changes to what's going on so he's right back where he belongs  there are no surprises on the Boston side we can just keep moving forward over to the Washington half of The Ledger which again blow out so a lot of stuff ended early  Kyle kuzma has been fine so far  his rank through the early going is number 43 which probably doesn't hold because he's shooting near 90% at the free throw line but I do think the uptick in usage probably does keep him inside the top 100 this year Jordan Poole on the other hand has been a mess he's number 163 high volume misses right now  coming out of the blowout will probably help him at least get a little bit more consistent the Steals and blocks believe it or not are kind of floating his value or it actually be even worse he's missing his free throws his turnovers are too high  is it a Buy Low on Jordan yes but also this is a guy getting drafted near 40 45 and frankly it was that was way too rich for my blood because we knew that this type of stuff was a possibility for him  if you can get him for like a 75 range guy I would do it  or you can roll the dice and hope that he continues to stink a little bit longer and then maybe the price gets as low as it  75 is low enough I would do that I don't think that I would pay top 50 for him I don't know that I would pay top 60 it just feels like 75 you take a shot at that point  below started for Washington that was because Daniel Gafford was out so they moved kuzma up to Center and I didn't go so great against the Celtics colabella has a really nice Fantasy game  he can rebound good defensive stats but he's also still very young and very raw and very green team was actually generally a little bit better when he was out there he did also play in garbage time when the other starters didn't I wouldn't read too much into it he's not a starter yet but it is something to keep an eye on  bulls nice little comeback win they needed this one voosh finally woke up he had his first Big Game of the Year let's hope he gets that kind of gets him on track Zach LaVine didn't shoot the ball well but he's starting to kind of come out of his season opening Funk and then Demar has been fine so far he's the one bull you haven't really need to worry about to this point I'm continuing to keep an eye on Alex Caruso only one block no steals in this one but he's a defensive Wizard and frankly I just I feel like the Bulls are better when he's out there versus someone like a Kobe white who had another bad ball game I don't think he belongs on 12 team 9 category Ross rosters we'll see if Chicago eventually moves the minutes around kind of figures out what the right lineup combinations are  just feels like Caruso's gonna be in one of those combos I don't think you need to add him but  keep an eye on it  Tyreese Halliburton turned an ankle in this one something to monitor going forward bennedict mathurin we just heard that he missed practice with an elbow injury that one kind of coming out of nowhere  but you know from Athens so far this year we're seeing the same problems as last season which is that he doesn't really do much besides give you a boost in free-throw shooting he's number 150 in nine category leagues and I don't know that he moves too far beyond that my hope is that he scores enough to get up near the top 100 but as far as the Pacers go it's Halliburton it's Myles Turner and it's Bruce Brown those are your safe place and everybody else is a little bit funky  what I drop them um  I'm dropping topping  dropping topping oh yes  it's a rhyme that feels so good to say and do  but he healed you're probably holding on to in the hopes that he gets moved that's the way that his value gets rehabilitated mathura and if you drafted him you're probably hanging on but I didn't tell you to draft him so I always  it's I get it like you guys are listening to a lot of different analysts I'm not the only person you're listening to but it is somewhat frustrating when I have people come to me and they're like what should I do with Jalen green and I'm like not have drafted him  feel a little bit similarly about math and although I do think he has a shot  because at least the free-throw percent is a really good positive for him  Brooklyn gotta win they needed that they beat Charlotte on the road because lamelo ball continues to shoot like me  that won't last all year you're not gonna be able to buy low on lamelo because whoever drafted him spent probably their 11th pick on him but he's number 97 in nine cat leaks right now on the shoulders of shooting get this  25% on 15 shots a game so far this year he is the single worst impact field goal percent guy in the entire NBA right now which is basically what we said he was going to be a punt field goal guy didn't think it was going to be this bad and it won't be this bad the other stuff is where it needs to be six boards 9 assists 1.7 steals so presumably when the field goal percent gets up to 41 which is probably will over the course of the Year everything will be gravy that'll put him probably in the 20s if you're not hunting anything and a first rounder if you're hunting turnovers and field goal percent but it's also why I didn't draft him in many places one place I think I drafted him where I figured I had I think it was a keeper where I already had Jalen Duren and I thought well maybe he can counterweight this  turns out I probably need more but either way it'll be fine  bigger stories from this ball game Dorian Finney Smith terrific fill in spot at Center while Nick collects it is outdoor and Finney Smith officially a member of the burger board the first official member of the Dan besser's Burger board here in 2023 Mikhail Bridges you know quietly solid which you know we'll take it he's number 38 per game right now I think I'd like to have seen him post a little bit more on the usage side but if he cruises along in the 30s all year and plays every ball game then he'll actually hit his mark  campus a lot of points a lot of points 33 points almost nothing else and that's okay that's kind of his Fantasy game and he's gonna have a great job here while cam Johnson is out Spencer Dinwiddie also got hurt in this ball game so there's there's kind of an opening here for Camp Thomas to keep storming the roost Lonnie Walker picked up a whole bunch of slack when Spencer Dinwiddie went down I don't know that I have the stones to play Lonnie Walker in a short stream if Spencer misses any time but it's on the table  uh Ben Simmons continues to look good almost triple doubled in this one that's great and that's kind of the story on the Brooklyn side as far as Charlotte goes outside of lamelo ball you got a good game from Terry Rozier good game again from Gordon Hayward Mark Williams bounced back with a perfect well Perfecto actually 8 for 8 from the field two for two at the free throw line  and Brandon Miller is probably the story on that Charlotte team right now he's been really good he's number 62 through the first week of basketball I don't know if this sticks like I don't know if the field goal and free throw percent stay as good as they have been but it's been a very encouraging start  you know up there with Chet right now as the best rookie starts to the year  pretty crazy I know but that's where we're at  where's chat right now he's number 14  so far I feel very good about putting chat as the only young guy on the Danvers old man squad that one's been okay to this point but yeah Brandon Miller he belongs on rosters he's a start right now  we'll see how everything gets shaken up specifically when Myles Bridges comes back but for the moment things settled a bit in Charlotte  Portland got a win that's good if we want their old guys to actually play a little bit deeper into the year we don't want them to lose every single ball game DeAndre ayton 23 rebounds people are hating on hating  I'm doing all the Rhymes today baby I'm dropping topping people are hating on eating DeAndre Aiden  in 26 and a half minutes per game so far this year is number 30 and I know again limited sample size the steals are and blocks well the blocks that won a game is probably close to sustainable the one in half steel is not  but you know we talked about Jalen Duren being one of the potentially biggest rebounders in the League this year DeAndre Hayden Allen of the big rebounders in the League this year he's on a team that has  pretty much nobody else that rebounds  and he also is kind of a little bit Improvement mode all the time you know what what is that mean for DeAndre Aiden  but people are hating on Aiden and he's been one of the top centers so far  I mean if you want to just like the basketball monster page is where I would go if I'm gonna look at centers  trying to trying to turn off the two things there we go uh yeah I think he's like the ninth ranked Center to this point  add who's been amazing and bead poor Singas yokich Chet demonic sabonis JJ Jalen Duren Rudy gobert and DeAndre Aiden  stop hating on Aiden he's been fine  Jamie Grant had his first better Ball Game of the Year let's hope that keeps up shade and sharp great start right now Malcolm Brogden is a start right now scoot is we talked about it before we fouled out in this one is that fouling issues which is interesting for a  back court player little better in this one  but look you're getting all the flavors that we tell you about with with rookie ball handlers bad field goal bad turnovers and even bad free throws here  do you want to trade for school you do it in December  and if you drafted him after I told you not to draft rookie ball handlers  this is me throwing my arms up  and exasperation for those that are not watching and listening instead over on the Toronto side ogno we came back but didn't play all that great he was fine Dennis Schroder another good ballgame so far he's arguably the guy that I underrated the most going into this season I just did not see this kind of performance from Schroeder he's been inside the top 90  and that's where the free-throw number that is likely to come up he's only at 75% right now  threes maybe those come down I mean even still like if you're getting 14 and 9  like he'd have to be so terrible in the other stuff to not be a worthwhile fantasy place so my humblest apologies to you Dennis  I didn't think you were going to be this good to start the year I didn't think you were going to be this good at any point this season so  my bad dog  Atlanta came back and beat me on a soda the Wolves just completely fell apart in the second half of this ball game go bear was decent again he's off to a pretty good start this year Jayden McDaniels made his season debut played 24 minutes captains and looked good five for six shooting a couple of Threes in a block hill come on  my hope with with McDaniels is that he can improve upon last year where he just hovered right outside the top 100 pretty much the entire season I would love him to take a round round and a half step forward just something to make him consistently a play as opposed to like two weeks he was pretty good next two weeks he was man and it bounced back and forth like that Kyle Anderson is a whole I know he didn't score but that's not why you have him anyway and my Conley is also a hold because you drafted him as a top 100 110 range point guard and that's basically where he is right now after a couple of decent games in a bad one and that's kind of the way The Season's probably going to go  for slow-mo he's always gonna be someone who's undervalued because he doesn't score at all but right now if you actually took his numbers from this moment and extrapolated them for an entire season he probably would be inside the top 100 it's just that we've got all these sort of small sample size stuff that's pushed him down the board  did Murray monster ball game good to see him get going after a few quiet wants to start the year they needed him to be a bigger part of what they got going on in this pushed him up to number 39 now in the yearly going Jalen Johnson has a starter is fun said Nick bade did just enough Off the Bench to stay on rosters on Yoko Kang woo keep rolling with it he actually had more minutes than click a Pella in this ballgame okang was a plus 22 capella was a minus 4 they're not just going to magically shift what's going on after one good ball game for one and a bad one for the other but again any time we can inch towards more of a timeshare that's a good thing we should very much be on your roster  DeAndre Hunter had another 16 points he was fine if unspectacular and he does actually belong on rosters right now I didn't draft him anywhere because I still think he's eventually going to cool off and fall outside the top 100 but so far so good and you can ride that stream as long as it takes you  finally at a human game out of jail in he had a little bit of foul stuff early Detroit just wasn't playing well then the game got out of hand lady and he ended up with eight and seven  he'll be fine the only reason I bring up the during game is because yesterday on the Pod I said hey this is your chance to try to sell for a second rounder because someone's gonna buy and Jane's not going to average 18 and 15 with you know four defensive stats all year and 80% shooting it just doesn't happen  even the best of the best of the best don't put up those numbers so we had to know it was coming down but there was just so much I don't say hype because we love Jalen Duren and I said it before I'm pretty sure I gave the first add rack out on the internet last year when he started to inch up in minutes played for Detroit so you guys know I love him but I'm also a pragmatist so when the value is there then it was time to capitalize on it and you know you'll still get a pretty good player if you wanted to but I think after the bad ball game you probably just  ride what's still going to be a very fun year but probably not a top 10  Isaiah Stewart did just barely enough to remain on rosters and I feel like that's actually kind of going to be the story for him all season long 14 and 9 with a couple of you know a three-pointer and a half and you just pray that he gets a damn defensive stat  at some point this season  that's not really what he does so there is a chance he ends up as a drop but he's hanging on by a thread right now  Alec Burks only 21 minutes in this game 11 points 7 assists he's like he's better than I expected and with Detroit actually trying to win games this year maybe that's a reason we're seeing a little more of him  I still think eventually he tapers off maybe in favor of some of the younger guys but for right now Burks probably does belong at the end of rosters even if you don't use them on the Roto games caps side he's playing well enough to go on head to head Jayden Ivy got hot in this one but he only played 19 minutes so I wouldn't buy into that and then after Thompson was the big one great game from Thompson 15 and 10 with four defensive stats I mean we can see it he's he already has one of the really nice to fantasy stats that's frankly in the NBA but we just have to sort of suffer through the rookie learning curve stuff so if you have him enjoy the ride if you don't you're probably not going to be able to pry him out of his managers cold dead hands  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're

blah we move along to Dallas and Memphis  no Kyrie so Luca just did more Lucas stuff massive massive massive counting numbers bad for you throw in turnover numbers you guys know the story at this point for Luca who's been awesome early season Lucas always awesome he's number two right now despite the free throws in the turnovers because he's averaging  3912 and 10 with  6 3-pointers a game  you want some stuff that's not going to stick that's not gonna stick all here those numbers are obscene Tim Hardaway is on one of his heater's which is a short-term stream if you want to bother with it Josh Greenfield in for Kyrie Matt Derek Lively's minutes are on the ropes we talked about that on yesterday's show with the weekend recap I think with Dwight Powell and Maxie Cleaver both healthy there's just not enough reason and I know Lively at 5 fowles so maybe it would have been more like 17 minutes and said of 14 but there's just no guarantee for him  unless he's the guy making the big difference you know Dwight Powell was in the better units yesterday klebo was in a better units for Dallas yesterday Lively was in the ones that were getting beat so he didn't get to play and if he's not gonna play every damn ball game I don't know how you justify hanging on the whole way through  because not like Dallas is about to Pivot into a youth movement here unless he takes a massive step forward and I don't know how we can just expect that to happen overnight so I am going to be one of the more aggressive analysts and say you can probably drop Derek Lively I don't think anybody would scoop them up after a couple of bad ball games I mean maybe they would in hyper competitive League's but  this podcast is tailored more towards intermediate to slightly competitive 12 teams  he's not a start right now  Grant Williams is going to be teasing me all year I can see this he had four three-pointers early in this game and then didn't do really almost anything else the rest of the way but he's a high efficiency 3-point shooter and so I can't quit on him  watch list  Zyer Williams also watch list by the way if we're gonna flip over and look at the other side big games from Marcus Smart JJ and Desmond Bane those guys all are ranked really high right now in Joy it but Memphis really needs a win Warriors it's almost like they're better when Draymond Green is healthy even when he's not playing a full starter's minutes yet the Warriors are just a  completely different beast when Draymond is out there there are three in one  and Dre what last two ballgames and they've won them both  he didn't put a big numbers because he only played 21 minutes but his minutes will continue to track up  Steph is crazy good  Chris Paul put up a pretty good line in 25 minutes I'm not worried about that yet keep an eye on Chris Paul as draymond's minutes continue to increase in Moses Moody got the fill in for Klay Thompson so just sort of file that in the role it X  Andrew Wiggins was awful again  you know he's not playable right now I would I would consider just sitting on him until he gets his game together and he remains say this on every damn show if I have to  I don't like having Andrew Wiggins on my team I don't like guard Wing types that stink and free throw shooting but he's also a by low both of those things are true at the same time so if you can go get him for fodder you do it but if it costs anything more than fodder I don't he almost Valentine's blocked Two Shots that's saved his fantasy line but he's just not going to be a play this year I know that it's sort of weird to say that after he has a better game  but he's had two good games if you want to call it that out of his first three and he still ranked outside the top 130 10.7 boards a block field goal percent will probably be better than it is right now  free throws blocks probably come down  he just doesn't have a secure job we leave it at that  herb Jones came back to Earth a little bit still had three defensive stats so I think he's bought himself on a little more wiggle room on your fantasy team I know he dropped outside the top 100 with this bad one but again Warriors blew him out so  grain of salt Jordan Hawkins filled in for Brandon Ingram 145 and 2 with a couple of Steel something again again keep in the back of your mind at least until Trey Murphy comes back that Jordan Hawking's could be a guy that fills in as a you know half a burger type injury replacement  Milwaukee and a game that probably was closer than it needed to be because Tyler hero went off Jimmy Butler's off to a slow start people are actually starting to panic a little bit on Butler which is great Buy Low he's shooting 32% from the field his steals are down his assists are down  everything's gonna be fine people this is Jimmy Dan Butler we're talking about go see if you can get him for like a 45/50 range dude in fact stamp it Jimmy Butler is my Bilo of the day  honestly I didn't even realize he had gotten off to such a slow start until somebody mentioned it on Twitter they were like hey what about Jimmy Butler this guy's thinking right now  I don't even realize it was happening but they're right he is stinking to start the year probably because they made the god forsaken finals the heater tired man  nuggets don't ever get tired because you'll get  is a wizard but the heater pooped  this is a tired basketball team  anyway Jimmy Butler Buy Low  big time by low wreck on that one Brooke Lopez slightly better ball game still didn't get the Big Blocks one of these games is coming he's going to get the big block number and then the baillos gonna be done for him Chris Middleton only 17 minutes  I mean I told you guys I wasn't drafting him anywhere because I just think this year's gonna be a headache for a while I mean maybe he gets up to full starters in the next three four weeks something like that I don't know but they're going to be going so easy on him  and frankly as soon as they have Team chemistry they're gonna be going easy on everybody because they have enough talent to overcome a few losses I don't think they're that worried about being the one seed  they want to keep their guys healthy and Middleton is one of their key guys  what's going to be a mess Bobby Portis had a big ball game but he only played 19 minutes so uh  not gonna bite on that one Denver wins again no finals hangover for the Champs they're four and oh there you only team in the NBA who's foreign oh right now all there are still two other undefeated teams the Mavs and the Celtics  if you're interested Nicole gets another triple double Jamal Murray 14 assists  out of nowhere  and then no other huge surprises Michael Porter Jr slowed down he only played 19 minutes in yesterday's ballgame Christian Braun got bonus run they just found a unit that was working and they rolled with it  so I wouldn't worry too much about that kcp couple threes a steal couple blocks you know I you didn't draft she probably didn't draft him at all but he didn't pick him up for his scoring and right now he's inside the top 50 on some unsustainable stuff but people are giving me Gus for kcp and he's one of the better fantasy plays in the league these days  Utah's all over the map Walker Kessler finally had his first big ball game of the year hopefully this kind of gets things going although we knew it was coming against yokich  so let's hope that it's not something that only happens against gigantic starting centers on the other team but this is a good one for him Laurie marketing is I'll admit off to a better start than I expected he's number 12 in nine cat right now I thought you'd see him take a small step back and so far he's pretty much duplicated it year over year and then Taylor Horton Tucker whose right now messing with my emotions in a very significant way going from good game to Awful game and back and forth again  which is put him at 1:50 in nine cat  by the way that ain't enough he's shooting 37% from the field and 67% of the free throw line the free throws are not good for him those are not going to take a big jump the field goal percent should probably get a little bit better  if it does is that going to be enough  I don't know  I'm inclined to say no and let's somebody else deal with this headache but you make your own call Jordan Clarkson outside the top 200 after this terrible ball game  nobody believes me when I say that my fantasy teams get better when I remove Jordan Clarkson and this isn't a knock on Clarkson Because teams need guys that are out there gunning for points but his turnovers are too high as free throws are not as good as people think they are his field goal percent is always low and we got all three of those together and this ball game and so overall he's just been terrible to start the year and I don't think you belongs on nine category rosters  and the last one from a mega Monday while my voice continues to sort of hang on the brink here Lakers beat or Lando late game push from the Twin Towers line up on the Lakers side if you want to take away anything from yesterday's ball game number one it said Austin Reeves still looks really tired he was getting beat pretty consistently by Mark hell faults  by  at times I think Joe Ingles for he went in there very long France Vagner was beating him up but he's got a size Advantage Reeves just looks gasped  Tori and Prince had his back and forth continue uh and D'Angelo Russell who I mentioned a couple times as soon as I saw his minutes in the very first game of the year remember I said to you guys this dude's gonna end up being a massive Draft Day value because the Lakers are rolling out there for full starters minutes  he just hadn't had that one warm game yet through their first three  so that's why he was hanging around near the edge of the top 100  but he was shooting like 37% so one hot game later D-Lo jumps up to number 53 and the likelihood is as LeBron starts to take some days off the minutes were at 32 and a half in this one they're trying to keep him in check a little bit  delos going to be a big winner and a huge ball game here  I didn't take him in many places but there was one draft I'm trying to remember which team it was I don't even remember at this point there's one draft where he felt like 120 something and I thought well this is stupid I have to draft him now and now I feel good about that because I didn't think I was gonna take him at you know 95 100 where he was going which seems like that might even be a value but once he fell you know round round and a half deeper than that  but anyway back to the bearing the lead here Christian Wood and Anthony Davis played great together in yesterday's ballgame would was a plus 12 best on the Lakers in last night's ball game and it wasn't flukey it wasn't like he just happened to be out there in the lineups that were doing really well it was that he provided us something  for the Lakers a certain something that the other lineup combos weren't giving now rui hachimura being out probably did help Christian would squeeze a few extra minutes out because they Lakers foolishly tried to shoehorn cam reddish into anything yesterday or jaxson Hayes and both of those guys frankly don't deserve to be in the rotation but they got to get some minutes someone has to get some minutes of the starters don't get completely worn out but Christian what was great he got big rebounds in traffic when Anthony Davis couldn't go get them an ad got 19 of his own so all you can knock him but the Lakers guards aren't rebounding well at all Lebron only got three boards and yesterday's game because honestly I think he was probably a little tired on the second half of an OT back to back and they needed another big  and wood did a really good job guarding guys like Wendell Carter Junior he did a good job on France Vagner a couple of times he helped protect the lane when ad was being pulled out towards the perimeter  I'm not here to tell you that he's gonna just magically get 2627 minutes of ball game nightly but I am here to tell you that it worked yes yesterday  and I think that means that they will try it again so if Christian Wood is out there and you have dead weight and I know that this is a time of year where a lot of guys are turning into drops I do think that would deserves at least a look I know his numbers are horrible so far he's outside the top 175 so it's not like you got to pick them up and play them but particularly if you're in a spot where you could stash him to see how these rotations shake out I think he's got a good shot to carve out a bigger role based on what I saw last night  over on the Orlando side Jalen Suggs is kind of coming on a little bit this year he looked really good in a way that frankly surprised me just to sort of watch him live in a ball game he was playing a ton of Defense which we know we can always do we actually spread the floor a little bit hit a few three pointers which  surprise to everybody but you know the steals numbers are not a fluke he's good at that he can rebound a big he's sort of a big guard I'd like to see some more passing out of Suggs only two assists again yesterday and I know that false is going to be the main guy there Distributing the ball and as running through France and it's running through Paulo  but you know two assists for a guard like sucks that that number just has to be a little bit better is there a chance he overtakes coal Anthony in more in a more permanent way I know that sucks is starting an Anthony's coming off the bench but those two guys do tend to kind of bounce back and forth in who's actually getting to do stuff on a night tonight basis  that I don't have the answer to but last night Suggs looked like the far better player and it's you know it's a one game sample size and there are days where coal looks like the better player but I would I would actually start suggesting watching more magic games live to see if this thing starts to tip a little bit in the Jalen Suggs Direction and if it does you might see Cole Anthony end up on the trade block  otherwise no massive surprises Gary Harris went six for six and no you don't really care about that getting a lot of window Carter Jr questions these days  you know I told you guys on draft night he's a top 100 Center so the fact that he's been a little worse than that shouldn't blow anybody away guys run cold guys run hot he played 35 minutes but he doesn't get any defensive stats so for him it's gonna be about getting 14 15 points and nine rebounds and just plotting along so again not a guy I'm targeting because he's a 0 upside Center buddy is also a by low because people are super frustrated a fact by the fact that he's been bad so far so again two things can be true even if I don't really want him on my fantasy team it so that's your look back at a very very busy Monday I will do a look ahead here at Tuesday in just a second first things first though I want to remind you guys to please come find me over on social media especially now where I'm almost completely out of vocal strength  I am hurting people but I'm getting through this damn show I'm getting through my back-to-back shows today and we are going to do a couple of questions from the chat room but please

just three games so not a whole lot on the docket for the Knicks  I badly want Josh Hart to get some more minutes I don't know that it's going to happen  but I badly want it to happen  can I will it to existence  probably not all so where is a manual quickly going to end up at the end of all of this because  he's number one forty in what I would deem kind of a good start to the year so that doesn't auger well for what comes next is that's good then what is bad  head to head I think I'm good with quickly because again he's a guy that helps you in a few spots and doesn't hurt you a ton but Rodeo  he's just there's just like not enough good stuff  that makes any sense I like quickly I hope he gets moved I don't think he will at least not for a little bit Cavs still dealing with a bunch of injuries Carousel Levert now on the man the injury report with a hamstring injury he's questionable Darius Garland has already out Donovan Mitchell is questionable but I guess was at shoot around he's also dealing with a hammy  to figure it out when you get there this is gonna be one of those like  somebody's yelling at me on Twitter that distracted me from the show you jerk um  max druze who I adore so far is likely to have another very large ball game and I think he's gonna be good all year  so  keep it cooking I actually like what Carousel it's done so far I know he's had some issues at the free throw line and feel goal percent but  he's looked very comfortable with the team  and so that's worth keeping an eye on as well for the Spurs you guys know how I feel about this Birds I just think there's so much inefficiency on that team and it's why I dodged almost all of them because of the percentages stuff you guys know I like to generally attack percentages as an easier set of categories to win especially on the Roto side but maybe we get our first weapon Yama bananas line didn't even this evening maybe he goes crazy  who knows what would be fun so I'd like to see Zach Collins probably stop turning the ball over if at all possible for the sons I think we've got Booker up to know he's doubtful still huh um Beale is out Booker is probably not but I guess we could call them maybe so you know more Kevin Durant  more use of Norwich as we watch him kind of settle into his role if you want to do the Eric Gordon what I've been calling it is the Aragon Gordon close your eyes and hope it's not a terrible shooting game night  have at it but you know same old stuff Magic on the back-to-back they've got the Clippers we just talked about Jalen Suggs he's kind of the guy I'm watching right now and then all the whole you know when no Carter Jr I don't want him but he's also buy low guy  for the Clippers they are very thin right now they traded away four power forwards and Terence man is is still hurt so you're gonna see some weird lineups you'll probably see more bones in there when they go smaller you might see some kobe Brown I don't know that I'm picking anybody up for this one game because it is just one game for the Clippers in a two-game week  so in a situation that likely will not happen again the rest of this year meaning this  this particular set of healthy players being there that probably doesn't happen again this season so I don't know I'm just I'm just ah  I just can't make myself care  I will  um and that's what's coming up tonight so I think we can probably take that off the screen for those that are watching live and let's pivot over to the chat room  I'm gonna go until I can't talk that's basically where we're at with the chat room right now again now you can see my Twitter handle back on the screen so do find me over there because again it's easier for me to write type things with my fingers  than it is for me to speak them out loud but I am going to continue to do my best I'm also gonna throw our Discord Link in the chat room right now because you've got a lot of fantasy basketball nuts all just hanging out with one another if you're a premium subscriber at sports ethos you get access to some hidden channels in Discord where you can actually interact straight with the analysts get your questions answered there also tools are up at sports ethos now in case you guys didn't see our messages yesterday five new tools on the website these are you know Excel bass Gadget tools that we just haven't had access to in the past so really cool stuff that's all in the fantasy pass which starts at six bucks for you month Dave says well tari Eason gets significance minute when he returns Jalen Johnson is what I expected Easton to be I think Tyree will get some I don't think it's gonna be that many  if you drafted him you might as well wait and see what happens but I'm guessing he's gonna end up on Waiver Wires the nice thing about Easton is that he rebounds and gets steals so he might be able to get value without having to work all that hard for it  so call it fringy I don't think you need to stash it's you need your roster slots like if it's a head-to-head deal but you know if you can pop in an injured list I'm okay with that  what are the Clippers streamers tonight  honest to goodness I just don't trust any of them  bones is probably  bones is probably your safest one  but maybe it ends up being brought  anyway  THC seems to play every other game what do you think yeah I mean you could try to play him every other game I'm probably just moving on  how much is Xavier Tillman worth in nine cat role I want to trade him away for Zach Collins in my other selling now I think I'd rather have Collins because later then kind of taken a shot that if things stick for Collins if you start to see a little bit of The Upside come together his ceiling is way higher than Tillmans  Tillman maybe higher floor even that's questionable because Memphis may just trade for a big man  is Brandon Miller earning his minutes now or when Martin Bridge has come back he's cooked know I mean they spent their second pick on him so I think he has earn some minutes the bridges one is the one I'm more concerned about because I think he he's just gonna chop away at everybody in that front court and and you know Gordon Hayward loses out or Miller loses out then maybe they do fall to the wrong side of the cut line but I don't think that you move on from Miller preemptively things are going well you probably just ride it out  should I trade Donovan Mitchell for Anthony Davis well they're both off to really hot starts this year you know the big issue for Donovan Mitchell is that he's been hurt so you know he's played two games and Anthony Davis's played four but they are  two of the top three players in fantasy sports right now  I think I probably would yeah I think I would because you know we know Donovan Mitchell is going to come down and he's going to end up in that you know somewhere between 15 and 20 range  or maybe between 12 and 20 if you want to call it that an ad is going to be higher  I think any of the Davis wants to show that he can be healthy this year he wants to show that he can you know take over the team a little bit with LeBron getting super old  and then we just have to pray but add has that per game  insane oh cap although I get it you know on the head-to-head side maybe you you prefer the guy that is a little bit safer from the health standpoint  turned my microphone off to cough here everybody  how much Fab would you use out of 100 if someone dropped the Anthony Melton two days ago uh give me  16 know  21  any thoughts on Paolo was expecting a second year breakout ah so you're someone who didn't listen to my podcast this preseason he's Paulo man his percentage is working a magically fix themselves I'm thinking about dropping him to stash miles Bridges if you're in a nine cat League miles Bridges probably does post better numbers this year than Paolo Bank Carroll if you are punting percentages and turnovers I think I'd rather have Bunker Hill but in almost any other category league setup you probably prefer miles can you believe it I can believe it because I set it over and over again he was gonna be a very bad category League player this year  I tried to warn you guys can you need some players you think would fit into that 70/80 range to try and trade for Jordan pools so here's what I would do and I don't know if I have time to do it on air  because my voice is is dying I would go to the late sixth early 7th round in your draft and look for players that are over performing where you think they're going to end up and Float those guys out there  let's see who would that be in mine  maybe highest Jones think he'll be pretty good but you could take the upside shot Franz maybe is someone you could look at  hmm who else fits that zone there  um  Klay Thompson  Tyler hero maybe I got my yeah those guys I guess sort of makes sense I'm not sold on any of those names but some should I start Jeremy Sohan or ISO Coro today  if Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland and Carousel are all out you probably go a coral if if you get two of those guys back for the Cavs then maybe you go so on  what are my thoughts on Trey young my thoughts on Trey young is what I said all throughout the draft season which is that he is a assists and free throw percents specialist he's a field goal percent and turnover Punch guy and if you're not hunting field goal percent there was almost no chance he got he got to his ADP and I have seen nothing to make me move off of that position so far  can we expect Jalen Johnson to be a mini ogn and Obi rest of season no no no OG is a Hyper Elite steel Skyland Johnson is not that you know I think if we can get top 80 out of him I'd be pretty happy  should I trade away Max druce for Paulo Bond Carroll in a points League okay the points League changes this a lot yes and a points League I think I would do it category League know  do you think this is a buy high for Rudy gobert and his Austin Reeves just overrated this year two very different players  no I think you know we'll see go bare probably come back down a little bit because 1.3 steals is not something he's gonna stick on the other stuff probably somewhat safe maybe rebounds come down from 13 and a half a little so I think he settles  look I had Rudy in more the 60 range this year I didn't think he was going to drop off that precipitously so no I I'm not buying his 30 range start but I do think he's gonna be fine I think Rudy will be fine this year is Reeves overrated know he's completely gasped  if you watch a movie as know lifted all on anything right now if you drafted him you drafted him for a great percentage is guy and he's not contributing in those because he does not have the lift to get to the free throw line he doesn't have to lift to make any shots he's a buy low but he's also got where the ceiling is kind of capped because he doesn't get defensive stats and LeBron 80 indie or the guys that are all so taking a bunch of shots there so I like Austin Reeves I like them because he's good at percentages so that does make him a Bi-Lo I would look at but also I didn't think he was gonna be like a 60 range guy I thought he was going to be like  85 to 105 so that's where you should probably continue to think he moves as he gets his legs back underneath them  would you recommend azer or D Anthony Melton doesn't have to be Dan answering but anyone else would be great so someone in the chat room could could pop up I think I would  man I think I would rather as her Thompson  just I mean he's already showing so much melting probably beats him here over the next like month month and a half two months but like the growth  if we extrapolate as her growing over the next few months he looks really cool  is Steph a sell High I mean what do you gonna do you're gonna sell your Mid First rounder for who another MidFirst rounder now man just ride it out Steph is awesome  there isn't really anybody better you're gonna get you're not gonna be able to get yolk itch for staff so  no point really  melted in Brockton Charis Levert who has the best rest of season outlook  I would have said Melton obviously but this injury to Anfernee Simons might give Brogden a little bit of a window here  probably still go meltan  Zion or Darius Garland Garland  false or Dennis Schroder I'll go false  because I feel like the best iteration of Schroder is what we're seeing right now and we've seen kind of one of the poorer iterations of markelle fultz he's still can do more and they're ranked within like six Slots of each other so I'll go false  is boy and beganovic worth keeping I have Anthony Simons in my ill already probably not  is it time to drop Clarkson yes  should I drop Wiggins for cam Thomas  oh  that's a tough one actually  mmm  no try to find another drop wigginsville bounce back at some point  I'm wondering the same thing you said earlier our entire Easton thinking about dropping him or slow-mo or quickly for Max Drew's yeah you got to drop one of those guys for screws I don't know which one it's gonna be necessarily  if eason's on your ill you don't have to draw him it would be quickly I think between the other two guys in nine cat but if you're taking zeros then it's Ethan  Dan who do you think is Miami's Best big man when bam is out Thomas Bryant  do you think Keegan Murray is going to get better  with Fox being out or you think it's the opposite I think he stays about the same  lack of credit giving to Wembley and Devin vassell disappoints me well when Ben yamas number 156 in nine cat right now because turnovers free throw and field goal percent matter  when he goes crazy I'll give him all the credit in the world and I think it's going to be a cool year for him like I'm excited to see what Victor can do because at some point he's gonna have a game where you goes for 20 points nine rebounds and like five Steals and eight blocks and we're all going to our eyes are gonna pop out of our skulls but he has a done it yet  and I like Devin bucel as a basketball player but also he's number one 120 because he's been tanking your free throw percent so far he doesn't really do anything besides score this is why  all right I think my voice is is about done um  lightning round  should I trade Kyrie Irving for JJJ yeah I'm fine with that either way whatever fits your team better  would you drop Deni avdija and use waiver priority to in an 18 team or to get the Anthony Melton yes  would you trade Tobias Harris for Marcus Smart  fair trade I'm okay either way  what's Mathers upside  90 is probably a best case scenario for him is he droppable he is yeah if somebody amazing is out there  somebody offered me nauseated and DeAndre Hunter for Zach Collins and Bones Hyland know I think I'd stick with Zach Collins  what would your asking price for Tyrese Maxey be in a trade like if somebody if you were gonna sell Maxie I would try to get a top a third rounder or better back  so on our melted melting  what do you think about PJ Washington should I drop him for a streaming spot yeah I think you probably could specially once the Hornets get more of their guys back who's better to hang on to Kobe white or bennedict mathurin  let's go mathurin  thoughts on Cades turnovers per game they are likely to be very high all year probably not five per game but they're not gonna be low  first time catching you live and not on two times speed on Spotify just wanted to say thanks one my legs last year because of your show you're welcome Nicholas welcome aboard I'm sorry you caught me on a day when I can barely speak  last question we're shutting her down THC had a great game yesterday is it worth picking him up again and dropped keyonte George in a points League yes points League Taryn Taylor Norton Tucker belongs on rosters because his big issues are more category League based  oh should I drop Kobe white for scoot yes absolutely drop Benedict Catherine for a streaming spot I'm fine with that if you really want to I don't think you're like he'll have some big games where you'll regret it periodically but overall I don't think it's gonna be that big of a deal either way these guys don't really move the ball forward all that much  I can barely speak thank you guys for tuning in thanks for all the great questions please do find me on social so I can type my thoughts to you instead of speaking to that speaking them  I don't know why I chose to do two pods back to back when I layering guide us but James Harden got traded so you know that's way it goes all right so you guys
