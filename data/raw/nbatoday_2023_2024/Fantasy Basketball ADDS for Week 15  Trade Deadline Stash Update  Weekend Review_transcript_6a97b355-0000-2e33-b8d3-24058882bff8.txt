welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast that's a good Jam  that's good Jam I am not sick of that jam yet  I am however actually sick again because this is my existence forever  forever so you know I get it like you guys listening to this podcast you're probably thinking Dan is legitimately always sick I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that I started this show basically the moment we had our first kid so like seven years ago started a podcast  we were really doing it it wasn't every day I think right before he was born he was like two months after that we started doing this show every day  and I didn't get sick when he was an infant because we were taking him out that many places all though those are simpler times  he was an infant in early or late 2016 or early 2017 we used to take Asher and his little carrying deal too like bars and restaurants and pubs and what have you or things that other people are doing and he just sleep through the den loved the crowd noise he loved the crowd noise sleep through it now I'm sick then as soon as that kid started preschool when he turned two like two and two months  so that would have been January of 2000 and  19  so five straight years now I just been sick  outside of the you know half a year year where nobody went anywhere during covid so yeah I'm sick literally all the time but it's because I started this God forsaken podcast right when I was sliding into hey get ready for sickness all the time now in Asher's defense he's in first grade now he doesn't get sick all the time he's gotten sick like three times uh since August or September or something like that but of course he has a younger brother who was literally booger on everything  I tried to talk about poop and Bookers at least once per Fantasy Basketball episode that's the rule around here at Fantasy NBA today which is by the way the name of the show I'm Dan Bass Pros talking poop some boogers as usual  at Dan Vespers over on social media I don't do that much a poo and booger Taco over on social  maybe I should maybe I should I also put a trivia question out on Twitter about seven minutes ago and I said I would give the answer here on the podcast before I did it on social see if anybody would come listen to the show instead of just sitting over on Twitter waiting for it the trigger the trivia question was for those of you that want to play along what unheralded center with a Yahoo pre-season ADP of exactly 100  has as of last week moved into the third round in nine category leagues  thanks to posting a second round value I'm adding a little bit here because it didn't fit on Twitter thanks to posting second round value over the previous month  that was the question  80P preseason ADP of 100 exactly 100 on the nose  and he's now a third rounder you guys know who it is a couple of people got it right on Twitter so far we've had I'll give you some of the wrong guesses we want to like play the game where we circle around it Jared Allen was guessed that's a very good guess but his ADP was not 100 it was going earlier than that Alan was going closer to like 5 6 3. 0 0  buy a ton but by enough to disqualify him from this one was Brooke Lopez is preseason ADP it was  Rolo was about 70  70 75 range  so who Could It Be Who Could It Be Shen was a guest his ADP was way earlier than that so know that was that one's not gonna do it I think his ADP might have been  well 80P doesn't tell the entire story because you sort of line it up he was technically going 48 if you actually did it by like if you did it numerically is 80 was technically 50/7 but he was going 48 if you line the players up so that's one of those weird areas of incongruity  other incorrect options who's thrown out another Jonas Valanciunas not a bad guess he's fallen off a little bit lately though jv's now number 61  but he did have an ADP I believe outside the top 100 or if not outside of it then pretty close to outside of it let me see if I can track down JVS  average draft slot he was number 97 that's a pretty good guess but he's falling off lately so it's not JV either  the correct guess vkj you got it in the chat room  Daniel Gafford  Daniel Gafford  it's funny that very few people are thinking about him too Daniel Gafford is down number 30 in nine cat in 26.2 minutes per game  11 points 8 boards a steal two blocks 60 or eighty 70% actually from the field that's crazy 72% at the line so he's not hurting you very much there one and a half assists only one turnover Daniel Gafford ladies and gentlemen thanks to the magic of nine cat where turnovers matter  and percentages matter and blocks and steals matter  Daniel Gafford is ranked right in between Jalen Brunson and Jimmy Butler  this is the wildness the wildness of the value of different categories and how they factor into a player's rank  Daniel Gafford  I have met a few spots he was a member of the old man squad so that's a good little footnote on all of that but there's your show opening trivia I'll try to do that more often I think that was fun actually a little show opening trivia  it gets us right into the fantasy side of things and it's a little game to get everybody kind of warmed up for the week here on Monday and maybe warmed up for the day depending on how we're feeling on other shows  I want to apologize in advance as we now sort of segue into the actual part of the show there may be a sniffle or two on this one my kids did in indeed give me their cold it's not too bad I can function just fine power in through but it has hurt my voice and it hurt my son is a little bit but you know  where there's a will there's a way you know I went on a stretch right I didn't miss a show for like two and a half straight years so a little kid crud isn't gonna knock me off of this one welcome Everybody by the way a lot of people joining us live here right out of the Chute that's super awesome this is fantasy NBA today I'm Dan vas again thanks so

okie dokie for those uninitiated this is our Monday episode which is basically a weekend review where we go through all 30 teams or really anybody that played Friday Saturday or Sunday which is generally everybody in the NBA but sometimes once in a blue moon you'll have like a 28 or 29 game slate we had some big injuries over the weekend we'll cover those will as we work our way through the games we'll talk about which players maybe sort of moved up or down my trade deadline stash board just a lot to go over and we're gonna get into that right now  start on Sunday we'll work our way backwards Detroit a 16-point win over the Oklahoma City Thunder Cade was resting this ball game but don't do the thing where it's like look they're better without him  no they're not better with out him but in Detroit's defense they have won three of their last 10 ball games yay Piston's they're no longer like laughably far behind everybody else in the NBA they're only two and a half games behind the Wizards for the second worst record in the NBA there was a thing on the Pistons and I don't mean to get too far down a side road here up where I think when they were on that like whatever was 21 22 game losing streak where I think there's season win total got bumped all the way down to like six and a half and we all should have just been every cent we had on the over because once you once you fall that far behind everyone you have no reason to tank at the end of the season and at some point You're Gonna Play other tanking teams and you're gonna get gifted wins because it won't matter now this one wasn't that all so NBA teams are just no matter how bad they are they're not a six and a half win pace  any who nothing to take away on the Thunder side as far as Detroit goes Jalen Duren 2020 game  his season is has been good he's number 70 in nine cat but it could be a lot better the ankle stuff definitely slowed him down you've seen the defensive stats kind of take a hit since he's been working through that but I mean I said in the beginning of the year  I thought Duran would compete for the rebounding title this season and as as hairbrained as that may be because he's not catching sabonis or gobert  he's not that far behind he's fifth in the NBA in boards per ball game at 11.9 to bonus leads illegally at 12.6% Jalen Duren is going to have a shot at some point in his career to lead the league in rebounding I feel pretty confident in that  Alec Burks is a nice feeling any time that Cade Cunningham has to sit Jane Ivy this is the prime example of why he's appoints League guy and not a nine cat guy  and he's definitely not gonna be a nine cat guy when Kate is back maybe still points League guy but 1986 with 33 pointers you're like all right now we're cooking and then you realize he went seven for 20 from the field two for five at the free throw line whoops  Isaiah Stewart also turned ankle in this ball game unclear if he'll miss any time  previously we've seen as her Thompson get a little bit more run when Stewart was out he didn't pick up the bonus minutes in this particular ball game they gave a little bit more uh to just sort of a smattering you might see Kevin Knox get the start keep an eye on that if Thompson gets a start for Detroit in the next ball game I might consider throwing in into a lineup but it also didn't seem like it was that huge that critical of an ankle tweak so we're probably talking about one two three games something like that not sure it's worth it the only argument you would make on Thompson as a as a pickup here is to say okay well if it gets us a couple games in and it gets us close to the trade deadline and maybe he gets to do more stuff on the other side of that that's your kind of Gap bridging idea but otherwise I don't think we need to read too much into this Steward thing  Indiana beat Memphis 1161 10 GG Jackson at 18 points when he's hot he can be fine it to me he's not trustworthy enough on the game to game same story for David Roddy who's Fantasy game is is relatively limited he doesn't do much besides hit three pointers and I mean I know he had a steal at a block in this one but that's sort of uncommon you guys know where I'm at with the Grizzlies but quickly to recap it Vince Williams is a play obviously Jaron Jackson Jr we don't need to talk about that when Luke Kennard is healthy he's a play with Cunard out John conchar is actually a solid Roto type guy punt points kind of build dude for head to head but he'll do enough even in nine cat I would think here while getting 30 minutes with no Kinard because he is effectively the point guard of this team right now and that's good that means assists we know we can rebound from the guard position we know we can get Steals and blocks from the guard position and he's probably gonna do it on a decent percentage remember there was a run last year when the Grizzlies had a few guys out in the back court a contra was like a top 80 guy for a month  and then Santi aldama who I remain let's say  cautiously bullish on he got 28 minutes again here he didn't get the steals or blocks and he shot just four for 11 which is gonna be a thing that jumps out  but he hits three easy he can rebound he often gets some assists not in this ball game  there's that roundedness he can get all the counting categories points threes boards assists Steals and blocks we just need the percentages to not be a total train wreck  will they are well they that I don't know yet if he's nearly last year's numbers percentages then Santee will have value and if he's more like what he's done so far this year in percentages he won't be a nine cat value that's the cutoff line  now we had our once every week and a half bennedict mathurin game  don't read too much into that Jalen Smith filled in for Myles Turner if that happens again we know what to do  aranese Smith is very much a safe hold Andrew marred has had a couple good ball games in a row much to my surprise actually because typically he's just some points in some assists but he got some threes in this one made his free throws got a steal I mean yes playing against the Grizzlies is helpful but  and this is good news for the Pacers Tyreese Halliburton is expected to make his return for Indiana's next ball game so you can probably not worry about the EM hard thing all so no TJ McConnell so nem hard played I think he was like three seconds off the team high in minutes in this one that's just not a thing that would have happened if McConnell was around as well he still would have gotten the Lion's Share would have been but it would have been more like 28 29 instead of 37 but you don't even worry about it I don't know why we're talking about it halliburton's coming back  buddy heeled might be the most difficult to hold in the NBA right now but you need to hold because he's starting and Rick Carlile is not gonna stick with the guy if their dog do and in this game healed was dog due and matheran was better so he went to bedding he went to Benny  but he does the better shooting guard fantasy wise  Atlanta took everything and they're all should all the squeeze by the vaunted 16 and 30 Toronto Raptors  this is my tongue in my cheek Jordan Noir I had 24 points for Toronto watch list watch list because it's really not clear what might be about to happen for Toronto gradey dick should be watchlisted John tape Porter should be watchlisted although I think Yakima portal will be back provided they don't move him  Bruce Brown got to start in this ball game know RJ Barrett and no manual quickly so things are all over the map okay so let's pause for a second on Toronto before we get into like the Nitty Gritty of each of the individual player and frankly I don't even know that we need to  it is important to point out that two of the top three usage guys on the team were gone for this game  so yeah Schroeder got to do more  gradey dick Gary Trent Jr Jordan Aurora Bruce Brown Dante Porter all these guys got to shoot way more because quickly and Barrett those two dudes weren't there  so you don't want to read too much into this game the thing you want to read into with Toronto is what direction are they going at the trade deadline we've already seen them move siakam does anybody else get moved we know Bruce Brown is a candidate to get shuttled onto another team would they move Jenna Schroeder who like is he really part of a rebuild plan  is it a full rebuild what's what's the what is the actual direction is this going to be like a partial rebuild or is this a full tear down because if it's a full tear down Turtle could be on the move  and Trent could be on the move and Schroeder could be on the move and brown could be on the move and then you got to figure out who the hell that leaves behind  we don't know right now  is it going to be the gradey dick Showdown the stretch  you don't really want to say dick show in a row on a podcast but you kind of have no choice  comedy but that doesn't help all that much is it going to be a Jordan Noah show  I don't think you need to pick up these guys including Gary Trent who I think is you know he's like seventh out of eight name I probably up to nine names now he's like at a nine names on the trade deadline a stash candidate board for me so very close to the bottom  but you saw it here I mean if he gets a dozen shots  he can be interesting fantasy wise  but you don't need to stash these dudes the only reason you're picking up these guys if you think quickly and bear it Miss another ballgame which I mean iq's missed a couple so you never know  no dejounte Murray with what they're calling a hamstring  wink wink nod nod I'm sure it's a I'm sure it's a devastating hamstring injury that's  that's keeping Deonte out for Atlanta apparently you know there's some stuff that's floating around on Twitter that he's been very irritated with the way the team is being run and we know he's on the Block  and this just might be them saying  you know enough like you're getting traded We're Not Gonna risk you turn in ankle and blowing this up for us we're gonna get as much value as we can even if it's not nearly what we spent to get you which I mean  who couldn't who couldn't have predicted that putting bringing in another feature guard alongside Trey young would work out all that great and any event the good news here is that with Deonte out and well trade back there was sort of this flip-flop of usage that it didn't get chewed up with Trae young returning I think whatever is one game back not for this one Trace been back for a couple ball games but it meant that all that extra usage was still floating around and the other player pool so saddiq Bey got 18 shots and Jayla Johnson got 17 shots try young 24 11 Clint capela got a dozen shots oh only seven whoop whoop but and again Atlanta is another team where you're like I don't really know what direction this team is going because if they move Murray and you know the rumors are all out there that they don't want to take to D'angelo Russell back they'd want to shut him onto a third team that's sounds like a club that wants to go into more of a rebuild  but it's Trey Young on board with sort of a semi rebuild  if obviously got something special in Johnson as a young player but you could move saddiq Bey you could move like a Pella you could probably moved on bug zdanowicz like I don't know where are the studs from a like a building standpoint not not like a who's hot standpoint if you were gonna tear this thing down to the studs which which players are those who are you building around Trey and Jalen Johnson and okongwu is that the three  I don't know  and so again that makes it a very difficult spot to say oh here's a possible uh stash guy but if you had to take a stab at it you'd say oh Kong woo was probably someone that they'd hold on to DeAndre Hunter who's hurt I'm guessing would be difficult to move so that's a guy they would probably hold on to Jalen Johnson feels like the very safe yes he's a guy they definitely want to build around  so what I stashed DeAndre Hunter maybe yeah I mean if he we keep hearing that he's like getting kind of close to coming back and then nothing for like a week after that  I don't know what the hell he's going to play and he can't stay healthy which is another big problem but it does feel like if they move Murray which feels almost inevitable at this point and if they move even one more guy than Hunter probably has value after that  Phoenix it's a Devin Booker show right now but it's not enough Booker's moved all the way up to number 13 thanks to one of the biggest weeks in fantasy in years honestly but his team keeps losing so something's gonna have to change a little bit Kevin Durant a couple of softer games here he's moved back down to number nine you know no biggie you're not changing anything with Phoenix just because Booker is taking all of the shots  Grayson let me start the starters basically when nerc is healthy now nurk was out for this ballgame Drew Eubanks started at Four Points 8 boards three assists a steal and a block  which um  I mean yeah that's like kind of what you'd expect if he's a fill in start  I don't know that he's a guaranteed to get 29 minutes every game that nerd is out so I'd probably pass on Eubanks but if you're like if you're feeling desperate he's probably a you know 100-2150 range filling Center  while nirk is out  markelle fultz had a nice five Steel game yesterday and seven out of 10 shooting I still don't think that faults is a top 100 guy the rest of the year I just I like they're too many ball handlers on that club if you're starting point guard that is averaging you know four assists all game which folks is at 3.6  that sort of wipes out the reason  that we were like oh we should like if you're starting point guard in the NBA you should be on a fantasy roster yes but only if you're actually getting point guard kind of stats and for false steals does kind of fit into that and it's nice to have a point guard who can be good at field goal percent but no threes not a good free throw shooter not that many assists probably not all that much scoring  the magic are damn hard team to figure out Fraud's Wagner is a nine cat play  palaban quiero is definitely more of a points League plays number 184 and 9 cat because of field goal and free throw percent and then went oh Carter Jr who you guys know I don't really like his Fantasy game but of the centers he's the one that probably belongs on rosters  but then you saw Mo Vagner get hot in this ball game Wagner was in lineups that went plus 20 and so they got extra run  which I mean that can happen every once in a while  this is not me saying to add mob Wagner this is me just saying if you're it big time into Wendell Carter Junior I  not with you on that train and then Jalen Suggs is really the guy that I've kind of gone back and forth with this team this is a better ball game for him but Suggs had been bad for like a solid five or six weeks he's falling outside the top 15 after sitting near 70 for a long time the Steels is going to be the category that gets him back so two steals in a block in this one that's good  is it the start of something I don't know but I am willing you know because we've seen it he did it when he had some energy  if the energy kind of kicks back into high gear for Suggs then he's a guy you're definitely gonna want  this is one of those ones where I want to I want to toe the line but as a fantasy podcast host you sort of aren't allowed to tow the line so I probably not  getting back in on Suggs yet I'm probably a game away if you can do another good one then I'll probably dive back in  Chicago know Patrick Williams on top of the nose aquiline who also kind of feels like he's out to the trade deadline we'll see but with no he will know Peewee IL  got into the starting lineup love in five and three with three blocks that was a bit unusual but if I was starting you can start him and for the Bulls right now this starting five  is a nice way to probably get all five dudes with fantasy value now a Kobe white came through with a classic  points League over nine cat kind of line but listen like he'll be fine Kobe white will be fine his numbers on the year are always going to surprise people he's number 90 on the season people like really is that low yeah because field goal percent has been a big dragon he doesn't get defensive stats and so you kind of have to think about these things in nine cat but he'll be fine tomorrow will be fine vooch is fine drum and had one of his sort of one once every once in a while explosion games Caruso I still like a lot big you guys know I'm a big fan of Caruso where is he now 69 and 9 cat  nice  anyway uh Patrick Williams when he comes back I'm not  uh yeah I don't think I start him in rodo could probably go ahead to head there because he just closed it up but honestly I'm happy with this way because I owe has a better more translatable Fantasy game that means you can start it  Portland side Malcolm Brogden is a goal as long as shading sharp or Jeremy Grant or Anthony Simons is out when the one of those guys is out Brockton gets that usage and he uses it better than these other guys it's nice to see yandere have a couple of good ball game in a row Simon's cold Grant decent school still learning Jabari Walker and I don't know why everybody gets so mad at me when I say that I think he really needs one guy out of his way to still get to that fantasy mark  and someone on Twitter was just like he's already a play I'm like well  I don't like I get it you know he's had a decent stretch here of points and rebounds  but that points and rebounds death not a fantasy line make he's averaging ten and nine over the last three weeks but on 44% shooting from the field 72 at the free throw line point eight combined defensive stats and that's got him outside the top 200 this is Jabari Walker we're talking about  if it you know a long shot Jeremy Grant gets traded which I don't think is happening then I think you can look at Jabari Walker and then I would be on board but I don't think we're there  I don't think we're there yet  let's turn the clock back to Saturday go through some of these teams there's Daniel Gafford winner of our trivia question today pretty amazing what he's done this year  inside the top 35  that's a beautiful thing right there  that's beautiful thing  the fun for Ty is Jones mayor shortly be running out we're about 10 days away from him likely being on another team and not getting to do all this fun stuff which is a shame and that's kind of what we knew was gonna happen he was always going to be either a shutdown or a trade risk I was high on him because I thought he'd have an outstanding first four months of the season and he basically has he's inside the top 60 when the Wizards have competitive ballgames he's been better than that he's like you know 1 1 5  it's quite conceivable that his run is coming to an end this is a nice one because they got to play the Pistons which meant to basically everybody had fantasy value and I don't know that we need to talk much more about the Wizards  Keep playing off Dia he's been good enough I know his numbers were lower in this one cool belief is a guy where I've said it before I'll just repeat myself quickly here I think he needs both tyus Jones and a high usage guy out of the way because he can get the minutes as we saw on this one he played 31 minutes but he took only seven shots  so get you some rebounds get you some steals I need him to score a little bit I need a little bit more than that  and that means someone's got to get out of the way that shoots  we shall see we talked Pistons all ready so we can slide on past them to Miami who lost again but at least Jimmy Butler looked a little bit more like himself but there's been a second rounder since coming back from his last injury which I think is basically what we were hoping for you know the issue is that he had such a long stretch where he was not playing well but Jimmy is up to number 34 on the season now remember two weeks ago he was number 49 yeah it doesn't take much a few good game steals are up to 1.2  after another three Steel game here if he gets a couple more of those will be a second rounder  I get it he's never gonna hit the marker because he's only played in 31 games and this is this is why these guys are rohto only type players  now Kauai who I've called a roto only kind of guy because of the game's cap situation he's playing games this year so he's working out at all formats but that doesn't mean it was incorrect to say go for him in games cap I think it would have been fine to avoid Kawaii in head to head leaks yeah you're missing out on a win but it would have been nerve-racking to pick a guy who you thought would probably sit a bunch of ball games it's not nerve wracking on the roadside and Jimmy Butler yeah he's been a pain in the butt in all formats but all of a sudden now he's playing better and if you're in a rodeo games cap leading took them you know late third round or something like that per game he's basically even with his ADP now  maybe what like four slots behind it  he's like two good games from being ahead of his ADP on a per game basis guys just I mean I get it like it's been frustrating but it hasn't been  at overwhelming  any who you're not playing anybody on Miami outside of the four key guys Jaime akez junior is worth keeping an eye on though they loved him  if his minutes ramp back up to 30 or thereabouts 28 29 I think that would put him back on rosters and if you want to pick them up now and just hope that it happens I'm okay with that  big news of The Weeknd Julius Randle dislocated shoulder  the early Imaging we got a report from woj and Shams this morning the early Imaging suggests that it's not the worst possible outcome for Randall that it's you know  slightly dislocated or whatever I don't know what the terminology would be for that but they're hoping back in a few weeks in stead of a few months so that's really much better for people who have Randall and fantasy which means you kind of have to you have to sit on him but it's also really good for the Nicks who've been playing their damn butts off lately holy crap they won six games in a row make sure a game back at the Sixers for the three seed in the east they have been storming the roost  in the meantime with Randall likely to miss time however long we don't know I expect Isaiah hartenstein who is getting re-acclimated he'll ramp back up to his big role so that'll be good  Donte divincenzo only played 20 minutes in this one they may not have really a choice but to play him in the mid to high 20s and he was already a guy that we like because of his per game numbers I was souring on Devon chenzo because his percentages were starting to weigh a little bit but I think you got a hold their  and nobody's gonna do more brunson's going to do more the two names you guys I know are most curious about and I saved them for the end of this discussion is precious to chewa and Josh Hart  in my eyes is a must add must play in all formats  they're going to need his toughness to counter what they lose with Randall the rebounding the defense all that stuff is going to have to be Josh Hart  and they can't go precious that you are because  he's very bad on offense  and there's just only so much you can remove offensively before your team doesn't have enough to compete on that and it can't just be Jalen Brunson taking 30 shots and now that Josh Hart is like super skilled on offense but he's better than precious to chewa by number of levels he is that you are going to get to play more absolutely no question because the next don't have the depth they had a month ago  and now it's gonna get tested a little bit  if you want rebounds and a steal you can pick up a Chua I don't think he's going to be a top 100 play in nine cat because we've seen over the years he has these big deficiencies in his Fantasy game  Josh Hart in my eyes is almost like a guaranteed top 75 and 9 cat while Julius randle's out with the possibility to go harder than that  because not only is he going to be basically guaranteed the minutes which throughout his career of heart got 30 minutes you ends up usually playing himself into an injury so let's hope that that can be staved off but we're talking about a shooting guard that can probably averaged seven rebounds a game in starters minutes and he's going to get through four assists because like they'll have no choice but to do a lot of ball movement he gets steals he gets threes doesn't I'm pretty good field goal percent not a great foul shooter doesn't take that many but he's gonna get shots now because Randall's you know High Teens in shots are coming out of the pool  and yes a lot of that's going to go to Brunson but there's only so much that one man can do by himself so Josh Hart instead of seven shots a game 8 9 10 something like that it's actually a big difference so Josh Hart must add must play and then achua  Philly said everybody in Denver you can just wipe this game right off the board because those dudes will probably back be back for the next one that was no Tobias Harris no Tyrese Maxey know Joel embiid  I don't think there's another game the rest of the year where they rest all three of those guys at least not until maybe like the last half week of basketball  now if they do should this ever come up again  Paul Reed was amazing Kelly oubre was great Patrick Beverley was great even Marcus Morris was actually so much useful of those guys if this all happened again I think redo and Beverly are the ones that you could probably trust certainly read a new brand and then Pat Bev is kind of your like is he gonna drive angry that day we hope so  I got nothing to say about the Nuggets they're just the same thing every night  usually it ends well for them Houston this game was kind of a weird one still no Jabari Smith Jr  so Jeff Green got the start but basically got run off the floor so they went heavier on cam Whitmore who had a really nice ball game actually 19 and 9 with 33s and 29 bench it's I you know I get it I like cam Whittemore  probably more so on the keeper or Dynasty side because in my eyes as soon as Jabari Smith Jr comes back  that job goes back to him  and then Houston is still waiting on the nebulous return of tari Eason  and in my eyes they're just sort of Aren't Enough minutes to go around  this game was and we haven't seen that much of it this year but this game was another one where Shane got played off the court a few games like this have happened recently his nine cat number is dropped back to number 53 or after he had moved into the early 40s  and it's reason for concern  now typically he's so good on offense talking Shane that they'll sort of take  take the bad with the good  but when they're down bars with Junior ontari Eason and they don't have the defensive horses around operating  to minimize what he is unable to do on defense you can see why they've had to sort of try different things I wouldn't be worried about it long term but it is something that's happening here in the short term and you have to sort of pay some attention to it Jalen green has had two or three pretty good ballgames in a row uh I'm inclined to just say dude got a little bit of his confidence back he's probably due for a little heater this is a cell moment if you've been sitting on him the whole year you shouldn't have been because I yelled at you guys over and over again not to draft him but heaven forbid maybe somebody joined our podcast our Sports ethos fantasy NBA Today circle of friends and like December and they had already been told foolishly to go draft Jalen green this would be your moment to try to unload you may not have another  Dorian Finney Smith was midway through having his best ball game in two months and he turned ankle for Brooklyn we know he's actually on the trade blocs so we'll see what happens there right so Neil's on the blocks but Spencer did he's on the Block  sounds like the two cams and Mikhail Bridges and klaxon are not but who knows  Bridges continues to be better thank the good Lord for that he's got a long way to go though but at least he's now up to into the 70s on the season after sitting outside the top 100 two weeks ago so that's that's progress man we'll take them baby steps cam Thomas gotta start and was amazing this is probably a cell moment for him as well and here's why  okay wait let me let me let me walk that back a tiny bit because there's a lot going on with Brooklyn right now  first of all the biggest story with the Nets is not the Dorian Finney Smith went out is that Ben Simmons is probable for Brooklyn's next ball game which is that tonight  I think it's tonight yeah they're hosting the Jazz in like seven hours  what the hell do we do there is question number one  so you're picking him up  because you have to  but you're picking up Ben Simmons  understanding and I've said it on this pod I've got on the record I'll say it again I'm not gonna try to back down from this that I don't know that he plays more than five games the rest of this year  if he's truly healthy  I will be happy for him I am not rooting for him to be back out after five games again I just like we've seen it  and you know me I Am The Proven fantasy analyst and I'm okay with kind of being that prove it fuddy-duddy in the fantasy Community it's an image that I have cultivated from many many years now but again like let's say he actually comes through and plays for a while uh then you want to see what he can do he was not a top 109 cat guy before going down earlier this year despite playing 32 minutes a game he was at six and a half points 11 rebounds six and a half assists all you know rebounds and assists are nice but the Steals and blocks are weighed down from where he was it you know Peak Ben Simmons that he just doesn't have that in his body anymore he's a terrible foul shooter has been throughout his career field goal percent is a positive but he doesn't shoot ever so you're basically relying on League average blocks hopefully he would get up to Lee averaging steals if you sort of gave him enough time and can stay healthy  slight positive field goal percent brutal negative and free throw percent and then you know you get small wins you get a win in assistance you get a weird and rebounds  so you're looking at me like okay can you be dream on green on a medium day  maybe  maybe  you know last year he was at 7 points six boards six assists but at least he was at one point three Steals and that got him a little closer to Fantasy value but you know again this is a guy who's played six games this year and he played about half of last season with big gaps in the middle he didn't play an entire year before that I just don't believe he's gonna stay healthy I don't believe that his body can withstand the punishment of a regular NBA season  so even if he comes out there and goes for 7:10 and 7 and even if he gets the Steals and blocks up try to think about Ben Simmons as a short-term add in your mind say look I'm expecting this guy to play for me for like a week  call it a short term and if you get anything beyond that cool also they're not gonna ramp as minutes up super fast he's not gonna come out and play 31 minutes this first game so if you're picking him up which I think you probably should  understand you might be waiting through the trade deadline or longer it actually see him get into the high 20s or low 30s and minutes if ever we might end up parting with him if he never hits that Mark  no cam Johnson in this game all so worth pointing out so that opened up more for cam Thomas because those guys have now started splitting minutes which is extremely annoying  so let's say Simmons and Johnson both come back cam Johnson had been trending down for a long time I think you have to hold to see what happens at the trade deadline more so than what I think is actually going to happen here in the short term it seems in my eyes like cam Johnson is gonna get 25 minutes and he's not going to be inside the top 100 between now and February 8th but again that's only 10 days away  so I think we can I think we can call him a very a really interesting deadline stash because if they Dorian Finney Smith and or so Neil gets out of the way and let's say Ben Simmons lasts a week two weeks and has to go back down suddenly you've got all these extra minutes floating around at small forward power forward and it gonna have to be Johnson at that point  I also think Dennis Smith Jr someone to keep an eye on he's a possible trade deadline stash or you can just wait and if you see the name didn't weedy appear on your screen on trade deadline morning you just  you know Auto add Dennis Smith before you even read the rest of the tweet  that in my eyes is kind of the only way to play the Nets right now  so you hold Johnson through the deadline keep Dennis Smith Jr like an ad window and a tab open on your browser with Dennis Smith Jr as an ad and then watch the feed all day long and cam Thomas who I was like well this is a cell moment yes it's a cell moment but also he's another one I think you should probably hold through the deadline because again if they move Dinwiddie  and Dorian Finney Smith or something like that and cam Thomas gets to start again however he gets into that starting five and he starts taking 2022 shots of ball game he can be first of all he'd be a big win in points League's and he probably would squeeze inside the top 109 cat you sort of overwhelmed the bad stuff with the good stuff  but that doesn't change the fact that 37 points here is a cell moment for him it can be two things at the same time  I'm talking a lot today Utah over Charlotte John Collins is actually had two good ball games in a row  I had dropped him I think it's safe to say you can add to see where this goes I also think that the competition played a pretty sizeable role here because  we'd seen Collins minutes it's a basically sat around 24-25 for the Jazz lately but he got more this ball game he was playing well he was playing confident he was taking shots and making them and we've seen that coach Hardy is going to go with a hot hand and he was a hot hand here so stream John Collins I think he probably goes in the Stream while warm bucket for me because he's warm right now and then when his minutes if they taper back off to 24 which maybe they don't but assuming I'm gonna guess that they will then you could potentially move on but again there's one thing that I'm trying to be better at its riding hot hands for a long time on this podcast I didn't bother riding the hot hand because I was like well it's gonna cool off so what's the point well the point is if you can squeeze something out of a guy even if you don't know a finite end date because I always like to better when it was like oh this is a pickup cuz somebody's hurt so I know the finite and date  the playing while warm is more like  kind of playing the stock market where like you have some indicators me I should check my stocks today you have some indicators of when a stock is going up and when is going down you can kind of like get a feel for what they do like oh you know Apple stock is one that I've kept an eye on oh it's bounced between like 175 and 190 for the last I don't know almost year so you know if it goes down you buy it goes up you can sell it and you can kind of ride those little waves and that's kind of what a lot of these dream while warm guys are but every once in a while you you buy at the wrong time you sell it the wrong time it's a little more complicated but it's not impossible and so that's where I need to be and I'm trying to be better for all of you guys to be more willing to say  dive on a dive in on this hot guy even if we know it's not gonna last forever and even if we don't know the exact time that it's over  Jordan Clarkson being another one he's now cooled off over the last couple of ball games after his insanely hot run this is more of the okay he's on the way down when he gets towards the bottom and you start to see him loop back up out of it and you could play a hot hand again that's okay  let all sat this one out for Charlotte I think he's questionable what's the latest on lamelo I haven't seen his update this morning I think he's questionable  and in any of that it doesn't sound like it's a super long term thing that's the important part ish Smith started and had 0 points in 12:00 no you're not adding ish Smith and no you're not streaming Cody Martin yes you're holding onto Brandon Mueller specifically because his role is only gonna grow post-trade deadline Nick Richards stream miles Bridges everybody's like what can I sell him for it's like well most people know he's on the Block but you know honestly if you could get like a top 60 guy back I think for Bridges you should do it and then PJ Washington it when the Mellow comes back PJ gets hurt because he needs these shots he needs to be a guy who can go take shots  but look it Rosie got traded that opened up some shots for PJ and a miles Bridges gets moved that opens up some more so I think PJ's another guy where it's like look you can call it a hot hand situation but he's also a guy that if he's not moved and he could be by the way Washington is not a guaranteed to stay there he's a guy that should be moving into more value in Charlotte so make sure PJ Washington is rostered right now he's not a trade deadline stash because he's playable anyway but he is kind of a trade deadline possible winner and maybe that would make it would have made him a buy guy but you can't buy after a 43.73 game Canyon  I have no thoughts on the Clippers I've expressed them a million times I don't Russell Westbrook has been generally the winner with each of zubats out but he wasn't good here and we know Russ has his massive Nine Cats struggles so you cannot really convinced me to get in on the Russell Westbrook thing  no I don't care about Daniel Tyson having a big ball game no I don't care about Mason Plumlee being a little bit better in the last two you're just playing Hardin Kawhi and PG on the Clippers right now play zubats when he comes back for Boston they just they were bad Jalen Brown was bad Jayson Tatum was not very good  Derek white was terrible Al Horford was filling in for porcas and he was bad  he really nobody dodged a bullet in this game uh  Al Horford will I think Boston has a back-to-back coming up so he'll rest one of them and of course Angus rests the other one then you guys know what to do there but I don't I don't really have anything else on the Celtics they just they got spanked  as did the Pelicans fortunately JV kind of survived this one  Larry Nance is somehow putting up fantasy value in like 18 to 20 minutes of ball game I don't really know how he's doing it and I remain frankly somewhat nervous that 20 minutes isn't enough  but we also know that Larry Nance has an insanely translatable Fantasy game rebounds three steals some blocks good both percentages often  like he his body can't take 28 minutes of ball game we've seen that now for about four years in a row but if he could just get up to like 23 I'd feel more comfortable with it I'm still going to say add Nance after a 17 minute 10 and 5 performance I really I think he can be a top 100 guy in 20 minutes a ballgame but again I get it it's sort of a low-end center and so if that's not your jam fine and he doesn't really have a great path to more because nobody's getting moved out of his way on this team unless JV gets hurt or Zion Knicks needs some time off or whatever this is this is what it is but it's okay it's actually just barely enough as is the story with herb Jones he's just barely enough normally he has a big ball game when Trey Murphy is resting this one again they got they got destroyed so very few players had big ballgames herb is you know top 100 when the team is healthy Nancy's top 100 when the team is healthy Trey Murphy is probably just outside of that Mark obviously he's in a cold snap right now you could make an argument to hold all three of those guys but with Trey taking back to backs off I don't think that Murphy needs to  be held on the head-to-head side he's probably more trouble than he's worth  if I was ranking them I would want Nance then herb then Trey  I don't have any of them is like you must roster them I don't think they're different makers but I do think Nance has at least they safest Fantasy game when the team is fully healthy I have no thoughts on the Milwaukee Bucks they have a new coach and  we'll see how it develops  Spurs beat the Timberwolves so both of the top teams in the west had an oopsies game over the weekend Thunder and wolves lost to some Bottom Feeders that has now brought believe it or not the Clippers and the nuggets are within a game of the top seed in the Western Conference now  and this is this is the Mike Conley effect he's dealing with the sore hamstring he had a flu last week Conley's missed a few games lately and the wolves have been totally unfocused like the need for a backup point guard on that team could not be possibly more evident than with Conley just missing a couple of games and the Wolves falling apart at the dam seams  I know their fantasy notes on them I'm not starting to kill Alexander Walker even when he fills in it's not consistent enough other than good Lord is Mike Conley actually the MVP of the NBA this year because that team went from World beater to crap with him out Wendy's minutes cap is being raised and he might play in some back-to-backs going forward it sounds like that's on the docket that is amazing news for a guy who's figured out the NBA a lot faster than I expected I thought he'd be like in the low 40s and field goal percent he's at 46 and a half now um he's a wonder and a Marvel of modern science so enjoy it you're you're getting the wemby action about a month and a half sooner than I thought  as I facer I figured he'd finished the season on more of kind of like a flourish when a lot of teams kind of stopped competing but he's making the adjustments on the Fly really impressive from Wendy trade Jones is a whole of a cell is a whole um Jeremy Sohan you know we knew he would ebb and flow he'd been in a really hot run  is this a stream while warm that's probably the best descriptor because I still don't think it's percentages are just gonna magically all get better they are certainly better in this setup you know we trade Jones at point and vissel and when be alongside he's getting better looks he doesn't have to set other people up at the same way can be more aggressive looking for his own better shots uh and you know from a reality standpoint maybe that's sort of again I get a little bit unfair I get so tied up in the fantasy side so on is not a bad reality basketball player or you won't be still young  and he can get you some points and some boards and some assists and some Steals and some blocks and you like all that stuff  but the percentage is really do still have a ways to go and that's why I can't fully get over the hump with him as like oh yeah rest of season and I don't think rest of season but again stream while warm that's okay just be ready if the bottom falls out  Lakers and Warriors that was absolutely the game of the weekend double overtime Lakers winners 145 144 LeBron ad d d low Reeves and now Jarred Vanderbilt interesting little note on the Lakers Vanderbilt is another ad from the weekend and addition to Josh Hart and I know some of these hearts on some rosters all ready but Vandal wasn't really he's had a couple better ball games lately did tweaking ankle in this one I don't think he's on the Lakers injury report which is a good sign but you know keep one eye on that but his energy is back he's got his sea legs again and he's able to finish better that was a huge issue for him coming back early this year his rebounding has been way better the Steels are way better I think there's just a lot to like you know they're gonna be games now where Tori and Prince comes out and hits a couple of three pointers or if cameras comes back and he's playing better where Vanderbilt won't get as many minutes and like you know 41 in here a lot of that was because of the double overtime because the Lakers were so much better with him on the court there will be games where he's not the right answer at that spot  so be ready for those but by and large I think he's now convinced the players  players want him out there  and it's seems like he's not convinced the coaches that he's fast enough and healthy enough that he's gonna kind of get not necessarily a start but kind of first crack at those minutes even if he's coming off the bench I think you can add Vanderbilt and then as the Warrior's go they went to this new look starting five Draymond kaminga Wiggins clay and staff and again everybody's numbers were hugely inflated in a double overtime game  and I I still don't trust Andrew Wiggins as far as I can toss him but I think you probably need to make sure that all five of those guys are rostered right now because what if we can just magically wakes up and he got dropped in a lot of places because he was horrible for most of the season he's available in like half of the League's that I'm in I think you kind of need to give him a roster spot even if it's just for one game even if he comes back out against Philly tomorrow and poops the bed and you drop him again  if Andrew Wiggins starts to play like Wiggins from the last two years that's a top 100 guy or better  but look he's been at 12 points for boards and one and a half assists this season and his head isn't in The Game and his field goal percentage down 4% from the last three years and it's threes are back down from Two and a Half to one and his free throw percent is still not good which it's been his whole damn career and his steals are crazy he's eighteen point four steals  this guy that is one as a starter  what if some of that stuff starts to come back what if you start to get a look at like old man like the previous version of Wiggins so throw him out of your roster for one day that's all I'm asking you coming is really hot right now and they're giving him as much as he can handle so he should be on rosters and I admit I was slow to get on board on the road oh side I did say as soon as he started playing more get him for head to head don't worry about the percentages immediately let's see what happens Roto I was very skeptical and I still made a bit skeptical because he doesn't get defensive stats and he doesn't shoot the free throw well but they're giving him all he can handle so that's a reason to explore it that's it nobody else on this team needs to be on a roster right now  they've gone so heavy into the starters  Sacramento Bee Dallas Kevin herder is playable right now so you know have him get him in lineups Harrison Barnes is very hot right now I don't really trust him  as far as I can toss him we've seen enough Harrison Barnes over the years to know like I mean he's focused right now so that's a big deal  if you want to play the stream while warm game on Barnes and her I'm fine I'm fine with that I think herder his path is just easier  because he  he it's more 3-pointers than Barnes does he tends to assist more than Barnes does Harrison his value is usually mostly just in points and free throw percent now he's been on a crazy run lately but  I mean we've got to think the bottom is about to fall out there I just don't know exactly when and then because of those guys playing better Malik monk is going through a little bit of a dry spell  if I'm ranking these guys I probably prefer to have monk overheard her over Barnes I think monk is a guy that should remain on Ross's I think herders a guy that should be on roster is right now and I'm totally fine with you completely ignoring the Harrison Barnes heater if you want as far as Dallas goes there was no Kyrie again to remember jammed his thumb like a week ago and said I'm fine and now he's out for what is he missed four games already and he's already been ruled out for tonight  Duty I say to that no you're not adding Grant Williams after a 7.3 pointer game he might actually be on a little hot run so you may miss another good one but you know I think I'd rather miss a good one then play Hymn for a total tank game  Luca obviously he's gonna have to do everything with no Kyrie Tim Hardaway Jr is streamable when either Luke or Kyrie is out talked about that Derek Lively is your guy at Center I would love to see the Mavericks make a move for a center someone to have their while they're developing Lively but as long as that's not happening you can continue to play Lively and I'm not worried about guys like Josh green or Jaden Hardy or Dante Exum or Derek Jones Junior because and I've said this for a while I don't think and now listen if they come back while Kyrie is out then maybe you could explore it but once this team gets healthy I don't think anybody be side's Luca Kyrie and Lively at that point would actually have fantasy value  did anybody not play Saturday or Sunday I don't remember let's do that old game I think like the Cavs I believe we're the only team that didn't play over the weekend  yeah that sounds right all right let's go to Friday let's look at Cleveland's last ball game they even play on Friday  uh  I know they played on Friday why am I not seeing it I gotta get my eyes checked  my looking at all I'm looking at the wrong Friday haha thank you everybody thank you watch Dan struggle and there's the Cavs  so not a ton of thoughts on on Cleveland Carousel Levert  should be playable with Garland out who they keep saying he's getting closer and then we we're not hearing anything about it so I would play Levert strus playable again it looks like he's maybe starting to wiggle his way out of a funk is shooting wasn't as good in this ball game but the rebounds the assist the steals were back there and the 35th that's the important thing and then obviously Jared Allen and Donovan Mitchell have been amazing Sam Merrill the cool off you knew it was coming you knew it was coming no way that dude was just gonna hit for three pointers a game forever  you just yeah new it so Jared Allen Donovan Mitchell Street and probably Levert are the guys you're playing on the Cavs right now who man alive and that was a very long and intense weakened review quickly on the week ahead and I don't I forgot to get the graphic ready here so what I'm gonna try to do is on the Fly  where is the zoom button there's the zoom button on the Fly we're gonna share the sports ethos premium stream board  so if you're watching the video you'll get a little treat here just quickly so that you guys can kind of see what the week looks like first of all you can check out the great Derek ball and his work with the week ahead over on Sports ethos.com and then there's a sort of a company thread on Twitter  but this is what the premium stream board looks like it's got all the games lined up  now we can kind of see visually how to stack guys so Boston you can see it here Boston has a back-to-back today the Lakers have a back-to-back today tomorrow  the Knicks have a back-to-back Philly as a back-to-back today tomorrow Utah has a back-to-back today tomorrow so there's a lot of choice is uh today could however be an overload day so check on that  in terms of sort of game planning your week out today is what is that a dozen games today I think there's 12 today 5 on Tuesday Wednesday is 10 so that one's bordering on overload just four on Thursday  10 again on Friday this is a big back and forth kind of week so make sure that you've got you you checked your calendar to make sure whatever streaming moves you're making are not putting your team into a spot where you're like adding a player on it where you're already full  so what you should probably be looking at is who goes on Tuesday and Thursday that's a nice spot to be in here's the 30th and February 1st so Boston is Tuesday Thursday Indiana the Lakers are two State Thursday the Nicks the Sixers some of the teams who just talked about and the Jazz so a lot of these teams that go three times in the first four days of the week that's where you should be looking to start the week and then once you get through Thursday then you just want to make sure you get anybody that has two games arrest the way so it's really more about which teams to avoid during that stretch and this is such a
