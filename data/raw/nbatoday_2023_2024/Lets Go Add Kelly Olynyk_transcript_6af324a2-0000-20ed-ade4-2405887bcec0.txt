welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast good morning everybody good morning and yes indeed it is a good morning  which I feel a little bit bad about saying that when the next sentence is Jakob Pearl heard his ankle  that's not very nice of me but you guys all know what I'm getting at here it's the thumbnail for the video it's the title for the video it's the title in my heart  it might be Kelly Olynyk time  friends it might be Kelly Olympic time now I say might because I don't want to get too carried away we don't know the severity of turtles anchored ankle tweak that's hard to say by the way Turtles ankle tweak  I got it on the second try  he may not miss any games at all this might be enough nothing  but on the off chance it's a something because Toronto plays again tomorrow their host Dallas they go every other day this week it's a four game or  we get some Kelly time I don't really see another pathway forward for the Raptors besides starting Olynyk  they could run real small but that wouldn't last long that would basically be Scotty Barnes of the five because the rest of that I mean I don't know you guys will you know we're gonna get into the roster in a minute here the Raptors are a small basketball team  by all accounts  not like  everybody on the roster is little just that they don't have a whole lot of size they traded away Pascal siakam they traded away Ogden Obi and the guys they got back RJ Barrett  it's kind of like the big one in that deal and then Olynyk came back in the other one  Kelly is the Big Man on that club  so yes you will see some Scotty at the five but it ain't going to be all that much and if you look at the numbers yesterday and we're gonna get into that in just a second again they were like four ish minutes that turtle in Olynyk didn't  account for at the center position  that's not to say that a Linux gonna play 44 minutes its Center but it is to say that if poodle has to miss a ball game and I firmly believe that this is one of those scenarios where it doesn't matter  if you're head-to-head if you Rodeo whatever  if you get a start  and a full game of numbers out of Kelly Olynyk you take it  even if it doesn't explicitly add  to your games played in a given week  and this requires another chat actually so let's do this before we even I haven't even said hello yet but we launched freaking face first we're plowing at 100 miles an hour right into the Kelly Olynyk discussion  there is a class of player analytic isn't it but there's a class of player  Alex technically I guess for our purposes here Kelly is it  that player is  if that guy whatever it is in this case it's Olynyk but it could be any number of other guys is probably you know  somewhere between like 30 and 50 of them in the NBA where if they get full starters minutes  they are basically double the production of a streamer level guy so obviously the guys at the top of the board everybody through like basically the top 35 is in that department you can look at a guy like deer and Fox as an example 27 points almost 33 pointers two boards five and a half assists almost two steals that's basically double what you're getting out of somebody that you yanked off the waiver wire to plop into that spot  the guy you're picking up is probably gonna give you like 13 to and three with a steel that's half of what dear and fox is doing  so that level of player and then you know the cutoff is blurry a bit because of percentage is and how that impacts a players ranking but like the guys around that point  are roughly double the production of a stream will streamer level guy  and those aren't the only guys they're doing it those are just the guys that are doing it every night  Kelly Olynyk is a guy like that and we know it because when he gets full starter's minutes he is close to double the production  of a traditional streamer level guy we haven't really seen it this year I don't think he's at a single game do you have a game where he hit 30 minutes one he had one game this year December 21st I was skimming through the game log here one game this year where he cracked 30 minutes he played 34 and a half this back then is Utah days ages ages ago 27 points 3 boards six assists four steals three three-pointers 10 out of 16 from the field for the free throw line yeah that's double  there's a couple of the games in there that are sort of like nuzzling up against it he had a 29 minute game if you want to say like starter oh you know what I found one November 22nd 13 9 and 5 a steal a little block and a perfect five for five from the field and three for three at the free throw line  but this is this is a living and this is a Linux even in situations where he's not at and exceptionally High usage guy we don't even need the Houston Rockets iteration of him where he was also a usage dude so he plays full starters minute there and he was taking double digit shots a game we don't even need that guy we just need the guy that's going to play 28 29 30 minutes because he is out there that long he's gonna get you eight rebounds he's probably gonna get you five assists because the Dude can pass like a son of a gun he's gonna hit a 3-pointer maybe more than one and his percentage is gonna be awesome he gets Steals and blocks and again just by being out there that long on a team that wants to play Fast open free  he's gonna be in double-digit points also  so again just look at the game log we already talked about a couple of them there were one or two other ones December 13th he played 29 minutes he had 9 points 10 boards 8 assists so a near triple-double December 16th he played 29 minutes he had 9 points five boards 13 assists a steal the block at a three  but that's basically it he had a 27 minute game at the end of December we went for 196 and 10  all in your triple double  there aren't that many guys in the NBA that pushed triple double when they get started his minutes on good percentages both  both  so if you guys are wondering why I make such a freaking stink about Kelly Olynyk this is why  the dudes playing 20 minutes a game right now and he's inside the top one 40 technically he's been startable in a lot of formats this year  but that's on 20 minutes and taking just five shots a game  on a team where he is maybe slightly valued a bit more  and that and the minutes increase by 50% into a starter's role 8 points becomes 12 500 becomes seven and a half for assists becomes 6 1 0.8 steals becomes one point two point three blocks becomes 0.5 which potentially could go even higher and he's at 55.84 percentage is splits  you're talking 12 points 7.5 boards six assists over 3 pointer over a steel on good percentages  that's a top 50 run  and that's why I would use a move on him if so Roto you pick them up right now because it doesn't cost anything to use a move head-to-head you probably have to wait until tomorrow to find out if Turtles gonna miss a ball game  and if he does I think you just add him even if all you get is one big Kelly day  happy big Kelly day everyone  yeah we're going big Kelly day today and this is before we've even gotten into the box scores from yesterday but there's only four ball games and one of them was gonna be all about Kelly so whatever good morning again everybody  the show opening rant I haven't done a lot of show opening rants lately but that was fun I am Dan Bass Pros this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation you can find me on social at Dan best briefs d a n b e s b r i s I hope you guys will indeed find me over there please do take moment at the front end of the show to like rate and subscribe and of course hang out with our buddies over at man's or yeah manscape.com I don't know why I hesitated on that that's an absolutely  that's an absolutely  absolutely  ethos 2-0 ethos 20 is the promo code over there make sure to check out our buddies and manscape.com get yourself some sort of  hair trimmer  enjoy the hair tremori  clean yourself up  look pretty like me  yeah it's not true  all righty okay let's dive into the rest of the stuff from yeah yesterday obviously the Lin was the big story I wanted to open with that the other stuff from the Raptors Pacers game gradey dick played 23 minutes yet 185 and two with four three-pointers notable  but not pick up a bowl you shot seven out of nine not a sustainable number he made all four of his three-pointers not a sustainable number and he basically just sucked Bruce Brown's minutes right into a vacuum and got them all  which is also not necessarily going to happen every ball game but he has a guy to keep an eye on for when if or when the Raptors decide to Pivot on things a little bit although I will say the the injury to Trae young May preserve the Raptors season a little bit longer they won three games in a row they're three and a half games back at the Hawks so they'll sort of semi convince themselves they can make a push at this thing here and so the next four weeks they're probably just going to play their best guys at the very least it might even be longer than that  Indiana bennedict mathurin we mentioned him on yesterday's show recapping the weekend he's your Aaron any Smith filling guy I  don't get them all right I got this one right yes yesterday I said look this is a guy who's putting up numbers even while he's shooting 35% if he has one good shooting game it could really be a pop-off kind of evening and well that's what you got here don't expect this the the end point here for bathrooms going to be somewhere in between but the Pacers definitely want niece Smith back like that's the that's the guy at this point he's kind of the glue dude in Matthew and was good like make no mistake he helped the team in the ball game but they need Smith back they need him back for his his defense this sort of hard nose Ree and we just keep watching and like what is Catherine gonna turn a corner when he's gonna start to put some pieces together  one game doth not a corner turned  how was that for poetic  anyway you're using him now that's the point that's all that really matters in this context you guys know I'm not an Andrew nem hard fantasy guy so Halliburton siakam matheran Myles Turner right now  and if you wanted I'm seeing some people that are kind of down on Halliburton these days yeah the injury got back from it kind of slowly he's falling at number nine in nine categories got passed by Victor webmin Yamaha last night whose number eight Ridiculous by the way yeah how he's been fading but like I don't think anybody's gonna sell on him  anyway uh  Detroit in New York  Quinton Grimes Revenge game  he played 24 minutes he actually looked really good 14 points 3 boards two assists a steal three blocks and three three-pointers  the minutes are not there yet he's working his way back from injury all the minutes here were lower than his first game back where he was at 26 minutes this was 24 which makes me think that getting Grimes all the way up to 28 or higher is gonna be a little bit of a tall order this is a competitive game so Detroit kind of ran their competitive lineup honestly I'm a little surprised that we didn't see more Grimes and less of maybe fontecchio but I think they like Simone's size the ability to space the floor I mean grabs hit some three-pointers yesterday too these things could remain in flux is basically the final Point here we don't always know exactly what a coach is going to do especially a coach that's been as sort of wonky with rotations and players as Monty Williams has this year  so My thought on Grimes is  if you've got a dead weight spot and you might because you know we're all of a lot of these speculative pickups after the trade deadline and you know a solid like 80 to 85% of them have turned into  turds so if you have one of those guys you could drop him and just see what's up with Grimes  if you don't have that space you're I wouldn't I wouldn't drop somebody that I'm feeling that you or I or whoever we are feeling confident in for Grimes because again there's no guarantee he gets more than 24 minutes the rest of the way  but if he does and he starts to play with sort of a semi purpose like he had at the end of last year in New York when everybody was shut down and it was you know Grimes versus the space mutants uh that would be intriguing  all so of note on Detroit Isaiah Stewart  the new Punchy and the NBA Bobby Portis you have been dethroned  the Nikola Mirotic battle  it could be retired to the annals of History although I remain very sad about it Isaiah Stewart is actually due back for this ball game he served as three games suspension the court case was tossed in Phoenix there's nothing else that's coming of that other than you know he's gonna be watched very closely by officials game in and game out not that I want you guys to go pick up Isaiah Stewart I would say watch list Stewart watch list Grimes as kind of the or like spec ad if you have a spot for him  Funko is a drop he's not the fantasy stats that doesn't hold I am a bit worried the reason I bring up Stewart is more so to say I'm a little worried about what it does to fante to us our Thomson to Grime potentially it's just another  forward slash Center that the Pistons are going to be figuring out where to slot in and generally Stewart was the starter on this team anytime he was available you basically was starting and they had a couple where they tried to bench line up but by and large uh he's going to be ramped up and he's gonna be a starter  there's a possibility this is something I'm wondering because they sent boy and bug zdanowicz out they sent Alec Burks out you know they swapped a bunch of guys Marvin Bagley obviously was sent out earlier that was the trade well before the deadline  we haven't really seen Stewart in this new look Pistons  so is there a universe where maybe he  moves into that like one 30 range  15%  so I'm not adding any of these guys again unless there's a dead weight spot and then you probably go Grimes just cuz like that's the mystery box  but keep an eye on Stewart these guys all play again tonight unless Grimes get the day off back to back after coming back from injury we'll see if he plays in this one  and we'll get a data point that's basically what we want from Detroit right now is a data point  better I think to play a conservatively here and basically just start Cade and Jane Lin Duran tonight and then everybody else you sort of feel it out the Knicks Isaiah hartenstein up to 27 minutes that means if he's playing he's a start again phew  phew  so you start the starters that's an easy one for New York even chenzo Brunson heart achua heart and Stein those are the four or five stars for the next excuse me and nobody else really matters  in the  Shams went on first take today no sorry Sean's went on whatever his thing is what is that  the drop or the heat or silly show name and he talked about how they're expecting ogn and Obey back in two to three weeks  and that unlocks somebody out of this starting five and possibly a fantasy value  my guess would be a chew up but it could also be Josh Hart  but until that time  just ride a man the way tips is  Jump On It Brooklyn clobbered the G League Grizzlies game was over early but there was some news from it Ben Simmons is terrible  for the 31st time I want nothing to do with Ben Simmons in any format cam Thomas got hurt it was an ankle tweak but it seemed like kind of a bad one we don't have a report on how bad yet I think initial Imaging revealed nothing so that's a good sign but I would be pretty floored if  he was able to kind of hang in there and play in the very next ball game I'm thinking that he'll probably miss some kind of time in which case  you know I said the cam Johnson was someone that I was giving a week to last Thursday or Friday it's Tuesday now  and yeah honestly this game wasn't that bad gameplay 25 minutes 12 2 and 3 with the stealing a couple of Threes it's Fringe level so it's not good good but it's also not bad  with Cam Thomas out that drops a lot of shots back into the bucket so now done suddenly Dennis Schroder actually might be playable for a game or two his Fantasy game doesn't translate all that well but with a lot of usage it might work  Dorian Finney Smith probably is streamable with Cam Thomas out just again because you put an extra couple of shots in the bucket of someone who does the other stuff and their value jumps a little bit and then cam Johnson I think you got a hold on to here because suddenly if he goes from nine shots to a dozen that's how he gets back sort of in the money so to speak over on the Memphis side I'm gonna reiterate exactly what I said on yesterday's show which is that Jaren Jackson Jr and Vince Williams Junior he had a bad ball game here but those are the two guys that you can actually trust on a night tonight basis those are the guys that the Grizzlies are trying to get starters minutes there is a list now of like eight guys I think that all are being guaranteed somewhere between 19 and 25 minutes a game which isn't enough for any of them to post fantasy value those guys are Luke Kennard Jake laravia  Santi aldama  Utah Watanabe Zaire Williams GG Jackson that's six that might be the number is Derek Rose isn't going to get 20 minutes his body won't take it and then Matthew hurt played only five minutes yes yesterday  and then Lamar Stevens was kind of be the seventh thing is and look everybody's like who Lamar Stevens yeah he actually has an okay fan he game of all of these guys the ones that are the most intriguing among the clunker crew the top four would be not in any particular order would be aldama Kennard Stevens and Gigi Jackson GGI knockoff because he's more points League he doesn't do anything beside this shoot and as you saw yesterday if it's bad it's real bad so knock him out of the mix aldama the percentages are going to hold him back so he's not gonna be a guy I'm looking at until Jaren Jackson takes the season off and then you look at all dhamma  so that brings you down to Kennard and Lamar Stevens as the only other guys again this is  JJ Vince Williams those guys are still to to me on the good side of the line JJ of course wins Williams is a sort of like the  questionably good  and then the next  slice was pretty good fall down but that's Kinard and Stevens because we've seen Luke he's not gonna play in back to back but when the game is competitive in a non back to back he can get up near 30 minutes and that gets him enough for nine cat value and then Lamar Stevens is a guy we're watching because he hasn't gotten anywhere near 30 minutes but of all of these guys this ridiculous list of players of like Glee's no neighbors and whatever a Stevens has the most translatable nine category Fantasy game because he could score you can rebound you can get defensive stats he can get threes and his percentages are not a train wreck like almost all of the other guys that we just listed off  what do you do Dan you're talking a lot what do I do what you do is you hold JJJ you hold Vince Williams and you don't do anything with everybody else  that's it  Miami was in full streamer mode and they won which is like the classic you know play up with your guys day no Jimmy Butler know Terry Rozier know Tyler hero no Nicola yovich all for different reasons not not all for a couple of those guys for the same reason suspension Butler and over to back  here oh was a game time called basically so he could be back in the next one which is tonight for Miami  I don't think Rosie's coming back seems like he's probably not quite as close and then you got I think Thomas Bryant who's all I had for a bit longer on this suspension and Josh Richardson is not all that close but what you got here was basically names I just said four five rotation players down for the heat so yeah it was cool to see Haywood Highsmith Jaime Hawk has Junior Delon Wright Kevin Love Caleb Martin Duncan Robinson six guys that are almost definitely on the wrong side of the cut line moved onto the right side of the cut line you're like Dan how does six guys move up when only like four important guys were out and the answer is it's not about how many players it's about how many minutes and how many shots  just like minutes and usage maybe that's the faster way to do it  because you take Butler out of the mix you're taking a 30 some odd minute guy and those minutes get split between different dudes okay you know a few for Dunkin' Robinson if you for Caleb Martin a few for Dylan write a few Forks okay that's fine but it's about who's handling the basketball  when these guys the yesterday crew had the basketball it wasn't too very quickly get it back to Butler or hero  it was now to do something with it  so I guess took 17 shots and Kevin Love took nine shots in 15 minutes and Caleb Martin took 14 shots and I Smith took nine and Dylan's not gonna take shots but five assists you know when he's just out there he's gonna get you a cyst Steals and just do good fantasy stuff  but then the problem of course is that tonight you add back a couple of those guys maybe it's just Butler and yovich tonight maybe the other guys are all still out  but we can't really do anything with this team until we know precisely who's in and who's out  and in my opinion until we know precisely who's starting  because yes hi Smith had a good game off the bench because he had a bunch of three pointers and had four defensive stats that's not a guy that I trust coming off the bench  I don't trust most of these guys coming off the bench well what if Dylan Wright is getting another start tonight boom I'll drop him in  what if Duncan Robinson's getting another start tonight and probably drop him in as well because almost no chance he goes one for 11 again I like the 11th Duncan but you're going to have to hit a shot for me  Caleb Martin and  the reason he had value yesterday is because he got 14 shots and that just doesn't happen when almost any of the usage guys is out there with him  what if Jacquees in the starting five and only Butler comes back yeah I'd probably play him so we got to find out who's back and who's now we got to find out who's in the starting five you know maybe yovich comes back and he's in the starting five I would be very nervous about making that move  there'll be someone on the heat you can stream tonight you can feel pretty confident about that but which one  not a clue  no freaking idea  and you know what's funny is yesterday I got a question on Twitter at someone was like what am I doing with Keegan Murray and I'm like I don't know I feels like a pretty easy hold and he was like it hasn't been that easy he's been bad for a while I'm like well you know what is bad like he dropped from 50 to low like late 60s over that stretch so yeah he'd been slower lately but I was like no look dude he's an easy hole he's the he's a core guy for this king's team and like he's gonna be a bit streaky and then whammo I love when the fates conspire to make me look smart I don't like when they conspire to make me look like an idiot it happens both of them happen yesterday was fun because I said some stuff on Twitter and on the Pod and then the games happening it was like  I talked about Catherine I talked about Murray and I talked about her and his 30 minute attack I've talked about Malik monk being someone that I don't really trust on the Roto side and it all just happened yesterday and I don't always get it was like a clean sweep for Dan's fantasy takes just I just let me enjoy it for a day because most of the time it's gonna be like all right if I can have a decent hit rate I'll take it  a decent hit rate is why you guys get to follow me on a show and listen to me yell into the void but it ain't always that fun yesterday we got him we got him  anywho I basically told you the king's angles there Harrison Barnes didn't get to play very much and frankly shouldn't get to play very much unless he's getting super hot  I'm not really all that clear where his minutes went uh Trey Lyles played a little bit extra but mostly it was like the starters just played a crap load yesterday anyway Keegan Murray was good Darren Fox coming out of a week off  you could say all you want about him getting all star snubbed and it's probably true but damn this dude's got a lot of energy coming off a week break  demonic bonus had a quiet triple-double you know this the way the NBA works these days that's a thing that's like a legitimate thing and you know you deal with them at a bio it's gonna be a little bit of a tougher whole road to hoe Kevin heard it didn't shoot the ball well but again if he plays 30 minutes he belongs on rosters Malik monk is more ahead to head guy then a roto guy in the king's don't change very much day to day you really only watching her and monk that's it the rest of it is a whole lot of nothing and believe it or not  that's the whole damn thing I know it's a short recap I didn't expect everybody to come out and join us for this podcast but I certainly do appreciate those of you that did and hear me got to hear me yell about Kelly Olynyk for the first eight minutes of the episode  people in the chat room were like should I add Kelly did you guys miss the first date freaking minutes of this show  I'm coming to get you all  don't do anything it had to head until you find out if you have a turtle is missing time if it's on the Roto side you can add and then hope that he starts tomorrow but no you're not dropping someone like a Paul Reed for him you're dropping somebody you sucks  GG Jackson someone got throwing in there yeah perfect Vince Williams  nah probably not not today not until you know if you know he's starting then you can get a little aggressive but we don't actually know today right now we're just hoping  on a wing and a prayer  me hopes me thinks  malicious that it shall be Kelly time big big Tuesday coming up tonight this is sort of your maybe overload day I think we did the math on yesterday's weekly preview show that in all likelihood you will be just slightly under overload if you're at 10 start 3 bench league but you'll actually be just slightly over  the overload if you're at 10 start for bench league so 11 games that's like basically the cusp it's almost a dead Heat  it's basically a coin flip that you're going to be overload today  somewhere between 9 and 11 of your 13 players are probably going to be going a lot of angles to watch tonight we're gonna talk about those over on Twitter so if you guys want those come find me over on social media at Dan best briefs I did a Q&A a free one in our Sports ethos Discord yesterday so I hope all of you guys have joined up there as well again we have a free side we also have a premium side and I want to give away some prizes I'm gonna give away some prizes but we're gonna be doing that over on Twitter as well that's at Dan best Bruce d a n b e s b r i s  uh ladies gentlemen that is that I will be spending my early afternoon watching they Dodgers bring training game because it's gonna be mookie show hey and Freddie Freeman I'm yeah I'm a little little Goose up about that in the meantime I hope that I will be able to see you guys over over on Twitter and I don't think I have anything else that I feel like I'm this shows so short I feel like I'm forgetting something but it was just a four game card and this isn't a streaming day so it's not like you guys need assistance on that front I think we can  just kind of wrap it up  all right you know what quickly if you questions from the chat room should I drop Daniel Gafford for Kelly Olynyk not today but if Kelly starting tomorrow then I might give you the okay  uh pool for OG  them  I'm fighting for my playoff spot yeah I mean you can't take an injured guy if you're fighting for your playoff spot  sorry should I drop Paul Reed for a living no I don't think you even do it  I don't think you do it at all in this one because you know you're getting like a month more out of Reed and what is the best case to know like turtles ankles pointing didn't seem that horrible  unless news breaks today that Pearl's Gonna Miss multiple weeks then that would change my tack here so no AJ is AJ Griffin an ad for ESPN points League no I don't believe so not only 12 teams is Gigi Jackson a drop yes can you rank the Brooklyn streamer guys next week for points it's hard to do because I don't know if Camp Thomas is going to be in or out but that would move down his Schroeder up near the top cam Johnson would be up here the top those guys are already on rosters then Dorian Finney Smith would be the next name I'd look at and then there's a pretty steep drop off for Brooklyn after that like you get to the guys that don't play very much so you're looking at like maybe a Lonnie Walker because when he's out there at least he takes a bunch of shots and that may be as far as I'd go  uh should I hold OG or drop hold if you can  how early can we move for Brooklyn streamers yesterday  because I got a four game week this week in a five game week next week you ain't gonna get any better than that  Dan what's going on not much Joey not much  things got a little easier around the best household just for a moment last week I had four straight days of play by play in my wife worked 14 consecutive days at the hospital and this week she's off and I only have one day where I played by play and the kids for the moment are both healthy enough to go to school so  I got an actual work day thanks for asking Joy I appreciate it  fontecchio or Quentin Grimes I would prefer Grimes I think he has a more translatable nine category game even if right now the minutes are going to find heal  odds are neither one of them ends up inside the top 100 but if you're going to take a gamble on someone's is the is the better bet to be top 100 are we still projecting a good ceiling for projects key  no I don't think so I think Chris Paul is going to take at least a chunk of his minutes and that'll be enough to sort of push him outside the startable range but Andrew Wiggins just got ruled out for the Warriors tonight so you probably get at least one more game of pods  and  that way you don't have to worry about it at least for one more day and now we'll wrap it up say I chewed up an extra two and a half minutes oh should I drop Andrew nem hard for Aaron neesmith yes I would do that  and now for the third time this is like the ending of the third Lord of the Rings movies  where there's like five different endings first they go home and then there's the whole like Hobbits bouncing on a giant white bed and then there's the everybody saying bye and then there's crying and it's like  come on this movie's been ending for 25 minutes I get it was a three-part nine-hour epic but  in percent of that to be the ending well that's what you got in today's show 10% of the show was the ending for real this time see you guys over on Twitter later
