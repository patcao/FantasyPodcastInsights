welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast apologies on the slight delay  to get this thing going a tiny bit sooner than I did but we're here  do you really care does anybody really care why I'm  five six minutes late the answer is that I was getting it this is like Beyond first world problem type of moment we use instacart a lot have basically since the pandemic and you know with the second kid it's a lot easier and this Instagram dude was texting me about something called Topo Chico  and I kept saying I have no idea what you're talking about I don't know what you're talking about finally like four messages in I'm like dude are you shopping two orders it's like yeah I'm sorry this is wrong one  son I looked it up I guess it's like carbonated water basically  I didn't ask for carbonated water I drink my water out of the tap like my Pappy used to do it's happy before him  Topo Chico  the hell do I need carbonated water for  what am I what some kind of fancy boy  I'm not fancy  I actually drink I actually like tap water I have no problem with it if I want it cold I will put it in the refrigerator  I don't need bottled water and it's not because I'm some environmentalist I just think it's  unnecessary  whatever you guys have been following me for a long time so you already know them weird so this should come as absolutely no surprise to you that I'm even one clicker than you realize welcome to another week week 19 fantasy basketball  playoffs start  next week for a lot of folks  if your playoffs start this week I apologize I don't think we're gonna get into a lot of that

do that's all available over at sports.com  let's dive in shall we let me make sure I'm getting the the graphics all the way that I want them there we go we will go through Sunday and then Saturday and then there are three teams I actually bothered to look it up before I went on air today that didn't play Saturday or Sunday so we'll hit those from Friday as well and let's just start kind of moving our way through the stuff here the Milwaukee Bucks took down the the sort of semi zombie 6ers what do you can't really call him the zombie Sixers because Joel and beat is going to be out for a while this is just who they are now  uh  so what do we got well Malik Beasley continues to be a pretty reasonable fill-in for Chris Middleton as long as he remains out  not that he's like starting for him but he's getting some of his shots and Beasley's running hot right now which is all so relevant no I'm not picking up Bobby Porter's after one good ball game moving on we're gonna try to go pretty quickly on this stuff too I think people appreciate it when we hustle until you get to something that actually requires a bunch of additional attention  and there's a little bit of that with the Sixers  mostly the back court and I think there's actually some disagreement in the fantasy community on this I you guys know me I tend to be very high on D Anthony Melton and this is the kind of ball game that makes me stay that way he only played 18 and a half minutes as he's working back from a stress fracture in his back which is big deal 16 points three boards three assists two steals four three-pointers in 18 and a half minutes  he was awesome  I mean that's a  like that's a top 70 or better fantasy line in 18 and a half minutes and it's always been the case for Melton that he could put up fantasy numbers in low minutes the issue has generally been is he playing alongside extremely high usage dudes and the answer right now finally after a very long time of it the answer being yes the answer right now is no just Tyrese Maxey really because I mean what what are we gonna say Tobias Harris is a high usage guy he's not  he's a usage guy who is sort of a usage guy button actually had the highest on the team he went out there and he was just firing away having a grand old time  so uh  yes there are more backcourt bodies on this team right now they've added buddy hield they added Kyle Lowry  but the thing is melting is better than these guys yes he's better than both of those dudes I know buddy yield is a nice outside shooter but Melton's just a better all around fantasy or basketball player and so in my eyes I trust that Nick nurse is going to see that  it's not always the best idea to put your trust in a coach to see the thing that is like right there out on the page in front of them but  I trust in nurse and I think that is melting he's on a minute's limit right now so don't worry about the the time he'll be when he was a 16 minutes 15 16 minutes in the first game now 18 you'll probably be at 20 or so in the next one you know Philly has a back-to-back he'll probably get that off Blended in there and they do next week this week they have only a three game we're still probably play in all of those and you know I'm always looking at things more on the Roto side I get it if you're streaming he has a very bad schedule over the next four days just one game but I think by you know middle of next week Melton's gonna be collaborating people so I'm big into DeAnthony Melton I think you can keep playing Maxi obviously Harris Paul Reed is a yes buddy hield he's a hold and then Kelly oubre is the one that I'm a little bit worried about  but as long as he's still chucking in his time on the floor then I won't be too worried about it so hold all of those guys for now what kind of see how things shake out but definitely add the Anthony Melton that's one of my key names for the foreseeable future is melting and I don't know if I'm beat ever shows back up again this year and if he does we can reassess at that point but for now I think Milton 100%  in my eyes belongs on rosters because like  how many times can you go out to the waiver wire and find somebody that if he gets the minutes and we don't know like maybe he caps out at it like 24 with all these new guards in the mix  if that's the case then you're looking at a guy who is going to be struggling to hit Top 100 but dude was you know top 75 this year before he got hurt and that was with embed around  28 minutes mind you but 10 shots  he could get 10 shots in less than 28 minutes with out joy to meet out there as we saw in his ball game yesterday that's one of the names that I wanted to pause on a little bit Lakers and Sons not a whole lot to take away from the Lakers hachimura is as that sort of last starting spot right now but his Fantasy game is not robust enough to consider him an ad on the Phoenix side know Eric Gordon who was going to be like likely filling in for Bradley Beal so you were Now sort of two  rotation guys down  and that meant that Royce O'Neill was sort of unfettered  there were no feathers upon him nothing could hold Royce back he played 37 minutes at sick 3-pointers he was unquestionably the best player on the floor for the Phoenix Suns yesterday which is crazy thing to say but you know these guys are all very good at basketball and at some point they'll pop off and the Lakers were like look we have to figure out a way to slow down to Booker and we're gonna live with it if Grace and Allen Roy and he'll beat us  and they did let's do guys combined for 12-3 pointers  44 points on 29 shots between the two of them  if Bill and Gordon are still off for the next ball game then you play Roy Sony  barely straightforward call there got some questions about bull bully played 24 minutes you know again this team is extremely short-handed right now this is probably a best case scenario for Bowl unless Yusuf nurkic goes down I guess if Drew Eubanks went down you might get a little bit more Bowl he has jumped over you banks in the pecking order  but this is sort of like  as good as it's gonna get  I don't think he needs to be added in 12 teams you can put them on your watch list someone's gonna pick them up and then they'll drop him a day or a game or two later I think you can just watch for now plus I do believe that as this team gets a little bit healthier you'll see them run smaller more often and that hurts well anybody who's not  above average at basketball which is like everybody on this team they're very very thin  Club  they really only have like seven guys they're willing to play and two of those guys are hurt right now so bold gets bonus  Dallas this is troubling Derek Lively played 14 and a half minutes it's David Lee 19 and a half minutes and Maxi kleber played 24 and a half minutes which I get it that goes over 48 so that was  some minutes were logged not at Center for at least one of those guys but it is extremely troubling that all three of them are playing less than rotational minutes and so you now you've got this  unpleasantness  and it sort of weird like I think Jason Kidd is trying to figure out what combos work at the moment because Lively was a plus nine in his 14 and a half minutes and Cleburne and Gafford were combined minus 32 in theirs and I get it you can't draw that many conclusions from plus minus but it does seem a little bit like  you might get a you know who's whose matching up better on a given night kind of thing I'm still holding gaffer I think you can drop Lively I think you can I not that you ever picked up but you could obviously not you can let go of him and the reason I'm holding gap for is that he only needs about 22 23 minutes to actually be a fantasy asset like he wasn't that far off here in 1985 with a block you give him another three or four minutes out there you've got 10 and 6 with a block and a half or whatever it is 10 and 6 and a half like at least at that point he's startable if barely and then anything over that is gravy if Lively gets hurt again if Cleveland gets hurt again all that stuff could kind of break in your favor so I'm not dropping Gafford yet but this is messy and if you're thinking about picking up Josh Green just know that this is a dude who's running hot right now and  I keep I got it like  I have to be better about saying it's okay to play players when they're hot but I just know like we know enough to know that this is not a thing that's going to just magically be okay the rest of the year  he's usage numbers are not all that high he's been on kind of like a pretty good steals run also which is a little bit unusual shooting the ball well he's not going to the free throw line which is good for him  the three-pointers have been better  all that to say I don't think you need to take the Josh Greene if you were thinking about it  feels unnecessary  I don't yeah let's keep going Indiana Benedict mathura is filling in for Aaron Nesmith right now and there's actually kind of been okay  I would argue better than I expected in this role and you know he's not shooting well which is actually kind of promising given the other stuff he has four steals 10 assists 17 rebounds in his last two ball game and it's mostly just because the minutes are there you just played 68 minutes in those two games now in Smith comes back Matthew and you don't even have to give him a second thought uh but right now like that many minutes he's probably short-term streamable I mean like heaven forbid actually has a better shooting game here let's say he has a better shooting game tonight against Toronto he's still taking 12 13 14 shots which we said 14 exactly in the two most recent Nesmith filling games  I don't know the assistant stay that high it's actually rebounder he's not that terrible so that's not you know not 11 but somewhere between  5 and 10 is not insane give it six and a half seven rebounds possibly in 33 304 minutes because Myles Turner's not that great of a rebounder and see I am not an overwhelmingly great rebounder so there is a little bit left over there for math Aaron  I think you could probably play him tonight you know that's not like spending a bunch of roster moves on stuff and you know Roto games it's a little easier because you could just pick up a guy and then drop in two days later if you needed to but for a player that I said I don't want anything to do with he's in an okay spot right now and so I'm kind of okay if you really wanted to playing math and in the very short term Andrew Hart playing decent minutes but his Fantasy game 10's not to translate all that well he typically is like mostly like medium assists and not a whole lot else shooting seven for eight yesterday was helpful but I don't I don't trust him for nine cat  Cleveland over Washington not much on the calf side I don't care it's Levert out a better ball game but I don't care we know what's gonna happen with him in nine cat and then Max Drew who's the founding member of the doesn't matter Club had to good ball games so he was due for a stinker  by the way I think that doesn't matter Club should sort of be named after like late stage late career Danny Green where I was like look if you just look back at the end of the month it's going to be like a 100 to 120 range month and that's basically what it's true she's gonna be he'll be about 120 over a month some of the time it'll be good some of the time it'll be bad  doesn't really matter if you want to fill in the end of your head to head bench that works  I don't think I'd use him against the games cap these doesn't matter guys probably don't belong in a lineup against the game's cap but  you get it hey let's pause on Jordan Poole for a second here because Jordan Poole got benched because seemingly coaches like look I want the ball in your hands more when you're on the floor  and he's actually responded well benched Jordan Poole has taken 57 shots in three games since moving to the bench  he's taken 17 free throws so you're finally getting the positive impact free-throw number from him like he's actually getting to the line  he could not throw a stone in the ocean right now he's shooting 38 some odd percent I think over this last week that's despite a good ball game yesterday  the rebounds in his sister never gonna be all that high for him but he did have five assists and yesterday's ballgame  and basically what we're looking at here with pool is  he's finally taking the usage that folks were hoping he would have to start to see the season  now  the big issue of course is going to be field goal percentage is it going to be 38% on high volume or is it going to be 401 which doesn't feel like that big of a difference but it's actually an enormous difference when you're talking about how much of a drag that number is because he's not taking a whole bunch of shots you know 57 shots if you want to go a couple of percentage points you're actually talking about made bucket to made buckets that kind of thing so like that's substantial when as opposed to like he was taking seven shots a game the difference between 39 percent and 41% is nothing it's meaningless  but on volume it matters  so it to that and I don't really know we can't know if he's gonna run out he's gonna run cold is going to be somewhere in between  the best we can do is just assume  that he's gonna land somewhere near where he was  maybe before he hit the bench which is like 40 and a half to 401% and then if he gets back to Golden State 43 not if I don't think he's getting anywhere near 45 that was sort of like the good shooting year for pool but if he get back to 4243 percent now you're actually cooking with something so  we're getting there in a way that I didn't expect I should probably say that but you may remember that I said I thought Jordan Poole was an interesting posted deadlines stash because I thought the Wizards would trade someone tyus Jones Kyle kuzma something like that it might open up the usage for him it seems like the usage is going to get opened up for pool just in a different way  so this is like  finding the Uncharted road to get to this point so if pool got dropped I think he's a mustad player right now he's not gonna be particularly available  in  no it's funny he'll be more available in expert leaks than he will in novice  because he was so awful that expert leaks there's like no way anybody was going to play him all season long while he was tanking your team but not least there were like oh but these scoring 16 points I got to hold on to this dude so he was actually a little bit more available in  leaks that have  well I guess it's like minimal IL slots because then teams are gonna want to like  dump the guys that stinks so that they can get afford to take a 0 on somebody that doesn't  he was more likely to get dropped in expert leagues because experts were aware of how bad he was but anyway point is just go check  check to see if he's out there  later Shaman had a nice ball game I'll put him on a watch list I don't think that we need to jump it right now because he's sort of come out of nowhere here to play 37 minutes there was no Denny Avia for the Wizards yesterday who had slid into the starting lineup for Jordan Poole got hurt they think it's a pelvic contusion yeah that's the final rule yesterday so then when avda went out they needed to bring another guy in Off the Bench to start that was sham it  presumably audio won't be out for too long so sham it likely won't be interesting for too long but if coolie now is hurt then maybe sham it just slides over and starts for him so there's sort of a couple ways that we could get to this point  with Sham it who's you know fringy at best and then Marvin Bagley has not done what we were hoping for I wanted to make sure we hold on to him just for a little bit to kind of find out what is role was gonna be and we're seeing that  you know as a starter here  in this sort of post Gafford era it's been a mixed bag yet a 15 and 14 game in the middle of all of this  he had  what did he played like 15 minutes and 28 and 30 and the rebounds have been fine and the blocks have been okay but the problem for me with Bagley and I'll call him sort of a soft hold right now is that the free throws are bad we knew that was going to be the case  and the Steals and blocks are actually like kind of okay right now and I'm a little worried of what it's gonna look like if those taper off at all because uh basically since he gained the starting role he's at five Steals and seven blocks over I guess that's six ball games and I just I honestly I don't know if those are going to hold and if they don't he falls out to the top 100 because he's like teetering right on the borderline right now and I get it everybody wants to 10 rebounds so you know it's not the end of the world there like if you want to hang on and take the rebounds that's okay  I just I don't think he's going any higher than that until someone else gets out of the way now if they shut down a high you use guy I have pool or Coombs more however  gives up their shots and Bagley can get more than 10 shots ball game if he gets up into that like 13 14 shots range and that's what you saw in their loss to the Pelicans right before the All-Star break he had 14 points he's at a 15 point game in there  that's a big difference from 11 and you guys know I'm not a guy who cares that much about points but that's significant add an extra three four points to his number now you got a double-double you can actually kind of write home about it's just basically 10 and 10  so badly this soft hold he is a hold soft though it may be but anyway that's where I'm standing on that one nothing on Denver don't care about them at all everything is the same for the Warriors Andrew Wiggins as a whole Klay Thompson who I was starting to get real nervous about he had a better ball game here he remains kind of a soft hole as well Brandon podemski is also a soft hold I'm worried about what Chris Paul might do to him but maybe I should be worried about what Paul might do to Klay Thompson all so  I don't think I am because slays like literally the only guy on the team besides Steph that can actually hit a three-point or sometimes or he's a no space in it all on their roster bug flew into my vision there if you're wondering what I'm looking at hope you guys sold high on Johnathan comingo all the stuff that we were worried about is sort of come out now you're holding there's that bug holding dream on green all so he's a low end sort of Punt points kind of Center guy but  this is an ugly game overall for the Warriors and I think that's why  what's going on with my headphone today I think it's getting caught was getting caught on this strap here or do I have them in backwards no it's not in backwards I don't know why it's doing something weird today anywho so Warriors a lot of soft holds right now until Chris Paul comes back and then we'll see what everything means  Orlando black  Jonathan Isaac's knee buckled he may not play again until 2029 we'll see what happens there  we were kind of paying attention to see if he could get 20 minutes but you know what happens when he plays a few extra minutes he plays two and then the whole thing comes apart I do believe this is part of a back-to-back and maybe they're feeling bad about doing that now I don't know either way  Franz Wagner is literally the only nine cat player on the magic who are without by the way without Pablo for the first game all season long it didn't really change much meant some more for Wendell Carter Junior a little bit more for Jane Lin Suggs a little bit more for Cole Anthony who played 30 minutes off the bench but I would expect Powell back and so I wouldn't read too much into it the big news over the weekend that we kind of buried in the mix here is that Trey young had surgery on his hand and he's expected to miss at least four weeks reevaluated at four weeks so not even gonna be back at that point if the Hawks are still kind of fighting at the edge of that play in Bubble you'll see him come back and play Trey has been extremely durable in his career he'll try to get back in there but in the meantime this now gives you sort of a firmer hold on a guy like saddiq Bey who I thought could fade as DeAndre Hunter got better Hunter now is an ad he was sort of a speculative add before he was a guy I talked about as a trade deadline stash all so Jalen Johnson is going to go crazy Deontay Murray's gonna go crazy crazy bogged on bug zdanowicz is gonna go crazy Hunters gonna be okay bae's gonna be okay click Appel is on a minute's cap right now your trade deadlines probably passed but if it hasn't you should try to see if you could get Clint capela because on Yahoo was out for at least two weeks technically indefinitely and so if capella gets his minutes up before then he could go on a little bit of a push here and then those guys will go back to splitting things a little bit I got a bunch of questions about Kobe buffkin I don't specifically know why he's nowhere near 12 team so you don't have to worry about that if you're in a super deeply you could keep an eye  on him but that's about as far as I go there  Oklahoma City everybody then is tell like I always bring that up in the people were like this is why I asked Mike that's fine if you guys can tell me I either way is fine I just look at what people are tweeting at me and then I'm like I don't understand this but I guess I'll talk about it on the pod that's why you guys should listen to the pot  Thunder they have no fantasy notes of any kind ever they have three players on their team you're starting every day and that's it check Shay  Jalen Williams  how about the Rockets though uh Freddie Van Vleet is kind of settled back in now that's nice Shang goon Jabari Smith Jr these guys are pretty obvious calls Dillon Brooks is droppable with Freddy back because he's not forced to take 19 shots anymore I'm in Thompson is the one that we're all watching he's a hold right now it's a bit lower in this ball game again he was having a fishy issues shot two of ten from the field missed his free throws  but he's an amazing rebounder for a guard defensively you're seeing it like nightly blocks and steals  and that's just in my opinion that's not a guy you can kick back to the waiver wire not when the ceiling is that high  and he's been sort of regularly stealing a few minutes from jail in green who played a little bit more in this ball game so it's not gonna be every night but like there'll be games where greens plays 25 minutes and Thompson also gets up to 25 and in those I'm in Mike just damn do enough to be a fantasy start so I would hold on to Thompson kind of see how this thing goes  again he's another player that I wanted to pause on just for a moment because I felt like there was kind of more there but yes firm hold on Thompson  Chicago start the starters Pelicans right now start the starters they're down CJ McCollum I guess they were start the starters when he was back all so it's just a different last starter CJ's out so Trey Murphy is in and right now Zion tray herb JV Ingram those are the Five Guys you can start when McCollum comes back he'll punch train Murphy back to the bench and I think at that point you probably then all so punch Trey Murphy but for now I like what they can do when he starting those extra minutes or good for his rebounds good for his defensive stats and that covers the fact that like this ball game he shot the ball very poorly  he'll have good shooting games where he won't need that other stuff  but the extra minutes as a starter means he'll get that other stuff and that means now the floor is 100 and the ceiling is more like 50 when he's coming off the bench and his minutes are you know seven to 10 minutes lower  you start to look at sealing of 80 and floor of like one 60 it's a pretty good chunk move for him so Trey Murphy injury filling right now  Utah blew out the Spurs not for lack of weapon llamas trying Victor's last stretch here is  mind-boggling he's up to number nine in nine cat now he passed Kevin frickin Durant  how I'll tell you how he's blocking shots at a rate that I just can't even remember he's number two over the last week listen to these averages for women over his last three ball games 22.7 points 1.73 11 rebounds 4.7 assists  3.7 Steals and five blocks  yeah  that's ridiculous  over his last three games he has 11 Steals and 15 blocked shots  and even though he's been a pretty big negative in field goal percent they who cares  what's really amazing is that Nicola yokich is actually been better a more valuable nine cat player over that same stretch you could just on one of his ridiculous surges right now but oh my God Wendy  I had the distinct privilege of playing against him in one of my three had to head legs and I mean I thought I had that week completely wrapped up in both steals and blocks and we switched it for both basically it's crazy hold on to Trey Jones hold on to Devon bustle obviously those are the three guys I hope you guys sold high on Jeremy Sohan when I mention that a while back we can keep going  for the Utah Jazz taeler Hendrix I call a speculative add towards the end of last week I think that's the best we can say he fouled out in 26 minutes here so would he have played  two minutes more maybe would that have made any difference in his fantasy line nine and three with a block in a steel or a block at a three ball  I mean okay  keep an eye on it obviously but I don't know that anything really is guaranteed Walker Kessler is now settled back into his 18 to 20 minute range which is annoying but it is top 100 so hold on to Kessler and then keonte George who I mentioned I thought he's a sell High when he has a couple good shooting games in a row like he did going into the All-Star break now you've seen the cool off the bottom can fall out hard on these young guys keonte is both a hold  and a cell when you can those two things can be true at the same time  maybe Jordan Clarkson's heating up again if he's about to go on a heater that's also a sell High opportunity  marketing John Collins Collins Sexton  and then Walker Kessler those the four safe ones for the Jazz in nine cat and then George is sort of like the oh get him on the right week kind of play but he is still a hold and I feel somewhat similarly about Trey man although the more I look at them I think man has a little bit of a higher floor then keonte because the defensive stats and the rebounds tended to be better  although here Trey man played 24 and a half minutes had six points two boards and three assists the three steals kind of floated his value for this ball game Charlotte won again which is crazy they've completely ruined their chance at getting you know Bob or our ruining their record their chance of getting a bottom three record in the league they're now are they better than the Blazers know half game they beat Portland to move would in a half game of having a better record Charlotte stop it  stop it Charlotte screwing up a whole season of being awful it was funny too they asked their coach Steve Clifford what's different  and  he said guys are trying now which is a big indictment of the dudes that were there before  but you could get it like  that's veterans who were just like I'm gonna put up my numbers  now they got guys playing defense  Cody Martin had a big ball game you're not picking him up not from one big ball game but Celia meets each had a nice ball game you're all not picking him up either Nick Richards again low end Center stream he had a big ball game here so that was nice but overall we kind of know what his floor ceiling is after like three months of filming in for Mark Williams  Brandon Miller miles Bridges those guys are obvious starts a train man again similar to George he is both a hold and start and a cell wall hot  we knew the rebounds working to stick it like seven ball game he's just not big enough to put up those kind of numbers he's not that tall he's tall for a point guard but he's not that tall and he's not thick at all so  like the guy the guards that get a lot of rebounds tend to be either very tall or very strong and he's not really either of those so we sort a new that number was gonna come down uh what is everything else going to be again we don't exactly know because he's never really had an opportunity like this before  could he be top 109 cat yes but when he has one of those big ball games and someone's like oh this guy could be like top 40 that's when you need to jump in and be like I'll give you this dude and all you got to do is give me back at top 70 guy and you'll basically be happy you did  unless you're punting feel goal percent in which case obviously takes a pretty good size step forward  for Portland uh Anthony Simons had a bad shooting game but you know not gonna worry too much about that Jeremy Grant similar story as long as those guys are healthy you play them  Chris Murray got the shooting guard minutes with the know Malcolm Brogden no School Henderson no shade and sharp or is plenty of guys that are out for Portland right now  dominating finally deciding to wake up here he got off to a really good start to see him remember and and disappeared for a while but in top 20 over the last couple of weeks where is he for the full season now  52 that's like almost right where he was drafted  congratulations DeAndre Aiden of being basically right on your ADP missed a bunch of ball games so by totals not so much but again like those are only those are really the only guys you can play I don't think you can play Kris Murray  you certainly many times did you guys have to ask me about Jabari Walker before finally taking my word that it's not he needs multiple guys out of the way and you know at some point school will come back and he's gonna be asked to carry a big usage load when the team goes into full shutdown but they're not there yet  does Brogden play again I don't know maybe  whatever Sacramento keeps streaming Malik monk he's a he's a Bonafide stream well warm guy Kevin her is a stream when he gets minute Sky which is starting to tip back the other way mostly because Harrison Barnes was playing better but the Malik monk heater is also contributing and it's almost like he and her kind of trade off Monk and hurt her  which guy actually gets to do enough consistently so maybe you just trade off who you have on your roster herder was okay enough in this game to sort of float holding on for another one or two days but I need to see that minute count get back up to 30 if I'm actually gonna recommend holding on to him long term  not surprisingly by the way Darren Fox better out of the All-Star break he starts fast and then tires  we've seen this a couple times now  you might be a guy who benefits from just taking like a game off every once in a while what Sacramento's record right now  33 and 23 they're the five seed tied with the Suns and the Pelicans I guess they can't give him any days off my bad keep them going Clippers I don't know what the hell happened to the Clippers in this ball game they just couldn't shoot the ball from outside know Paul George Norman Powell filling in he filled in for Kawaii before he filled in for PG and this one and you know if you need points that's the direction you go otherwise no I'm not picking up Terence man we've seen this enough times to know he has two or three games like this and then basically goes back to being non-existent  before we turn the clock back and cover the game from Saturday this is a great opportunity for me to remind you guys to find me over on

or Lando we already talked about Detroit is interesting right now and another team I want to kind of pause on obviously you've got Duran and you've got Cunningham those are your safe nine cat guys I'm going to hold Oscar Thompson  but I need to add a couple of little tweaks on this and you guys know how I feel about Jaden Ivey I think he's a points League guy I don't think he's a nine cat guy at least not yet percentages and turnovers hurt too much  Thompson  a little bit of a mixed bag but he's a hold  then you got Simone fontecchio who I honestly I think his game translates just better to points formats because he doesn't have that well right he had a better well-rounded game here but by and large is that said is not particularly well rounded mostly threes and scouring every once in a while he'll grab a steal but Quentin Grimes is the other name on wanted to mention he made his Pistons debut played 26 and a half minutes which is a surprisingly large number  only five points two boards four assists two steals a block in a three-pointer  from the end of last season with the Knicks that's the whole like oh maybe we get this iteration  but  I can't imagine a universe where he's usage is lower that it was in New York  so eight shots in 26 and a half minutes I mean that's kind of an ah you took eight and a half shots in 30 minutes a game for the next last year and that was by the by the way that was a number that was pulled up by him taking you know double digit shots nightly at the end of last year but I could see a Universe where you know let's say Grimes gets up to 27 28 minutes with this Pistons team Monty Williams has been known to do all sorts of crazy stuff if he starts to play close to starter's minutes you could obviously see him get up to you know something like 11 shots a game  and then the question becomes is that enough  I don't think there's anything that's going on with Grimes right now that's enough to say add but I do think there's enough to say watch  he's a watch list guy for sure  Boston nothing start the starters and then Horford if any of the starters is out Nicks we can do this one pretty quick I say hartenstein back up to 24 minutes that came on Saturday that's a good sign that means we can get him back loaded into lineups thank goodness cuz him coming out and playing like nine minutes without much of a warning was a huge bummer  Josh Hart Dante even chenzo pressure to a Jalen Brunson you're starting to starters for the next and as expected boy on bug zdanowicz didn't get to do much Alec Burks didn't get to do much the next likes having a little bit of Firepower Off the Bench but at this point start the starters  and then as a starter comes back let's say Annabelle comes back before Randall he probably bumps a chewa maybe heart and whichever guy he bumps I probably don't start at least for one ball game maybe two and then of course OG might take a game or two to ramp up so maybe that's not the fairest way to assess it but you're gonna see these guys taper off you're gonna see precious taper off as guys come back you're gonna see heart taper off will even chenzo stay above the cut line hard to say you might see all three of those guys taper off but for now  play them  easy call  Ben Simmons heard again  Ben Simmons Jonathan Isaac not sure who is more obnoxious to roster and fantasy I've said  probably 20 times on the podcast now I want nothing to do with the Ben Simmons experience this year  so I don't know why I need to keep bringing him up I do it because there might be one new person watching the show every day or listening to the show and so I want them to know I want nothing to do with Ben Simmons  I think we can also punt on Dennis Schroder even if Simmons is a game or two you know his assist will be better if that's the case but I just don't think Shooters Fantasy game is gonna translate enough not without really a lot of usage that just with or without Simmons I don't think it's coming Dennis's way uh cam Johnson I'm gonna give I on our last show I think on Friday or maybe Thursday I said I'm going to give him  one week to convince me to hold and his minutes have been very slowly trending up coming back from injury we don't know what Kevin Ollie wants him to do I like that he was pretty involved offensively in the minutes he was on the court in this ball game but there weren't enough of them  if he can get his minutes back up into the mid-20s that would buy some time for a hold but if you really is going to stick between 18 and 23 then we'll ultimately move on from cam Johnson but give him let's give him another two or three ballgames and and then we'll get a sort of finalists assessment there  watch list Dorian Finney Smith I don't know that he's gonna do enough nightly remember that last year we had like this Dorian Finney Smith quest for top 95 I mean that's sort of like your best ending point for DFS so I don't think you need to take that big plunge but let's say Ben Simmons goes down for a while  Dorian probably picks up some of those minutes  what I'd like to see is Brooklyn just flip the script and play a bunch of dudes that weren't playing before but they don't have their pick they're only three and a half games out of a play in spot currently occupied by Hawks team that just lost Trey young so by and large you know most likely Brooklyn's gonna keep fighting Better or Worse that's probably what's gonna happen a Timberwolves were without Rudy gobert on Saturday so slow-mo got the start and was slow mo gets the start slow mo goes into our lineups but I would expect go bare back very soon and so this is not a thing that I'm racing to do unless we get word that go Bears going to miss another ball game  and we won't know until tomorrow they're off tonight so I don't know let's look at Friday there were three teams that did not play over the weekend if you guys can remember who they are congratulations we talked about it a lot last week because I wanted you guys to avoid these teams that had one game on the  back half the backup end of the All-Star break  Memphis Miami  and then another team that actually had two games but then went off over the weekend this is the one that I that caught me by surprise when I was going through and getting myself prepped  Toronto  Miami you just waiting to see what's up that bunch of guys suspended so you're probably gonna get a stream Blended in there someone like a Caleb Martin maybe Duncan Robinson maybe we'll see who jumps into the starting five for Jimmy Butler that's probably the guy you'd look at they had a little kerfuffle yes fussels were cured  Memphis I think is probably the one I want to talk about last Toronto  Gary Trent Jr keeps sitting like right on the borderline of someone that I'm willing to hold on to he had 134 and 4 shot the ball poorly but you know the 14 shots is hard to ignore  RJ Barrett was out for that ball game that helped so Trent probably is gonna end up a drop every time I'm like yeah go ahead and drop that he has a better ball game he probably fits into the max truce branded doesn't matter Club  and then as much as I love Kelly Olynyk his fantasy stats said is one of my favorite on the planet  I don't think he can get to 25 minutes and less the Raptors shut down Yakima portal which doesn't feel like it's all that close because we're still end of February right now you know maybe a month from now that happens but again like at that point you're talking very into the season a lot of League's will be over  five six good games out of a clinic at that point is it going to be worth it I mean again the nice thing about a Lin is that even in 20 minutes a ball game he's putting up playable fantasy numbers so it wouldn't kill you to hang on he's top 115 in 17 minutes a game with the Raptors on 94 and 2 with a steel half a block and great percentages  but you want more you know you're hunting more with that last roster spot and there's just sort of no room to go up as until unless or until they play a Linux and portal at the same time and so far they've seen rocovich is being has seemed somewhat reticent to do so  oh well and then Memphis I mean this is like the zombie Grizzlies are complicated mix  John conchar is out dealing with some thumbs soreness we've heard that Bane and smarter trying to get back by like the end of March so that's way off  Santi aldama as we talked about on a silly season stash show he's a guy will probably deploy when they shut down Jaren Jackson who is that going to be I mean we think it's going to be a 65 game thing and then JJ's done he's at 52 right now so unfortunately we still have a ways to go on that 13 games is a solid I mean hell I can tell you how long it's going to take Memphis to play another 13 games let's see what are they got they got four this week for next week three of the week after that I gets you to 11 and then three the week after that so perhaps by March 20th JJJ will have the 65 threshold and then maybe he'll consider shutting it down so how badly do I want to hold on to Santi aldama that whole time the answer is not badly enough  I thought he was gonna get to do more I'll be honest I thought Alamo was gonna get full starters minutes and he would get 12 13 shots but it hasn't happened 24 minutes eight shots and ain't enough I'm willing to say that I was wrong on how much I thought he was gonna play and now he feels like more of a Jaron Jackson beneficiary like the only starter for the Grizzlies that exists right now is the one that's blocking Alma but he's there so  we got a mind it  so JJ and Vince Williams are basically the only Grizzlies that you can rely play on a night tonight basis they did sign Jordan Goodwin to a a two-way deal so that expands how many games he's eligible to play he's a guy I'd keep an eye on I like Goodwin is Fantasy game is interesting but again he's not a guy you're picking up before you actually see it happen and you know Zaire Williams has had like a good game every two or three and Gigi Jackson has one good game every three or four and Luke Kennard has a good game everyone or three and he sits back to backs and contracts been sitting back-to-backs and he's been okay like one out of every three and that ain't enough  Lamar Stevens actually has a pretty good fantasy game too but he hasn't played enough he isn't playing enough minutes either  the only guys on this team reliably playing enough minutes right now our Jaren Jackson Jr and Vince Williams Junior that's it  but we'll keep tracking it because maybe they go harder into the sillies or softer I don't know what what  nomenclature makes more sense software or harder into the Silly Season  neither one of them  either way  all right here's what we're gonna do we're gonna fire up another show basically right after we go off air with this one and we're gonna break down the week ahead so come join me over on that one
