welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  all right so I've been thinking about this particular show idea for a while and I never could quite figure out when I wanted to do it apologies click the button I didn't mean to their  so I figured today why the hell not you got the MLK Game Day game going all day long there's a bunch of them happening as we speak right now I think four games are still in progress  six more coming up in the evening and the nice thing about this show is that it's not really dated  sure you know trade valuations can change a little bit day-to-day but for the most part  what we do on this show will remain  mostly accurate for the foreseeable future  so let's break down what we're actually going to be doing today first of all hi I'm Dan best purse this is fantasy NBA today a sports ethos presentation specialty show it's something I've been kicking around and the old laboratory for some time and it's a trade Raider show where basically you guys submit them  and I grade them live on air  I prefered I've prepared zero content that is on my own this is all going to be me you know flashing through player rank pages and formats and all that good stuff and telling you whether or not whatever you're doing makes sense or doesn't make sense  this is not about real life trades this is about fantasy trades meaning the people that are going to enjoy this the most are probably going to be the ones that are enjoying it live or close to life  I'll be looking at the trades in the chat room which can either come from Twitter or from YouTube and I'm going to be looking at them chronologically  so if you're here early post your trades early  if it's obscenely complicated I might jump over one but I'm gonna try to do them  in order as we go  and we'll see if this works as a show format if it crashes and burns  nose dives into the middle of the ocean well at least we tried  and if it's lovely and everybody has a wonderful time then we'll do it again in a couple of weeks there's your that's the stakes for this one  for those of you that are watching this over on the social side because I'm trying to do more simulcasting these days but days plays make sure take a second to follow at Dan Vespers it's de and Bes b r i s no matter where you're taking in the show please do spend two seconds of your time to like or subscribe or both because that ends up going along way shout out by the way to everybody that has subscribed to our YouTube channel which is over 5,000 for the first time in sports ethos history  and you know I feel a little bit dumb  because if I had actually invested my time in resources into YouTube five six years ago it would be a much much bigger Juggernaut on that side but I just kept putting it off like now  I can just do pods I can just do pods I can just do traditional shows audio that's where I'm comfortable  I was obviously wrong because about a year ago 13 months or so he started finally putting some time in resources into the YouTube side and the growth has been crazy I think it's up from like 2000 to 5000 in a year and it tends to be kind of a snowballing process the more people the more subs you have the more people see your stuff the more it drops into algorithms the more likes and subscriptions you get and it's sort of this big rolling ball thing so obviously I should have done this a long time ago but I'm an idiot and I waited and so now I need all of your help so again please do like rate subscribe  um we got some trades in the chat room already there's like 10 15 of you that popped him in there before the show started so we're gonna just start at the top and I hope that others of you that are watching with us here do take a moment to throw your trades in there as well because if we only get 10 or 15 trades well then the show is not going to take nearly as long as I wanted and maybe that'll be  sort of a not so subtle jab to me that's saying you need to either post this weight early so people can preload the chat room  or maybe it's just not a good idea one of the two either way we're gonna figure it out here on the Fly let's do trade number one Andy says I traded Kristofferson for Jimmy Butler in nine cat head-to-head I actually like the poor Singas side on this one you guys know I think Jimmy Butler's a bylaw I I'm sticking by that he's number 47 and 9 caddies actually moved up per game rankings while he's been hurt because guys that were in front of him that kind of probably didn't belong in front of him how Fallen back trying to think of a few of the guys where that's actually happened to them I think who are the guys that fell back Devin was sells falling back a little bit miles Bridges has fallen back a little bit bam out of Bio was kind of a weird didn't a little bit of a surprise to see him fall back  Tyler Hero has fallen back poked on but zdanowicz so like guys are slowly falling back not much  but for Butler it's all about the steals right now he's at 21 points five boards four and a half assist yeah the assists are a little bit lower than you'd want but the Steels are only at one and that's a number that with Jimmy you generally are hoping is closer to two  thing is and I know the first thought is but Dan you would have had a draft Butler ahead of poor Singas at the beginning of the year yes  but a lot of that was a draft Theory kind of thing meaning I like to both going into draft season but Jimmy Butler is one you were going to have to take sooner because he wouldn't be back around to you the next Loop through in a way that poor thing is likely would be even if at the end of it all like I still I still thought that Butler would probably outperforming us on a per game basis that may or may not happen still the rest the way they're not separated by all that much like 20 slots right now um but porzingis was going later in drafts so that's why you could take him later  traps are not always about drafting guys in the order that you think they're gonna finish it's about drafting guys in order that allows you to get as many of your targets as humanly possible  but as it stands right now of course I guess is healthy Butler is not  how that goes the rest of the season we don't totally know for sure but I think we have a pretty good idea of what porzingis is this year which is somewhere between 20 and 30 on a per game side  Butler I think probably does get back up into that range but when does he come back from his injury could it be later tonight maybe  I'm just now willing to take that chance and there's also the chance that is deals don't come back it's just a weird year where Jimmy doesn't steal by ball and so then you probably  at that point that's another reason to lean sort of more towards the crop side  trade number two let's oh my goodness wanted to go Evan Mobley and assuming this is Trey Murphy for Deontay Murray Kyrie Irving DeMar DeRozan and Miles bridges in a 10 team points League ah this is a lot if you're gonna do a points trade I'm gonna ask you to please try to do your best to give their actual numbers because I don't every points League grades guys out a little bit differently  I'm inclined to lean towards the first side the problem of course because the first one could also be Deonte know because they say dejounte in the second one so it's got to be right Murphy would be Trey Murphy not Murray  um so Trey Murphy is obviously the lowest ranked guy in this group Deonte Kyrie DeRozan miles Bridges those guys are all very good Kyrie the best in that group  but I don't see how anybody gets anywhere near Giannis in this group and then some bonus in points is also kind of a wrecking ball  so I think you gotta take this side with the individual best player which for points league is gonna be Giannis  you yes you lose some depth because Trey Murphy might end up being droppable and attend team points league but you can probably replace him because again it's a 10 team or  miles Bridges is a candidate to get traded Deonte Murray is a candidate to get traded Kyrie into roses are going to be very good so you don't really worry that much about those guys but again I would lean towards the front end of this one because mostly mostly because of Giannis up next trade Ezekiel says I traded my Drew Holiday Inn Jabari Smith Jr for Scotty Barnes yeah I mean this one's a pretty easy one Scotty Barnes is to play there Drew and Safari or nowhere near is ranking Barnes is number 15 yes he's been falling  not steadily so much but kind of very slowly coming down the board but even at that pace he's still and I think I said like a month ago that I thought he'd probably still have a pretty good shot to finish inside the second round and I I'm not moving off of that yet but like  you know Drew holiday is where 70s right now 80s Jabari Smith Jr I think is worse than that he had a hot run now he's back in the 80s again Drew holidays in the 70s this is a no-brainer this one isn't even remotely close to fair I wouldn't veto it if I'm a commissioner because technically Drew and Jabari are like reasonable players to give up in a trade but this is awfully close to a veto a bull trade even though I don't believe in that just because of how unbelievably one side of this is like you even a bad fantasy manager can go trade Scotty oh I need depth okay fine you can go get like a pair of 50s for Scotty Barnes you should be able to go like you know Albertson and Jalen Williams or something like that you'd be able to get two very good players for Barnes technically you should be able to even get more than that but taking two guys in the 70s and 80s that's a foolish trade from the guy giving up Scotty Barnes and hopefully he's not watching this pot is Ezekiel because he'll probably try to pull that one off the board  are there more things getting posted oh yeah lots of Trades are coming in okay great job guys so I can start to move a little bit faster now  I overpaid a bit for Kawaii in one League Kyrie and Kobe white for Kauai but I had too many point guards and had exactly being coming back on IL Kobe white was my worst player um yeah that is an overpay because Kauai and Kyrie are very very close in overall value kauai's number six Kyrie's number 10 and Kyrie's been pretty consistently flying up boards in fact he's been ahead of kawaii over the last month basically since Kyrie came back from his foot injury he scoring over his head right now because Lucas out and yes they'll probably flip but Kobe I was a lot to give up for that little adjustment in first round value  I don't mind switching Kylee and Kawaii if you really needed to I just I feel like  that's almost a trade that you could do as a one for one throwing in Kobe  I would probably have tried to do Kobe white plus like us like a 30 or 40 range guy for someone in the 20s  that's your kicker there and I get it you know it's it's better to have number six the number 10 or you know whatever the hell I just said we were at with those two guys but  that's really close and both guys are a wrist so it's not like you're getting off of the risk side of things  little bit of an overpaid here traded keyonte George and Isaiah hartenstein for Emmanuel quickly in a dynasty League yeah I'm good with that you know feels like a manual quickly is probably gonna get himself a new deal  in Toronto I I assume that the reason that they traded for him and he'll be someone that they build around a little bit and harsh dying will eventually go back to being behind Mitchell Robinson so you're really like you're asking yourself how good does kante George get  and how quickly does he get there I don't mind like you know what you've got with quickly it's not like he's an old dude so quickly should be good for a while yet I'm I'm good with this one I like it  okay here's one with a points question and they did put the numbers there do I trade Devin Booker at 47 and Kobe white 33 for Jimmy Butler 36 DeAndre ayton 31 and Jordan Poole 27 in an ESPN points format you don't Devin Booker is running away as the number one player in that deal you generally want to keep the number one guy Booker plus white here is about 80 the other side you're at like around 90 I'm rounding a little bit but that's three players meaning can you find someone on the waiver wire who's like a 12 and then break even and the answer is probably yes so no you're keeping the booker side Aiden is going to be a shutdown candidate pool is a shutdown candidate Butler's not um Jimmy yes he's a little bit of a Bi-Lo here but I don't know that in a points League he gets as high as Booker so no you keep Booker you keep Kobe White  this is going all right so far isn't it  I thought so maybe I don't know maybe you guys disagree  Steele I traded demonic sabonis and Malcolm Brogden for Brook Lopez and Trey Murphy  free throw percent and lack of defensive stats were killing me um  I mean I get it so on just a strict rank standpoint Malcolm Brogden is a throwaway he's probably not gonna do very much the rest the way and from Strictly a rank standpoint Brooke Lopez and demonic bonus are almost in a dead Heat rollo's number 33 is not his value obviously being a buttressed by blocks demonic bonuses number 36 is value being buttressed by rebounds and assists and field goal percent  I think demon is the bonus is your best player in that deal much as I love Brooke Lopez and you guys know I'll always have a soft place in my heart for brolo I think he probably gave up too much here I think sabonis could get you a lot especially with this at the big big triple doubles he's been putting up lately if you really wanted to go for a few more defensive stats  you can look at some other guys around there like you probably could have gotten deer and fox for sabonis they're ranked neck and neck and you get a defensive stat bump I don't know that I would go for Jalen Johnson because you could probably even aim higher than that  Chris does poor singing this would be someone you could probably aim for with sabonis get you those defensive stats  I just I think you could have aimed higher than Brooke Lopez here so not a huge fan of this one  Steph Curry and Tobias Harris for vouch and Scotty Barnes this is a fair trade this is a fair trade I think Steph is a buy low right now so I probably lean in that direction if only because you know Scotty Barnes having the best season of his entire life he's number 15 staff is having one of the worst stretches of his life he's number 202  that that's gonna flip probably over the next few weeks I think Draymond coming back might even be the Catalyst for Steph waking back up again  the voucher for Tobias side is basically a dead heat to buy us is number 54 which is number 56 they are break even I don't know that either those guys changes who they are all that much over the next couple of weeks so basically this is a take them out of it frankly and you're saying Steph or Scotty Barnes and I say  give me Steph I think this is a nice Bi-Lo  also this is what it looks like when a comment comes in from the X side is like a little Twitter logo next to their name okay that's interesting wolf says I've got two I made all right well let's see what they are Desmond Bane and Kobe white for Anthony at well Desmond Bane is out for two months so obviously the Anthony Edward side is a big winner in this one  if Desmond Bane was healthy I think I might take the Desmond Bane side but he's out until maybe we possibly never  and your other one will Derek white and Jeremy Grant and God Dairy is Garland at the goal at the start of the season so obviously we didn't know they Garland was going to have a busted and miss you know month and a half two months  you know the start of the Year this seemed like a pretty good trade actually right now I've seen it doesn't let's say Garland comes back healthy  it like I get it you want the scoring you on the point guard stuff Derek White's number 27 right now he's falling off a little bit after a really hot stretch  and the amazing thing about why is what he does for a roto team he's just been solid at basically everything Darius Garland is going to hurt you and in turnovers he's gonna hurt you generally and field goal percent he's not gonna rebound all that much he's not gonna block shots the way that Derek white does from that guard position I don't mind it if all these guys are healthy especially because kind of Jeremy Grant uh is about to fade you can see Portland is is going into you know bailing water out of the ship mode these days  Derek white on his is insane hot run probably could have gotten you Garland all by himself  and the white Grant side is technically more powerful Hill I'm not as high on Darius Garland as your average fantasy analyst  so I think you could even potentially go higher with those two guys the problem of course is that the world isn't going to see Derek white for what he's worth so he's always going to be a difficult guy to include in trades because  whoever has him on their fantasy team is going to be the the manager who values him the most because you're watching him do his stuff every single night and going holy crap this guy's amazing and everybody else is like not that excited by 15 points but they're not paying attention to all that other good stuff  oh it's a lot of questions now whoops maybe I should go a little faster you know what I hadn't decided was how long I wanted this show to go on oopsies uh maybe I should have thought this through anyway we're having fun so this feels like another good opportunity to remind everybody to please  take a moment to find me over on social at Dan

face after this brutal stretch of child illnesses and you know vacation days I'm gonna fluff my beard out here live on air and you guys can watch Dan Go full like  living under a bridge mode on the podcast all right let's get back to the stuff here Joseph says in November I traded yolk and DeMar DeRozan for Halliburton and Victor webmin Yamaha oh  that is  that is a saucy trade  well you could just number three halliburton's number five there's not that much separating them this year  and Wendy's been a lot better than tomorrow I like DeMar DeRozan you guys know that he's number 44 he's worked his way up into the 40s from the 60s just the way we knew he would  but Victor's number 14  despite them in its limit despite the days off despite all the things working against him when he's still a second round value this year  and so that's the Winning Side in this trade  well done Joseph Kim  gas says I Cade Cunningham trayce Jackson Davis for Dante Stevenson Joe and arbs a Barrett and it got vetoed yeah I mean okay so look I'm not a fan of Beatles I'll say it again I think they're dumb and general bitonti even Jen's own RJ Barrett our our kind of garbage cheap players and Cade Cunningham is a like he was rolling top 50 prior to his injury and I know he got off to an oral start this year and he's not gonna be a number 25 guy the way that some folks were drafting him but  he's the only guy out of all these names that has any legitimate fantasy value so I can understand why that one got vetoed this is a pretty one side and trade as a commissioner I wouldn't veto it because like you just sort of can't unless you can prove collusion but this kind of looks like collusion  JJJ trade him what do we get sorry yo-yo you are not following the rules of today's show I need legitimate trades on here you don't get to just ask me who to trade it for  I say this of course tongue and cheek you know throw that in the comment section if you really want to whatever maybe I'll get around to it but I'm great in trades today baby  ivy for cam Johnson punch field goal and punt turn over team okay well that changes things quite a lot if you're not hunting anything it's cam Johnson in a landslide if you're punting field goal and turnover it brings them pretty close together I probably still like cam Johnson despite it because right now obviously Ivy's running big because Kate is out and he tried actually just one their ball game while we've been talking live on air I think it ended or its got like 30 seconds left  but Jane Ivy yeah 24/7 and 6 and actually a good field goal percent here but five turnovers missed a bunch of free throws  like that's the Jade and ivory great popcorn numbers and you're just praying you're praying that he doesn't destroy you in the other stuff so difficult play in category League's especially when Kate comes back but you know I  points leagues or in your particular punt  I get it I get it so most formats I would say cam Johnson but again given your specific punts here you probably can go to the ivy side  is the time to panic about JJJ these are not the questions were answering on today shows my friend we are talking trades exclusively  Jordan says Turtle for Grayson Allen I still prefer Turtle I like I like Alan I think he's doing good stuff I just think what turtle does is a little harder to find out there  Devon vessel for France Wagner give me the Franz side I mostly don't trust with the Spurs are doing day-to-day the cell went on a hot run now he's cool off a little bit so once so forth a lot of you have come in here and dropped your damn trades into the chat room and then you abandon ship that's that's not cool come back you have to sit through this nunsense  Shango and Zach LaVine for Trey young and Jordan Poole  well I I was super down on Jordan Poole this year so  I thought she was being pretty accurately drafted around 55 he's beating that buy a little LaVine I thought was being pretty accurately drafted all near 50 he's been a little behind that Trey I thought was getting overdrafted in the teens but that's again more of like a head-to-head build kind of guy  so I get it in November you mostly were like look I'll give you Shen good and Levine you give me Trey young effectively and if pool is anything at all then terrific now we're looking at a sort of in hindsight and the shengwen Levine side seems like  the the winning formula there although trays at 28 so he's had a pretty good year by all accounts  50  Lavigne is 64  who is nothing  yeah I guess it's pretty fair  Shane going to Levine for Trey that's basically Fair  Jimmy Butler for and Kyle kuzma for Paul George yeah I'll go I'll go to the Paul George side in that one we've talked a little bit about Butler already you know PG's been rolling along and kuzma's more of a points League kind of options so I'm good with that  Emmanuel quickly and he has Junior for DeAndre eight in the Blazers scare the living piss out of me I think I might take the quickly side ah  feyton comes back and plays he's probably the best per game guy in this bunch  but I'm genuinely worried now about what the Blazers are dealing with and and Aiden's missed a bunch of games with this knee thing  I think quickly probably sits in the like 60 to 75 range and I don't know what let's just call like has nothing once Butler comes back so it's just call this quickly for eight and  it's probably eighteen if only because you're in a 10 team or so you're just trying to squeeze whatever the best per game numbers are out if you can  Gafford for Derek white is the first trade that's a fair one I'm good with that either side no no you are there and capella for and Bruce Brown for vouch  yeah I think I like vouching the second one because it feels like capella is a big risk to get traded their ranked pretty close right now food is 56 capella is 71  and capella I think probably Trends down the rest of the way so yeah give me the give me the voucher side and then again the first one is is pretty fair Ezekiel you're saying you missed your trade let me this is all going to be recorded you can go rewind and you'll get it don't worry about um traded hartenstein McHale Bridges and Michael Porter Jr for demonic bonus Freddie Van Vliet and Trey Murphy yeah that's a win Mikhail is a bylaw yes but he's not going to get as high as some of the other guys here I think  for Bridges it was always the plan this year was to get a guy you drafted like 22 with the hope that he's like between 30 and 40 per game but extremely durable and you got the durability but you didn't get the per game numbers with him so far and yeah he probably does come back but like  heart and shine he's been great but he's not going to get as high as a bonus and Freddie same story for Michael Porter Jr so give me demise give me Freddy van Fleet those guys are probably your two best per game producers in this group and so I'll lean to that side  there's another one from Wolf  scent Derek white at a sell high and Jeremy oh okay so this is back to the Darius Garland one  yeah so we're talking about points league in set of category  all right I guess I get that  Darius garland does get a points League bounce  category like I still prefer I think the Derek white side points League I'm okay with it although it's tough here if Dairy Garland is out for a little bit longer let's jump to this one valence Tunis for Middleton because I felt Middleton as a higher upside and Nancy would impact all I just had to wait a while but I feel better a little bit better about it now yeah so Larry Nance being healthy has impacted Jonas Valanciunas there's sort of no way to sugarcoat that JV has slowed considerably of late he's having a quiet ball game right now I think that one actually ended and he's he's cool you know that that's the truth of it but it's not  that much it's not like an overwhelming drop off  the big issue is that you've seen the minutes a little bit less locked in he was at you know starters minutes before Nance came back and now he's at starter sometimes but sometimes 2326 it's bounced around it's been like between 20 and 30 instead of between 25 and 35 and that's that is notable I still think jv's going to be perfectly fine the rest of the season as we go I don't think there's that there's any reason to really Panic on all of this stuff  but as far as this particular trade goes yeah Middleton's been  a trending the right way and if we think JV drops from top 50 to maybe more like top 75 to top 80 85 something like that then are they kind of like two ships passing in the night what's Middleton been the last month I guess is the question here I haven't even looked 78 so yeah I mean he and JV are almost deadlocked over the last month  so this is fine I just I feel like you probably could have gotten more for JV that's the only thing I would say looking back on it  Kevin Rand and Devin his cell for Jaylen Johnson and Tyrese Maxey I think I'd prefer the Durant side I love Jalen Johnson and I love Tyrese Maxey but KD is sort of your big performer there  and I also feel like Maxi was probably gonna come down a little bit off the insane start he had so slightly into the KD side  yeah that's the thoughts on that one  Jalen Duren for Emmanuel quickly ate cat um it's probably quickly because it's eight cat over nine  but it's so close and I love Duran's Fantasy game more I just I don't know there's something fun about is the way he destroys people he had almost a 2020 game today while we're talking about him  I just I think Duran has this insane ceiling when he can actually keep his ankles healthy so personally I would probably take during even if like you're looking at the ranks at the end of the year and IQs like number 60 and turns number 66 or something like that so for me I'll probably go during just by a hair even even if it doesn't necessarily match the numbers  what's the least you'd trade away hartenstein for  um let's say that for another show since it's not a specific trade question  Jalen Suggs for onycho Kangoo points League I'm gonna go Kang woo here because I have I feel like Atlanta as a chance to blow it up and you're gonna want that oh Congo run at the end of the season if that happens  Roger that says here's a big one for you and bead vessel tyus Jones and cam Johnson for James Harden Karl Anthony towns keldon Johnson and saddiq Bey points League  so look I don't even really need to think twice about this Joel embiid side I almost don't even care what else is going on I know Hardin and Cat are your number two and number three guys of the players in this deal  and you know tyus Jones and cam Johnson could dry up and be nothing in a points league but if you can get your hands on Joel embiid in a points for him out I just almost feel like you have to do everything you can to do it because  he could do so much by himself that  he almost he almost win you weeks if he goes particularly gigantic in a way that nobody else in this group is going to do  or over a half an hour now and there's a lot you guys are staying like 10 to 15 questions ahead of me here I'm gonna try to go a little faster and catch up and I'd like to try to have this done in about the 40 minute Mark but it did work so that's fun the show format worked I don't know how many of you actually liked it if you liked it please make sure you're liking the show you know liking on Twitter leaving feedback all that good stuff so then it sort of hits the algorithm and then all fine time to try to do more of them that's the way you got it you got to show it outwardly I need Optics likes we need Optics like so otherwise the shows don't do enough damage and we got to get new Subs out of it and all that good stuff  nine cat wrote Oh punching points  you'll get your tires Maxi for Trey young and Anthony Davis  yeah I think that's the yolk is side for me  I love add but  you know yoga is ahead of add Maxie's head of Trey young I don't this one feels fairly straightforward in my eyes  specially and yeah I mean hunting points in particular like but yeah okay  Joel embiid for demonic ceponis yeah no that's I mean it's embed by in a landslide  Ryan pepeo Johnny DeLuca for Tyler glasnow and Manny Margot uh this is a question involving current and former Dodgers and it's a baseball question and you're being silly but save this for Joe orrico in fact go throw it at him right now he just says he just had a show posted too you silly customer go Dodgers  quick oh wait we got this one already I got you one don't worry I saw it before  France Wagner for Mikhail Bridges  and Aaron McHale bridge is an Aaron Nesmith okay um yes I like the bridges side I think he still has a chance to pass France in overall value and then you start to get nice Smith as a bonus there so I like the bridge is side  someone posted just the format but not the actual trade here  CJ McCollum Nick klaxon Isaiah hardenstein for Trey young Derek Lively and DeAndre Aiden  see here yeah I mean this one I think is relatively fair I don't know that it either side is running away with it I think I'd rather have hartenstein  and Claxton over Lively and Ayden and then I'd probably rather have Trae young over CJ McCollum so basically balances out that's fine no no obvious runaway winners here  JJJ for Jared Allen um yeah I'm fine with it you know you're getting a good Center back doesn't have the same upside as JJ but he also doesn't have the shutdown potential  would you rather trade Duran Orton for a manual quickly I'd rather trade Deandre ayton  I have lost my trust in the Portland Trail Blazers  I sent offers to trade away lamelo to aquire Jalen Brunson is this a win for me in rodo  I think you could potentially aim higher  because lamelo just came back and he's putting up these massive popcorn lines  so no not a win there I'd rather have little I think should I trade window Carter Junior and Vince Williams for Jalen green in a 20 team points League  yeah I think points leagues you do it  JJJ for Shang goon yeah go ahead take the guy who's not shut down risk  I was offered SGA and Cat for embed and Wagner  yeah give me the Shea side  because cat is so much better than Franz Wagner and then SGA and B are basically neck and neck at the top of the board if it blows up your team build then you have to think twice about it but I don't think it does  Larry Market in Ontario is here for Damon hartenstein  pretty fair actually pretty fair deal  I think the market inside wins by a little bit because Larry's been so good and showing no signs of slowing down  so you say all right like a top 15 guy and and Roeser they issue is does Mitchell Robinson comes back does Terry Rodgers get traded  if either one of those things happens it could flip this particular trade  for that reason maybe you go Dame and assume that he's gonna be going Full Tilt at the end of the year but I don't think that there's an obvious winner or loser here we had a yellow Mamba now we got a brown Mamba around all the Rainbow Mamba in this chat Mikhail Bridges and Aaron Nesmith for Franz Wagner uh didn't this happen before is this under a burner account now  I think we did this one I like the Mikhail side  would you try to trade Jalen green if possible I would just not have had him to begin with  he's not a nine category guy points leagues whatever like float through RJ Barrett number two  on RJ Barrett with right handed have Jalen green  Brunson and tyus Jones for wimby and Michael Porter Jr  yeah that's the wemb side  and then this is looks like I caught up oh wait no there's there's a question after this but it's not sort of in this Spirit of the show maybe he'll do it just to do one more Jerry Jackson and Alpine for Kauai and go bare it's a 10 team Dynasty category League  I would keep Davis and Mobley and Kawaii  yeah I mean I think you got to do it nobody on this board is getting anywhere near Hawaii's per game potential the problem of course is that he's also the Old Goat here you know JJJ shengwen these guys are young they're on the up Kauai gobert or the old guys so this is a win now move  your team is going to be pretty old you know you're talking just a few more seasons where you're gonna have  the big stuff you want out of these guys  I'm a win now I play Win now basically any anytime I'm doing anything I I don't do a ton of dynasties specifically because I don't really want to just put money into a coffer to plan for four years down the road that's not fun to me for me I want to chance to win every year but think about it from this standpoint yeah I mean you're I'm a guy was gonna tell you to make to take the win now move I think you probably have this year probably two more really really good years out of kawaii then you start to see some more additional drop offs so if you can win your League this year next year something like that you do it because JJ shingle in those guys are not catching Kawaii on a game side  what's a sell high I can get for Kyrie and Jared Allen  basically because of their Playoff schedules oh well I mean Kyrie should be able to get you pretty much anybody you want inside the top 20  but maybe not as high as like the top eight  so Target someone between 8 and 20 and I hope that they don't notice the playoff issue now if they do notice the playoff schedule if you're trying to get somebody back who says three or four games on that week well you look at it from this standpoint Kyrie what's the whole playoff schedule not just the one week that you're looking at can you increase the playoff games by enough to offset the totals that you're going to run so take Kyrie and say look if he's like a 244 for you or something like that multiply his per game production by tan and go find a Target and say all right am I gonna get enough out of this other guy and say 11 games  is it worth it one extra game over these three weeks two extra games over these three weeks is that worth it  how far down the board am I willing to go number 25  30  I don't think I'd go down that far your regular season still has at least another month left to it probably more  so I don't think I would take anything back that's worse than like pick 25 for Kyrie because he's number nine right now people he's churning and Burning Man  he's number nine and he's coming off another big ball game earlier today 42 7 and 7  beat the Pelicans he and Tim Hardaway did it basically by themselves  you know so  don't sell too cheap  this is Kyrie Irving we're talking about he is absolutely obliterating people  how are we here are we basically done we're basically done are we expecting a shutdown with Rozier know I'm expecting him get to he gets moved Ontario here's a question let's get one for the road mikal Bridges  for Chet or Beale for Porsche there's no way you're gonna get shed homegrown from Michael bridge is right now and there's no way you're gonna get portion for Bradley Beal  these are just not gonna happen  the chat side and the person get side when these trades by such an absurd I mean like you could go Michael and Beale and try to get one of those two guys that might get you close  and even that might still not be enough  so a b whoever you are you're gonna have to come up with a way better deal these are like this isn't even in the ballpark of fair Jets at top 20 player this year  Mikhail Bridges is what 70s 80s right now it's been a rough year for him I know we got drafted high but we got to look at what guys are doing  KD and vissel for Kauai and Freddie Van bleed points League  pretty fair I think I like the Kawaii Freddie side but pretty fair  okay  that'll wrap it up at 42 minutes thank you everybody you guys did a great job of bringing the questions bringing the heat if you guys like it again please make sure to show you like it in some way liking the YouTube liking the Twitter feed subscribing retweeting whatever you can do to help sort of boost it because I'd like to try to do something like this again a few weeks down the line but again if the show doesn't end up doing all that great sort of as it blasts out into the community that I can't justify the time spent and that's unfortunately the way I got to do everything right now is sort of what's the ROI on time invested but it seems like a lot of you were here a lot of you posted your questions and then maybe took off he'll come back and watch him later we graded out probably 30 or 40 trades on Today Show and that's pretty fun I'm at Dan best for silver on social I hope to see you guys over there this is sports ethos.com presentation of a fantasy NBA today a bonus silly little fun side episode of the show and I'll talk to you guys over on the Twitter until tomorrow when we recap the massive MLK days late so on for now
