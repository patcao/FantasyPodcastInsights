welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast I were running back to back today streamers Showtime banging them both out in the morning oh yes oh yes  we're not screwing around today everybody  so here's the thing well first of all I'm Dan batters this is fantasy NBA Today many thank you for  hanging out with us  one or both of our shows today  today is um  an interesting one for a couple of reasons because you have a number of teams getting right into the streaming stuff here you'll have a number of teams that have really good schedules from a traditional standpoint  for instance the Mavericks play five times in the next seven days  you would normally think that that's pretty good  Clippers do two by the way the heat also have five games in seven days so really busy stretch coming up Sacramento has six games over nine days pretty damn good and somehow only the fourth best schedule Warriors Rockets also have six games over nine days  and yet  we're forced to look at the card through a different lens  because Friday and Saturday are overload days Friday and Sunday excuse me  meaning that just like with yesterday's show  any decision you make about your streaming today has to be based on how many guys you've got going on Friday and Sunday  the average number of games played for teams on Friday and Sunday is 10 on Friday  and 11 on Sunday  average  I mean you know  yours may be different  some of us have taken various precautions  and already have a lower number on those days for instance  but that also makes it kind of impossible to do a simple show where we say oh well here's the bad schedule and here's the good schedules  because it's going to be  based 100% not even partially 100% on what your team's actual situation looks like  the best thing you can do is  try to wait  because the longer you wait the better idea you'll have of which categories you need to go hunting for  maybe you don't have that luxury but I would venture to Guess that most of us can  because every single team in the NBA  between now and Sunday  has at least two games  meaning there's no way to turn a one game week into a three game week  plenty of teams have two games handful of teams have three like more than you'd expect on honestly I listed most of them Dallas Golden State Houston  the LA Clippers Miami Philly was one that didn't make it into that previous discussion Sacramento all these teams have three games the rest of the week  of course then  that means that over the next four days if your season ends on Sunday for instance the best you can do with a move today is adding one game  in just total total gameplay  that might be different if say you have 11 guys going on Sunday and then you could swap out someone going on Sunday for somebody that doesn't  even still you're talking about kind of threading a needle a little bit because anybody that has three games left plays on Sunday  they have to  there's no way not to do it  you either have today and then Saturday Sunday or today tomorrow and then Sunday the day off has to be one of the middle games otherwise you'd have three days of games in a row and that doesn't occur in a modern NBA schedule  so even then you're talking about okay well if I go to a team that has three games last odds are  I'm just gonna be replacing a guy that's already an overload on Sunday  and then I'm probably adding one game somewhere else  so that's still only a one game ad  the ultimate needle thread right now  is basically  a team that does not have  Friday and Sunday overloaded  and can move  even that doesn't really work  because you're still only going from two games to three games  there's really no way to add two games over the next four days  I thought I thought this through and then apparently I didn't because all this stuff is kind of swirling around right as we're on air  there isn't a way to do it the best you can do minus injury if you're replacing somebody who's hurt that obviously that's a thing you want to do and you just want to maximize games played look at your schedule and figure out the way to do that mine is an injury the best you can do over the next four days is adding one game played to your weekly Ledger  but here's the thing  you can still likely do that on Saturday instead of today  the reason to do it today is you have more options for adding one game over four days versus one game over two days you just have more teams you can pick from if you're looking at Saturday  provided  you have you know there's two ways that I could go so let's let's look at Saturday first and then we'll come back and we'll look at today again for Saturday if you are full on Sunday you can take that guy playing on Sunday and move him to a guy playing on Saturday that's how you gain one game making one move on Saturday pretty straightforward  teams that play on Saturday there's enough of them Saturday's what like a six something no five game card I think if I'm recalling correctly I'm probably not let's look this up so I get it right Saturday is a four gamer so you got 18 to pick from if you're moving from a Sunday team to a Saturday team 18  there should be some streamer out there that you can pick up and feel okay about if you are  not full on Sunday  that's all the more reason to make a move on Saturday  or even a couple potentially again I think it's very unlikely that you're not full on Sunday with 13 teams going odds are you're at 10 guys or more but there are a couple of teams that go back to back Saturday Sunday Brooklyn Cleveland and I'll do the scroll through for people watching the Lakers  and the 76ers  so there's four teams that have a back-to-back Saturday Sunday  here's the thing though we've talked about this does anybody is anybody off both of those days  no  so again if you were not overloaded on Sunday  the only guy you'd be dropping their to make a pickup on Saturday would be potentially someone else playing on Saturday but he might as well just make a pick up for someone playing on Sunday if you are full on Sunday and you're dropping that guy on Sunday to get someone playing on Saturday you could pick up one of those back-to-back so that you have a backup option on Sunday in case somebody gets hurt which is the best thing to do of those and you've got four teams pick from or if you feel confident you got 11 guys going on Sunday you move that 11th guy to someone only playing on Saturday then that adds Atlanta back into the mix that as Denver Detroit uh Memphis back in to the mix so now you've got a few more options of teams you could pick from for Saturday so that's how you could add one game on Saturday  having a better idea  of what you'll need to win the rest of your week  again the only real reason to make those moves today in Saturday is if you like your options a little bit better meaning if you like the bonus game you're getting today and said of the bonus game you're getting Saturday which adds back into the mix some of those teams we were just talking about Dallas Golden State are options today Denver is today and Saturday so again depending on your overload situation that might fit into your calendar but mostly I'd say Dallas Golden State Houston the Clippers the Miami Heat the New York Knicks are actually in there I forgot to mention them earlier  Philly is on that board Sacramento is on that board so you have those like what did I just say seven or eight teams to pick from today  so if you really like the streamers on those teams and you think that they're way way way way way way way way way better than this dreamer you might get on Saturday that would be the reason to go today still if I'm if you're like okay Dan you're circling here there the radar is almost keyed in on it  what are you doing Dan what are you doing for your teams that are in the playoffs right now  I'm waiting to Saturday  I think that's the way to go provided you of room on your card for gamer you definitely should  I'm waiting till Saturday I'm gonna take whatever overload I've got on Sunday and I'm going to move it  says as simple as that  or somebody who's just not playing well that doesn't make sense because they are playing on Saturday so you take your one or two worst players on Sunday let's say if you have two moves left you take your one or two worst players that are going on Sunday and you switch them that's it  that's the move  now if you're not overloaded tomorrow which I'm not I made a bunch of moves and so I only I think I only have like seven guys going tomorrow which is way under the expected number that actually opens up a few options for my team but because of that  I'm definitely not making moves today  definitely not  because I have room on Friday  I can make moves on Friday  I can make a move tomorrow and move on Saturday if I want  I can just make a move to a Detroit Piston since they go tomorrow and Saturday  that's a way for me to gain nicely if I take a guy that's playing on Sunday that's my overload guy and I move them to Detroit going tomorrow and Saturday or Memphis going to tomorrow and Saturday that's the way that I can gain two games I guess I get I suppose that's the way  if Friday's open and Sunday's full  you take the one game on Sunday that's overloaded you flip them to somebody calling Friday Saturday that's how I can still get two moves bonus the rest of the way or do the same thing for today but again the longer you wait the better idea you have of what player you can pick up so that's your needle thread if you're not full Friday but you are overloaded not just full but one extra player on Sunday you take that guy and you flip them for someone with three games left the rest of this week  but I don't know that there's even a player that that fits that that's not all so going on Sunday  so you take your overload guy on Sunday I'm trying to do the math in my head here on the Fly  so you don't lose a game there but that dude has all has to not be playing between now and there and  yeah that doesn't make any sense so it's really tomorrow that's that's your your tiny window you've got two teams tomorrow Memphis and Detroit where  if you have one guy to spare on Sunday if you have 11 dudes you can downgrade to 10 on Sunday and you can move to Detroit or Memphis because they would go Friday Saturday and preferably the guy that you're dropping from Sunday maybe didn't play on Friday I still don't maybe there may not be a way to get two bonus games but suffice it to say  the main point on Today's Show 14 minutes of nothing is basically what just happened on this one the main point on today's show is wait as long as humanly possible  dear Lord wait as long as you can  folks using the internet without expressvpn is like not paying attention to the safety demonstration on a flight most of the time you'll be fine oh God this is dark but what if one day that weird yellow masks drops down from the overhead and you have no idea what to do  oh  it's better to be safe than sorry  that's the main point here  every time you connect to an unencrypted Network cafes hotel's airports whatever any hacker on that same network can gain access to your personal data your passwords your financial details  and a skilled 12 year old could do it and then they simply take it and they sell all that info on the dark web for 1000 bucks  let me do this over and over and over again they'll do it all day just sitting in a coffee shop  so why why  would you go into that situation without any sort of protection I mean again like first of all what are the odds you see a 12 year old hacker and a coffee shop probably not all great but one of those other persons in there who looks like they're working on their script might just be stealing your info  Express VPN uses an encrypted tunnel if you can try to picture that it's a secure encrypted tunnel between you your device and the internet so bunk bunk hackers trying to get in can't see what you're doing  it would take that same actor in The Copy Shop a supercomputer using a supercomputer over a billion years to crack Express vpns in encryption  the reason I love it  forget all the safety stuff you just turn it on  that's it you don't need to be tech-savvy to use expressvpn you just turn on the app click one button it goes from red to green from off to on your protected you can use it on phones laptops tablets more routers whatever you can say secure on the go secure your whole house whatever that's what I love about it it's easy it's safe there's just no reason not to  if you ever use internet outside of your own home  so secure your online data today by visiting expressvpn.com slash hoop ball I love that it's still hoop ball that's expr e s s v p n.com slash hoop ball and you can get an extra three months free expressvpn.com slash hoop ball go there today  let's take a look at the chat rooms see what you guys got going on who do I like best who do I like best  my mommy who do I like best for a head-to-head Yahoo points League Trey Lyles precious Ochoa or Haywood Highsmith  yikes  um  it's probably a chewa  yeah we'll go precious  how many moves would you recommend saving his backups for the last two days of the Season just in case everyone sits um  so this is I'm assuming this question is in reference to if your league goes to the very last day of the regular season so that final Sunday when half of your roster is gonna sit I mean  as many as you can here's the thing the answer to this question is  a tiny bit of a cop-out but all so  there really is only one answer to this question and is every move you use during the last week of the season so I April 8th to April 14th every move  in a lot of scenarios maybe you get Super Lucky and you don't have to use up all four on it but if for a lot of us every move you make that last week is dropping someone who's just out for the rest of the season  you also kind of want to be a little bit careful early that week remember there's no games on Monday of next week because of the college national championship so it's a Six-Day week Tuesday through Sunday and basically everybody plays at the end so Sunday is kind of a wash although again like if you have half of your team gets knocked out if a bunch of your players get ruled out  if you can figure out if it's a real injury or a fake one that's where you'd use some moves if it's a fake one keep them because a lot of teams are playing back-to-backs in there try to figure out assume  maybe this is the way to phrase it assume that nobody on your team is going to play a back-to-back so if someone gets ruled out on one half of one you kind of have to give them to the other half to find out if they're actually hurt  so don't blow all your moves early next week April 9th April 10th whatever don't blow all your moves on Tuesday and Wednesday because those guys might actually just come back and play the rest of the week you want to use your moves exclusively on guys that are being ruled out for multiple games because then you could gain multiple games by using a move  guys on your team that are just not even the tiniest bit productive which hopefully is nobody so hopefully you don't have to use a move for that and then towards the end of the week Friday Sunday whatever just make sure that you're getting as many games as humanly possible so it's not so much about saving moves for that last day as it is not being too aggressive with your moves on Tuesday Wednesday when guys that are sitting might play the rest of the week  saving your moves for situations where uh guys are out for multiple games is the key and then at the end if you have one or two moves left just you know be ready to use them so  there is no right answer to this question of how many moves I'd recommend saving for the last two days of the season I think if you get there with a mover to left great but if you had to use them all up on Thursday and Friday Also that's okay there's no right answer here  arcade Cunningham and Miles Bridges drops  give them to the next one they get ruled out again then probably but I would give him a little bit longer and then if Tyrese Maxey and Josh Hart are both out who was the better play between campaign or boy on bug Donovan in a points League I will go  campaign  because at least the as the floor of getting some assists  but not much it's Gotta just all be points he's gotta rack Up All In One category and that can be kind of complicated  plus you know what the next they might just pick somebody else and roll with them I mean it would probably be both done it but you just sort of never know and then on the other side with campaign if he's out there he's gonna get you some points in assists on terrible percentages but that's okay cuz it's a points League all right guys we went back to back this morning that was fun
