welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  yeah I know scheduling is a little bit weird right now and I again apologize for that  it's an adventure of a week in the best press household but welcome one and all  wherever the old day this is Thursday  Thursday it's fantasy NBA today this is a sports ethos presentation I am again Dan Bass Pros  I guess I said my last name I didn't see my first name at Dan best price on social media  should I have gone by Dan Walter that's my middle name yeah probably if I went all the way back to the beauty of time  but I don't have that luxury now it's too late the best person is out there  there's no going back on that now  although I was briefly Dan Bebe  when I was handicapping over at pregame.com those were  unusual times unusual times Darvin ham may be on the hot seat out in Laker land  and we had a bunch of guys yesterday that kind of solidified that they don't belong on fantasy rosters  and Today's Show is to go through all the games from a 12-game Wednesday and let you guys know who you can safely dumped out onto the waiver wire because I know you're all looking for the next big thing and you're gonna want to know which player you can cut loose to do it  luckily today  we got all kinds of names for that  before we get started want to remind everybody that all the relevant links are in the show description you can get my Twitter handle there you can get the show  feeds there if you want to pass it along to anybody the Discord link all that good stuff and of course the links for some of our lovely sponsors manscape.com  expressvpn to name a few I would certainly be appreciative if you checked them out as well  but let's go ahead and dive straight on into the fun or fun ish for some of these ball games because this first one was not  Wizards all I need you to do is keep it close and for a few games they were able to do it but not so much this one  ah well womp womp it happens sometimes they're not going to keep it all that close  and everybody was terrible  which at least makes that our fantasy analysis side somewhat simple  we were in the posture of streaming Danny avula lately because he'd been hot and honestly actually wasn't that bad and I know we should shut the ball terribly shot it horribly in this ball game but you know kind of who didn't who's my guest shot at okay  and that's still the case Audios in the Stream wild warm unit  Ward  you know what that's it that's the stream wild warm Ward  I don't know that there's a W word  that you could use to signify that we're playing the player at least not without getting kind of weird so it's gonna be the stream wild warm Ward it's the particular Ward where we stream the guys that are warm  Abdi has been one of those guys lately I think you can probably continue that because you know game wise he was okay here just that like nobody got to play very much and then his shot wasn't dropping but anyway we should move on to the Cleveland side because after a month of shooting 32% from the field  Max druce finally woke up finally that was a tough month man  he fell from like the 6570 range to the edge of the top 100 this better ball game pushed him back up to 90 so he jumped like 10 slots with one good ball game  and you know I don't know that he's gonna necessarily have a few games in a row like this but we also know that he's not a 32% shooter long-term  I think having at least one of Donovan Mitchell or  Darius Garland around actually kind of helps stress because he's more open playing the Wizards all so helps everybody because everyone's always open but sometimes you just need to slap buster  that's what the Wizards were in this ball game  and let's hope that Max can build on that he was never a drop because his minutes were still there  all the other stuff was still there steals blocks right have been better this season rebounds assists he just wasn't hitting any shots and then he did and you know everything magically fixes itself  Indie beat Milwaukee again bucks Kryptonite is Tyrese Halliburton and here's one of the drops Malik Beasley is one of the drops I know that like he fluctuates up and down in three points stuff but that's all he's doing now he had an interesting start of the year if you recall where he was getting  other stuff actually it was weird it was different  and you know I wanted to write it off but at the same time I had to be reasonable about it because I was like all right like we're seeing this with Max Drew somebody in a new environment getting to do different stuff than they're used to  it's gone now  the rebounds are still sort of semi there but the assistive trended back down where they always are which is minimal and the Steals and blocks which were actually kind of okay to start the season those have gone back down to his career marks as well and so now he's exclusively three-pointers  on rightly a 3-point percentage that I don't know if it holds up all season anyways at 47% from downtown  he's doing his job what they need him to do but he's not going above and beyond it and so I think Beasley now you can effectively move on from with three points streamer but he doesn't need to be on your roster all the time  on the Indiana side a couple of very quick notes on the Pacers and then one larger one Aaron neesmith only played 22 minutes in this ball game which again some of this stuff doesn't fully make sense to me with the way Indy does things but there were units that were playing well enough and so Rick Carlock on just let it roll Nesmith while he was on the floor was a plus 18 as part of the group that built up the lead he went for for anyway he's a hold is the short version Obi toppin might be playing his way into these Dream well warm Ward but not as of yet Jalen Smith's minutes are not secure enough we know enough about Benedict mathura and not to buy into that nonsense  the player I wanted to talk about is Buddy hield  who transitioned to the bench four or five games ago whatever it was Pacers have won every ball game since niece Smith got shifted into the starting five  Jalen Smith also by the way over Obi toppin this new starting five is just working  because Rick Carlisle is for all his annoyances on a fantasy side he's a good coach  he finds units that work together and he's  not you know married to one particular lineup terrible for fantasy  good for reality it's annoying for us here from on the fantasy side but anyway now buddy hield his back into the dog house he got some pretty good minutes his first couple games coming off the bench but lately it's been much more sporadic thank you he was at like 28 and 20 1 3  so I think you can probably punt on buddy hield that doesn't seem like he's about to get dropped back into the starting lineup anytime soon because that's starting lineup was losing and this one is winning oh they got their guy into the starting lineup that's their hustle guy their heart and hustle dude that's Aaron easement  every team needs to get that guy into the starting lineup  the one that hits a shot  and we'll run through a wall  look at the teams in the NBA that have that kind of guy and how they deploy them Alex Caruso  perfect example of that kind of player  Bulls want him on the court anytime they can get him out there provided he's not falling over dead on his face  whatever let's keep going Atlanta beat Oklahoma City this was the sort of stereotypical letdown game the Thunderhead beat the Celtics and I hotly contested match the night before then they had to go on the road and played at Atlanta team that was very much more keyed in on this one than the Thunder were she was having a bad ball game and then ended up with 3313 and 8 because he just doesn't have bad ball game jaylen's five steel performance as he continues to just slowly walk up the leaderboard  he's at number 64 in nine cat now  played in 30 games which I think is that all of them for the Thunder did he missed a single game yet I don't know why I care that much I think because we call them a Buy Low and then I was like why is this taking so long he did miss a couple he missed a couple but regardless he was a Bi-Lo when he was in the 90s that was another easy one  steals were always going to come around at some point  sometimes it happens over one or two ball games sometimes it happens over three weeks  this is one of the instances where it happens over one ball game five steals one day he jumps from like 0.9 to 1.1 on the year that's how fast that can happen  rare off day for jet Holmgren  I don't think anybody is concerned because he's number 12 in nine Cat still  sick  why am I talking about the thunder nothing changes for them on the fantasy side how about them Hawks Jalen Johnson 28 in 3 with 2 3 4 steals made his free throws shots 60% from the field man what a year he's having number 37 per game in nine cat only derailed by a stupid hand injury that sidelined him for a month and change  otherwise he's been  I guess it's got to be behind Derek white probably the biggest Winner's in on the fantasy board at least like the biggest jumpers because where was he going where was Derek white was going like 80 90 he's number 15  Jalen Johnson was a last round sleeper b-150 guy was a 37  I'd like to put other guy I want to put Kawaii in that mix we talked about this before Scotty Barnes obviously Chet Holmgren  James Harden much as everybody hates to hear it  these guys are big Winners Tyrese Maxey down to number 22 now friends  I love it he's a guy that we were high on but he's kind of coming back to Earth a little  yes I said this on Twitter yesterday and bouncing back to the Hawks now because I keep getting derailed by the fact that I haven't been sleeping all that great because my kids are sending bodily fluids everywhere Seneca at 10 points 8 boards two threes a block  three at 12 shooting hit a couple of free throws I'm frankly tired  of playing saddiq Bey  which I know isn't really fair because as Finn's go he's been fine  but over the last month these shooting 38% so he's kind of hurting more than he's helping if you can catch him on the right week two week three week stretch he's been fine you know for the season he's sitting just outside the top 100 which is playable in most formats  I just I really want the Hawks to get healthy so that I can safely say no more Barry and right now he's still teetering right on the brink of being a nine cat play in all formats two three games will go in a row where he's good and then two or three where he's not as good he's not bad enough  or he's not inconsistent enough I guess I should say to be in the Stream while warm Ward  man I am ready to not have to deal with his up and down crap anymore and as soon as he under Hunter comes back  wipe our hands of this nonsense  Brooklyn is a mess they shot 39% they have no offense right now is it that they need Ben Simmons back I don't know I don't think he's  coming to the rescue anytime soon  will there be a coaching change I don't get a coach is gonna fix this  but it does feel a Brooklyn in the Lakers right now are the two teams were feels like something's about to pop  whatever that might be  Brooklyn tried moving Kim Thomas to that sort of bench Gunner role and he is as cold as ice by the way he was willing to sacrifice by coming off the bench not that he had a choice  almost all of the regulars on the Nets are in a Bi-Lo posture right now Mikhail Bridges basically couldn't be any worse than he's been Camp Johnson less of a Bi-Lo because he's somehow kind of surviving the ugly  same with Nick Claxton surviving the ugly somehow  you guys know I'm not particularly high on Spencer didn't win his Fantasy game but technically if he fits your build he's a little bit of a Bilo as well  question is how long does it take  for this team to sort of  cap on whatever it is that needs to change I don't know that I don't have the answer to  for Houston they're down a few bodies and by and large they've had trouble winning while down a few bodies but  here getting to play against a different team that's having even more trouble winning was good for what else the Rockets they've what they want to a couple in a row now what are these games they beat the  beat the hapless Nets and then the worst team in the NBA in the Pistons obviously you like what you're getting out of shingen and Freddie Van Fleet right now because you know most of their teammates are hurt other than I think Jabari Smith Jr green is fine but he's not a hurt but he's also not good  they need to our Easton they need Dillon Brooks  I hate that this Eason knee thing keeps cropping up because  he was really coming on and with no Brooks around like the sky was the limit but he can't stay on the damn floor you're holding on Easton his Fantasy game is too damn good like he absolutely positively must be on your team  if you're wondering what to do with Jay Sean Tate here in his fill in role I think the answer is if you wanted to go schedule play that would be the heaviest I'd go there same story for Kim Whitmore who put up a nice line and 16 and a half minutes but I mean 16 and a half minutes that's the story there  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of

right now mostly since they got healthy  they're down Trey Murphy but they've won four games in a row they are improving on the road which is a big deal and where they won this one Zions been better still looks a little bit  let's call it stocky but what he's engaged at kind of doesn't matter you just now have to hope that the stocking this doesn't deliver any sort of injury to him getting Larry Nance back was big for the pals they now have that sort of defensive unit they can go to they have someone that can spell Jonas foul in us if he's like in this game he had some foul issues there are certain instances where they can deploy kind of different looks this is a deep team now that they're mostly healthy they can  they can handle a lot of the competition  and they can do it without hitting a ton of three pointers now they hit 12 in this one because McCollum and Herb Jones each had four but they're not one of the leading three-point shooting teams  but they can guard some people now that they're getting their guys back  as far as fantasy goes herb Jones is a play as long as Trey Murphy's out when Trey's been in herb has been bad otherwise everything is pretty much telegraphed on that club so we move on to Minnesota where basically everything is telegraphed as well the only story for the Timberwolves right now is that they fit a little bit of a funk  what are they lost two in a row it's a mini funk  they had that big win over the Lakers before the year turned  hard fought ugly game then they lost to the Nicks and now to the Pelicans I mean it's like they're playing bad teams or anything Anthony Edwards has been on a pretty good run lately  it kind of feels like the wolves go as Mike Conley goes he's had two I'll say pedestrian games but certainly quieter ones and then they lost McCartney's been good  Connelly's number 66 and 9 cat Rudy gobert is in one of his little mini funks as well he's dropped at number 80 he's been cruising along in the 60s for a while I think he probably gets back up into that range  just this one wasn't a very good matchup for him Zion ate him alive  but there's nothing you're really changing with this wolves team you just you know you hope that they put up better offensive or fantasy numbers in the next one and move on  looking for more possible drops I'll give you one on Toronto Gary Trent Jr was kind of curious how he would fare  the odds were that it wasn't going to be very good because they traded ogn and Obey away and pressure is a chewa and you know OG was getting started minutes but she wasn't playing very much and they brought in two guys that are likely to see starters level minutes in Emanuel quickly and RJ Barrett and they did and so Gary Trent was the guy who loses out because he was picking up some of those extra minutes and those extra minutes are now no longer extra  what was also nice in this ball game is that we finally got a full starters compliment to minutes for Yakima portal who's been I mean from a minute standpoint he's been all over the damn map this year luckily his Fantasy game is good enough that you know he's a 26 in some odd minutes and he's number 84 in nine cat he's got his free throw percent up over 50 now so that's been a big part of it would love to see some more games where you approaches 30 or even clears it like this one because then he's a top 50 kind of guy but you know we'll get what we get as we say to the kids you get what you get and you don't get upset  Dennis Schroder has embraced his bench role he continues to hang out just outside the top 100 he's at number 18 in nine cat that's fine  again we've talked about it before no where near that top 50 start  I also said this before I was really worried  when Schroeder started top 50 that I missed on that one by a billion I did not I had him in the 130s  he's at 18 now I still missed but like what the hell is actually a difference between 130 and 1/18  like 10 points over an entire month  probably  whatever  not really miss luckily feel better about that as far as Immanuel quickly goes I mean he was an obvious add the minute this trade went down and you got to see some of that here he was good he was one of their most effective players in this ball game  and sky's the limit  now that's not true Sky's not the limit because he doesn't get many defensive stats his field goal percent is a negative he turns all over a fair amount he doesn't usually rebound or pass very much you might seem more assists this Toronto team Embraces ball movement in a way that they Nicks maybe sometimes don't question mark  and that would certainly help I be pretty floored if quickly could get inside the top 50 just because he has that sort of prototypical shooting guard game but man if they used to just there good things are gonna happen  for Memphis the I don't say the the John Moran shine has come off but he gave them a nice little sort of kick in the tushy when he came back and now they've come back to earth a tad their  still fine obviously way better than they were with without him but they're still not  really Contender level  man do they miss Steven Adams like a lot a lot fantasy wise you got really three guys to worry about on this team I said that on Twitter and somebody called me out for the Marcus Smart  exclusion but when I said it last week I still wasn't sure that smart was gonna be a top 100 guy  and he really hasn't looked like it yet I think what five steals in a block in that first game coming back and then things have leveled off and he doesn't get to shoot very much and he's not getting to pass all that much  and so I just I you know I don't think Marcus Smart is going to end up being  a playable fantasy guy  where is he at on the season now one 41 that's called the wrong way too  I think you hold a tiny bit longer because at least this is a guy where we've seen succeed in fantasy  but I bet she's gonna be a drop in the next week we can all so  I've given you plenty of drops already today so I don't think you need to work all the way down to the Marcus Smart part of your board but  maybe  Dallas spanked the Blazers who are still without DeAndre eight and but Anthony Simons came back and looked like he was still sort of catching his breath and this ball game you can basically throw this one out game was over super early scoot played 30 minutes because they wanted to just get him playing time and anytime they can do it and he wasn't a pillar of inefficiency here shooting two for 11 from the field 2 for 4 at the free-throw line with six turnovers  and this is why you don't draft rookies  this is why if you want to stash them you do it with the expectation that they're better after the All-Star break  time honored tradition  Malcolm Brogdon back to not being all that relevant because Simon's and sharp are in as is Jeremy Grant I guess I shouldn't make sure to include all three of those guys well know those three guys are in Brockton goes to the bench and he doesn't get to do all that much  I've got to think the Blazers are trying to move Brogden before the trade deadline there are crap on a team that could use a competent like a very competent backup guard  there a lot of teams are he'd start  but I mean look at the contender list just go down the board  who are some teams that could use a veteran like that  sure you wouldn't hurt if for the Thunder to have someone like that on their Club  nuggets to have a backup because nuggets are thin they win a lot of ball games because they're starting five is ridiculous but they're kind of thin  Clippers are a little thin  King's have enough guards  Pals have enough guards Mavs Mass could use some depth Rockets could really use him depth Sons could use some depth Lakers could lose you some depth there's a lot of teams just we even within the Western Conference that are looking at Brogden and going come on  come on  I'm looking at the the chat room and Daniel Infante asks why I'm a manual quickly hater if that's what you took away from that that is absurd Daniel what what speech did you just listen to  what what did I just say that that's I mean listen I like I really appreciate you watching and I appreciate the comment too because it makes me think what the hell did I just say to make you think I'm a hater quickly is going to be  a must roster all formats guy on Toronto  it does not make me a hater to say that he doesn't rebound and he doesn't pass  he might pass a little more in Toronto his fuel goal percent is going to be low  and that is a hard 9 category stat set to getting inside the top 50 is what I said  I don't think it makes me a hater to say I don't think he's gonna be a top 50 guy and if you're looking at how he was on the Knicks this year pre-trade he was outside the top 160 because of all those things plus Thibodaux using him stupidly he's a good basketball player  but he misses on a like four to five categories in nine cat which caps his upside  that does not make me a hater that makes me a pragmatist I am a handicapper here on this show Emmanuel quickly getting to do a lot of stuff which is what's gonna happen means he needs to be on every roster when I saw the news break I was on vacation in Yosemite I still got to the computer and said make sure you add him immediately  but top 50 is a is a deep stretch  and I just want to make sure that you guys actually do the lifting here don't just be like oh I mean quickly he's gonna take 18 shots that makes him an automatic top 25 kind of guy that's just not how it works  guys have to be able to do seven six seven categories and he's going to be points threes  free throw percent are going to be the three big ones  and if we go real lucky he'll get you for assistance instead of two and a half  but that's still a small positive he doesn't rebound  he doesn't get Steals and blocks he doesn't shoot the field goal percent well  this is not a knock this is why you then look and compare to other players on the board if you don't want to do like the Deep dive on projections and things like that and you're like okay well who's another guy who scores a bunch  get some threes  hit some free throws  as kind of like the three big things how high do they go like well does that sound like Tyler hero  it sounded like Tyler hero like two years ago but he's since added more rebounds and steals to his repertoire so no longer and here oh by the way who I think is like sort of a best case scenario for quickly  remove the rebounds remove some steals Heroes at 23 points three and a half threes four point four assists 45% from the field 88 the free throw line let's say that it quickly gets to those numbers  but in five and a half rebounds it's more like two and a half to three and a set of 1.4 steals it's like point nine  that brings him out the top 50  so that's why I said what I said it's not a hater thing  it's about understanding how numbers equate to Fantasy value  but again the short version is start him everywhere  the long version is understand what his actual value is what can I get you coming back things like that  let's keep rolling along here um Dallas Derek Lively's heard again which is a huge bummer  because  he has this he has really good fantasy game and he just can't stand on his feet so  listen I'm a pragmatist as I just said I would love to tell you that you absolutely positively must hold on lively until the end of time  I wish that you could  but I also understand if you can't at this point because you know without a clear time line  this is a guy who's sitting near the top 100  with upside because his minutes have just kept trending up every time he can stay healthy and and learn on the Fly  but if you don't know if he's going to be back for week two weeks three weeks or whatever it is I get it I get it try to hold if you can  I understand if you can't Kyrie and Luke are going to do the bulk of the damage for this team now Tim Hardaway was an easy drop the second that Kyrie showed up but Grand William's got her to get in this ball game and so now that may open up room for I don't know about Derek Jones Junior possibly if Dante eggs and comes back he sort of a possibility here I I personally don't think any of those guys maintains top 100 value with both Kyrie and Luca healthy  but if you wanted to hang on to any of them it would be Exum because you know he's gonna be wide open all the time and that sort of the way he was making his living over the last couple of weeks  I also think that you wouldn't end up feeling all that terrible if you moved on from all of the maps streamers and just thought man like what's the best case scenario for these guys still not all that great thing is I've already given you like three or four guys that are probably droppable on today's show so do you really need two more  like six drops coming out of yesterday's card  Chicago lost it New York not for lack of try and DeMar DeRozan good ball game Alex Caruso great ball game Kobe white bounced back on Andre Drummond please stop taking free throws Andre can we please have a game where he doesn't take free throws  but  and it's a big butt it's a wide load  Zach LaVine likely back by the end of this week  so  things are about to change for the Chicago Bulls what I would remind all of you before you guys all call me I hate her again is that Kobe white was bad when Zach LaVine was in  I did a breakdown of it on Twitter Twitter what's Twitter  it's the evil cut section might be the good cousin of Twitter right now used to be the evil cousin now it's the good ones so Twitter and Twitter I did a breakdown on Twitter and I think I mentioned it on a show like week two weeks ago maybe Kobe White's week by week performance this year has been extremely luminating it was something like 180 150 220  then I think he had a 40 top 40 week  and then there's back to like 200 again and then Zach LaVine got ruled out for a month and it was like 25 15 40 50 and then he cooled off and it was outside the top 200 for the last week and a half and he had this good ball game all that to say with Lavigne out Kobe White's been closer to like a top 60 play and with Levine in he was pushing the back end of the top 200  Patrick Williams went from an afterthought to near the edge of the top 100  and so I am genuinely concerned that those two guys fall off a cliff you're not dropping Kobe white in advance of this new news that would be insanity but preparing yourself for the possibility that it could get kind of ugly for him still we we know that Levine remains on the trade block even if he is actually going to be coming back and playing for the Bulls again here in the next we don't know one to two ball games they're still trying to move pieces because they remain slightly better than they were to start the year but overall pretty bad 15 and 21  you know five and five their last 10 I guess but they're the 11 see they're not even the play in right now  they were half game up on the Hawks yesterday now it flip-flops  so they're still looking to move some stuff around but Patrick Williams will be a drop when Levine comes back Kobe white might be like a stash at that point had to head maybe you still deploy him but  we've seen that one the usage isn't there there isn't enough of that other stuff because he's a points threes assists free throw percent guy  and those things dry up fast when you go from 20 shots a game back down to like you know 12 or 13 like it was a substantial usage bump one of the biggest  and I've taken a lot of heat over the last four weeks  about not being higher on Kobe white to start the year I would change nothing of what I've done the lesson learned there was that I should have I don't know like the Bulls seemed so hesitant to move any of their key guys so the fact that within the first like three weeks of the year it dropped that they were thinking about moving exact Levine that was way earlier than I expected that was the mistake I made  I thought that it would be later on December January February where they're like all right fine well actually consider blowing this thing up but they did it in November  and then the shutdown and you know it seems like exactly is actually been hurt because this would be a pretty long shutdown if he wasn't and then all actually letting him possibly come back and play for the team I guess we'll see anything can happen over the next 24 40  anyway get ready cuz it was bad for these other guys when Levine was playing before Kobe and Patrick  for the Knicks  Josh Hart  I think we can pass  Dante even chenzo pretty good in this game again but 25 minutes is not enough  that's the part you need to take away from this don't look at the fact that he had two good ball games in a row you got to look at the fact that historically he's needed more than 25 minutes to produce consistent fantasy value so far this year  he's actually been on a better per minute clip  mostly because he's hitting threes at a very strong rate two and a half three is in 21 minutes ballgame and he's at one point one steals in only 21 minutes a game so like  the  if you could just extrapolate that line and say okay maybe Place 2526 minutes that gets them over three threes a game it gets him to like 1.314 steals would that be enough yeah maybe  but I feel like we know enough about even so over the years to know  kind of what he is and percentages are both going to be bad  so he's gonna have to do a lot of three indeed to counterweight that  I'm not a full believer yet  if he becomes sort of the Tibbs Guy Tom Thibodeau guy because he tends to have his guy's and his minutes Trend up to 27 28 I think I would change my tune and I were not that far away from it so I'm a little bit hair splitty but 25 long term just isn't enough given what we know about his fantasy stats at  just because he's been good for a few games here  I can't fully Buy in  he's close though he's coin flippy right now again just a minute or two more might get him over the hump  so you know stream away when guys are that close there's certainly a scheduled stream level but I do think we need a tiny bit more in terms of playing time to push him over that  full like start everywhere kind of ledge  Clippers won again all the Phoenix was without Kevin Durant again so that's certainly played a role Clipper shot 55% son's 53 that wasn't a whole lot of Defense in this game  friends quite Leonard good at basketball  he's number seven per game in nine cat right now  James Harden is number 13 Paul George's number 14 Clippers are a freaking fantasy Gold Mine this year  but not much to take away from this one zubats is it 121 that's just his Landing place he'll have some good ones he'll have some bad ones and nobody else's really worth paying attention to when they're healthy for the sons I'm holding Grayson Allen until something forces me not to he's been very good someone all year is basically been out for this team so that's been helpful but it does seem like he has the fantasy game to exist around Superstars because he hits 3 he gets steals he does it all at a good clip and then they'll give him a ton of minutes so he'll just sort of back pedal into three or four rebounds and three or four assists kind of deal so Grayson Allen is a hole for now and nice to see Bradley Beal ramping up  good good we move along  Detroit Utah this was a wild one overtime game that featured over 300 points boy and bug zdanowicz game Jalen Duren big ball game Cade big ball game  the only Story by the way you know I don't take Victory laps when guys do what I say they're going to do I just sort of move on but this is the fear with Jade and Ivy and why he's more of a points League kind of dude  playing time not guaranteed production not guaranteed points League fine nine cat no on Jaden ivy  livers and Burke's those are the two names to look at on Detroit right now Alec Burks is very much in the Stream well warm Ward at the moment he is currently warm so Monty Williams is giving him robust playing time he didn't do all that much besides score it threes and have a decent field goal percent in general but you can stream while warm livers are starting at Power Forward I'll start times and played 11 minutes Detroit's try and stuff  they didn't do enough with his 37 minutes to Warrant to pick up but at least keep an eye on that for Detroit  but no moves to be made from it this is more of a watch list kind of thing and look I'll admit I've been to skeptical of Simone fontecchio  two skeptical  but I think I have every right to be pretty skeptical because on the season he's number one in 194  but a lot of that was when he wasn't playing at all so you kind of have to look more at like the last month since his playing times gone up to more like 27 minutes per game and he is right on the border of a 12 team 9 cat all formats guy 27 minutes game he's a 12 points for boards a steel half a block and 2.23 pointers with serviceable percentages so when he gets  35 minutes and gets off to a hot start  then he manages to be inside the cut line  I think he's I mean listen you want to know what I'm actually gonna do myself I'm fine with that I mean I'll put that out there we're a fantasy analyst so I gotta sort of take a stand  he's probably not a guy I started in Roto because I don't trust that he's gonna shoot 55% long term or average two steals a game long term that's what he's been over the last week because he's running hot right now  Head to Head go right ahead easy decision he's running warm when a guy's on a street like that there's sort of no hot stretch or hot streak I put the two words together there's sort of no real downside to playing them on the head-to-head side so roll with him there I'm personally too nervous to use him against the games cap because  I like I don't see these things lasting  and that's fine if you have a bigger Stones than I do Uno  have at it but  not my thing I like to be much more safe conservative with my roto games cap deployment which brings us to the rest of this insane Jazz roster cane George has been shelved while Utah's currently trying to win some ball games so luxury stash at the very most Kelly Olynyk had been doing quite a lot lately he only got 20 minutes in this game he's a stream while warm Ward kind of guy John Collins has been it's been have been pretty loudly trending down since the start of the year he's just a straight schedule play  Jordan Clarkson explodes like this for a couple games in a row about once every two to three weeks  you probably can't sell on Clarkson Because I'm guessing no one in your Rodeo League wants him over the last week even with these giant games mixed in he's still outside the top one 20 for the season I don't his Clarkson even on the board yeah 100 in 196 because he's a field goal percent full tank who doesn't it that many three pointers and doesn't get defensive stats and turns the ball over a crapload he's just not a nine cat guy but then he has these you know he had a triple double in the game before this one and then 36 point Mega Whopper here and basically like kind of won the game for Utah you might be able to convince somebody in your league that he could be a top 100 nine cat guy you it wouldn't be true but you might be able to convince him one meanwhile Walker Kessler who is being dramatically underrated this year because his minutes have been stupid is at number 66 in nine cat and they're not even letting him play  nine points 8 boards almost three blocks a game in 25 minutes a night  that number gets and he was a 29 yesterday in this overtime double no single over time the double overtime game was later  he played 29 minutes here and at six blocks he's an absolute Goliath on the interior and we just need the minutes to be a little bit higher I don't think you can buy low on Kessler anymore that was earlier in the season it's certainly been good enough lately  and then Colin Sexton somehow still a hold  they've had this guy languishing doing nothing for like a season and two months everybody got hurt finally like all right you know what Colin go do whatever and now everybody's coming back and they're still letting him play  for the life of me I cannot figure out what the hell you does gonna do on a game basis but right now sex in needs to remain on rosters he's been accent over what it is about that two to three weeks since the whole team got hurt top 70 can't move on now  Miami beat the Lakers won 10 to 96 without Jimmy Butler Lakers shot 42% from the field had 24 turnovers  not Anthony Davis's fault  get that man some help right now 29.17 boards three steals 5 blocks six assists because teams are doubling him as a Lakers run the ball through a d sometimes now and his passing has gotten better Nine out of 10 at the free throw line  jumbo size game ads actually put a little bit of space between himself and Nicola yokich on the nine Cat Board number three behind Shea and Joel embiid  oh that's a big ball game Austin Reeves got a start it took like half the team being hurt for driving him to finally let him start and  he was good one of the only Lakers who had any bounce in his step  let's get to let's do the heat first because the Lakers I think are a deeper story than just the superficial box on this one first of all your streaming Jaime kids Junior when Jimmy Butler's out that's a pretty easy one  Duncan Robinson is borderline I'm not streaming in when he comes off the bench so I mean that was this ball game so no I'm not streaming to call it yovich  he had a better ball game here but some of that is just the fact that the Lakers are  like they have just they're so disjointed right now  and then Kyle Lowry had a nice steals game because you know Lakers with 24 turnover somebody's gonna get a few of those I haven't been starting Kyle Lowry lately so for the heat I've been playing out of Bio hero obviously and then harkes  and then Kevin Love has been kind of weirdly useful over the last what is it I mean we're we're multiple weeks into this Kevin love being like kind of okay thing  probably a better fit for head-to-head because he's mostly points and Boards sometimes threes sometimes free throw percent if he can get himself fouled  he went two for six the foul on this ball game which is extremely weird for him  honestly I don't think I have the stones here to use him in Roto but he Duncan Robinson  both of those guys even Lowry you could probably use on the head side but aren't really good enough for Roto Iz is good enough for all formats at least well Butler's out  and it was a Jimmy Butler question in the chat room and I was sort of waiting to come back around on that you guys are wondering what the future holds for Jimmy Butler  the weird thing for Butler right now it's not the injury because he always misses a few games here and there that's just kind of in the story for Butler Mrs 15 to 20 basketball game seemingly every year  the weird thing with Butler this year is that is steals are way down most of the other stuff is not all that far off you'll go presents a little bit lower as well  I have every reason to believe that much like with Jalen Williams  some of that begins to come back  I don't know if he gets to that top like 10 to 15 range where he has been I think two or three of the last four seasons  but I don't think he's going to be in the 45 range where he is now  think about Butler is  I mean his draft position is so weird he's someone that last year I targeted everywhere because he was going at like 35 in some spots and I think he was a little early than that this season and so it was slightly less safe but still it felt relatively safe I do think that Jimmy crawls himself back inside the second round on a per game basis when he gets healthy the steals the field goal percent being sort of the big things right now that are different year over year  um at a bio doing more has been part of it Kyle Lowry not being out for like the entire year he'd have a few more options I know they lost Max strus but some of the other guys have kind of been able to step up those are things I'm not as worried about for Butler the thing I'm looking at is steals I'm looking at steals I'm going to feel goal percent one or both of those probably Trends up and I'd be pretty floored if he didn't get inside at least the third round which would be you know near his 80P as the season goes so no Panic really um you know probably not top 15 which is a shame  because usually he can be a pretty easy second rounder  there's still a chance that he gets there I don't want to take that off the board yet but I don't know that it's necessarily as much of a shoe as we figure because a lot of kind of big name players this year are not getting steals the way that we thought Butler going in the mid to late 20s or early 30s  felt like a guy or like all right well worst case scenario he ends up like right around where he was and this deals and field goal percent are not there so we need him to get his butt climbing up the board and I still think again that he can get into that like 25 to 30 range which would be right around his ADP he wouldn't be a hit in that spot I'd still be annoyed about it but at least it wouldn't be sort of a small loss which is where we're at right now  um let's see here what else we got going on um let's talk about the Lakers because there's something amiss with this team first of all Lebron had a down ball game which you know it happens he's been pretty unbelievable so far this year he was in the first round he falls back to number 16 with this bad boy game  it still feels to me like his steals is a number for LeBron that's gonna come down felt like the efficiency was going to sort of Peter out as he gets a little more tired as the season goes but that's not the story of this ball game one down game for LeBron means nothing  the issue with this Lakers team is that they're being run poorly a few things are at play and I don't want to go too far down the Lakers rabbit hole but we need to do a little bit of it to understand what might come next  first of all Christian Wood is now like back in instead of Jackson Hayes which is fine you know the Lakers have they need offense and what is vastly superior at that end of the floor to Haze who's  the better Defender better box out guy  but the Lakers are sort of in a pick your poison spot right now and some of that has to do with really hot tomorrow being out for a while and now D'Angelo Russell's out for a little bit and cam reddish is playing in every other game and Jarred Vanderbilt is very clearly not 100% all of these things matter  on top of that cam reddish turning back into the pumpkin that we basically knew he was he had come out of nowhere to be this high energy steals Guy they never been at any point in his career and not surprisingly he ran out of gas trying to do that  and all the while and we spent too much time on this last few shows but it Bears repeating because  there's a report this morning that the Lakers are that the Darwin name is lost the locker room and I you can understand it because he's the way he talks during postgame pressers is like yeah you know we're never discouraged you have some passion man  I think he sees the writing on the wall  I don't know what the timelines going to be on that  but I think he sees the writing on the wall  and  he at least for some stretches yesterday  was willing to give Max Christy a little more run  but like the thing that keeps jumping out to me is that you know Taurean Prince was over six shooting yesterday and he played 29 minutes there's absolutely no reason why a nice cold tour in Prince should play 29 minutes  I don't care how banged up the team is find something else  find some other lineup  he was one of the biggest negatives on the team  yes yesterday cam reddish he didn't have it anymore those two guys don't need to be starting I like Tori and Prince when he's hot he's a big three-point streamer  and he was a go go go go the last like two or three weeks because he was warm but the shin is off you can drop him too I like him now you don't have to  because this stuff comes and goes if he gets hot again we'll play him again  but they need somebody with some energy somebody with some Grit some belief  I have no idea who that is on the current roster I would have said ruin and  he's out again  but there's a problem right now because right now Anthony Davis is looks like about the only guy I give Austin Reeves  Max Christie also these are the three guys that to me look like they're playing extraordinarily hard every ball game and LeBron is 39 so he can't he's amazing he's a cyborg  but he can't Sprint back on defense every single time if you expect him to carry the damn team which they've done they've expected again for a long stretches this year  someone else out there has to be running and there's way too many plays and you see this they're just like they're dejected they're down they get off to another bad start and it's the same old crap  something's going to change on this Laker team I don't know what it is whether it's going to be a trade a firing or both I just I go through all of that all those whoops to say be ready  because of the Lakers send off say if they trade D'Angelo Russell and Tori and prints and Royce whatever and they bring back one guy like Zach Lavine you know that may open up stuff because then there may end up being like a fifth guy who gets all of the bulk minutes instead of where he is right now where there's like four guys that are all splitting minutes because they all kind of stink  I feel bad for Jarred Vanderbilt he's obviously not himself he's moving slowly Lakers are running different schemes this year that make no sense I like it they're all over the map then that team needs a shake up in a bad way I think it's coming when again I don't know but be ready same story is Brooklyn and finally Orlando Sacramento double overtime fun and this ball game was fun for some folks not for France who got hurt five minutes into this thing and not for Gary Harris who got hurt 11 and a half minutes into this ball game those guys were out window Carter Jr is kind of a maybe go go bats they played 28 minutes moving her was the center who didn't get to play in this one that Center situation is a mess  Paula bunker had 43  extraordinarily inefficient points in this ball game he went on a crazy run where he scored like 18 straight that was pretty awesome  but the eight turnovers and all the Miss free throws are and that's why you like him and points and not as much in nine cat is there a pickup  by the way again this is why you held on to Jalen Suggs because he's good but is there a pickup with Wagner and Gary Harris going down are there multiple pickups with Wagner and Gary Harris going down because these are two starters  I think you consider adding whoever moves into the starting lineup because Paolo is going to do a ton and Suggs is gonna do a decent amount but there's gonna need to be a third guy willing to go take some shots  Caleb Houston had 15 points and four steals but he only took six shots chumo KiKi at 11 and 7 with three three he only took five shots  travel and queen played 38 minutes took seven shots  who is it going to be could Mark helps resurface here and be that gather guy I doubt it  I think if you told me I had to choose from one of these dudes I'd probably go okeke because we know he has a great steal rate from when he actually got to play a couple years ago and he gets some you can get some rebounds I'm not convinced that Caleb Houston can do enough besides hit three pointers it felt at me you not gonna get for steals every game so that you have to sort of chalk up to a little fluky barely in rebounds or assists so you kind of look at the guy that can get you some of the other things and that's chuma okiki I don't know that he's gonna be a starter in their next ball game but it kind of feels like he almost has to be and if we get the word on that think they play on an overflow day though so it probably doesn't end up helping you all that much is Orlando play on Friday is it their next ball game yeah they're in Denver I don't know that you're gonna be able to use a guy if you pick him up on Friday but it feels like okeke's probably that dude  and  yeah and then for the Kings  Malik monk got called out by his coach in a previous ball game and he responded 37 points he played 46 minutes off the bench  I feel like there was a stretch I feel like he played almost like 25 straight minutes at one point in this game something crazy he can Murray got lit 20 8 points  anytime he has a bad ball game just try to buy low because people like oh no sabonis went 2020 with a triple double as a big ball game these guys played Crazy minutes Chris Duarte only played one minute as a start 10 excuse me 10 and a half minutes is a starter  this is why you didn't jump at him after one kind of like marginally decent ball game we saw bad deer and fox in a rare twist he's been really really good lately always gonna be held back by the free throw percentage number 29 and 9 caddies gonna be better than that in points League blah blah blah just repeating things but again this is why you held Malik monk after the bad ball game he'll be fine I feel I feel like I wanted to say more about Orlando and then I didn't do it it doesn't matter quickly here a couple of really good I like these questions in the chat room because you guys are getting more broad stroke with your stuff those are things that I can talk about on the program because they're not team-specific  oh Adrian Benjamins  a b what's up dude  awesome  this is a blast from the past so I don't know if you guys were hoop ball followers back in like 2017 but Adrian actually filled in on this show that was in the summertime I think I only did three or four shows a week and then Adrian and Neil Rochelle Lonnie filled in on fantasy NBA today that was back when I used to take time off what an idiot I was then huh they were all the hosts of The Box Score breakdown a show that's been sitting quietly just waiting for sweet Adrian to take it back over again we missed you dude  I was awesome hope you're still watching here at the end of the show so you can see your shout out  that's not the thing I was talking about  Tony says how high are you on tari Eason in general to quote the great Harold and Kumar I'm not alone I like to our Easton a lot he has a really translatable Fantasy game he's number 89 on the season and only 21 and a half minutes per ball game that's including all of the games where he wasn't getting very many minutes as he ramped up from injury he's number 65 in 25 minutes a game because he's a great rebounder he's a great steals Guy it just it translates nicely and if you could keep that damn knee healthy and get up to 27 28 minutes he does have you know top 65 top 60 potential top 100 feels like basically a guarantee the rest of the way again provided he can stay healthy  what else we got here and sort of this broad stroke stuff I'm not going over the trades guys you're giving me a trade I'm not breaking that down  this is more more thoughts on Kobe white Alexander says the reason he was bad with Zach Williams was because he was shooting terribly here's the thing guys Kobe white is not that great of a shooter  he's at 44% on the year right now  and that has him right around the edge of the top 100 in total basically I think Yahoo hasn't been 102 and basketball monster has him at 106 at 44% you are right Alexander to say he was bad with Levine in because he wasn't shooting very well  but it's also really important to note  he's able to float his value with what we call popcorn stats in the industry points boards assists  and sometimes threes  these are the stats that accrue the fastest they pop like popcorn blocks steals things like that they come slower in smaller increments you know one steal per game is League average 0.7 blocks per game League average League average in threes is like close to 2 for scoring it's 1560 for rebounds at 6:00 for assistance and whatever  hope that part makes sense  if you guys can go back and do me the favor of looking at the game by game the shooting was bad  but the number of shots was also way lower  look at the number of shots I'll try to pull this up on the Fly here if I can do it it's not that easy without putting together a very bad podcast but if you look at the date range basically the first month of the year say October 24th to November 24th first month of the year and just look at the number of shots that Kobe white took in that stretch 11.5 and he shot 41%  he was outside the top 180  even if you adjusted that up to 44% that does not make him a nine cat startled guy  because he still would have been subleague averaged in points  rebounds steals  blocks field goal percent  the one thing where he ends up well above lovely average in threes and a little bit of an assists he was at four assists per game 32 minutes per ball game still playing big minutes  but  wasn't getting big shots  if you go to the next month which is basically the Zack Levine out one that again I'm sort of fudging the edges on this a little bit because I want to do it on the fly without messing up the show  top 35  played 38 minutes per game with Levine out  shot 50% from the field on 16 shots per game  five extra shots per ball game  and he went from sub-average shooting to above average shooting  where does 41 and 49 meet 45 which is basically where he's at for the season right now because over the last two weeks he's been bad shooting again and it's dropped back down to 44  what is Kobe white the rest of the way is he the 16 shot per game guy which again 16 shots per game at 44% he's still startable he's not top 35 but he still started if he was getting 16 shots  50% obviously that comes down the threes the points all that stuff comes down with it assists will also come down when Zach lean comes back  is Kobe white top 100 guy when that team is fully healthy  I still don't know if we know  so yes you're right he shot the ball poorly during those first four weeks five weeks whatever  41% is below where we expect him to land when all is said and done  but where is he been basically every season of his not that long but long enough NBA career so far 39 402 43 444  4344 is who he is  so if his shot attempts go back down to 12 instead of 16  does that keep them inside the top 100 if he's shooting 44%  I don't think so  I think that's one 3150 range  can you shoot 46 47 percent then he stopped 100  sure  did the shot stay at like 14 instead of dropping all the way down to 11 and some odd  maybe  those are ways that he could stay  but again outside the top 180 to start the year  and only a little bit of that 20 to 30 slots worth was field goal percent  a lot of it was just  way lower usage  but Zach LaVine tomorrow Rose and Alex Russo all these guys are still on the trade block so they could still be gone in a week a day whatever  and that's where I am on that one  all right we're over an hour whoops sorry through a question back up there were over an hour now and I forgot to tell you guys anything about our sponsors it's all so basically time to wrap up the podcast so let's do it all at once first of all at
