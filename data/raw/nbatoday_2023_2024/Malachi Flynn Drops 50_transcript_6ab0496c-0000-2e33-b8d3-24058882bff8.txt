welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right so some dude dropped 50 last night and  I don't want to say it was the least likely  because you know like do up wreath is still out there but it was  pretty damn surprising  Malachi freaking Flynn  Malachi Flynn  50 points on 25 shots Off the Bench  crazy steam lost  but that's because he plays for Detroit  now Malachi's fault  it's pretty wild when you consider the fact that he shot 72% on 25 shots and the team still shot under 46% overall  that's not good enough Jade nivi shooting three out of 15 may have had something to do with it  Marcus Sasser was what three out of 13  come on guys hit a freaking shot someone else poor Detroit  poor Detroit  anywho  welcome to Fantasy NBA today I'm Dan bass still  we are winding out here folks Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday and then one more week 11 days  it's all we got left  crazy  Playoffs begin  and our job switches quickly  to figuring out what went right and what went wrong in a season gone by well start that basically the the day the season ends  season ends on Sunday April what is that 13th 14th something like that  and the very next day we'll have a show on Monday  we will immediately start to figure out what lessons we could take away from this year whether they be the same ones previous Seasons sometimes certain lessons carry over require us to do a little kind of extra emphasis on the wrong syllable  and some of them will be new  we'll go through the old man squad we'll go through Yahoo's ranks it'll be a prolonged dive into everything that we could have taken away from this most recent year  so with that in mind I say please do take a moment to like and specifically subscribe because I'd love it if you guys hung out with us all off season long that's when I need you the most because there are boring days in an NBA offseason and if I got you guys out there to come hang with that'll make it a whole hell of a lot easier let's talk fantasy basketball we're gonna immediately start with the Malachi Flynn game it's Flynn day everybody by the way it's also met today who had 28 minutes again and at nine five and three with five Steals and a block in yesterday's ball game and I think I can we can officially say that met two is pick up a bowl  that's reasonable that's a way that people talk  you can pick up Matthew  I mean I feel like I feel like you kind of have to  he's playing great ball right now  now from a scheduling standpoint Detroit schedule was a good one yesterday because they had three games in four nights so that was a really intriguing grab I realized today if you're head-to-head it's not really the day to do it but they do have a back-to-back tomorrow  and the following day  he's basically had four good games not great for good games in a row and five of his last six have been solid mostly because he's piling up defensive stats  which I realized maybe not a thing that can last forever  he's right around the edge of the top 100 over the last two weeks over the last week he's kind of like a top 80 range guy he's also by the way only shooting 43% over that stretch but the Steels and the blocks are carrying him  so I'm good with it if you need Steals and blocks and enough rebounds to not hurt you there  may 2's become that guy  kind of a fun little unexpected add  I don't know what the hell happened with Kade yes yesterday Cade Cunningham was not on the injury report and then like 20 minutes before the game he just they decided and never mind  Jaden ivy again I don't know how many times I got to get yelled at about this dude typically when Kate is out he's startled in nine cat when Kate is in he's not close he's a points League guy only and then yesterday you saw why is he a pointy guy only well that's why  I'd rather have Marcus frickin' Sasser  who by the way keep an eye on Sasser because he's kind of playing some point guard and a Flynn doesn't go crazy then Sasser probably has a slightly better ball game  uh you know head-to-head yesterday part of that you know three and four set made sense Rodeo this is not a situation you're overextending yourself for Marcus Sasser  I'd rather have met to and certainly if you didn't have Flynn for this Blog game which very few people did  it's certainly ain't getting better from there  might as well just do the other side of this same ball game and then we'll sort of cycle back to the beginning of the cardan Johnson triple double  man if he could have just stayed healthy all season long  Jalen Johnson Clint capela bogged on Bugattis Deontay Murray those are the four guys you can play every night to DeAndre Hunter had a better ball game here if he's heating back up that'd be nice but for the most part he's a points kind of efficiency stream  when he's on his game doesn't get many steals or blocks doesn't typically do a ton of rebounding or assisting yet a few more in this ball game and obviously it helps when you're playing a team like Detroit that has no idea how to guard any one but the yandere hunter in my eyes is more of a doesn't matter range dude who you play when you need scoring on usually an okay field goal percent and then you know maybe a couple of rebounds basically but that's sort of it  all right rolling back to the top Portland and Charlotte had themselves a real lovely 89 86 ball game the answer the question of  who wins a slap fight well  so DeAndre Aiden is still playing for some reason I don't entirely understand why but we'll take it because I do have him on a couple of teams if he could be a nice source of boards and points and field goal percent and he still is Mr bunch of time in the beginning in the middle of the Year and that might be why that he still playing  Jabari Walker had one of his big games shot horribly but he did have 22 rebounds so that's hard to overlook and again there's this whole like how good you need to even be from a fantasy standpoint to have value if you're playing 40 minutes a night the answer is not that good  but yet somehow the Pistons have some guys that even if they play 40 minutes a night I'm still not really sold on making them fantasy adds in fact Jabari Walker over the last week is averaging 39 minutes of ball game and he's outside the top 150 because he's averaging 12 and 11 on 32% shooting and basically nothing else  so Jabari Walker a low level doesn't matter play who's basically a rebounds stream  I freaking rather have Andre Drummond in half the minutes  Banton was okay in this one he's above the cut line in that same stretch of time all the you know he has issues also last week Banton is shooting 37% on extraordinarily high volume so even though he's at 17.5 and 3 with almost two Steals and two three-pointers he's outside the top one 50 but the difference there is that there's just a lot more upside with Banton mostly because he's probably not going to shoot super high volume 36 and a half percent you gotta figure that probably creeps up into the 40s and that's frankly all it would take for him to be inside the top 100  free throw number is our lower over the last week but overall he's not a terrible foul shooter and then you're getting points boards as if steals blocks threes  it's you can get a guy that can get you all of those and just like isn't completely ruining you in the efficiency stuff then you're doing okay and prior to this last week for Banton it was really more of like a field goal percent is not great  or bad at times and then free throw is kind of okay  but again this is that same thing like you have to be good at more than a few categories to be good at nine cat I'd rather have Banton  he's my second favorite play on poorly right now behind obviously DeAndre eight and then he got schooled 22 and 10 but he's an efficiency black hole basically with very few defensive stats typically bad turnovers and both percentages have been kind of rough all the field goal percent was better in this one so he's points League only and that's basically as far as you go with Portland Kris Murray is a guy we've talked about as like a very very low end I just need a guy to fill in us a roster slot but there is no fun there so why do it if it's not even a tiny bit fun  no Nick Richards and  no basilia meets each for Charlotte in this ball game  so Grant Williams played points Center he had 5.7 boards and 11 assists he's a play when Nick Richards is out I know he's shooting wasn't great in this ball game but you can stream Grant Williams for Richards Davis bertans got the start and I mean four steals is not a repeatable number so no  Brandon Miller you play no miles Bridges by the way in this game either so that allowed JT Thor to start don't care Trey man he's a steals  some board some assists slowing stream  it's messy man I don't know who's gonna play for Charlotte in their next ball game obviously miles Bridges plays you play I'm Brandon Miller's a play Grant Williams is a play with Richards out and that's probably as far as you go against a game's cap and then for Head to Head you could run a guy like Trey man out there because at least he's seemingly playing Knightley  yucky  Lakers got productivity from all five starters no huge surprise there giving they played the Wizards who don't defend at all a life will be slightly more complicated here coming up Lakers playing a Cavs team that's going to be presumably at full strength though I think they've got it back to back there but look you think Donovan Mitchell is going to skip the Lakers to play the Clippers no chance  they'll play their guys against the Lakers they'll rest some of their guys against the Clippers  so like there's probably not gonna put up points quite the way they have been calves in the wolves and warriors these are three teams that are playing really good defense lately well calves a little messy overall but typically a pretty good defensive team  so what happens there may be a tapering for rui hachimura but you know for the moment he's still playable  and then the main four guys are kind of your obvious choice nice game here from add 15 out of 15 at the free throw line  kind of needed that not that he was trending down or anything but the free throw number had dropped and was not a positive he had kind of Fallen back to a neutral this game pushed him back up to a positive free throw marker  cool  for the Wizards any of the left this game part way he was dealing with a migraine so that allowed Corey Krispy a little bit of extra stuff to do but typically I don't like to play Corey and unless kuzma's out and kuzma was in because he knew damn well he was gonna play against the Lakers uh Tristan vukovich 15 points I don't really care he's not gonna get full starters minutes and you was gonna have trouble with Anthony Davis he had five vowels in his 20 minutes  I really just want Rashawn Holmes coming back I'm not picking up books of it I I just I know he might be okay here in a very short run  I'm not gonna risk it  Jordan Poole just continues to play I there may be a little bit of an Iron Man thing going on  I would love it if he'd sit a game or two because then I go Jared Butler and I go all so super hard Jared Butler  that dude's got a pretty good fantasy game and we're not really being allowed to fully see it  yeah nine and seven here seven assists three steals a block at three pointers  he's had a couple of games where his assistants have been up around 10 already  but it's just not reliable it's not happening every ball game or even every other ball game and you kind of needed to be like every two out of three ish  which I don't think happens unless one of these main usage guys whether maybe it's obvious maybe that's all we'd really need but I do think that pool being out of the way would be the easy path here to get Jared Butler some more stuff so for now your pool your kuzma your idea that's it and you take it day by day as you have to do basically with every team right now  Thunder are down most of their key guys so you're in should I bother streaming  any mode and the answer is kind of  this game was a blowout so it not a great look at who the streamers would be but with Shea and Jalen Williams you can generally go Lou Dort and Josh giddey and just you know don't expect too much  Celtics  spanked him Boston's starting to play with a little bit of a purpose again yeah you got slightly better games at a Pritchard  and Horford but some of that was again because this game was over early so you know Jayson Tatum only playing 29 minutes pretty good example of how the game was done huge game here from kristofferson's  really really nice ball game for KP who moves up by the way I know he's missed a lot of ball games but before sinkus is number 15 per game this year he's right back there again  27 and 12 with a steel 5 blocks and three three-pointers that was a True Unicorn now is a unicorn  Indie lost at Brooklyn oops no Myles Turner may have played a role in this one bad Pascal ciac I'm definitely played a role in this one Jalen Smith started for Myles Turner and was fine you know I was kind of hoping for more but he was part of units that were just getting run right off the court because Jalen Smith defensively is not very good  you know he gets a block every now and then but in terms of like actual Rim protection or deterrence you can just go right through him  what does that mean for Indy  what does that mean for Jaylen Smith well I don't know if Miles Turner might be back for their next ball game that's a possibility  they've got the Thunder we don't know who's gonna be playing in that ball game coming up next so  what we got in this one was Jaylen Smith and I said Jackson basically splitting the center minutes  and if that's the case then both guys are like right on the cusp of fantasy value with Jalen Smith you probably want about 24 25 minutes with Jackson he could probably get it done in about 22  I kind of want to see it again before I'm willing to make a claim or  so make a call on either of these guys so Jalen Smith Isaiah Jackson column kind of watch listy if you really needed rebounds and probably some field goal percent you could go Jalen Smith in a pinch because you assume he's starting and he's starting he's gonna get 20 minutes so he's at least at least he's not gonna really burn you 20 minutes of Jalen Smith you can probably get like seven eight points and you know seven to nine rebounds all so which is kind of nice and maybe like yesterday you would fall into a steal or block  so yeah you could probably go Jalen Smith if you need some big man stats  if you don't specifically need big man statue just going for like a nice big across the board line that's where I would say watch list but again this time of year your category hunting and Smith would make a lot of sense for boards and field goal percent and maybe a little bit of other stuff if he happens to play a good ball game which  he didn't really hear  I tried to warn you jerks about Trend and watch for I was getting yelled at about him and you know life I don't want to complain I don't need you guys feeling bad for me but life as the fantasy analyst is can a weird one sometimes because I'm out here on an island getting yelled at for whatever and I have to come back on every day I have to I choose to it's nice it's fun I come back on here every day and I have to go over what I got right and what I got wrong you guys can yell at me with no ramifications for it  Dan you're too late on Trend and Watford I'm not  there needs to be another guy out and in fact a guy came back that was cam Johnson who got a game off for rest  Watford now is two guys away  when Johnson was out Watford got real close  we need two guys know a Clowney had a crazy 22 in 10 games and that also factored into it but  he's not there yet  mikal Bridges who can't shoot you're still starting him cam Thomas and Nick klaxon those are the three Dennis Schroder doubled but he has issues with the other parts of his Fantasy game so he's really just in assists play and that's as far as you go with the Nets right now not cam Johnson first of all he's too banged up so they're not gonna overextend him on the minute side not Dorian Finney Smith because his Fantasy game isn't thick enough and not trending Watford sorry  just the truth  or Lando in New Orleans this is a weird one bunch of pills were pissed off at the end of the ball game a couple got ejected as far as fantasy stuff goes it was nice to see Jonathan Isaac get back up and over 20 minutes so that's good Paulo at 32 and somehow it was not a good not a good fantasy game  Wendell Carter Junior nice little points boards field goal percent stream that's what he's good for I'm repeating myself I hate that part of the gig having to just repeat the same thing over and over again I need to just have like  I've talked about this before at some point I'm going to do a project where I just have every Fringe level player so pretty much anybody ranked between like 85 and 160 and it just has my take on all of them and if it changes on any given night I'll just change that board and I can say look at the damn bored  or the changes maybe I'll talk about it if it doesn't change that's when I can just be like look at the board  so for the Magic Window Carter Jr  look at the board  Jaylen Suggs look at the board I don't care about one slightly bad ball game  Jonathan Isaac  I thought maybe he could go we could make him a go and Roto the minutes are just really hard to predict  but damn when he gets 20 he's he's a role to play  I think you could probably have him on your team in a game's cap format not if you badly need a whole bunch of scoring or anything but  for others  get you some threesome boards some steal some blocks on a decent field goal percent  not the worst thing in the world  Zion heard his hand laid in this ball game Larry Nance  left  actually don't remember what it was and I was counting on this little bubble on the screen to remind me and I don't  I don't know what the hell is going on there in any event if Zion has to miss a ball game we might actually get a little bit of yonas Fallen shooters  maybe they might go heavy on Naji Marshall but in all likelihood you'll probably get 20 plus of JV so that would make him a nice big man stream for a game this again is a Zion has to miss one  dice and Daniels is playing more again these days you can't expect him to go six of eight shooting but you can stream him if you need a steal basically  and that's probably about as far as you go  the rest of these guys are not all that useful for me Toronto lost by 50 basically I'm rounding up and they had everybody out except for a manual quickly Kelly Olynyk got this one off as well Gary Trent got this one off RJ Barrett got this one off they already had all those other guys out from before so the starting lineup I mean look at this good gravy starting lineup for the Raptors in this game was a manual quickly and oh  gradey dick who people have heard of at least Malik Williams Jalen McDaniels I think we've heard of Jaden McDaniels and Garrett Temple  they reversed the  Frozen Carbonite that he had been encapsulated in for however long and Garrett Temple gotta start  what  all right so here's what you need to know about the Raptors presumably Olynyk and Trent and Barrett will be back for the next ball game but if we ever run into another one again where they just fully pull plug on all NBA level players Jordan Noah is the guy  he has the best fantasy game of any of the names that you see on your screen right now or any of the ones that I've read plus Muji and Javon Freeman Liberty  I want to do Liberty Liberty  so frequent Liberty actually did a decent ball game yesterday 165 and 6 with a steal and a couple of three balls no don't trust him quickly yes you can play quickly know he's super inefficient and terrible in this Blog game but again if he's Last Man Standing he's a play Aurora is the one that sort of jumps up as like okay well this guy gets some playing time he tends to go do a bunch of stuff he's he's a busy body on the basketball court he's not just gonna stand there and wait for someone to happen  gradey dick is points really only inefficiently Sol pass  if everybody's out you might take a look at him but know what a temple no to McDaniels although he's slightly interesting he's playing 37 minutes and notably Williams who  who yeah I know  this game was over early so you just dumped the Box on the Minnesota side we'll just keep rumbling along Memphis won again and the Bucks have now lost two games in a row to Absolute dumpster teams  unacceptably poor performance is without Damian Lillard they lost the Wizards and the Grizzlies those are supposed to just be free squares at this point in the season  there's a rare Bingo reference on the podcast  Jaren Jackson  35 points four assists three boards three steals a block  I don't know how he's done it but Jerry Jackson has almost Salvage this fantasy season he's at 66 games played which given how bad the Grizzlies are this is a massive win and he's a fourth rounder per game now how the hell did that happen  how did he get up to fourth round per game after his terrible start and all the mess gone on around him on the Grizzlies  Jared Jackson congratulations on  kind of saving your fantasy season I know impressive GG Jackson is a points League guy  Luke Kennard really bad game here but when he started I generally feel pretty comfortable playing him he's coming off a really big ones so you kind of have to look at the average of the two  Jacob ravia know and then Brandon Clark I am honestly blown away at how fast he's gotten his sea legs back underneath him here 14 and 3 with two blocks missed his free throws or this would have been a really really good fantasy game I kind of need him to get 22 reliable minutes which I don't know that that's in the cards necessarily with him coming back from a catastrophic injury and his team terrible and there being 11 days left in the season  but I'll be honest with you guys I added him in a role to League you can't go ahead to head I Memphis has back-to-back coming up tomorrow in the following day he's going to sit one of those they have another back-to-back next week he's almost definitely gonna sit one of those as well  but Roto side if you want like 10 to 14 points pretty reliably I think he's gonna be right in that mix six rebounds that's where he's at all the time that's where he's been one or two assists and some defensive stats on what will likely be a very strong field goal percent number Brandon Clarke is not a terrible option  you know I give you thought you were going to get to play James Wiseman for a day and then Jaylen Duran didn't miss any time with a knocked out tooth Brandon Clarke is a damn good replacement there or if you thought you were gonna get a Marvin Bagley run down the stretch and he got hurt and go Brandon Clark instead  This is Rodeo by the way from Milwaukee I mean get it the together bucks  get it together  if Giannis doesn't have a good shooting game you're really in trouble and he didn't and I don't really know how that happened Brooke Lopez had a good shooting game out of nowhere  no Dame again which you're looking at it like okay surely Malik Beasley can do something in these games the answer is no not really he's 3-pointers only pet continents had a couple of well-rounded games we shot about terribly here  I would not play Pat connaughton by the way I know I know Dame is out I know he's sort of the starting point guard right now but he's just out there to get the ball to other dudes  sorry Pat connaughton I don't trust you  what is it pretty well-rounded games too in a row I don't know why I'm being such a jerk about it  seen enough I've seen enough to not have confidence  and then finally the late game all these other games were done and then like two hours later Cleveland and Phoenix like you know what let's make sure the night continues Cleveland got blown out Donovan Mitchell was fine Mobley was pretty good and Jared Allen was pretty good but the rest of it didn't do enough Max Drew's 912 and 8 pretty close to a triple double for stress in 38 minutes he's back to logging gigantic playing time and this was like early in the season that was when strews was a top 75 guy and then it seemed like he tried to play through a sore knee for like two months before they were finally like Max stop dude  stop it you're not right  he took some time off and he's come back and he's look pretty good since he's come back and I can't not I don't think any of us knew for certain that that was why stress wasn't playing well that he was playing hurt for all that time but it sure kind of seems like it now looking back  that he was just exhausted and hurt  because he's come back and he's shooting the ball well  he's rebounding again he's passing again the steals are back up again  I think juices a play in all formats right now and at the very least even if you don't think that the field goal percentage is going to continue he's a positive in threes and he'll be you know neutral ish in almost every other category  and being neutral and almost every category is a fantasy win typically  those guys are shot 75 range guys that are just kind of like Lee averaging everything  it's not easy  Phoenix is on a little bit of a push right now this is the Kevin Durant woke up part of the Year Katie 32 Booker all so awake 40 points Bradley Beal is basically just playing point guard right now not really asked to do much  didn't we all kind of know that Yusef nurkic was eventually gonna fall apart this year not that he's been bad but he got after that really good start and he's kind of settled back near the edge of the top 100 that's fine  that's fine I'm okay with that  he was over his head that's my totals what is he on a per game 113  yeah  funny thing there too is that I guess build water on myself nerc and Max Drews have almost the exact same per game ranked this year  but if you ask most people I think they'd say that nurkic has been way way better and they're basically tied in ranking  it's just this perception thing  anyway you can keep playing Eric he's fine he won't be great he'll be fine  and Roy so Neil Got a Feeling game here that's worth noting because Grace and Allen sat this one out whoever plays alongside the three superstars in that starting five is just gonna be wide the bleep open  I don't think that means that Rose O'Neill is going to magically start shooting like 50% from downtown but if you needed some threes whichever guys Lots in there is someone that you could probably take a small Gander at all right that gets us through yesterday's card there hasn't been much in the way of news this morning just one big one Julius Randle finally did undergo surgery so he is now out for the season that's crummy it does also mean that Josh Hart is locked into value for the rest of the regular season now that we didn't think Julius was coming back I'm  Nick sir I'm sure waiting on a similar report to drop on ogn and Nobby but hopefully there's still holding out hope on that one Jimmy Butler is probably even though he missed shoot around and then everybody on the Sixers is questionable so again just stay piped in to all of your NBA news feeds because these last few weeks of the season  everything is a mess a mess mess mess mess mess mess mess mess mess it's a messy mess and it's disastrous and we're not gonna have any information on anything until late is humanly possible so just get yourself geared up and ready to make moves where you have to  all right let's see what anybody Quick Check of the chat room just see if anybody's bringing up any players that I forgot to remember if you have questions that are of the streaming variety save those for the streaming show which I think we're going to try to go back to back this morning because it's still pretty early and I'm almost done with the first show already and I don't have to get on I think I got a phone call in like an hour so I think we can probably squeeze it in that other show as well ah would you play Brandon Clark or she may be made to in the back-to-back it's gonna have to be met too because Brandon's probably not gonna play in one half of the back-to-back  schedule based question sorry bud you got I need you to throw that in the streaming show this show is not about schedule  what's up Dan how are you doing in your 30 deep finals while it's a best of three weeks I lost the first week five to four I'm currently losing this week five to four  so close and yet so very very far  so close and yet so far  yeah Dr Ace team is a monster and it's got my number and this really sad part is that this is the week that I feel like I almost could have won but my team is somehow losing turnovers like Brooke Lopez having five turnovers was one of the worst things that could have ever happened to my 30 deep team yesterday I need my team to just have a day where they have none because that's my only hope  of winning I need to internals and a whole lot on to three pointers and both percentages and then that's the way I get there  good luck to me Steve's team is crazy Steve teams is a juggernaut my team is pretty damn good like I'm not in the finals by accident but I'm very much the underdog and I this I thought this week was gonna go better than I don't know where all the damn turnovers came from  brutal  uh still powering through this is air dunks my eighth cat Rodeo League I'm competitive in rebounds assistance steals who's the best pickup of this group if I'm attacking those categories rebounds assists and steals  Shimizu Kinard Jordan Goodwin Jaden or Jalen McDaniels or Dyson Daniels that's Dyson Daniels we got just Daniels not McDaniels uh rebounds assists and steals  probably it's probably good win if we know if he's playing and then the nice thing is then Rodeo if he doesn't play you don't like you can just use somebody else against the game's cap so it's good when would be my favorite  meteors the next one because he's probably gonna get like two or three assists and a nice collection of rebounds and steals  Kennard because he'll get you a cysts and the might just play enough to get you some rebounds and US steel and then with Daniel's great and steals but the other stuff is very much up in the air the drops TJ McConnell key on Ellis Andre Drummond  and Jabari Smith Jr is that who jsj is well you're not dropping bars with you and your and let's see if you're just looking for those key I would probably hold Keon Ellis  because with all the injuries out there he's getting more rebounds and assists a hold of Ellis of all the players on this list  Jabari Smith Jr is my favorite  and then you go  Ellis Goodwin  a drum  Drummond me to Drummond to Kinard  McConnell Daniels all right there you goofy  uh schedule based at yeah I don't want to do schedule baseball let's see I'm holding on to field goal presenter and all right let me turn this question into one that can apply to people that are doing something else uh I need field goal percent rebound Steals and blocks which guys do you like the most out of Cam Whitmore Trey Lyles he would Highsmith or she may be met to met you would be my favorite there because he's actually getting not even not feel goal percent all the he could but he's basically getting all of those with a shot he's getting three of them with a shot to get all four and the other guys aren't  so metu is the choice there if you're attacking those categories  all right we're gonna take about 10 15 minute break while I get this show posted then we'll come right back for a streaming show we're just gonna go back to back today thanks for watching everybody I'm Dan Vasquez at Dan best person over on Twitter I'm not even sure I gave a proper greeting on today's show but at any event again please subscribe please please please please please that's the stuff I need from you guys right now I really want you guys to hang out with me in the offseason oh question is Josh Hart going to play today I don't know  we'll find out later I'll find out when you guys find out 50/50  hopefully is my answer to that question but I don't know all right come on back around don't leave us we got one more show coming up in 10 minutes I will talk to you then
