welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  all right guys this is I believe officially  the last show  of the run-up season  we're going through some real draft results four of them to be exact to head to head teams that I build and Toto teams I built will see what we can take away from those all get to questions at the end of the show from folks hanging out in the chat room I know a few of you will roll in and I'll remind everybody that you can do that as we get a little deeper into the program welcome to the show first and foremost this is fantasy NBA today  a sports ethos presentation I am your host Dan best price it is a pleasure a distinct pleasure to have you along for  what in my eyes has been the most rewarding draft season  of episode that I think I've ever done  a couple reasons why before we get into the Nitty Gritty on this because I want to do some thank yous at the beginning of this show a reason number one  is that this is the first time we've had a full complement of draft content on our YouTube page and the response was  really amazing I didn't expect it to grow as fast as it did over the last  whatever it is I guess it's about two months or so month of September the YouTube page got about 38,000 views which I know isn't all that insane so far in October it's already around 80,000 and this is a thing that I didn't even really start messing around with consistently until like November of last year  so to see it take off to see  that we're now looking at a situation where  you know YouTube is gonna be probably 100,000 views in a month which I know not that much compared to like bigger Cheese on YouTube but you throw that on top of the large numbers on the traditional podcast channels and this is easily gonna be the biggest single month in the history of fantasy NBA today and there's just not gonna be anything closed when you sort of push everything together that we've done so thank you for that that's been absolutely incredible I am thrilled I am flattered I am blown away I don't want to say I'm humbled because that that gets turned around a lot I'm not humbled I'm actually just happy about it it's cool  other reason that this draft season's been so rewarding is that I feel like I've kind of settled into a rhythm I tried not to do too much extraneous stuff this year you know a lot of times I get pulled in about 55 different directions I tried not to do that this season so that made it a little bit easier on my brain and now we got to start to transition our minds to the next phase of things like basically as soon as this show is over then it's time to get to the next stuff so let's review four reel draft results that my team you'll get to see the names of my teams they couldn't think of a better way to do this than just to scroll through a couple of web pages so we'll go kind of low Tech on this one and basically the moment that this show ends we switched to in season mode  which is heavily on social media might I add so if you're watching this show and you're not following me over on Twitter it's at Danbury d a n b e s b r i s we do a lot of stuff over there as news breaks I want to try to get it to you as fast as humanly possible can't do that on a pod unfortunately you can get the Deep dive stuff and I definitely want you guys to keep watching and listening it's a big part of what I'm doing here but you can get stuff faster on social media so definitely come hang out with me over there and we'll have a show later on today with Derek ball who does the week ahead piece at sports ethos he has a master of assessing the week what teams have good scheduled bad schedules on low traffic days streaming options so we'll go through all that stuff in a second show later on today and then starting tomorrow we're basically a one show a day  program again unless I come up with some other idea and or a whole bunch of extra time that's the way it's going to be but let's go ahead and dive into day I want to make sure that the folks that are watching with us can actually enjoy let's see here where is the one that I wanted to go to they can enjoy the draft results in real time  this is a  starting with a rodeo gear so let's get the rodeo league on the board  again I couldn't really think of a better way to do it than to just share my Yahoo draft results screen so if you're on traditional pod channels and you're listening in and thinking dammit I'm missing something fun you're not really it's just a very small visual aid my team which is a very cleverly titled public Roto ninth  two because I like to label my teams by  what the setting is and what pick number I had because once you get into 78910 Cash leagues and they're all listed on that one big Yahoo board you want to be able to switch quickly to the one that you're thinking of so for me it's like all right I want to make sure I get to the rodeo League I want to make sure I get to the one where I started with Kevin Durant  then there's this one of course if you do like three Yahoo we're Rodeo's and you get the 9th pick in two of them it's sort of blows up your ability to catalog  or organized what your team's names are but let's not worry about that that's just something that happens to Dan I got 9th pick repeatedly I got 11th pick repeatedly this year and then in a couple weeks I managed to squeeze out like a one or a three and that was that was a nice little twist here so this league and we're gonna go through my picks basically and and how that All Shook out this was one of the weirdest drafts that I've ever been a part of I know people are like oh those Yahoo public prize legs they're just a bunch of jokers they're often not but this particular one I don't know what it was about this specific  50 dollar role League that is not a big one  the people were just so strange there were so many big swings getting taken in this one that had left the board in such a wild way for me that I couldn't believe it so let me just list off the pics and we'll go through them with some general thoughts kind of on each team as we go through all four I had the 9th pick in this one so you guys can do the math along with me or I'll just now it's at night I took Kevin Durant for Rodeo I think he's just a fantastic way to start your team I know that there's going to be fears about rest days and maybe those are legitimate although historically we've seen that when Kevin Durant is healthy he insists on Playing For Better or Worse let's just hope he doesn't have the one big you know sprained MCL that cost him seven or eight weeks and I think we'll get a much better number this year but again from a roto standpoint there are very few players in the NBA who have a more Roto friendly game than Durant the only category where he is sub-average against the league is steals at 0.7 last year instead of you know one would get him about League average he is a significant boost in blocks at one point four from your forward position he is one of the best percentages guys in the NBA at the in fact I think if you look at both percentages and assess them together I believe he is the best percentage of player in the NBA is this assist we're at five last season there's no reason to think those don't come stay relatively constant on a team with two very good scores rebounds will stay somewhat constant especially with DeAndre and gone so I don't answer my even go up depending on what you think nirk does two threes maybe that comes down a little  29 Points maybe that comes down a little as well but just amazing across the board and so a really nice way to start your Roto team  I like Kyrie Irving at 16 and you guys will notice that Kyrie Irving is probably the guy ended up on the largest number of my fantasy teams and I'm honestly okay with that you know it  the dude's a little bit of a clown at times and he's in and out of lineups for all sorts of goofball reasons but from a fantasy standpoint getting him at 16 or deeper which I think you'll probably see in some upcoming drafts is a damn steal  he was number nine on a per game basis last year largely playing alongside a Kevin Durant or a luka doncic he was a top 10 player alongside Luca down the stretch and Lucas dealing with a calf issue that's been going on for months and isn't just going to magically go away so I'd expect him to miss 15 to 20 games and even if Kyrie misses 15 to 20 himself  the game numbers are gonna be so good they'll counterweight whatever you lose in his you know 18 missed games this year  and Kyrie like Durand is very close to a positive impact guy in almost every category 2  especially from a point guard slot where he is eligible point guard shooting guard he's a positive fuel goal percent guy great free throw shooter steals good blocks very good for a guard at point eight assists are fine and if you pair that together I've got this sort of like kind of okay start to assist my team's a little low on rebounding but good threes five between those good scoring between those two guys like from a roto standpoint you couldn't ask for a much better well-rounded start  and this is one thing's got crazy because you know you got the ninth pick so I'm coming up at number 33 in the third round I didn't think there was any chance I was gonna get my late second round Target  but I had to do it Kawhi Leonard was still there at number 33 I've got three guys that are intense intense injury situations but I also if you look at base like how these guys played when they were healthy last year Kevin Durant was number four I don't know why I said it all weird when he was healthy last year then he got not healthy and Kauai Leonard took his spot at number four in per game ranks and Kyrie Irving was between six and 10 in per game ranks the entire game season I have my top three guys are all possible top seven per game fantasy producers I don't even care that there's a significant amount of overlap in what they're good at because I still don't have a an assists Maven I still don't have a great rebounder but my team is beastly in field goal percent free throw percent steals scoring threes are good assist are decent without a point guard so far turnovers are weirdly low considering I have three really really really good fantasy players and now all I gotta do is fill around the gaps as I figured  and then it got back to me at number 40 and another one of my early third round targets was still there and Freddie Van Fleet who I realized doesn't really fit this team all that well but I want to point out again the second half of last year I know that van Glee going to Houston is not gonna be the same as van bleed in Toronto but the second half of last season Freddie Van fleet was number 12 on a per game basis despite shooting 40 and a half percent from the field and look I don't actually care that his field goal percent stinks because my other guards and wings that I've drafted so far have unbelievably High feel goal percent and can more than handle whatever van fleet was bringing their way  the blend of Kevin Durant and Kyrie are Kevin Durant and Kauai takes care of Van Lee so now I've got call it an average fuel goal percent team still without a big man  now I took care of a sis my steals are through the roof my threes are in good shape my free throw percentage is nearly Untouchable and I thought all right look I'll take a big man in my next slot that'll take care of the rest of the stuff and then lo and behold it pick number 57 James Harden was still on the damn bored and I know that he's in a state of Purgatory right now  trying to get traded and I know that means we might miss a few weeks of hard and at the beginning of the year but wherever he goes he's going to be a big time assists guy and he has good defensive stats and he's gonna score and he's gonna hit threes and now my free throw percentage is ridiculous in this league and the only thing I don't have is a big man and so all of a sudden now I'm looking at this team I'm like look this team's not that great at block shots Kevin Durant is fine Kyrie actually decent from a guard spot Kauai gets you a half Freddy gets you have hard and gets you have all of my guards are actually pretty good at shop blocking but I don't have a big man yet so that's a problem  surely in the sixth round I'm going to take a big and that was where I was sitting until Bradley Beal was still on the board  at 64 and I couldn't not do it  so now my team has some problems feel good percentages guy again kind of doubling up a little bit on what some of the other guys do on this club but I could not pass him over there at this point my team is B is just an absolute monster in scoring threes are pretty good I know Beale doesn't take that many and neither does Durant but and neither does kawaii but like between the lot of them you're getting you know one and change two and then Kyrie and bleeding Harden are taking care of the rest steals are great cysts are great free throw percentage is insane I need rebounds I need feel goal percent again a little bit and then block shots would all be helpful so sure enough in the seventh round I just took back to back big that went Mark Williams and Clint capela nothing fancy there now my team has the big man stats that they were lacking before and now I can pretty much take who I want down the stretch of this draft I went John Collins at 105 the Anthony Melton at 112 Trey Murphy at 129 is a stash because Yahoo leaks have three IL slots and I figured why the hell not I'm  a little bit low on threes  b-ball Paul read it 136 was still on the board and Kyle Lowry at 1:53 because in Roto you just take this three weeks of Kyle Lowry before his body falls apart at a few assists at the end whatever Paul Reed gives me some hopefully big man stats towards the end of the draft as well the thing about Road always you don't have to play all 13 of your guys in Yahoo leagues the games cap is 82 so my last few picks are heavily guys and I'm like look I need these guys to be good per game stuff I want them to be filling in because inevitably my top five or six picks are going to miss some ball games Bradley Beal in fact is already been ruled out for the season opener later on tonight but I have a really really well-rounded team now if Paul Reed gives any blocks at all that category goes to being a strength all of a sudden I actually think that if this team has even a modicum of Health they just bought race the league  and so that was team won  I do want to share the next Rodeo team if at all possible let's see here what can I do next how do I do this YouTube how do I do this  I think it was that the one  I don't know which one is which it's hard to tell which one is which sorry everybody I'll figure this out  uh doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  you know what hang with me here I know a good way to figure this out if I scroll that down just a tiny bit that can get that one out of the way okay this is a way that I can figure this out that was a head-to-head League that'll be up there okay we'll figure this out on the fly so the other rotol one that's the one I wanted to share okay here we go so the other Roto League I wanted to share was the one where I had third pick and that was this one there we go  let's get that bad boy up on the screen so we got the visual aid sorry to those listening after the fact this is the other Yahoo wrote a league I did  I was blessed with a third pick and you know you'll notice there are a couple of overlaps on this one as you look at the board  do I have some regrets on this one yes a little bit more than the last one but I used to think it's a pretty good team so third pick I want shade girl just Alexander yoga and bead were off the board I was debating between Shea and Halliburton and I thought you know what I'll go with the scoring early because I tend to have an issue with scoring later in drafts so I wanted to make sure I got the guy that was good to put up the really big Point totals figured I would deal with assists as we worked our way through but then it was time to start just taking guys that I liked the most and so there again at 22 in this draft was Kyrie Irving who in my eyes I mean that's like you have to on the road outside I get it per game or a head-to-head that can be a little bit difficult but Kyrie Irving played 60 games last year and by totals he was still number 14  if he gets to 62 63 64 games played he's an easy first rounder by totals as well and so getting him at 22 was a total no-brainer the pairing with shea Guild just Alexander is a little bit unusual but you do get good blocks and good percentages and good steals out of guards in this spot assists are probably a little bit low considering I have two guards on my team rebounds are fine both of these guys rebound relatively well actually for the guard spot threes are a little bit low that's because of Shea so that's what's kind of going through my head after two picks  third pick in this one I went Kawaii again and that's something you guys will see as a theme for me on the Roto side I don't mind the missed games I want the guys that are gonna go full lunatic mode  on a per game side  and Kauai is that again I get boost in steals I have three guys that block shots relatively well for their positions rebounds are still low assists are still a little bit low and that's the stuff that I'm starting to look at threes are not all that great either but percentages are outstanding and everything else is kind of taking care of so now I'm thinking all right what do I need as we go forward I need threes  I need boards I need a cysts and I probably need  a like some blocks from a big man  the boards and the blocks in my mind I assume I can just take care of when I start to get big men  now again I have good shot blocking guards and wings so far Shay was one Kyrie was almost one Kawaii was 0.7 once he got healthy that's actually pretty good to have about 2.6 ish blocks out of those three guys and averaging you know point eight point nine blocks per game and I don't even have a big man on the board yet so that's to me not a bigger issue the assists the threes the the boards are the bigger issue right now  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your

between them I went hard in a little bit earlier I think that I normally would have wanted to but it does take care of the assists and the threes part once he lands at some place so I'm gonna need to make sure this team kind of stays afloat in those two categories until hardened comes back but once he does he takes care of that James will bring down the field goal percent a little bit but to me it's not a big issue because Kawaii Kyrie and Shay are all very good infield goal percent out of guard spots once I start getting any big men on this team that's gonna take care of itself hardens another guard who blocks some shots  so  I'm in this kind of weird in between like Harden was half a block last year uh on top of Shea who was one Kawaii once he got healthy was 0.7 Kyrie was 0.8 so I'm at three blocks a game out of those four guys so 0.75 which is kind of enough to be League averaged to even tiny bit above League average in that category and I am still without a big man so what that allowed me to do coming back in the 5th round was to draft a big man who was more rebounds and field goal percent focused and less focused on blocks and that was DeAndre who I took it 51 he was 56 is ranked last year he's gonna get to do more in Portland than he did in Phoenix he's big time positive and field goal percent he's not gonna impact my field my free throw percent negatively not that it matters because I have Shea and James Harden on this team so I have free throw percent to spare button was also a point eight blocks per game guide that probably goes up to about one when you assume as minutes probably go from 30 to like 30 to in Portland he'll probably score  close to 20 points so probably get between 10 and 11 rebounds a game he took care of some things that this team badly needed without punching any holes in the club uh sixth round cam Johnson was still on the board at 70 he was not a guy that I thought I was gonna take their because I felt like Hardin had taken care of the threes but cam gives a three-pointers boost again another he's small forward power forward eligible doesn't hurt field goal percent much while adding three pointers so I'm keeping the percentage is strong he gives steals which I didn't really need at this point but I do know that I'm gonna need another big man so I dealt with that on the way back and I went yaka Pirtle who's finally now gonna put a negative into free throw percent he was at 60% of game last year but on a between Shea and hardened and Kauai  and Kyrie not to I mean he didn't take as many but I was a 90% alive last year my free throw percent was through the roof I mean my team was shooting like 88% of the foul line so I have no problem with throwing Pearl in the mix he's not gonna barely put a dent in this team that's still top of the bag in free throw percent and now I feel good about my field goal my blocks  my rebounds are in better shape and I can kind of go with who do I like the rest of the way team was good and everything now at 94 I went Michael Porter Jr mostly because I just think he beats that rank I don't know that he necessarily provided what my team needed here but I don't care you know good percentage is again threes scoring some rebounds not much defensive stats but my D stats are fine Jalen Duren at 99 I think he's a decent value there not again I wasn't hunting what he was doing necessarily but he was still on the board for me at 100 and I thought why the hell not I'll get strong and rebounds now I'll get strong and blocks I'll get very strong and feel goal percent  yes my free throw now is coming back towards the pack a little bit but again like the guys that on my team that are good for free throw are not just little bit good they are maximum good and then my guys down the stretch I just you know I took a few shots here my Conley at 18 I think he sits around the top 100 and we'll give a little assists boost to a team that probably still needs a little bit in that department because Harden was the very good one and he's going to be out to start the year Paul Reed at 1:23 I think is always worth the late round flyer Kobe white at 142 as a decent shot of being dropped and Rodeo but I went with him there and then said Duke Bay at 147 if he gets enough usage which is a big maybe then he could be sort of like a poor man's version of Cam Johnson and then if they're both doing the same stuff then perhaps I could move one and and keep the other so those are the two Roto drafts so far and thoughts on them please do again mid-show reminder to hit that thumbs up button and  subscribe to the YouTube page subscribe to the traditional podcast feed and please please please do take a second to find me over on social media at Dan best briefs we're going to be  starting to do so much stuff over there if you thought I was doing a lot during the run-up to the season you are wrong there is so much more that'll happen as the season goes things like beel being ruled Out Boy on Bugattis being ruled out for four weeks you want that stuff and you want me to tell you what it means quickly the way we do that is over on the social media feed all so let everybody know again if you're watching live because the last time I said this there were like four of you and now they're 30 something of you watching live as we go that number always goes up  use the chat room use the YouTube chat if you got a good question I'll answer it at the end of the show that'll be part of our stuff every day throughout the season  okay next thing is let's get into the head-to-head results  let's see which one do we want to do first  head to head I had an 11th pick  and I had a first pick ah yeah that's a fun one which one do we want to do first 11th pick or first pick let's go first pick because so far we've done  a ninth pick and a third  I guess 11th and 1st they're both things that you guys haven't seen before well whatever it doesn't matter we're gonna we're gonna do the  whichever one streamyard decided to pull up first pick there we go you guys will notice that this league is not a Yahoo public league and so you actually get to see one of my team names which is Richard Belding and if anybody gets that reference immediately I love you if you don't he was the principal on Saved by the Bell and my team logo is very much a picture of Dennis Haskins face  so this one I went I the first pick so obviously I went Nicole yokich right out of the Chute let me move my face so it doesn't cover any of the pics their Nicola yokich was the first pick on this one at that point you're not making any critical life decisions on you know what you're doing with the rest of your team I know when you have yoke which right out of the Chute there's an inclination to say okay what am I punting and  I don't think you can definitively decide that until after you see who's available to you at 24 25 and so in this particular draft mikal Bridges was still on the board at 24 one of the things about Nicola yokich well one of the things about this particular League this league only has one IL slot instead of three so you have to draft a little bit safer and you'll notice that my picks are a little bit safer in this one then in the rotor leaks you just saw because they're just there isn't a place to stash dudes once they get hurt  the other thing is when you happen to call the yolk itch and that first pick you just don't screw it up after that  your job is to not tank your team in your next two or three picks and so that's all so kind of where I was coming from with this one so pick number two Michael Bridges was still on the board at 24 per game ranking he probably is around 25 this year but by totals we know that he's a guy who plays now nagging injuries don't tend to hurt him all that much he plays through them assuming we can skate through without any Big Time season ending stuff pairing Bridges with yolk it I'm hoping I get a lot of guys that play a lot of games between those two dudes and that's a really good way to start your league Bridges all so one of the higher scoring players available at the end of the second round you know once he went to Brooklyn he was a 25 plus per game guy he was at 26 ish with the Nets so that's good A lot of the guys getting drafted at 24 are not that high unless you take a risk like someone like a kawaii Leonard yeah he'll be 25 points but is he gonna play  and this also answers the question of what am I punting with yokich and kind of takes threes off the board  because you know if Jimmy Butler was still there I probably would have gone Butler it was a little riskier  but a better per game guy than Bridges but also doesn't need threes so if I if Butler was there I probably end up hunting threes Bridges was there so now I'm thinking probably I'm out on blocks I don't have to be  but probably because after these two picks I have a team that's okay in scoring not great because you could just in a big score my team is still very good in rebounds good and assist because he'll catch a good and steals because both those guys can do that good in percentages  and very weakened blocks to get a big man who doesn't block that much and then along with a wing who doesn't block all that much was Bridges about half a block a game like it's not completely cooked but I don't really want to blow up the things that I'm good at so I go Desmond Bane in the next one and I'm pretty high on beIN actually this year higher than most by totals by the way down the stretch last year he was number 18 and that was with John Moran around a fair amount I I just I think Bane has a shot to be inside the top 20 on a per game basis with no John Moran route for that first 25 games I think he'll be inside the top 30 after that so again I'll get some good scoring steals are okay threes is another boost I can continue to have good percentages by taking guards that are not bad in field goal percent  rebounds and assists are fine if on Spectacular Now putting a couple of guys that you know what was bridges down the stretch  four and a half boards and 2.7 assists those numbers are not all that blisteringly high but he in Bain cover up any free throw issue that yoke hitch might have passed through if you'll go present is still well above average because of what you'll get does by himself and so that's where I am after three picks I think guys that are going to be out there a lot  pick 48 it got back to me I had a few choices here I figured I want DeAndre Aiden and that's again you the second Team league that I have gone with him and he's not to do that I'm necessarily targeting on a day-to-day basis but he made a lot of sense for what this team is trying to do which is a punt blocks big team and DeAndre ayton is a big that doesn't block that many shots not that he's like completely anemic there but it's definitely not one of his strong suits down the strategy blocked about a shot per game in Phoenix again that's I think what you can expect out of him in Portland but he's a big man that gives me rebounds very strong field goal percent I think I'll get some scoring out of him in a way that wasn't really a positive last year and so now I address an issue I get scoring out of a big man and other teams taking big men almost from this point on are not getting scoring out of them  unless you can consider design on a big which I guess you can  8 is kind of the last big man who's expected to score around 20 points per game  that's it because after this the big men that are going are you know guys like Mark Williams and Rudy gobert and click apella and on these guys are all good but they're good because of other reasons so I wanted to make sure that my scoring was going to be good and I think I could get wing and guard scoring still another two or three rounds after this so I got my big scoring out of the way so I didn't take the big hit on that that other teams are probably going to take later in their drafts but that also left me extremely weak again in three pointers because I have two big men so far so I went Zach LaVine at 49 I went with another Wing who's good at percentages  uh my steals have now weakened a tad so that's something that I'm going to be looking at later in this draft because Levine is not a big steals Guy Bane is not a huge steals Guy yokich is a good steal his guy from the big man spot and bridges is as well but those two guys are not going to be able to carry it I get good scoring again here this helps Shore up threes assists are starting to become a small issue for this team despite Nicola yokich so I had something that I have to be aware of as well not that you know Bane and Levine they'll get four to five something like that I'm Not Dead in the Water there but it's gonna be something that I want to address because I don't want to lose this when I start a team with Nicolas yolk at that feels like a little bit of a waste of a key Advantage however  when it got back to me at 72 I had a few choices here I felt like threes was still something I wanted to deal with points with something I wanted to make sure that I was still strong at so I went Klay Thompson and Mark helps so threes big-time threes and scoring out of one some scoring but good assists and steals out of the other and I can continue to have okay percentages because I don't think Clay is going to be a complete tank job their faults is definitely not going to be a tank job their false doesn't help free throws but all of my other guys including my big man are relatively strong and free throws so that's still fine I do feel like I want more Steals and I want more assists and I felt like there was one spot where I I could possibly give up a little bit of juice and that's why coming back to me at 96 I went Marcus Smart who again I don't know that he necessarily beats this mark on a per game ranked probably does while John Moran is out once he comes back I don't know  Smart's gonna be my first Real mess in the field goal percent department but you're probably gonna get five plus assists maybe six you're gonna get big steals more three-pointers I'm trying to shore up these things that I know  you'll get is not as strong at like threes and I think I've done that and at this point I'm starting to think okay  where are my problems spots  but also what do I need to make sure that I definitely win because this is a head to head Lee and I feel like I can win assists most days with false smart and then biggest out of yoke itch  I feel like I can win threes now with smart Klay Thompson Zach LaVine Bane and Mikhail Bridges  but I want to make sure that I lock in a few things so field goal percent should be something I win when you start with yolk itch so I went Jaylen during at 97 all so should lock in rebounds during 8 and yokich three guys that should probably all be 10 plus rebounds a game a Duran's free throw percent is a little bit of a concern but I am hoping that my team can handle it that's kind of this like okay if I don't win free-throw percent it's not the end of the world because I don't want to make sure that I have my five and now at this point I'm going with pics that I think have some upside so D Anthony Melton is I think is an upside play he fits this build Zach Collins is an upside play that may or may not fit this build Emmanuel quickly definitely fits this build as someone who potentially could score although the next didn't extend him so maybe that doesn't mean he's playing his much and five to turn him into a streaming slot that's fine Christian would also kind of a flyer play that probably gets punted but you know big man who can space the floor a little bit get some rebounds does some scoring those are things that I want out of my big guys and then tht at the very last pick could actually blow up this build so there's a kind of a high probability that he ends up back on the waiver wire or as trade bait because he's bad at  two things that I want to win which are the percentages and but still at 160 we saw him put up some pretty big numbers in the preseason I thought that was sort of a worthy risk to take but the one thing that you want to look at at the end of your head draft and I was using our draft tracker at ethos excuse me which I I turn off after the tenth round because um like these are guys that might be on and off of your team and so you're not necessarily getting the best the most accurate depiction  after the tenth round is complete so right after DeAnthony Melton side the last pick of the 10th you want to check and make sure that your team is strong enough to rely when five to six categories every week on the head-to-head side  and so at that point I knew the team was very good in steals because I had Melton smartphones and bridges and then yolk itch out of the big man's spot and by the way I think Jalen Duren averages close to a steal a game from the center spot he showed himself to be pretty good steals big in the second half last year once he started to get playing time so then pretty sure I'm winning steals  I'm pretty sure I'm winning boards between Duran yokich and Aiden that's a pretty hefty Trio in your first nine picks at 30 some odd rebounds per game out of those guys and then you know you hope that Marcus Mark doesn't put too big of a hole in that I feel pretty good about assist maybe not over with 10  Bain will get you four or five well guys out smart it's going to get probably six faults is gonna get six to seven Lavino get you five melt and maybe four something like that it's not outstanding it would have been nice if I could have gotten one more guy that was up in that reliable like seven and a half eight range but they just weren't there when I needed them but that's a pretty good one field goal percent between durin 8 and yokich very strong and then the fact that my early guards like Bane and Levine and bridges are not bad at field goal I think that keeps that in pretty good shape and then believe it or not I think this team reliably wins turnovers which is pretty crazy considering you starting with a highest guy but you'll catch is my only High turnover guy Bridges is not that high Bain is not that high venous not that high Thompson folks smart I don't know what smart it's going to do there I don't have those any other like big cough it up kind of guy on this team so that's kind of weird isn't it that that's something that I ended up being very strong at  and I already forgot what five things I said but I also think this team's going to be pretty good and free throws because during really the only negative false is kind of a neutral but and maybe smart you call him a neutral but Thompson's positive leans a positive Bane's a big positive bridges of positive yoke which is small positive that once a decent one probably win that maybe a little more than 50% of the time I think I went threes 50% of the time I probably wouldn't points maybe about 50% of the time and then blocks I probably won't win at all although maybe I'll fall into one if Duran or Zach Collins or Christian Wood puts up a few here it's not really a Target but if you accidentally win it like 20% of the time it's not the end of the world so I feel very strongly about five I think my team's pretty good in three others and then at one so it's just kind of weird punt where like I get it maybe you want to be outstanding and six but I think in the regular season a lot of head-to-head League's you don't want to be bad at three you want to give yourself a chance against a team that maybe is suffering through some injuries or whatever to win eight to one or seven to two that's how you get to the top of the board and secure that first round by and so that's why I built the team the way that I did  we have one more team I want to go over and unfortunately because I am you know running all of this stuff by myself it's hard for me to do it all on the fly but I think I can do this here let's get this one up on the screen for the YouTubers  and I think that should do it there we go this one's a public league once again  and once again I ended up with a late pick with number 11 and this one is a scarier draft the first thing you think when you look at it is damn Dan that's a scary scary start you are absolutely right but I kind of had to do it the nice thing about public leaks on Yahoo is they have three IL spots so for me I'm just gonna pray that my early guys are not all heard at the same time  and frankly I don't know that I really like the results from this draft but I'm gonna go through it anyway this was the first draft I used our draft tracker tool for and so I don't think I was ready for the way that it assessed teams as it was moving that was something that I learned after using it once or twice  but I went Kevin Durant at 11 because I just I couldn't bring myself to do the lamelo ball punch field goal build right out of the Chute I wanted to start with someone that could sort of open up the page for me to do a bunch of other stuff and then Anthony Davis at 14 this team is is so very risky but if those guys hit then that start is extraordinary at a few key things  pretty good at scoring not very good at 3 pointers very good at rebounds out of the first two not very good at Ace but whatever power forward and Center is my first two picks so I'll have to deal with that later steals good  I mean I'd say very good actually because you get points 7 and then like one out of big men and I haven't even added a guard yet blocks yeah Mondo field goal percent Mondo free throw in the middle not bad and then over is actually very good so I have six categories that this team is extremely extremely strong at and then even steals you could almost put in the good side because as soon as I had a garden to the mix they're gonna be very good  I don't have another pick until 35 and I'm just looking and thinking okay I had to get a guard I have to get a guard if I don't get a guard here I'm going to be in real trouble and then I got two back-to-back and so this team went  from six extraordinary categories to Crazy balance because I went Freddie Van Fleet and Darius Garland at 35 and 38 and now the team is like  pretty good at free throws  pretty good at assists pretty good at threes  pretty good at boards but not great anymore I really not that great at boards  this team became okay at everything  and that's not really what you're necessarily trying to do on a head-to-head side but I you know you we've seen a million times how hard it is to rack up a cysts late so I figured I'd take two and then make a call on what direction my team wanted to go a little later I went Jared Allen at 59 who now pivots this team back into a Little Bit Stronger on the big man side  I was all over the map here cam Johnson at 62 because I could tell this team was going to be weakened three pointers if I didn't go that direction this team ended up building a bit more like a roto Club  and I want Michael Porter Jr at 83 and Mark L faults at 86 like I don't even know what the hell I was doing at this point I started to think all right I'm just gonna build a balanced team and lean into some sort of strengths at the year goes on Draymond Green at 1:07 who's out to start the year so annoying their time lord at 110 mostly just because I thought he was kind of a value at 110 Josh Hart at 1:31 I managed to get Paul Reed at 1:34 I like that one a lot and then Malik monk at 155 what the hell is this team I don't know  this is the one team I drafted where I look back at the end and I was like I don't know what the hell this team is they are this team is pretty good at everything  this team would be very good in Roto but in head-to-head I don't know what this means am I gonna lose four to five to four every single week and my gonna win eight to one one week and then lose seven to the next all of those things seem very much on the table for this club so what likely happens is I see how this team does for a month and I'll do some streaming probably at the end you know if if Josh Hart loses his job to Dante even chenzo or if Malik monk isn't doing enough Off the Bench to fit this team's build somebody will get rotated in because it's important to use your actual pickups in head-to-head you want to be streaming a little bit maybe not first week but a little bit  and you know at a glance you figure a team with Robert Williams and Paul Reed and Jared Allen and Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant maybe lean a little bit more towards a big man stuff and maybe that's the direction I go is to lean a little bit more into the big man stuff and move a guy like a cam Johnson or a Michael Porter Jr and say all right maybe this team isn't gonna score very well maybe that's a little bit of a punt points team because Kevin Durant is kind of the only guy on the club that I look at and go oh this guy's a good score so there's a lot of directions that I could go as the season moves on I think I have a lot of pretty good players on this team I just think that they're fit for Head to Head didn't make a whole lot of sense and so we'll kind of go back to the drawing board and this is a team where you can tweak it to get it right look at what you're good at look at what you're great at look at what you're slightly suboptimal look at what you're terrible at and start to lean into strengths as the season goes along and this is a good example of why you don't necessarily have to punt on draft night to still have success and I'll keep you updated on how this club goes as the season goes along and now let's do a few questions from the chat room as well and a reminder to please like rate subscribe all that good stuff Asin says Chris Paul or Markle false nine cat head-to-head I probably go  mmm the head-to-head part yeah you probably go faults he probably plays more games than Chris Paul Roto I go Chris Paul their tyus Jones or Jared Allen Head to Head I'll go Jared Allen there  Victor says hi Dan I had my last draft last night I got him beat it five and was gonna go for more blocks as I was targeting JJ but lamelo felt me in the second round was either right pick to take yeah I'm fine with that I mean embed lamelo is a  pretty balanced start that's like the old school way of playing fantasy basketball where you go big small and your team is now pretty good at everything  not terrible at anything not outstanding it much maybe scoring  and pretty good at a lot of stuff and that gives you  a lot of options in the next few rounds because you can kind of lean in any direction  a son says any randoms on the waivers you're keeping an eye on for week one I will get into that on  the next show probably this afternoon or at the latest tomorrow's show because Wednesday's got the big board and we'll do our look ahead part of the program but I'm not going to do that today because I still got a few more shows in between Sammy says is Tilghman a good pickup for the rest of the year well he sat around the edge of the top 100 when Adams went down last season so  sort of  is the answer if you need a big man who steals but doesn't block shots field goal percent rebound steals that's what Tilghman will get you Memphis is gonna mix and match a little bit but ultimately you know when they go up against a front Court that's not super duper tiny he'll probably see high 20s and minutes and in those games he'll put up you know top 90 top 100 kind of value so the answer is probably to this question  Lucas says do you know if the fan tracks public money wrote a league have a games cap by default I can't find it in the rules you know what I actually don't know Lucas they should  and then he says oh it's a weekly lineup League yeah so okay so if it's weekly line up like you don't need a games cap because you're making your decisions at the front end of the week you're going to probably try to maximize games played by playing guys who have four games and have two or three and so then the cap is sort of imposed by what happens the rest of that week  young asks Chet versus poor Singas in Roto I'll go poor Singas you know chip might be to beat him in games played by four or five but I just I'm going to go with the trustworthy guy I think Chad has a really nice here you saw him on The Dan Bass Pro sold man squad but I'll go with Old Reliable here Voss asks buddy hield or bennedict mathurin have both in Roto and category who should I be leaning to start I think I'd probably start buddy hield  mathurin  we need to see him take a step forward let's frame let's let's frame it like that um  math or in last year all he did was score and be a good free throw guy there was literally nothing else going on with his Fantasy game if he takes some steps forward and rebounding if you score more than that's a chance that he gets out in front but we saw late last year but he held in 2426 minutes off the bench was still well inside the top 100 so that's buddy hield to me  George or Jorge asks why is Clarkson usually falling into the 11th or later rounds at isn't it hard to find points in free throw percent in late rounds  yeah but all so you know I think Utah is going to start to get younger so I don't know that Clarkson necessarily is going to get to do exactly what he did last year  but the issue with Jordan Clarkson isn't that  he doesn't score or doesn't get free throw percent because he does do those things the issue with Clarkson is that  his free throw percent is not as good as you think it is he shot 81 and a half percent last year so it's actually a very small positive the issue with Clarkson is that he really is only a positive for your team in points and threes negative and rebounds big negative and steals for a guard at one at a half he doesn't block shots his field goal percent is a negative his turnovers are weirdly High  he has I would argue five six things he's quite bad at  so sure if you need 21 points and can suffer through the dings in all that other stuff yeah that's fine but there was a reason he finished at number 184  per game last year and Nine Cats because they're more things bad than good  Sac accountant Jeremy Sohan was dropped in my 10 team or should I burn number one waiver price know ten team or I don't I don't actually think he's a 10 team play unless he fixes his percentages and I also think the Spurs are going to be rotating him around I know he's starting as their point guard but you'll see Trey Jones get a lot of time there so no I wouldn't burn away her on him in a 1 0  in the second round how lucky am I and how jealous are you are you me being ridiculous  that's crazy so fifth pick would get you what 19  so the 19th pick in the next I didn't screw up the numbers amazing start and beaten Dame very jealous  razor says who would you pair Halliburton with at picks 17 and a head-to-head nine cat  unless you're punting points you're going to want to get somebody in that second round that scores a bunch  so that's the way you want to look at that um  but I wouldn't look at it necessarily from just like a strict pairing standpoint because if you get too focused on that you'll forget to actually draft a really good player so please don't spend too much time hovering over the pairing for Halliburton because a lot of guys in the late second round are great basketball players and you're just gonna want those dudes late second round guys mid to late second round guys Donovan Mitchell I like a lot Bridges Bane JJ Jimmy Butler  if Kyrie Falls that far so I wouldn't worry too much about the pairing thing I would think okay what do I have after I take my favorite second round guy and then start to think do you lean into it or away from a as you get to the third fourth round at that point  Lucas says did you do any auction draft rotal leeks this year I did not I'm not a big auction guy and I told everyone the following statement once my children don't need my attention then I will start doing auction drafts because they're longer and you cannot walk away from your machine and I can't really do it during the normal business day because I'm doing all this other stuff for these pods and for sports ethos  and so if I'm just like laser focused on an auction draft for two hours in the middle of a work day no that's not gonna work I don't have two hours where I can't be focused on something else on a weekend nope that's not gonna work but snake draft I can do because done Yahoo those take about an hour 10 minutes you can walk away between picks uh if you're near a turn and that's just the way I have to slot it in my life right now so long answer to a short question no  Wayne last question then we'll wrap it up at the 53 minute Mark hey Dan if you're rostering poodle and during together we'll have Butler and shabby enough to cover the free throw percent hit  um okay so I mean we can go a little bit on last year now it's impossible to know if those two guys do the same or less they are both extraordinarily good positive impact free throw guys the answer if they if these guys repeated like a turtle repeats what he did last year Jimmy Butler kind of wipes him out by himself hurdles a slight bit more of a negative than Butler was a positive last year so that would put you just a little bit below average Jalen Duren let's assume that he does about the same damage to your free throw that yaka Pearl does and she would be a bigger positive than that so the answer is yes you'd be a little bit above average  it's funny to have Shea and Butler and not be a great foul shooting team it feels kind of like you're wasting it a little bit so I would say get one more good free throw shooter in like the third fourth fifth round and then you can go purdle endure and you'll be pretty well above average so you're you're on your way there I would say one more guy would get you to spot where that becomes better than like a 640 proposition  we got another show coming up later on today that'll be a 2:30 Pacific Time With Derek ball the week ahead we'll do a weekly preview show I'll also talk about the two games coming up on the docket tonight and start to settle
