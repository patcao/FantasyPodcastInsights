news today actually it's not a great day for streaming and I'll show you why here as we throw the premium streaming calendar up on the screen the reason we don't do this every day for the entire season is I'm not giving you the streaming chart for the entire year you gotta pay for an NBA pass to get that most of the season and all so why I zoom in because I can't have you guys look at everything out in front and go get an NBA fantasy pass if you want to see this thing for the whole season but I'm giving you kind of a bonus here at the end of this year probably won't put this on the screen next season but I do think it's worth getting one of the many reasons to get a fantasy pass but right now you guys get to check it out  here's the issue today it's Tuesday March the 12th those that are watching again you can see the calendar on your screen but those are listening I'm gonna explain it all anyway here I start with the teams where you should be considering dropping players  the reason I do that is because it's great in all the find players to add  but you got to know who you're going to dump to get them and frankly I believe that's the more important part because the ads  you want to be doing at the basically the very last second when you get an injury report on a specific team you'll know who's in who's out and kind of what you're gonna get out of your volume streamer  the drops  it's great you can plan that way in advance provided no one on your team is a late scratch that's another reason to wait until the end then you get your hierarchy so the hierarchy of drops is late scratches because you don't want 0  I guess slightly longer term injuries would would kind of come before late scratches and then right under that would be teams that have horrible schedules  the teams that have horrible schedules today Tuesday March the 12th  are the Lakers who have the terrible schedule yes yesterday and they still have the worst schedule today yesterday they were three games in 11 days today they're three games in 10 days that remains the worst including just two games the rest of this week and they don't even start next week with the game for a couple of ball game days it's the Lakers are your drops anybody Fringe on them three and 11 you kind of had to drop everyone three and ten becomes a little bit more palatable  for you know someone like an Austin Reeves who's been pretty good lately actually but you're definitely not picking up anybody Beyond Reeves and D-Lo  the Cavaliers have pivoted into a bad schedule after they had a good one last week calves have two games over six days the Warriors have two games over six days and the Minnesota Timberwolves also have two games over six days but one of those games is tonight so it'd be kind of dumb to drop a timber wolf tonight when they play tonight  because starting tomorrow they have the worst schedule the rest of the week Lakers at that point have two games over five days and three games over what did I say nine I guess but it's all so three games over like six at that point because a lot of the bad stuff for the Lakers is on the back end of it not to say that their schedule gets good but Minnesota will have the worst schedule starting tomorrow one game over five days  but for now today they don't because they played tonight they're in LA to take on the Clippers so you're probably not dropping a Minnesota player tonight if you manage to hold them this far you can go ahead and drop them tomorrow so your friendship players on these clubs for Cleveland it would be like uh oh I don't know like a Georges niang um if you had picked up Sam Merrill  uh I mean even Isaac akoro is he's been good but he hasn't been good enough  the thing you could also do with Cleveland is hold through tomorrow and that's the same thing with golden state so it comes down a little bit to whether or not you like the player on those teams  and the reason I bring that up because normally if you know if you're looking at a Cleveland or Golden State and you're like oh two games over the last six days of this week I got to get off of this sinking ship because  typically over six days you can find a bunch of options of players that have four games  here's what things get a little bit complicated  the complicating factor for this week is that there's almost no options of players that have four games over the next six days it's extraordinarily Slim Pickens on the strong scheduling side  you guys know that when I'm doing this long streaming stuff one of our big targets is to try to add two games played over the length of a particular long Stream So if you're taking a warrior to drop over the next six days you're looking for someone who has four games to their two there are  I believe two teams  I mean triple check one thing yeah two teams  for Bridget just a brief moment I thought it might have been one but it's two teams that Clippers  and the Wizards are the two teams that have four games over the next six days  the good news is that both of these teams have Fringe level players on them  the Wizards are loaded up with them these days and we already have Rashawn Holmes listed out for tonight we already know a bunch of other guys in the Wizards have been out for a while so while that does open a few things up some of those players might already be rostered for the Clippers since Russell Westbrook went down that kind of opened things up for a Norman Powell who probably is already on a roster but then you also have an option like a Terrence Mann or if you wanted to go with the backup center like a Mason Plumlee or Daniel Tyson that's a pretty clunky other option there but Terence man makes a lot of sense  on the Wizards Corey kispert probably rostered but maybe not he would make a lot of sense bilali who I'm not a huge fan of in just sort of like overall fantasy appeal but for games over six days especially with all of these guys hurt he makes a lot of sense as well and should Landry shamet happen to resurface he would be your sort of one additional very large tear down from these other guys but you could be way up a creek because if those guys like if Terence man is already rostered because the Clippers are in the middle of a five-game and seven day stretch so he could have been picked up a couple days ago or let's say kiss bird is already roster you're basically looking at  Kula believe as kind of your only remaining choice  and maybe man is still out there I think Terence man is pretty lightly rostered because he hasn't been putting up eye-popping numbers and people sort of were willing to overlook the Clippers good schedule because he wasn't all that interesting and I get it he's not interesting but again five over seven for them was interesting for the Wizards four and six is interesting  the other paths you could choose require you to use you to use more roster moves which typically I don't want to advocate for on a Tuesday  the teams that have back-to-backs are the ones that then fall into that mix so the back-to-back teams are Indiana Memphis in Sacramento  by the way the reason the Clippers are a little bit better than the Wizards is that their back-to-back is midweek that Wizards back to back is at the end of the week so you have less flexibility there but they're pretty close either way you have to wait on it  Indie Memphis in Sacramento have a back-to-back today tomorrow okay that's fine and they all have some options on those teams as well like you know TJ McConnell we topping Andrews GG Jackson Lamar Stevens Kevin herder so like there are some Fringe level players and with Memphis you're looking for guys that are definitely gonna play in both of the back-to-backs but the problem is  if you use any moves yesterday and remember we had a bunch of teams that we wanted to abandon ship on yesterday  if you used moves on Monday  you really don't have moves to use today  one at the absolute most so like I move I use them there's a league I'm in where I have four moves I used one yesterday I'm willing to use one more today I do not want to be over two moves left  so that's another way to look at it like if you have a six move week  you could use four Monday and Tuesday to really load up on the front end most of us have four weakly moves and Yahoo that's the default other sites have kind of followed suit  do not use more than half of those Monday and Tuesday you're going to want to make sure you have some moves for one day's Wednesday Thursday Friday in case someone gets hurt because you got to get off of those zeros and those are days where you can still get Wednesday Thursday you can still get three games left out of an injured slot someone who gets hurt you can swipe swap them out for somebody who plays three times Friday you could swap them out for somebody who plays twice  then you use your last couple of moves probably Thursday Friday range maybe you want to save one for Saturday if you can but if you're in a tight battle you might need to use them up Thursday Friday uh but please don't use more than two moves out of four Monday and Tuesday  so then that's problematic because if you're using one of let's say you use one movie yesterday you're using another one today and you pick up Jake laravia who would probably be a decent stream today and tomorrow you can't hold him after Wednesday you must Abandon Ship Indie Memphis was the third team I said I already forgot  I remember these things Sacramento  there you go put them up on the screen for everybody all three of those teams play one time the final four days of this week  so this no flexibility at all  meaning then you have to use another of your remaining your two moves left you have to use your third move on Thursday on that guy you just picked up  otherwise you didn't even add a game played for this week in a lot of instances  the Warriors the Cavaliers I just mentioned yeah you turned a two game week into a game week congratulations but  really wanted to turn it to a four because an extra gameplay means that the guy you pick up just doesn't need to be significantly worse to actually hit value  and I don't like that at all because if you have to if you know let's take Kevin hurt her as an example here because he's super boring you pick up Kevin heard her tonight they got Milwaukee tonight Lakers tomorrow by the way the Lakers played Kevin her right off the damn floor the last time these two teams went head-to-head they went Malik monk for baseball game and extra Trey Lyles extra helping of trellis  if you pick up Kevin Herbert Tuesday Wednesday I'm I  I wouldn't but let's for this hypothetical say that you did  you need to use your third move on Thursday to get the hell off of Kevin herder there's no Universe where Kevin playing one game in four days is useful for your fantasy team now you're down to one remaining move so if you have a different slot that you were streaming  you're praying  on Thursday basically like frankly from the moment you make that move today you have to cross your fingers at no one on your team gets hurt the rest of the week  because if they do you're either stuck with her or the other slot your streaming or the injured guy which would be the worst case of all  so that's why I really don't like going for the back-to-back tonight tomorrow you you jam yourself into such a tight spot  from a i how many moves do I have left standpoint that I just I don't know how you recover from that  you need to leave yourself some kind of wiggle room in streaming in case something goes wrong and this time of year something always goes wrong  here are the names that we just talked about I'll put them up on the screen in case anybody didn't hear them as I was always going through it TJ McConnell will be topping and now hard on Indy on the back-to-back Memphis has Alma ravia GG Jackson Lamar Stevens Sacramento's Kevin huerter Clippers Terrence Mann  that one gets a more of a I know he's not as good as some of these other guys fantasy wise but four games versus three the rest of the week is a big deal and you can hold him the rest of the week and then Washington the best play out of all of these is Corey kissper in a landslide but unfortunately Rashawn Holmes has been ruled out already be loud cooler believe would probably be my third choice kiss Bert man cool to believe  like in that order cooler more for steals blocks and some rebounds Terrence Mann will get you some points a little bit more in that category maybe an extra three pointer slightly better percentages but very few defensive stats so kind of depends I think on what categories you're hunting here and that's the issue with using a move today  now you know there are other scenarios where you might need to like Phoenix for instance if you had really soil for a while which I did on a number of teams  streaming not streaming whatever he'd been putting up good numbers so I've just been kind of sitting on him he's been good enough to play in a three-game week because of those big rebound assist steel block totals  with the big three healthy that's probably not worth well even though they have a pretty damn good schedule at the end of this week  right so that's a situation where maybe you do use a move today and you move off of Roy so Neil because he hasn't been very good and you move over to like a Corey kispert if he's available or a parent's man who's gonna give you some of a similar stat set if you were defensive stats but the other stuff like relatively tight but he's gonna do it over four games instead of three  how much is that worth  or do you hang on and try to find only scenarios where you can add more than one game played with your move because the Clippers and again you gotta look a little bit farther ahead the Clippers after this week they go into a three game week and that might be your finals meaning you'd have to get the hell off of Terence man at some point  the other nice thing about the Clippers is if you absolutely had to you could use a move on Saturday the end of the week when they have game on Sunday you know Brooklyn has a back-to-back over the weekend and Washington has a back-to-back over the weekend but again we already talked about that so you know a lot of Nets are gonna get dropped because they only play one time over the first five days of this week if you wanted to move back to a Brooklyn Net starting on Saturday they'd have a pretty good stretch there for the weekend back to back so just something to kind of look a little bit farther down the line again later on this week and it might be Thursday or Friday when we do this little quick hitter streaming show we're gonna work in some of the players as they loop back around towards next week we'll call him kind of like a you know playoff stashes sort of deal and hopefully that'll be of some kind of used to you guys um what is see what do we got here quick check of the chat room see if anybody's got some streaming questions  oh hey it's our buddy that that was calling me out of the morning show for for thinking Chris Thompson was gonna play I got you dude I got you I remember that name give some credit please don't says I'd love to explain why you don't like Billy because it's percentages are trash his percentages are trash you've been getting fed a bill of goods on him this year he's played pretty good minutes 27 minutes a game this year he's outside the top 200 but this show is about streaming and four games in six days even of that crap is good enough  one three point nine steals 0.8 blocks you know and if it's minutes are up in the mid-30s with all the guys injured on the team there's a chance that he could actually be up and over one of each of those things and you get that four times you know if we're talking about six three-pointers five steals for a blocks that actually becomes pretty valuable the problem is he shoots 44% from the field in 70 at the free throw line and it really doesn't score rebound or pass enough so everybody's getting kind of caught up in this this thing and I was getting yelled at a bunch earlier this year but he's  like fantasy good in  just the defensive stats that's the only category where if you take him up to 30 minutes he's a positive  that's it not 36 minutes because I know he put 306 has been nobody plays 36 minutes in the NBA these days outside of like the top 10 11 players in the league and Josh Hart uh but like Bilal let's get him to 30 31 32  you won't be above average in points you won't be above average rebounds you won't be above average in assists he will probably be above average and Steals and blocks  and his two out of nine categories and turnovers will probably be around League average so our two out of nine categories good enough  12 team 9 cat know but four games in six days yes  I was playing on dropping Daniel Gafford after Thursday but now I'm not sure yeah you know and that's the thing that we're all gonna have to contend with because Dallas moves into a very bad schedule after the game on Thursday where they go three times over 10 days  you could conceivably hold the Mavericks until Thursday of next week because they do go three games over seven days you treat it like a three game week after that game for Dallas on Thursday that to me is acceptable then they're off for three days they go two games over seven days starting on March 22nd that's where things really get ugly for the maps so I think you could probably hang on and I don't think it would sink yeah Dr Mario says Mason Plumlee yeah I'm not super thrilled about it I mean you could I mentioned his name in passing that I'm not particularly thrilled about it thoughts on the Rockets beneficiaries with shengwen out so you'll probably see Jack Landau get starts but black I don't think you'll play enough I think they'll go to Jeff Green for 15 minutes Landell for 20 and then my hope in deep in my heart  deep in my heart my hope is that amen Thompson gets like a five six-minute bump that's all it would take even can't Whitmore getting a five six minute bump so maybe we get something out of the young guys in Houston that's what I would watch very closely watch their next ball game live if you can so you can see the rotations you can learn a lot they're playing tonight in San Antonio so try to watch that game and see when guys come in with their doing it may be an omen Thompson or Kim Whitmore thing  16 team or should I keep Nas read if they're no decent pickups from the teams of three games over the next five that's tough man they got one game over five days  someone in that three game like there's so many teams that go three times I can't imagine that there isn't someone who does even a little bit of something now in a deeply I get it because like your pickups are gonna be garbage and not read his gonna be rolling like top 60 so yeah you might not have a choice if the guys are picking up or like top 250 300 range three games out of them might still not get to one game of nasri just do the quick math and then go from there add for tonight well the Celtic add yesterday hopefully you guys will start to watch every show Pat calling you out Pat because on yesterday's show I spent a bunch of time talking about  Payton Pritchard  and Sam Hauser  did a bunch of that stuff are we playing Luke Cornett today  probably he's probably gonna start it's gonna be cornet for like 25 to 30 minutes and probably Xavier Tillman for the other 15 to 20  yeah  so I didn't intend to do a whole like Q&A thing I'm trying to keep these shows 15 minutes or less and where at 20 right now if you got more questions send them on into Discord thank you guys for watching I appreciate the the pop-up and listenership here on this streaming show good luck tonight let's keep it rolling we'll keep doing these two days I really appreciate you guys again like rates subscribe all that stuff on the way out and we'll keep these things going as many days in a row as I can so long for now
