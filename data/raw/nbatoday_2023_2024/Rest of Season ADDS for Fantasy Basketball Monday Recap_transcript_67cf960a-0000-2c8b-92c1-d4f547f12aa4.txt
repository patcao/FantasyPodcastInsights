welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast I wanted to get everything out on social today before launching into the podcast it's sort of a dual purpose thing one  the early you get stuff out on Twitter the more time people have to see it before games actually happen in the evening the other thing is that it actually really helps with my prep kind of keeps me on point once I get the podcast going because now I'm  yeah I got all the stuff written out I'm not gonna lose anything in the shuffle  anyway you guys understand my hairbrained process Manila in the chat room blames my tardiness on LeBron James and he might not be wrong because I did actually go to the Laker game last night oddly I've gone to the last two after not going to a single Laker game since last year and prior to that I don't think I had been to one in like five years so yeah I went back to back baby  no back you know Saturday Monday I was a fun one we'll talk about that one as we get towards the end of the card from yesterday that is what's going on on today's episode of fantasy NBA today  I am Dan Vespers this is the first of two episodes today we'll have one in the early afternoon that breaks down the schedule plays for this evening streaming that's a head-to-head show I've broken them up because it just frankly makes more sense to do so  take a moment here as you're settling in to hit that subscribe button it does actually matter I know I've said that before and maybe you guys don't believe me but you should it really does matter like REITs subscribe however you guys are taking in the podcast like something over on Twitter follow over on Twitter whatever your little thing you guys can do is relevant is helpful  please do it  the baseball draft Guy is available now over its Sports ethos.com ethos fantasy BB is where you can get the updates coming out on that as Joe and his team put more stuff into it daily best way to get it in my opinion is uh hit me up for a ridiculous discount that's the best way to get it at Dan Bass Pros over on Twitter or you can email in or you can hit me on Discord whatever's the easiest for you baseball fantasy past starts at six bucks a month basketball fantasy pass if you're on it already you can add baseball and football and make it in All Sport for one dollar a month Bob one dollar Bob if you're not taking that upgrade you're a crazy person and basically you're locking in all of our Sports for the price that NBA alone is likely to be next season anyway  so  yeah  let's talk basketballs specifically the basketball that happened yesterday zombie Grizzly's took down  the sad sad Brooklyn Nets good gravy these yeah  bookings now 24 and 37 there only two and a half games out of a playoff spot because the Hawks are without Trey young so they're all so terrible  and yeah so as bad as the Nets continue to be mathematically they're not going to get eliminated from play in contention for probably another four five weeks so nothing you have to worry about like a traditional shutdown for this team in the in the usual sense I don't know that's good or bad but anyway we'll get to Brooklyn in a second first thing is the Grizzlies we've talked in circles about the Grizzlies for the better part of about three weeks now  because they're in this weird half in half Out Tank deal and I say half in I mean obviously they're in full tank mode but they're kind of like a half in in terms of are we going to play only our young guys or we gonna sprinkle in a couple of semi veterans here and then as weird to call these guys veterans but compared to the rest of the team they they sort of are  and what does that leave us so forget the big overall we've done the big overall on Memphis repeatedly we've probably done it 10 times on this podcast in the last three weeks  let's just talk about each player Bing Bang Boom lightning round on them one by one  John khanjar most minutes he's played in a couple of weeks you can't you can't take that plunge because even when he starts sometimes he only plays 22 23 minutes for a reasons we don't fully understand  I mean the thing is if someone were to come out and say Yes John contrast definitely gonna play 30 minutes in this ball game you'd play him because his across the board his nine cat Fantasy games actually quite appealing he's also one of those guys that just needs to be out there for 30 minutes because he doesn't score  there's no  there's no lightning in a bottle moment with conchar it's get him out there for 30 minutes he's gonna get you boards assist steals blocks percentages all that good stuff but he's got to be out there  so no  Luke Kennard when he's in the starting five I think you could probably deploy him he ends up kind of taking on a little bit of a point guard role for this team when he starts and you know he's gonna jack up some threes and so provided they're playing a team that can't guard people all that well then Kennard would be a yes if he's starting  Vince Williams is a yes basically daily at this point he's gonna have some ups and some Downs because he's a young dude but he's in there and he's gonna get usage and he's playing every ball game so Vince Williams is sort of the first like every day or we've gotten to Trey Jamison started only played 19 minutes fouled out  yeah you can't trust him Jake ravia 14 and 10 that's cool 29 minutes off the bench was cool but there's no telling that that's gonna happen again so pass Santi aldama 12 5 and 4 with a couple of three balls he's a guy I start when Jaren Jackson is out so that has to be that's a one-to-one correlation now so that's the story on aldama Matthew Hurt No Lamar Stevens actually does have kind of an interesting Fantasy game but the minutes aren't there so no GG Jackson doesn't have a good nine cat game minutes in the shots are sometimes there but without the good 9 cat game no  and  Jordan Goodwin who's on a two-way deal so they didn't want to use up one of his days of Eligibility yesterday when he starts he's also a goal  did you guys write that all down  John conchar know Luke Kennard when he starts Vince Williams every day Trey Jamison know  Larry via know I'll dama when JJ is out Hurt No Stevens no GG Jackson no good when yes and obviously Jaren Jackson yes  that's the Grizzlies  the Nets are a little bit simpler I wouldn't call them simple but a little bit less complicated than the goofball Grizzlies right now because the Nets are down a couple of players  cam Thomas Ben Simmons sounds like Damron sharp is out already he's been ruled out for tonight's game again this remember yesterday was the start of a five games in seven Knights situation for Brooklyn by the way there are some other ones we're gonna talk about on the schedule show I might sprinkle in that information here  Lonnie Walker also sprained an ankle he's questionable for their next ball game tonight so  from a fantasy standpoint this is good news more thinning of the herd is always good for Fantasy because you tighten up the rotations fewer guys get more minutes  great so right now cam Johnson  author putting up huge lines hopefully that continues even after guys start to come back but even if it doesn't at least we're getting something now so cam Johnson go Dorian Finney Smith giant minutes playing enough minutes where he's a go he's another guy that just sort of needs to be out there for 3233 minutes to hit fantasy value he is doing that right now  Dennis Smith Jr not doing enough kind of surprising actually given how thin they are but not enough still so leave him on the wire Nick klaxon obviously yes Dennis Schroder all so pretty good fill in option right now just like it's seems like cam Johnson is for the likes of Ben Simmons and campus and then obviously Mikhail Bridges is a guy that you were starting anyway what is it what happens to this team when Thomas and and or Simmons shows back up I don't know I'm not convinced that we ever see Ben Simmons again and even if we do is gonna be 17 minutes so much is that really impact thing's Camp Thomas is the one that we have to be cognizant of when he comes back he'll come back and he'll start taking 18 19 shots of ball game that might be enough to render cam Johnson and Dennis Schroder bench material again but I honestly don't know specially if Walker and sharp and whoever else are out and if Brooklyn finally is just like you know what we were cooked but to me it feels like they're still a little ways from that  speaking of zombie teams  we mustn't forget the pork loin Trail Blazers for they are Undead as well and for any Simon's the only regular in the lineup yesterday they were all out know Jeremy Grant no scoot Henderson know DeAndre know Malcolm Brogden I'm sure I'm forgetting somebody else who gives a crap they're all gone  so Simon's who I said would take 25 shots I under shot he took 26 and made half of them which is a great sign was all the point guard he was the all the things for this ballgame for Simon's and he'll put up some gigantic lines if the whole team remains hurt around him I would be a little bit concerned about Simon's either playing himself into an injury or playing himself into a day off but I guess as long as they keep losing maybe that's not that huge of an issue and he missed a bunch of time earlier this year so he probably like come on you gotta let me play a little bit  and then you get into all this other Schmaltz and it's schmaltzy man Banton is took 20 shots and yesterday's ball game that came out of the blue  I can't possibly bring myself to pick him up  perhaps most notably because when I Kamar comes back that was his starting spot  let's go through this in orderly fashion do up Reef he had 26 points and almost nothing else yesterday which is pretty weird for your starting center to basically grab no rebounds  I think I'm pasting on Reef I know I put him down as a silly season stash guy I don't think his Fantasy game is quite there yet so make your adjustment on your board if you're tracking the Danvers board do up brief is a schedule play only  and even then it's basically only 18 is out I would not use a reef game against my game's cap schedule fine Portland's in a good schedule run they actually have a five game in seven Knights stretch coming up but it sounds like a might be back by that anyway Chris Murray he's been playing a lot actually lately but in doing a whole lot with it so I'll pass there again outside of a schedule play Rupert no Hagan's know Moses Brown no Mana no Jabari Walker I honestly and you guys know I'm super low on Walker but I actually thought there were enough guys out where he would probably put up a decent line yesterday  I was incorrect at 5,028 minutes 4 points and eight rebounds all he really does is score and board he sort of like a very very poor man's iteration of Bobby Portis on worst percentages  and so you know that's why I'm not extremely excited about him that said if everybody's out again in the next ball game I would probably feel comfortable streaming Walker  and then my hope is that Kamara comes back because he actually becomes my second favorite guy to play on the whole team right now if he is legitimately back for the next ball game and then of obviously if eight in his back for the next ball game he slides into that slot as basically the best fantasy player on the team but Simon's Aiden like we don't talk about those guys when they're starting obviously their goals because they're legitimate fantasy threats these other guys is a who's who of all of those guys  Camaro would be my favorite to play if he's back in the next one and then Walker behind him and then I don't know that you go anywhere beyond that  not much to report on in Minnesota Anthony Edwards has a slow ball game actually came off the bench cat had a weird one  some foul stuff early some like just out to lunch stuff late they ran some bench units that were actually being pretty productive  Rudy gobert had a huge one Conley bounced back to no one's surprise against a very bad team and you're not making any adjustments this I think the short version on Minnesota if we want to move quickly is that with Aunt back and slow-mo back nazreen no longer is a daily play that's the only note that changed on Minnesota everything else stays exactly the same  Clippers really missed a shot here ever since they got to the top of the Western Conference they've tripped over their you know what and falling on their face  they're five and five in their last 10 it's not like the sky is falling but compared to how well they were playing it kind of feels a little like the sky is falling they're still 39 and 21 so they're in no real threat of falling out of the top four right now three and a half game lead on the pelly's for home court in round one but they have now fallen back to create kind of a separation bubble between themselves and teams on either side  because the Nuggets finally decided to play like it's the actual basketball season they were doing they were going at about 80 if that 75% until about two weeks ago so basically the All-Star break and then Denver was like all right time to go and now they've won six games in a row and the nuggets are swamping people that is a scary team again  do I think the Nuggets probably end up winning the West yeah the way with the way they're playing right now they find the look focused  anyway Clippers uh zubats I think he does belong on rosters he's kind of like a third string Center type and then Norman Powell is the other question mark like was he gonna be doing more here with Westbrook out for a few weeks the answer is kind of you know he played more minutes in the two games since Westbrook got hurt or game and half or whatever it is and he put up a big number in the previous one but he didn't really get super heavily involved in this one now that was kind of odd  you know the Clippers actually are another team that has a great schedule coming up soon just not yet  they played yes yesterday they played tomorrow and then they're offered two days and then they start a five game in seven days stretch and Powell has been kind of Mr durability for them that would be a great time to deployment is that five and seven over on the back side no Giannis for this ball game so Patrick Beverley actually got the start and was awesome 12 and 9 Force deals a block in 33 pointers we know this about Pat been if he gets 30 minutes he's an awesome fantasy player we've loved him for years but he's super old now so these 30 minute games have to be deployed somewhat sparingly  I don't know that he gets another one even if you honest this is another game I don't know that Beverly would play 30 man I mean doc will probably run him out there  the guy you're always playing when Giannis is down is Bobby Portis he had 28 and 16 done matter if he's coming off the bench he always does a lot when there's no Auntie kupo around and then nothing else really changes much here Beasley two for 11 you know the 11 shots is what you're concerned with he's your Middleton 3-pointers stream and then Dame went mega mode with the honest out but keep an eye on the whole Pat Beverley thing I think he's back in the starting lineup in another ball game I would probably use him in as many formats as I could but I don't get the feeling that Giannis was gonna be out for all that long he kind of tested his stuff before the ball game it wasn't quite there they go every other day until next Thursday so pretty light schedule from Milwaukee by all accounts  and then after that they have one game in five days so this is not a time to be taking a chance on picking up a buck for a schedule stream Beverly on the other hand if you want to go on the Roto side chew up a games cap if you think be honest is gonna miss another one that would be the way that that you probably lean  Utah lost Larry marking in for probably a couple of ball games Washington well marketing was before the Ballgame he was ruled out I think actually late the night before Washington lost Marvin Bagley partway through to a back injury and they have no centers left now  which is kind of sad because they do have Roshan Holmes on the roster but I could not for the life of me explain what happened to pour Rashawn Holmes there was I know there was a lot of personal stuff during the sort of tail end of his tenure in Sacramento and obviously they brought into Montes bonus and so that rendered him kind of useless from just like at are you going to do anything type of thing but he just got on body snacked  he's not he's not that guy anymore that he was for you know five six years where we kept clamoring for him to get 30 minutes a night and then he didn't he was a top 30 fantasy play he's not that guy anymore  I don't know for Sean Holmes is seeing someone but it does feel like you know guys don't get like they don't just get old in a week  there has to be something going on between the ears and you know with this as  out into the light as the NBA is trying to bring mental health stuff and I don't want to put this on him this is my guess  it feels like that's the kind of thing that might be  a bit of an answer for Holmes but maybe this is the answer maybe they're just like look Rashawn there's nobody else you're gonna have to you're gonna have to channel some sort of fire and maybe he does maybe that's the thing that gets him fired up is actually having unfettered access to a job he doesn't have to compete for it or whatever I don't know you're not pre adding him until we actually see if they're willing to use him and frankly until we see if bad leaves gonna miss any time because last time  the Wizards decided to run small idea I got the sentiments which was terrific for Denny and so if that's the case then another reason to pass on or Sean Holmes in the short term Jordan bench pool I can't decide if I want to call him bench Jordan Poole Jordan bench pool or just bench pool either way  like this is what we were hoping for  post-trade deadline with the assumption that someone else got traded  and it's finally happening  and I actually feel like  we played the Jordan Poole card  damn near perfectly this season  because I told all of you guys to avoid him like the plague at the beginning of the year and then I told you guys to stash him up to the trade deadline which didn't turn out to be accurate necessarily for the week after the deadline before the All-Star break but now we kind of got a little bit Lucky in that oh they moved him to the bench and he's finally taking all the shots  the Glorious time he's top 60 yeah top 70 is over the last couple of weeks  there you go you gotta you got Jordan Poole who was actually playing now  hot damn  and then Corey kispert got ruined by the return of bilali I think with Bagley out if they do decide to go small again you might seem more kiss Bert so I would points League he probably hold on to Corey one more game Roto he was never really a play When the usage wasn't guaranteed that's too much of a dice roll on kispert but the other guys you know feel pretty well locked in I think if you can hold on to Bagley too by the way I didn't mention that one he left pretty late and you know Wizards don't have a whole lot to push for here um  but they have pretty good schedule basically between now and like the middle of not next week but kind of the middle of the following week after that so if you can hang on to Bagley I think it would do it and see if you can see if he'll come back pretty quickly  so Utah and you know we're getting into sort of like teetering on the brink of of zombie territory here Taylor Hendricks who was supposed to be the guy that gets to play when it's zombie time he got hurt Midway through this ball game toe issue  don't know if he's gonna happen to miss a game or two and Counting George was questionable with an illness tried to play through it and made it six minutes before coming out now the good news on George is that an illness you know A Bug's a bug you'll get over it and day or two or three or four or whatever it is so George will be fine marking and don't know exactly how long he's gonna be out but he was ruled out for this ball game the day before that's usually not a great sign that a guy is super close to coming back so what does that leave us well Jordan Clarkson is very much streamable with this much usage on the table because you took George out for this ball game and marketing and out for you know why X Y number of games and that left  I mean between those two guys you're talking about 30 shots of ball game floating around I didn't take job and expect Jordan Clarkson to take all 30 of them but here we are and that's gonna be the thing Clarkson's a guy that needs to get copious usage to overcome his massive fantasy deficiencies like field goal percent low defensive stats things of that nature generally kind of higher turnovers for what he provides  turnovers were good efficiency was actually good in this ball game so this one he was super hot it masked some of his issues which will surface but if he's out there taking 20 shots then you you have to play him at that point John Collins in these guys are obvious starts keonte George when he comes back is definitely a star with no marking in around there because he's gonna have a ton of usage again you could just kind of hope that it overwhelms the nine cat deficiency and then the guy to keep an eye on would be Chris Dunn I don't know if they'll go done and George side by side when he comes back but if he has to miss a game  we'll see then done would be kind of forced to play in the mid to high 20s and minutes that would be a goal  not picking up some managed there's yeah no would Taylor Horton Tucker potentially get some run if Hendrix misses time I don't really care to I think that the thing you're watching for basically is what happens with Kris Dunn in the next ball game if Hendrix sits it out because there's none of these other filling guys have translatable fantasy stuff anyway  Chicago erased a massive fourth quarter deficit the king's kind of melted down in this one I you guys know I faded the Kings this year after being a big time Kings proponent The Following season and their fading a bit kings are in the play in now and  boy the West is nuts I didn't look at this in the last couple of days you pretty much have your your 10 teams locked in at this point  but where they're all gonna be is freaking anybody's guess top three are all interchangeable Clippers look pretty locked in as the four for whatever reason that's like the one team you're like yeah I think I think I know where they're gonna be and then the pals are a game up on the Suns who are a game up on the Kings who are game up on the Mavericks or a game up on the Lake's who are I have came up on the Warriors oh boy  three and a half games separating five and ten  and it really could go either direction  because the Warriors and the Lakers are at the bottom of that pack and they've been playing probably the best of anybody in that group lately  Pals have been kind of hot suns and Mavs and Kings have all been falling apart lately  that's gonna be a fun one good race good race everybody Chicago's an easy team to handicap you start the starters unless they play a giant team and then you get Drummond in there but again we talked about that that's next one of those is coming up towards the end of the month  for the Kings I do believe it is indeed time to move on from the Kevin herder experience the 30 minutes are no longer a lock we just kind of wanted to wait and make sure on that front Malik monk who have described as a better head-to-head than rotos stream shout out to the gardeners for an apartment complex that are blowing leaves in about a four foot Runway between buildings behind me right now shut the heck up out there  oops I just get myself in trouble Malik monk why do I call him a better head to head stream because if you're punting any one of like two or three things his value jumps a bunch because he's good at scoring he's good at free throw percent he's good at assists he's not particularly great at the other stuff it's often enough when it all levels off he's like just outside of start every day  but that means that if any one of those three ish  you know steals blocks field goal percent rebound sometimes three sometimes like if you're punting any of those then he moves over the cut line so that's what I mean when I call a guy a head-to-head play versus a rotop play but guys like right on the cusp  then you pretty much can play them and had to head because odds are your team's terrible one of the things that they're not good at and then you can use them much more easily  okay see on the back to back in LA Lakers actually played defense now some of it was the Thunder they missed a few open shots but seeing the lake is actually played D was intriguing  and there's nothing really to take away fantasy wise in this game I love when D'Angelo Russell goes unconscious he such a fun player to watch when he's heat checking himself I don't know if you guys saw that play and it's the picture I used in the thumbnail for today's podcast but it was one Dlow was  in you know NBA Jam mode and  he hit like two insane shots in a row and then LeBron let's see if I can here let me see if I can pull this up I don't know how I pull it up without blocking it with my own face in streamyard  no that's just moving my face around there you go now you can see it on the screen so this was LeBron the face he made when Dlow passed him the ball while DLo is unconscious and LeBron threw it back to him and was like no  shoot that thing it's a great look  but what I want to actually talk about here and I'm gonna take the the box score out of the way and then I'm gonna  leave my face off to the side for those that are watching on video and also remind everybody to please like And subscribe and I'll go get something over at manscaped.com promo code their ethos 2-0  for 20% off that's the 2004 and free shipping on your order at manscape  but the reason I want to talk about not necessarily this ball game specifically but just the way basketball is actually changing over the last  really since the All-Star break  you've seen a  generally not in every ball game but generally a downtick in free throws and again some games there's a bunch like Brooklyn Memphis had a lot of free throws and you know if a team  a team like the Grizzlies who are super young and have no idea how to keep their hands to themselves they're gonna get called for fouls just is what it is  and I think some referee crews are probably gonna be maybe better at instituting these newer policies than others but Portland for instance 11 free throws Minnesota Took a ton in that ball game and again it's a like a bad young team is not going to figure out how to not foul but some of these slightly more veteran teams are gonna do a better job of it  like Utah Washington 383 throws in the ball game great  Chicago always takes a ton and they only got 22 tomorrow 12 of them 40 in that ball game Lakers always taking a crap ton of free throws 25 most of them Anthony Davis when they got into the bonus in the third quarter he had like six of his at the end of that frame on just you know fighting for Rebound kind of fouls that wouldn't have been shooting fouls anyway  and as a result you've seen scores ticked down a little bit  Memphis Brooklyn was basically right on the number Portland Minnesota went over Clippers bucks under  Wizards Jazz right on the number Chicago Sacramento under okay CLA under  and I think this is by Design and this is not me necessarily talking about like what you need to bet on  but it is I think notable for  how games are going to go for teams right now  so players that rely heavily on free throw volume might they lose a little bit of their juice I don't know those guys that still seems like they got to line she got is 980 God is 11 for throws tomorrow God is 12  how did Dame do dame got 13 so the guys that always get to the line are still getting to the line a little bit less  but the guys that maybe  are looking for sort of minimal contact and get the whistle we haven't seen those blown as much  and even like a five ten percent dip or increase in the amount of contact that it takes to get to the line is going to change the way fantasy numbers are coming in over the next little stretch so let's keep one eye on that and I don't I don't have enough data right now to make a sweeping Claim about how you know this is gonna change things but it does seem like if there's a if there's an adjustment on how much a free throw made free throw is worth  then the guys that are making them actually get a very slight bump in their value from now until the end of the season  so Shea could potentially see a little bump in value  I mean honestly just look at the board and who's taking the most free throws it was indeed Giannis would take a hit potentially all though  if you call it the same amount of much more of a hit you could take their butt shape Butler Dame Demar Booker when he comes back add  Tatum he's got actually see a very slight bumping value the rest of the way and they're already at the top of the board but there is a way to maybe think could they separate themselves a tiny bit could a guy like a DeMar DeRozan who's been sort of quietly moving up the board every week since about the seventh week of the season  is this a path for him now to actually Ascend a tiny bit quicker  Jimmy Butler is up to number 19 per game on the season now after the last you know two months where he's been ridiculous he's number seven over the last month so Butler's been cooking Demar has been number 17 over that stretch and I do think some of that has to do with being guys that are still able to get to the line even while officials are starting to make that little tweak we'll see if it has any notable impact on on the fantasy space probably more so embedding  I got to look this up I'm gonna I'm just gonna yell it into the void right now but I'll look it up later I'd be curious to know the over-under splits since the All-Star break because it sure feels like games are ticking towards under with more contact happening and you're also probably gonna see more technical fouls because players are like  you know bleep you ref that was a foul two weeks ago and they're gonna be like not t  you know one for you throw there well there's how you run it up I think a Lakers got called for two or three texts and yesterday's ball game  most of them are arguing non-valid Williams I think picked up a tech for arguing a long call I was at the ball game so I got to see all this stuff and that's why it's in my brain but it did sort of bring up a thought that I'd been kicking back and forth for three or four days which is  could this be the start of a trend where  contact needs to be more severe  from now until the playoffs and does that potentially carry over to next year something will want to think about in the offseason as well that is your recap ads drops whatever episode a quick check of the chat room here to make sure that you guys didn't bring up any names that I haven't checked in on yet Roger asks do you think Aiden is going to be shut down eventually yes right now know he was questionable then he got ruled out not too long before the ball game thing is he's only played 40 games so far this year so even if he played out the string right now he's only getting to about what  high 50s  what are the Blazers at they played 60 games I got 22 games lived all right so he could potentially get into the low 60s  like what's the point of shutting him down how many fewer games has he really need to play and Portland is doing a perfectly fine job of losing basketball games are 17 and 43  they'd have to be so much worse than the Spurs  to get into the bottom three  and then the Hornets who won a few ball games have now lost four games in a row these teams are going to be jockeying for those terrible positions so yes I mean eventually I think eight does get shut down but he's gonna want to play a little bit before then because he hasn't played that much this year ah let's see what we got here boo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  yeah this guy says amount of when  I'm on a forklift in New Zealand listening to Dan the man at work hope I don't crash yeah please no  fantasy NBA Dating Game best person not responsible for any injuries incurred well listening to the podcast  um let's see what do we got here would you drop keyonte George for Eric Gordon or Isaac okoro  if it helps with a schedule okoro know because at Donovan Mitchell comes back that explodes that and all so I think Eric Gordon know  those are both nose for me I know Utah schedule this week is not good but if you can get towards the end of next week you does schedule gets really good after that they have a five and seven starting on March 15th 10 days from now  Andy is just gonna do so much more than those dudes and Eric Gordon might not play in a back-to-back and Booker Mike come back and Gordon and then becomes pretty frankly barely played when that team was healthy a couple weeks ago so that's a no and a no for me no no Jordan Goodwin has three games left this week and he got a dnp yesterday I think he'll play in two or three games this week debating whether to hold or not he was someone that I really don't think you could add and head to head leaks because we have no idea how they're gonna utilize his two-way  I would hope we see him in all three but I just don't know I really have no idea I'm sorry  Roto you're holding Goodwin head to head I mean you're probably gonna hold for their next one because odds are he'll not skip two games in a row but after that then your guess is as good as mine  do you like Banton and points League's yeah  someone's gonna come back for that team and he's not gonna get to play as much  is Jalen green worth a pickup what do you recommend I do with Miles Bridges and Brandon Miller 10 team points League  I think I'd points League does make that more interesting  I'm guessing Jalen green is probably more valuable than Brandon Miller in a points league but I'm also guessing it's pretty close and a ten team or you're probably looking at okay so Miles Bridges as a hold until unless any shutdown happens there as far as the green versus Miller thing in 10 team that's probably a dozen really matter types scenario I'm guessing they'll end up relatively close in points League value and finally Gary Trent Jr versus ochia bhaji I'm adding Gary Trent Jr between those two guys he has the more translatable Fantasy game for Nyan Cat we know that his threes and steals can carry him he's actually had Seasons inside the top 50 I don't think that's happening here but with the usage being left on the table with the injury to Scotty Barnes thank you go Gary Trent there because it does seem like he's gonna get some shots and Dan are you keeping khris Middleton why have I ever said to add him is my answer that question I told you all don't touch him this year he's gonna be a huge headache  so no I don't think there's any reason to hold on to Chris Middleton even if he pops back up they're going to be going easy on him he's a huge pain in the neck  huge pain in the neck  yaakov portal wait for a update on the dislocated finger if it ends up being one that he'd maybe doesn't need as much they could get him back a little quicker and then JJ I'm a little worried this is the end of the line but I don't think we're all the way there yet he's at 54 games I still think he wants to get to 65 so play probably in about half of their remaining games which on the head to be a real pain in the you know what and in Rhoda you probably just hang on until the very last day and squeeze whatever games out of Jaron Jackson that you can please take a moment to like And subscribe on your way out we will be back in the
