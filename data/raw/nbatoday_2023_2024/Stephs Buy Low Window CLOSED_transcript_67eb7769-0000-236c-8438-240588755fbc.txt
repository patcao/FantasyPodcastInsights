welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  hi folks I'm going to talk a little fast on today's show and frankly I'm not sure that you guys really want to know why but I'll do my best to toe dance around it  both of my children not one actually all three in sort of the craziest Twist of all  the third one being the dog  have all had things  returned from whence they came  some more recently than others  but it's a hellscape in the best personal household right now and it's not a big home we're in a two-bedroom apartment in West LA so  protect me Suite dorm protect me sweet door  gosh I hope that door can protect me  my wife got lover is sitting out there she's stayed home from work today does not have it yet but feels somewhat inevitable at this point and we'll you know do what we got to do around here I guess anyway welcome to the show it's fantasy NBA today I say that because I don't want anybody to be surprised when we kind of Blitz our way through yesterday's recap and a look ahead at today's very large card I am hoping to have time for a 2025 minute Bi-Lo show in the afternoon today Pacific time I should say afternoon Pacific time since it's already there eastern time but again everything's gonna have to just kind of get played by ear a little bit  I'm also demoing a new thing for those that are watching instead of listening stream yard is what we use to put these things out on into the Universe I know that if I learned OBS Studio I think our content would be probably better looking but streamyard saves me a lot of time which does generally is my rate limiting step I am doing a seven-day trial that allows me to use a slightly higher resolution  curious to see if anything looks different on your end if you think this show looks different in any way let me know that looks exactly the same then obviously  no reason to continue that nonsense  I think we can probably dive into it first things first find me on social over at Dan best burst d a n b e s b r i s yesterday was a six gamer so not an intensely deep one but we've got some stuff to go over so let's begin that now Chicago Philadelphia that was the call the opener yesterday Philly had the early game at 4:00 Pacific time and they beat the snot out of the Bulls this game was not as close as the 13-point final score would indicate as evidenced by the fact that most of the Bulls played in the sort of 28 minute range Tyrese Maxey had only 29 minutes and ignores player playing only 29 minutes tells you a game is over very early as far as fantasy stuff goes not really much on the Philadelphia side and beat his back and triple doubled and he and she are fighting for that number one spot and fantasy sports but then everything else is kind of where you'd expected  Kelly oubre figures to have a good game here and there this one was with we without I should say D Anthony Melton  so that allowed Uber to continue to start even with Nick bottom back in the mix and then he went five for eight shooting so it's not like he had a massive truckload of usage heaped onto him he just sort of stepped into melting shoes  and did almost exactly what melting does which  you know we know enough about Uber's Fantasy game to say okay like yeah he does get some steals he's not melting level there he'll hit some threes he is melting of their generally scores better what is ubreak become when Melton and platoon are both in and starting its seems like probably a schedule play or kind of a feeling guy when one of the big usage dudes is out but those guys were not in this game and he happened to come through anyway when I started Brian Roto know  but I started in head-to-head probably as long as I knew somebody was out that becomes a much easier decision to make  as far as the Bulls go Kobe white got hurt mid ball game he finished it out Patrick Williams got her mid ball game and didn't finish it out Kobe I think gonna close to finishing it out but the game was over early enough Pace he has slowed we've talked about this a couple times on the show considerably here over the last week and a half after his extraordinarily hot run we also got word yesterday that Zach LaVine is not that far from coming back it's why I had him on the Bi-Lo board not that I guess it would be last week almost eight days ago I think we did that by low and I said if you want to take a shot on Zach LaVine I think he's at I think he's coming back soon Bradley Beal was kind of that same type of deal where people were so frustrated and annoyed by it that you could get these players with fantasy and reality pedigree at a huge discount  I think some people probably still missed the Zach LaVine news because it wasn't like a big thing it was a Billy Donovan presser quote or was like oh yeah Levine you know he's he's playing with Windy City and he got a good practice in kind of thing so they're hoping to have him back in the next week I have to admit I am  pretty  surprised that it sounds like Levine is gonna play another game for the Bulls or maybe he's like as soon as he gets healthy he gets shipped off somewhere I don't know  but certainly  with Chicago playing better lately they're not 15 and 20 they are ahead of the Hawks for the 10 seeds you know congratulations I guess but  seems like if he's healthy they'll probably let him fly  meantime if Patrick Williams estimates a game or if Kobe white misses a game I owed assume moves from you know decent minutes guy but not a ton of production to probably enough production  and on top of the minutes because usually he's a guy where it's like oh you know he got 2 0 8  no assists that's not a great sign but the Bulls were terrible they shut 38 and a half percent nobody really had any assists other than Terry if one of these guys misses a game white Williams whatever soon I think would be a pretty reasonable filling play  and yes Alex Caruso he's still a play I know this wasn't a good ball game but look if it's not closed they're not gonna push him that's the that Caruso rule the Karol  New Orleans blew out a Brooklyn team that's having all kinds of problems right now cam Johnson at least kind of survived this Onslaught nobody else did Mikhail Bridges has been very bad kind of from the outset this year but the piece is right now just don't fit  I don't know if you want to point to the Ben Simmons absence I still don't know that we ever see Ben Simmons play basketball again but you know whatever  I also brought up the fact that I was worried about since Spencer Dinwiddie a couple weeks ago this is your sort of bottoming out kind of ball game which is I think people when I talk about these things on the Pod they're like oh yeah damn you're taking a Victory lap I'm not actually I think this is  potentially a buy opportunity on Dinwiddie not that I would I'm not going out of my way for him he's right outside the top one 50 on the season and 31 and a half minutes ballgame and that's like we've talked about this not a great foul shooter  he's not a good field goal percent guy he doesn't do much besides assist and score and typically those two things are not enough  we've seen Dennis Schroder do it at sort of a much better clip this season but this is why I was worried because I'm a nine cat guy  Bridges is the Easier by low wreck on this team at some point he's just gonna be like this is stupid and I'm gonna go do some more stuff he looks tired team looks disinterested they are just getting smoked early and often and you kind of figure Something's Gonna Pop here I don't know what it's gonna be but something's gonna pop and you kind of want to just be ready for whatever that is  as far as like what are you doing tonight with that information see if you can go get bridges for like a top 55 top 60 kind of guy because honestly you might be able to right now  for New Orleans they put this one away early  so basically the analysis here is kind of don't pay attention to this box score other than one key thing  and that one key thing is that herb Jones  is good when Trey Murphy is out it's almost been a one-to-one correlation to this point  pretty damn close almost as close as you can get in fantasy for Wing players  nonsense Center Nonpoint guard types  so when Trey Murphy comes back you probably begin to worry about her again when he's out herbs a goal and it I think it kind of solidifies him as injury replacement and a very good one mind you  you know injury placement two Burger kind of guy but he was bad for like nine 10 games in a row when Trey Murphy was in there and then Trey went down and Herb was magically it's not magic had I think two good ballgame straight now  anyway Memphis beats San Antonio 10698 Julian champagnie 12 points four boards to assist a steal three three-pointers but only 22 minutes it's just again you know he's not gonna get to do enough Knightley  there's I am intrigued slightly Buy Champagne in the starting lineup but as minutes are not guaranteed  the Spurs are  not that covertly tanking the crap out of this season now when was on a minute's cap about 25 to 26 ish minutes per ball game he's not playing in back-to-back he's still gonna put up nice numbers so here 20 points 7 boards four blocks still good for Victor  but overall you know I I nobody wants him only playing 24 minutes he can go harder in that I guess that's a good thing but like it's Gonna Hurt rebounds  it's ultimately going to hurt defensive stats  and there's anything you do about it besides ride it out still think he's fun though  you guys know my feeling on the rest of these guys anytime that Devin vassell has a big ball game we try to sell High Kelvin Johnson he has a big game you try to sell hi Jeremy Sohan if he has a big game you probably didn't have him have him because he's been so bad  that's the Spurs in fact I think it's one Minima the only spur inside the top 100 now  Kelvin Johnson is falling outside of it to 104  you just eventually you knew the percentage is we're going to catch up their vessel is where  my looking at total rank or per game Devin Michelle is oh look he's inside the top 75 he had a few good ones in a row few  couple of them  that's fortunate think I missed a game I think I missed a good one or two from vessel when I was in Yosemite  the  the lower one but I'm a minutes are  probably a good thing for vicel and Kelvin Johnson because it kind of guarantees the have enough to do on a night tonight basis I am someone curious what Zach Collins role is going to look like when he comes back so he can play the other you know 24 sentiments is that his entire job will there be any time where those two guys coexist I'm not I don't think you need to rosters at Collins it's not at all what I'm saying I just think that there's maybe an outside shot that he could have value  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of beer Wine

Luke Kennard is making a case to be a three-point streamer but they're kind of going easy on his legs so probably not Santi aldama had his first decent ball game in about three weeks so you can ignore that I guess the good news here so everything always ends up as like the great leveling in life is undefeated Jaron Jackson Jr after being like number one 100 after a month is  I think he worked himself up into the  was I looking at yesterday you know weird board going I think he's at like number 50 something now so it's slowly Works its way up he's obviously been a lot better the last month John Morant has had his massive couple of games to start the year and then  the magic of nine cat kicks in and he's back down to number 81 and points League Mega stud that's just the way things go I'm not picking up his Mac Beyond we've been down this road way too many times for you to even ask about that probably the most important thing on the Memphis side is that Marcus smartly 30 minutes and did nothing Five Points two boards three assists if you guys remember he was around 1:20 before he got hurt and that was John Moran when John was out  now Jaws back so you figure Smart's offensive role is going to be smaller the question is basically can he do enough and steals  in assists and hopefully get those turnovers down to kind of squeeze inside the top 100  but he still averaging three turnovers a game and that's frankly just way too many for somebody who's not racking up a system of a ratio of like one point three to one  not good enough  I say  hell of a game Thunder beat the Celtics won 27 123 that's a fun one Chris stops poor Singas  is putting up normalcy gets numbers despite playing alongside two high usage juggernauts  he's just even more efficient now  somehow and he's number 17 Again somehow  good for KP he's having a good year  Derek White's having a good year Tatum had a big ball game here  pushed his way back up to number 28 which I mean obviously when he was like number 35 we had on the Buy Low board which is the most obvious call in the history of mankind Jaylen Brown was bad in this one  it's not much to talk about on the Celtics Al Horford had five blocks but again he's a guy you play when somebody's out because then he gets those starters minutes  for the Thunder Shay just keeps on Truckin man he missed a couple of free throws in this game which is like oh no  is the sky falling  ask guys fine only one steal though  I know we can wag our finger at him one steal what happened this is like the parent that sees the kid get a 97 on the exam and goes yeah but what happened to these three  what I would like to know is what is Jalen Williams ranked now 66 friends that was another really easy Buy Low  you knew things would start to come around for him  like because he looked good the only thing that was off  was the defensive stats right and they're starting to creep back up now he's up to 1.5 combined defensive stats  he gets that up to two by the end of the season you're talking about a guy in the 40s  hopefully you bought low on him when he was ranked at like 95  someone asked me today if I thought Josh giddey was coming around I don't actually not necessarily because he's not having an okay like couple games stretch but mostly just because his game doesn't translate to nine cat all that well field goal percents not very good free throws a little better turnovers are kind of math doesn't get much in the way of defensive stats doesn't shoot the three so you're talking about a point guard who rebounds and passes a little bit it's like if you got Draymond Green at point but without any defensive numbers  it just doesn't translate all that well  points leagues yes he's more interesting there nine cat there's just sort of almost no way he gets to wear folks wanted him to be  Warriors beat the magic Steph Curry beat the magic maybe I should clarify Steph busting out of his slump he had fallen outside the top 20 on a per game basis sort of quietly steals have dropped for Steph left couple of Seasons I think some of that is just having to shoulder a larger offensive load three-pointers had dropped under five for ball per ball game thanks to a field goal percent slump but and he only had four in this ball game for whatever that's worth but he got some steals he did it on a good percentages actually missed some free throws  but there was never really a reason to worry about Steph someone actually dropped into my Twitter mentions to ask  so someone actually dropped into my Twitter mentioned to ask if Steph was washed it's like well  I don't know did you watch like the first seven weeks of the year before he shot poorly for four games or whatever it was nah man we have this thing and I don't know if I like I think some of it is a little tongue in cheek where we're like trying to figure out when a guy is officially cooked  no one actually thinks that stuff is cooked he's unreal man he still does things that no one else can do I know guys get older it's a whole thing at some point everybody's gonna hit that marker but  even the greatest go through little shooting slumps  and then they tend to bust out the other side with a few games in a row where they shoot you know 12 for 20 and all of them are three pointers or something like that so no no reason to worry there he was a Bilo he'll be fine as far as the rest of this ball game goes Jonathan Cana had a better one I still find him kind of hard to deploy on the Roto side because you don't really know when the numbers are going to be good for two games in a row or even one game in a row he's outside the top one 60 over the last week because turnovers are high field goal and free throw percent are not positive he's not getting any three 15 points and seven rebounds it's fine like that works again points leak stuff and head to head if you're not necessarily desperately trying to win free throws or whatever or turnovers like all these things help him on the head to head side that on rotor you're like you know what that crap is gonna count against me for the whole damn year  so head-to-head for me comingo over Roto Gary Payton the second came back and immediately got hurt again Brandon pajam ski 28 minutes off the bench  it's something to monitor not because I think his his role is just gonna go away but Andrew Wiggins has been a little bit better lately trayce Jackson Davis is getting a longer look which again he's the he's the big news here he needs to be added after that last ball game where you started and you start him if he started Chris Paul they're sort of shoehorning back into a more feature role with guys hurt  and I guess the biggest thing for me on page who again I think is a very much a hold right now because one slightly slower ball game is not reason to go full panic mode but will he ever hit the  Willie ever hit the  I call rookie wall I guess is the sort of no one player for up Willie ever kind of run out of gas because a lot of what he does is that high energy crashing into people rebounding passing defense stuff and even the guys that have been in the legal long time eventually get hurt or tired doing that like the Josh Hearts the pat Beverly's those types  if that's who if if that's what potency is gonna be  which by the way is excellent but those types of guys they end up battered and bruised and it's a hard to go six months like that  I think that's gonna happen tomorrow the next day I don't know the hell do I know but just sort of trying to read the ebb and flow of the long season so hold for now keep an eye on it but no adjustments there and then as the magic go you're holding Jalen Suggs  at some point he's gonna fully get his legs back underneath him he's in a little bit of a funk right now but I think he'll be fine go get Dad say started played 26 minutes in this one he was good but they have three centers that they're all trying to give minutes to but as he got 26 movagar 150 Carter Jr 20 they're playing some of those guys together at times  the magic have what we can deem sort of a good problem like it's not like they have too many great centers they have too many adequate centers and not one of them is good enough to supply to the others  best thing for the magic would be to see if they could go get something for like a mover on the trade market or but Todd say I feel like a team like I don't know the freaking Lakers would love to have more to go foul somebody hard and hit a three-pointer and rebound kind of thing because like  Jackson is ain't doing it and Christian would is  sort of what all the coaches knew he was  that was the difference of fantasy stats versus what is actually happening on a basketball court I mean maybe they like and then there are other teams I shouldn't say is the Lakers I just happen to watch them a lot there are other teams out there that could use a floor spacing kind of angry big man I don't know if the magic would split up the Wagner's though so maybe but Todd's the guy that they  put out there and again somebody could use them  they probably prefer to have him he's freaking starting for him right now at the hell am I talking about call Anthony is in one of his funks he's a stream well warm guy he's very much in that bucket and then I see no reason to move him out of it and finally and this is the big surprise of the night Charlotte defeated Sacramento I won 11 101 that's a big oopsies Kings will be fine they're 19 and 13 but this one was supposed to be a Tappan just happened in just half but in and they went out there and they shot the ball poorly and they turned it over 20 some odd times whatever it was the bonus at 11 turn overs I call that the Stackhouse triple-double by the way 23 points 18 boards 11 giveaways because old stack used to do that sometimes back in the early 2000s in my college roommates used to have a good chuckle about the Stackhouse triple dub sorry Jerry you're very good basketball player this is not meant to pick on you but you did have some of those uh Terry Rozier giant ballgame he again anytime you can try to sell high on him you do it I love Terry Rozier I love his Fantasy game but we all need to be pragmatic about the fact that  at some point lamelo ball is going to resurface  Gordon Hayward might also not that it really matters all that much  Brandon Miller will also so just not going to be this wide open of a run forever  miles Bridges is a start of course PJ Washington is a starting early played 24 minutes off the bench but who cares with all these guys hurt he just runs in there and takes all the shots he can find and then Cody Martin is sort of your fringy one Nick Richard still filling in for Mark Williams who's been doubtful for an entire month and still played  ridiculous Kevin herder got benched for the Kings Chris Duarte started at shooting guard he was  I think I would argue a better facilitator  and so maybe that's a thing that gets tried again  the king's bench got smashed in this ball game starters were sort of like break even for the most part bench got smashed Malik Monk and and Coach Brown had a little bit of Aurora words on the bench so Malik's minutes got trimmed we'll see if that wakes him up in the next one or if it puts him deeper into a dog house you got a hold on monk for now and then for Duarte I'm not racing not to pick him up because I like his game doesn't translate all that great to Fantasy but if he's really gonna be out there and they're like look your job is to rebound pass steal and hit threes then maybe there's an outside way to sort of circle into fantasy value I just I need to see it to believe it and that was yesterday's stuff a mid-show reminder everybody to check out our friends over at manscaped.com use promo code ethos 20 to get 20% off your order we're getting all these really nice positive reviews from the folks in the YouTube chat room that have been buying the manscape stuff and they're like this thing is amazing I forget who said it yesterday and I apologize for forgetting the the poster who said they bought a lawn mower two years ago that was like this first or second year of the manscape partnership and he's never had to get another one and that's the problem with our manscape partnership I need new people to go get stuff over there because folks that have already bought things that manscape they don't need to get another one  the problem of having a good product is folks don't need to buy it a second time it's why Apple has to change the freaking charger on all their crap  why because otherwise we just used the same charger for 20 straight years that's not true they need to they put out new phones every year and a half  so yeah go new folks go check out manscape.com promo code again is ethos 20 over there and hey take a second here mid show to make sure you like rate subscribe all that good stuff no matter you're taking in the Pod and whatever you can do on social as well whatever you can do to help spread the word we really do appreciate that as far as tonight is concerned certainly a few things to keep an eye on it's a rather busy  evening what are we at 13 this is a 13 gamer I'll count it live on air I got no shame six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve only 12 oh that's small potatoes  he says with his tongue firmly oh Shake  talk about what we're looking for the Wizards any of the heating up because he's uh kind of in that stream while warm Zone he's been better lately started the year Well faded to hard now he's come on a bit last week week and a half or so  for the cows I've been watching Max Drew's because he is in a brutal field goal Funk right now 32% for a month  that's rough  the good news is it's pretty easy to fix it  just goes on a decent field goal stretch and here we go  any whoa believe so I'm watching on the bucks if he's really just three pointers and the Steals and boards and the system all that stuff that he was getting early in the year those are actually drying up then he would be a guy that moves back into just sort of stream Zone but he healed Off the Bench and kind of a black these days I'm gonna hold a little bit longer see how that goes Brooklyn is a team where it feels like Something's Gonna Pop we just kind of want to be ready when it does Pelicans we've talked about the herb with and without Trey Murphy what's called them Trey Jones my bad Raptors this is a team to actually keep a close watch on what's IQ gonna do that's a manual quickly RJ Barrett  again  Canada's prodigal son he returns  to play for his home nation team  and then Trent Junior does he actually still have a role Off the Bench we'll kind of see about that Grizzlies Marcus Smart's the guy we talked about him Blazers Anthony Simons has been out with the respiratory bug last week we'll see if he gets back in for this one for the maps now we got Kyree and Luca back together do any of the Wings remain playable now that the usage guys are in  the Bulls we got a bunch of game time decision type of dudes so let's keep an eye on that one  on Andre Drummond obviously as well for the next heart and even chenzo with the guys I'm watching there but the Jazz I mean things are weird with Utah man who the hell plays for that team on a night tonight basis  so that's another one where you're just sort of watching to see what happens every day John Collins seems lately like he can be disposed of Walker Kessler sort of like in and out of the starting lineup but he's been good either way Jordan Clarkson had a triple double so then he becomes a cell High it is calling sex in fall off a cliff here there's a lot going on with this team Utah  Miami comes down to who's in and who's out so that's a health one Lakers got to figure some stuff out really at your Moore's out D'Angelo Russell's doubtful  I would assume that means more max Christie but I don't think that matters for Fantasy probably enough Taurean Prince to let him fly or land on the back-to-back in Sacramento this should be a tough travel game for them from Golden State it's a drive but still kind of a tough one Kings I'm sure gonna be pissed after yesterday's loss to the Charlotte Hornets but you're watching Duarte there for Orlando you can keep an eye on Suggs the center situation that's kind of the stuff for this evening as I mentioned folks are trying to keep this one a little bit on the shorter side because  my children are like extraordinarily ill two rooms over and I am going to throw on a hazmat suit and go see if anybody needs anything in the other room here if you got a question I apologies to the folks that did put stuff in the chat room I appreciate you guys if you can help each other on these shows that's all so great or throw it in the comments Tab and and I'll try to take a look at that one question here that's not fantasy baby stayflow says hey Dan in your opinion what is the MVP race looking like uh right now it's probably embed on the repeat but Shea is probably your number two  Thunder or 23 and 9 second seed in the West  behind the Timberwolves who have too many good players for any one of them to be the MVP obviously you could just be up there every year but I feel like and if you know fair or not I think people are bored of yokich being this amazing  and they want to see if somebody else can make some Headway and right now she has absolutely made that Headway he and MB are duking it out I don't think anybody else is really all that close frankly  I mean you know look at the Bucks and Celtics who have better records could you go Tatum probably not they have too many great players bucks you could look at Giannis he's been very very good this year 31 Points 11 rebounds but kind of quietly awesome I don't know why nobody thinks the Bucks really good they're 24 and 9  but to me it's been beaten its Shea and I don't have the odds of that in front of me but if you want to throw a half shekel on each of them feels like one of them probably comes up with with your winner so again if you got a question throw it in the comments tab that again goes for everybody if you're listening to the show on iTunes Spotify whatever service you use to pull the Pod down you can still navigate over to our YouTube page and throw a comment on something best way to get ahold of me these days is that because ultimately might be later on in the day or the next day or whatever I will see those it won't be hyper fast but with Twitter I miss notifications all the time they're just like flying past me at this ridiculous rate which is cool I like being like popular over there but I can't I can't keep track of it especially not with hell happening elsewhere in my house even harder  I am Dan best for us we'll wrap it up early today short shorter show at Dan best Bruce on social this is a sports ethos presentation fantasy NBA today
