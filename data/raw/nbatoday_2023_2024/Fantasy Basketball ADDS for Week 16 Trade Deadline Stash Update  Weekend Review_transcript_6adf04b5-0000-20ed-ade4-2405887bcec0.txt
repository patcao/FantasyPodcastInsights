welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right so here let me get you guys all keyed in on some stuff first of all hello welcome to Fantasy NBA today this is a sports ethos presentation I am your host  Dan best price that hasn't changed what has changed  I'm sure you guys can still hear the nasal stuff going on with me but that's actually something that stayed the same thing that's changed is out of Los Angeles is basically underwater right now which I know for the rest of the country is like ah whatever little bit of water but this city completely shuts down when there's rain  the roads are flooded you can't get anywhere so as a result my day has shifted ever so slightly with both children at home like to be at home all day and in about 30 minutes that means that I am on duty and you may or may not hear from me the rest of today so I wanted to quickly get this show in before the madness of the day has en sued we have a weekend to go back through we're going to cover all 30 teams we're gonna get you reset for the upcoming week which I believe is now week six team which seems nuts but I I think that's true how the hell did we get this far we're like what do we had now we 60 yeah we're 60% of the way through the NBA season  amazing down sloping it and it's trade deadline week on top of everything else Thursday is the trade deadline we'll have our live show from 7:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Pacific time it's a five-hour show  that I do four hours of basketball play-by-play the later that evening so Thursday I will be dead but it's gonna be a good one it'll be a happy day  so  let's just dive straight on in today I'm gonna try to keep promo to a minimum because we've got so much stuff to cover and I want to try to do it at sort of a Breakneck speed we'll start with the Orlando Magic  at the Detroit Pistons  don't worry about this everybody just handing an iPad to another person in my home my wife was a tempting to crawl under the video  why she didn't just tap me on the shoulder and say we need the iPad welcome to my morning it's actually a John Denver song I believe it's called farewell Andromeda welcome to my morning  welcome to my day  yes I'm the one responsible  for getting it just this way or Lando is interesting right now for a couple of reasons one the main one being that Jalen Suggs has sort of defensive stat in his way back into my heart I still don't believe in Markle faults I'm sorry I'm one of the naysayers there I can be Captain buzzkill but I like Jalen Suggs when he's getting defensive stats and he has been last four or five games in a row now I basically have continued to say look if this is really the  turnaround for him the pivot point to kind of come back out of this thing  then I wanted to get back in and so I kind of have to follow through on what I said which he's doing he's getting defensive stats his minutes have been better  and maybe he was just a health thing you know he had all these injuries and fatigue and all of that sort of lumped together  but to me Jalen Suggs is now a re-add after he was at early season ad for a while I ended up finally dropping him after trying to hold on as long as possible but now I think he's a rehab uh Wendell Carter Juniors back to splitting minutes with Mo vogner which was there were like a there was like three games in there where Wendell Carter Junior looked like he was gonna run away with it and I thought man I really goofed this no I didn't goof this one up we know what he is we know the magic are gonna mix and match we know that they're probably trying to thin the herd a little bit because they just have frankly too many guys and so go go badass they just hasn't been playing all of note on the magic Jonathan Isaac has been hovering near 20 minutes lately which typically for him is enough you can't possibly hide him in a head to head format because he's gonna take a bunch of days off in there and his minutes are going to bounce around but if you wanted to and this is a tough week to say this even on the Roadhouse side stash him at the end of your bench and not use him against your games cap  I could maybe make an argument for that it's just it's hard to  when on trade deadline week you want to be using those sort of bonus roster spots on the Roto side at the very least to stash guys that might get better at the trade deadline so that's why in my eyes and maybe on February 9th maybe on Friday we come back we're like okay we know what's happened to the trade deadline we have an idea of who we think is up and who is down I now have a dead roster slot of I was saying I was stashing Bilal Colby hypothetically and let's say the Wizards don't make the moves we want okay then you switch that for Jonathan Isaac  okay but I still think we're you know four days away from that being a reasonable course of action  Isaiah Stewart remains out for the Pistons I think he'll be out for I think the did they say another week a week and a half or something like that Ozark Thompson finally got some playing time  I still think he's more of a silly season guy that a trade deadline guy so if you're trying to squat on Thompson you're probably gonna be waiting another month as a post to another week I don't know this to be the case maybe they turn his Direction even when I say A Stewart's back but I also don't feel like  I don't know that boy but Donovan just going anywhere I know they're trying to move out like Burks I just like I don't know how many guys in the Pistons  are really at a position to get out of the way for Thompson to make an immediate impact on Thursday  as opposed to on you know March 20th when they're like all right  Burks gallic and they just like list off anybody who's older than 26 years old you guys all get to take the rest of the year off and that would be the moment  I know real thoughts on Phoenix Bradley be a lot of big ball game which is good because he was sort of overdue for that Grayson Allen did not but he's a hold Washington is the more interesting or more horrifying side of this particular ball game kuzma sat this one out could potentially be trying to get him right for the trade deadline I don't know for sure and I don't want to make any assessments there  Jordan Poole decided he was gonna do the I Don't Really Care Act again  a lot of De I actually still think that pool has a weird like kind of outside shot to be a trade deadline winner I've been fading him anybody that's so if you're listening this podcast for the very first time today you're going to be like oh Dan is interested in Jordan Poole  Dan has been telling you all to avoid Jordan Poole like the  mother bleeping plague since a month before the season started but I am also pragmatic fellow who notices that he's getting dropped now in League's which probably should have happened two months ago but he's getting dropped now when you legitimately would only have to hold him for three days to find out if kuzma and tyus Jones or Daniel Gafford or whoever get traded and then like yeah you're gonna have games like this for pool just decides to pull the plug quickly on his night but you'll also have games like the previous one where he takes 202 shots or whatever it was and to me that's a reason now it's like okay pools been awful but there's like a 30 40% chance that more guys get out of the way somehow he needed more to get out of his way and so that to me is worth it Marvin Bagley is is not healthy right now so there isn't a legitimate backup for Daniel Gafford but he's another potential trade deadline winner  I've got one half of one eye not even a full I a half an eye on Corey kispert who's Fantasy game is is fairly whack  but if at the deadline it's you know kuzma gets moved and Jones gets moved and Gafford gets me I like if they really do blow the whole thing to smithereens  kiss Bert could number one potentially start  number two even if he doesn't you saw I took 13 shots here in 25 minutes like if he goes up to 28 229 30 minutes you could see him just chucking away 15 shots of ball game and then you kind of have to consider of more so on the points League side but possibly both but that's why it's only half of one eye and then cool to believe who had the absolute worst game that we've seen in the Tony Snell era sorry I shouldn't take shots at Tony Snell he's actually part of a kind of a heartwarming story in the NBA right now or what could be one that's kind of a sad story at the moment about his kids needing Healthcare sorry Tony Snell but you are the master of the zeros and everything could have really did have one rebound and one turnover in 25 minutes of this ball game and this is what I've talked about since November he's not a play in Fantasy unless we can promise he gets over 10 shots of ball game which feels like it could happen if both kuzma and tyus Jones get moved at the deadline we got to look at what the team looks like without kuzma and this one admittedly they got spanked and they got spanked quick and early so maybe we didn't get all the information we needed but we certainly got some  yes the Memphis Grizzlies are still a professional basketball team know they're not really Fielding a professional basketball team but they you know they wear the Jersey Memphis by 40 they had nobody left 13 players were out somehow they managed to run eight guys out there in this ball game but like look at this look at this madness I've got to believe that the Grizzlies have some of their injured guys back for the next one but if they don't we got an idea of who you could start which was Gigi Jackson Scotty Pippen Jr in my eyes are probably the two safest just because they can actually like have Fantasy game David Riley's Fantasy game is whack um  trade or sorry Jacob gillard's Fantasy game is is teetering on the brink of possibly useful and then Luke Kennard could have Fantasy game but I don't think his body is ready for 30 minutes yet so that's why I only played 24 here and I can't start him in 24 minutes I need Kennard playing you know the full starters compliment but let's hope that someone's back let's hope that Vince Williams and or Santi aldama or someone like that shows back up and that's why I'm not making any moves on Memphis until we get their injury report for the next ball game  as I mentioned we're kind of lightning rounding it today so apologies for going very fast you might not need to actually run this show on one and a half speed  no Jalen Brown for the Celtics so Al Horford started and was decent and that is the running story for Boston when one starter is out you can play Big Al  Clippers and he had themselves a 1990s basketball game first to 100 wins it was the Clippers Kawhi has been amazing James Harden has been very good outside of one ball game Kawaii by the way is number five on a per game basis  he is almost chased down Anthony Davis for the number four spot and by totals Believe It or Not Kawaii is actually number four also behind Anthony Davis there but I think Luca  who am I missing who's up in that top oh  uh Joel embiid is obviously the player in the top five that fell out when you started looking at totals instead  um  Harden is at number 17 Paul George is the number 13 Clipper continue to be a fantasy gold mine if he's a zubats came back played 18 minutes and struggled mightily with bam out of Bio who just kind of owned him in this one  zoo is  a very low end Center he's number one ten on the year you'll hover probably in that range once he gets back up to Full Tilt better  because hardened us on the team unquestionably so I think  think he should probably be rostered in most formats for that sort of Fringe startable stuff  yeah that's real estate with that Miami know Tyler hero the question was would anybody really step up in the answer was kinda Josh Richardson but I don't want anything to do with him so  I will kindly pass on anybody that's not a big neighbor in Miami these days Charlotte is another team that should probably like the Grizzlies and wizards get relegated to another level of basketball right now Indy with Halliburton on a severe minute strict restriction still beat the crap out of him Aaron Nesmith big ballgames he'll just continue to go huge while Halliburton is is half out a little surprised they Andrew and I'm hard did nothing but you guys know that I haven't been particularly high on his Fantasy game this year and that's nothing is really moving me off of that position  I don't think there's anything to add on Indiana other than to just say and I don't have a great argument for it on today's show I might have to do a specialty show hopefully tomorrow if the kids are back in school  I could probably make an argument that Tyreese Halliburton is the most hair brained but also possibly the greatest by low story in the history of fantasy basketball right now because and there's no surprise here either it's not like it it's not like people don't believe in him  it's that they haven't given any indication  of when his minutes cap is going to get lifted this is just sort of an indefinite thing  because he wants to qualify for the various Awards so they don't want him sitting out right now but he's obviously not fully healthy so he's playing 20 minutes of ball game just to qualify  and he still makes them better in those minutes but I have no idea when he's gonna play more  thing is you could get him for you know probably like a top 50 kind of guy right now and you know as soon as he starts to play more than 20 minutes a game he's way better than that we just don't know when so stay tuned I have thoughts on that I just don't know that I'm gonna have time today to get them to you  meanwhile meanwhile over on this Charlotte side miles Bridges PJ Washington Brandon Miller are the only viable oh Nick Richards sorry and Nick Richards the only viable hornets and they are semi viable at the moment but because they're competent and be a basketball players they're gonna get a ton of minutes and so that means you can play them  when lamelo ball comes back I'm not sure PJ Washington remains a whole but that I guess is an if lamelo ball comes back he's another guy that's like you could probably get him for like a top 60 top 70 guy right now because no one knows if he's gonna play another game this year  also Charlotte is selling off pieces we don't know exactly which we don't know miles Bridges is on the trade block I would assume PJ Washington is on the Block but also it's not clear that anybody is just gonna magically move into fantasy value if or when those guys disappear Oklahoma City and Toronto many overtime later this was an interesting one because Toronto double-teamed Shay pretty much the whole ball game and so SGA ended up with 14 assists he didn't have to score all that much which meant that Josh giddey Lou Dort Chad Holmgren who is obviously great anyway and Aaron Wiggins all took a ton of shots in this game that they normally would not  you should not adjust your expectations from the Thunder unless everybody starts double teaming Shea that would be the reason to sort of flip your expectations on Dort and Wiggins and giddy who don't get to do all that much typically because typically Shea is taking you know 10 11 free throws and 20 some odd shots in a game like this one and this one is steady at 14 assists so it's just a different job  Toronto is notable and again the you know the double overtime played a pretty large factor in this but RJ Barrett was back so he and quickly are both in there now for Toronto and and Scotty Barnes so the core is there  yakka Turtle got back up into the 30s and minutes he had a really nice ball game here I really would rather I want to talk about Dennis Schroder and Gary Trent Jr because those are the guys that I keep kind of bouncing back and forth on a little bit uh Schroeder was excellent in this one got 16 shots Gary Trent got 15 shots  we can't guarantee that they're gonna get that kind of opportunity on a night-to-night basis  but if the usage is at this rate even not in double overtime  those guys probably end up roster the trade deadline  and the reason we got there in this game is because Bruce Brown basically didn't get to play  and I have to believe  well some of that was I guess just sort of match up type stuff but some of it all was that the Raptors want to move Bruce Brown and the dumbest thing you can move or the dumbest thing you could do leading up to the deadline is hurt the guy that you're trying to trade  so they got him in there so that there were no Shenanigans but they're just gonna try to keep him healthy we know the Knicks are interested in brown we've heard the Lakers are interested in Bruce Brown we know the nuggets are interested in a reunion with Bruce Brown  there's a market out there and so the Raptors like look we're not gonna We're not gonna run you ragged here so quickly Barrett Barnes  pedal you guys get nuts a truant started which I think is notable um I'm not super high on either Trent or Schroeder but this game sort of gave me some some butterflies in my tummy as if to say okay Dan you weren't completely out of your mind to suggest that like sitting on Gary Trent is not the most insane thing and he was on our trade deadline stash list from from Saturday as a two-way guy that he's a two-way guy but maybe it's only one maybe it's just Bruce Brown that needs to get out of the way it just it kind of felt like he needed two guys when a game doesn't go to double overtime and perhaps that does end up being the case but it almost feels a little bit more like one and a half  after seeing this ball game maybe he's one and a half guys away  Minnesota blew out Houston so there aren't a ton of takeaways from this one getting a lot of questions on whether I'm in Thompson and Kim Whitmore can be fantasy assets the rest of this year my guess is no just based on the fact that they're not getting enough minutes consistently and I I didn't see anything here to make me move off of that  that's not to say that I don't like them as basketball players and fantasy players I think Whitmore in particular looks like he's going to have a really interesting Fantasy game  but there need to be minutes and then Jalen Greene was awful I still think he's a sell High  I don't know if you can after a bad ball game but you certainly could have after a few really big ones and I've again seen nothing to move me off of that posture I have no thoughts on the Timberwolves so let's keep moving again because we gotta go fast today  Milwaukee blew a big lead in Utah I mean this was a massive meltdown didn't you talk I think Utah put up 40 points in the fourth quarter and outscored the Bucks by like 27 or something ridiculous like that they look pedestrian at the moment let me go to the box score yeah I would score him 40 to 13  in the fourth quarter I think the Bucks were up let's see two 18 12 they're up 12 going into that fourth quarter yeah and lost by 15  yikes anyway no Brooke Lopez so Bobby Portis is your obvious stream there for Utah it was the bench that made the big run Larry Martin and got back in with the bench unit but Walker Kessler got a really nice game because of it can't take George had a really nice game because of it Kelly Olynyk had a better game because of it Jordan Clarkson was a little better because of it and so then you had you know John Collins still doubled but only 24 minutes he's been playing well lately at the center spot I talked about this on I think Friday's show that I was very late to notice that his minutes were coming at Center that's on me it should have been more obvious to me but I was blinded by the fact that it had so many bad ball games in a row but now that they're playing him at the five that's why you've seen the big rebounding uptick the field goal percent uptick I don't think all of it sticks for him but you I think you do kind of have to like the per minute stuff bump that Collins has had  but the short version of all this is this game didn't change my evaluation of anybody on the Jazz this was a game where the starters were getting blitzed the bench made a run and so you had kind of like a weird lineup for the Jazz through most of the fourth quarter  and that's why if you guys had better ball games  Portland was down a bunch of guys and somehow it made no difference Jabari Walker was still not very good as I said I think he's a three away  and this was actually a three away and it's still was it enough  no Brogden no sharp and no Grant and it still wasn't enough for Jabari Walker to get ten shots that was I think disconcerting and it's why he's basically the bottom of my deadlines watch board  at some point you might assume that like a Matisse Dibble either could get moved or shut down could Simon's I mean he's not an old guy DeAndre Aiden Maybe but then you'd expect someone like do a brief would be the the big jumper there and Aiden's missed a bunch of time already so unless he's actually hurt I don't think he's just gonna get  the plug pulled on him at least not until pretty late in the year so this is it like scoot the most inefficient game of all time Simon's and ayton had nice ones when granite comes back he'll do more and if Brogden gets moved and blah blah blah so again nothing really changes for me now Denver we may have our first actual Denver storyline in a long time kcp heard his hamstring I would assume this is gonna be more Payton Watson he played more in this ball game all those some of that was because Michael Porter Jr was not playing well but I I again would assume that Watson's gonna be the guy to step in if Casey Psy game or two I don't know that I'm adding Watson before we find out  and for Rodeo I don't think I'm adding him at all unless we hear that Casey's Gonna Miss like two weeks or more because I think I'd like to see what the Nuggets look like with Watson in there with all of the other high usage guys because it's not like what are the usage dudes what Down Casey p is not that  so watch list  is the short version which again I should be doing short version today while I'm trying to get in and out of here very quickly let's go back to Saturday what did I do it was that nine ball game so we're a little more than halfway done Brooklyn at Philly um Camp Thomas had a 40 Burger he is an amazing sell hi guy right now because you might be able to get like a top 50 type of dude coming back and we know cam Thomas is a great scorer on bad field goal percent  done typically rebound very much doesn't assist very much every once in a while I'll have a game where more stuff sort of falls into the right spot and look  that's not to say that his job isn't better here as a starter that it was coming off the bench it is  but he was like top two 50 Off the Bench and as a starter he can sometimes squeeze inside the top 100 as kind of like a one or two trick pony  that doesn't translate that great to nine cat Okay points League's fine you know you're doing things differently there I get it but nine he's always gonna be overvalued because he scores a lot  cam Johnson has been better lately um I feel less horrible about insisting you guys all hold him through the trade deadline  Ben Simmons had nine rebounds and five assists in 14 minutes but it does feel like this is going to be a very long ramp up for him so I don't I think I'm changing my position on Simmons I thought he needed to be stashed to see what he would look like I don't think he's ever gonna get to 30 minutes and if he does it's probably not gonna be for many weeks the way that they're going super gentle on him so I think you can part with Simmons he's gonna be a bigger headache than he's worth  Dorian Finney Smith is out but is also on the trade block or so Neil's on the trade block Spencer did Wheaties on the trade block if all of those guys get moved all so Dennis Smith Jr was hurt then maybe you get one eye on Lonnie Walker who scored 20 in this one but he suffers from sort of a similar ailment to Camp Thomas which is it's mostly points in threes  it's hard to get lonely Walker inside the nine Cat Board all so  I don't know did I summarized that okay  Paul Reed was sick on Saturday we didn't find that out until after the ball game hence the two points and four boards and 15 minutes he's still your fill in for Joel embiid we only need him to get to about 25 minutes a game to be a top 100 player and I think he can do it Kelly oubre is a start as a streamer as well to buy a serious what he comes back is going to be your guy but with Tyrese Maxey healthy you don't need to worry about Patrick Beverley who did have nine assists but his minutes are not going to be high enough to make it different Warriors lost to the Hawks in overtime Steph Curry had 60  fun little footnote that was flying across Twitter it's a third time this year that a team has had a 60-point score and lost and I think that had happened two times in like the previous 20 years or something  uh Andrew Wiggins left early so that meant more Brandon pajami in this one he had 39 minutes second good game in a row for him you can add him because we don't really know what the Wiggins story is gonna be you can drop Andrew Wiggins because there's no point in sitting on a maybe if he's hurt  and I would assume that he probably slides back into the starting five here Jonathan kaminga fouled out and 34 minutes he still did have 164 in three he is all so very much a cell hi guy he's playing very very well but he's also not gonna shoot 70% on high volume forever and when that levels off you're going to be glad that you cashed in for you know a 60 range guy or whatever you think you could get for him right now  if the best you can do is like top 100 you probably don't do it that's not good enough but again if you can get like a late fifth early six  late even late sixth kind of a guy I think I would probably do it for mingi and then pajam ski you can add him head-to-head you start him Roto you might want to wait and see but if he's sort of pulling out of this little rookie Tail Spin that he'd be worth while it's a start the Clint capela injury that we all knew was gonna happen eventually took a long time to happen but it did now finally happen he had a book big ball game prior to it but he heard his core it's a core injury so okongwu  all the way to the moon and back it is go time Pontiac and 22 and 16 with a couple of blocks in this ball game he's a top 50 guy as a starter  enjoy  no saddiq Bey the honorary Hunter is being eased back in at just 16 minutes I think Hunter could end up as a post deadline winner if he can get back up to start his minutes I guess that's sort of the big question mark there  Jayla Johnson colossal ballgame Trey Young's been running very hot right now that's part of why the Hawks have won if you ball games in a row  we kind of just need to see who gets moved on this team but as far as the deadline goes we know Dean Murray's on the Block  and if he moves that just opens up even more for these other guys  which you know I guess Sadiq Bay if he comes back could end up being cringy again somehow  hold him here he's gonna be friendship but I'll go is the big story after this ball game  Kings beat the Bulls trade Lyle's came out in nowhere and you can ignore that Malik monk after I just got done saying that I was ready to drop him on Friday he posted two good ball games in a row so monk stuffed it in my mug and you can go ahead and make sure he's back on rosters I gave him as long as I freaking could I mean he was bad for like three or four weeks in a row and then all the sudden as soon as I was like fine I give up that he exploded  yeah my sinuses are still screwed up  for the Bulls you start the starters right now easy call Oh Hey Kevin herder keep an eye on whether his heaters running out here with monk sort of heating back up again  we do her was not gonna last forever he's a stream while warm guy he might not be warm anymore  I badly need to pause the show to blow my nose but we're just gonna make it through we talked to Milwaukee all ready Dallas Luka doncic's questionable he had his ankle kind of rolled up on in this ball game but Kyrie Irving sounds like he'll be back for their next one so if one of those two guys is out you can play Tim Hardaway Jr if they're both back I wouldn't play anybody besides Luca and Tim Hardaway Maxi Kleberg got the big Center started this one but it was were Sean Holmes in the previous game which means you can't really trust any of them sure you could flip a coin and go with whoever starts but there's no guarantee that dude plays more than 22 minutes  I don't care about Josh Green's big ball game I mean it was nice but it's not something that you can put stock in nightly if it could it would have happened a few times before this one  Cleveland still kind of trying to get the pieces all fit together Jared Allen played through an ankle injury in this one we'll see if he's available I think he was at practice so I'm hopeful Max Drews is becoming a much harder hold right now every time it seems like he's about to get things back together something disrupts it and at a certain point even I've got to be like look maybe maybe it's just not meant to be from the field goal percentage standpoint because he's at 40% right now and all we really need is like 40 to  be fine  and I keep saying look he's gonna get back to 42 he's got to get back to 402 he might not get back to 42 I would say try to continue holding onto Street if you can because I do still think he probably does get back to 40% and I think he'll get 11 shots of ball game but again the team is trying to work the pieces back in time of Mitchell Evan Mobley Jared Allen they all took a crap ton of shots in this one we don't care it's the verts Fantasy game won't support being held if he doesn't have big usage so he's a guy that I think will be able to drop here Spruce this is the first day I felt more like 50/50 on him  because I just  maybe he doesn't get to 42%  the nice thing is  even even sort of bad Max Drew so still typically getting you a few boards a few assists a steal half a block some threes  it's that damn field goal percent that's really sagging things for him  Jeremy Sohan slowed considerably for the Spurs I still think he's a sell High what he's rolling and you know I know that kind of puts me on an island but it is what it is  that's just how I feel about I don't think he magically became a way better basketball player overnight he is definitely better as I've said in this role with Trey Jones at point and you know him getting set up and not having to run the point guard spot but he's still so hot and I don't think his percentage is just sort of fixed himself  Lakers beat the beat up Nick's they're still down ogn and nobody hey Julius Randle it probably took a little more than it should have but give the Knicks a lot of credit they've been winning games even without their guys this actually snapped I believe in nine-game win streak for New York  so with or without their dudes they've been finding a way  for the Knicks  you can start the starters right now I don't know if that's going to be the case when OG well what OG comes back you probably can still start the starters depending on who who's in and who's out let me let me try this a different way  pressure that she was the one that you're considering not starting  even if heart goes to the bench I still prefer him over precious when OG comes back there that was clearer  for the Lakers brought in add were back their questionable for the game in Charlotte I don't know how the Lakers can consider resting someone right now they basically need to win every ball game they play they're the nine seed a game up on Utah one game back in the Mavericks they have a path it's an outside one but they have a path to maybe get out of the play in but more than anything they just got to be focused on getting into the upper half of the play in so  like can you really screw around with a gimme game I would assume there guys play and if they do yes really hot tomorrow is in with the starters it didn't really make them any better uh so you're going 80 LeBron Reeves and D-Lo you're not extending beyond that as long as the main dudes are there and now let's play the game we always play on this show which is did anybody not play Friday or Saturday or Sunday and the answer is  yes  and it was the Pelicans think we're the only team that didn't play Saturday or Sunday  you guys know where I stand on the Pelicans and I don't think I even need to go to a box score to tell you where I stand on the Pelicans is  too many of the  Fringe or guys are eating from each other's buckets so if Trey young or sorry Trey Murphy is out you can start her Jones right now herb is out so you can start Trey Murphy even if they're not great on sort of the game to game those two guys you need one out to play the other kind of the same story for JV and Larry Nance I know I keep thinking with my heart on the Larry Nance one but the truth is he's not gonna value if valentina's in there and Val and Judas will have value if they says in but it won't be as good and then obviously with Nance out for a couple ball games JVS been a bit better very quickly here on the week ahead because I know this is supposed to be a weekly preview show as well  but it's trade deadline week meaning you have to approach this week differently  meaning and I know that this is been said many times and I say it every year  but  it needs to be said again  don't use your moves before deadline day  don't use your moves  before deadline day if you're

ethos.com all so of course hey go into the show description Focus the trade deadline live show three days away where it's 696 thumbs up on that thing I think we can get to 700 I think 750 would probably be my end goal we'll do some giveaways related to that that show again is on Thursday at 7:30 a.m. again if you're new please do check out stuff in the show description I know that's this sort of like the standard thing that a YouTube host or show host or whatever says but we've got our free Discord Link in there we've got the deadline show Link in there we've got links to our sponsors in there the Discord is a lot of fun it sort of just people helping people and again it's the there's a free side to it I've done some of my tweet storms in there lately that you can only then get on the free side of Discord trying some new stuff out so I'd love it if you guys would check out some of those links in the show description but again  like  you know you look at the week ahead here  you're going to want if you're in a head-to-head format you're good to want your moves for Thursday morning  because you know like one trade happens at 9 a.m. on Thursday morning Pacific time and you're like I gotta go pick up this guy and then 25 minutes later another trade happens with that same team and the guy you picked up is worthless  you're gonna want all four on Thursday  unless you are like the seven seed in your head to head League and so you just like you can't possibly afford to lose five for this week and you absolutely positively need to have to win or your team is dead meat you need to hold your head-to-head moves until Thursday morning  Roto on the other hand you don't have to worry about streaming to fill roster slots so it's sort of a different monster you don't have a weekly moves cap most likely but for Roto you're probably taking your bench slots this week or at least one or two of them and you're looking at the trade deadline possible winners list which again we did a show on that just a couple days ago on Saturday so I would if you guys have a moment to go back there and check out that show from Saturday please go do it  I think it was a lot of fun I covered  I covered 12 players I tried to rank them to the best of my ability it's the show that's on the homepage of our YouTube page here which is youtube.com slash Sports ethos you can find it on traditional pod feeds by just going back to the last show before this one so shouldn't be all that hard to find but we went through all these names that it have some measure of appeal some of them harder to acquire than others like you're not gonna be able to get a Kangoo now with capella going down but he I thought was a by low a week ago prior to the deadline what are some of the other names that that I kicked around on that show on on Saturday the the full list was a Congo who you're not gonna be able to get just soon moo who you probably can't get right now either because he's starting Marvin Bagley I think is interesting and he's hurt right now but if Gafford gets moved he jumps into a big role Dennis Smith Jr same story if Spencer Dinwiddie gets moved he could see himself jumping up the board Schroeder and Gary Trent are interesting Patrick Williams in Chicago let's say that he comes back Levine we know is out for the year now by the way so I was doing that show and then like 20 minutes later the Zach Levine out for the season news broke so Patrick Williams could be interesting if the Bulls move Caruso or DeRozan that's a big deal and then he and assume will be fun so the Bulls the Wizards  the Hawks the Nets the Raptors these are teams are your sort of like laser focused  and in terms of like  again you're not going to be able to just go get a Kong to sumu even like a Jordan Poole you're probably not gonna be able to pick up but you could maybe buy two of those guys or Patrick Williams you might be able to pick up it wouldn't be insane uh to stash Patrick Williams Because let's say DeMar DeRozan gets traded  suddenly there's all the usage in the universe and that's what he's needed so he and to Sumo would be monsters  you should be able to add Marvin Bagley in a lot of League's  Gary Trent Jr is very addable again a sealing a little bit more limited on that side but again if you're on the road oh side of things you're looking to see okay well what could my team need post deadline  I have said a number of times I think hula believe is two players away I think  and again I might even be three just for consistency sake but a lot of the guys at the deadline this year are two moves away so Patrick Williams two moves away now it's one because Levine is out for the year so he moves way up the board  just don't move is all so way up the board because of the The Lovin out for the season news so now we don't even need him to get traded so now it's one move away in Chicago for those guys to last all year  long was one move away and now Capella's hurt so he's Zero moves away bagley's one move away Jordan Poole might be like one move ish away hard to say but cool beliefs probably too Dennis Smith Juniors probably two moves away  shooter and Gary Trent as we mentioned earlier like 1.5 DeAndre Hunter is like one and a half moves away Jabari Walker and Azure Thompson are more like three moves away  and so again if you're on road and you've got a slot you think about some of those guys who you could pick up maybe you go try to trade for some of them if you can on the cheap and and see how the whole thing shakes out and then it would be important I think to talk about Joel embiid before we wrap up today's show entirely we mentioned him kind of in passing when we talked about the Sixers ball game  we don't have an official timeline on embiid even still even still we don't have it at official time line news did break yesterday that he's going to undergo a procedure whatever that means and there is hope that he can return this season I don't know if that means  regular season I don't know if that means playoffs but up I would be floored if we saw embiid what's 6 weeks from today one two three four five six that'd be March 18th I don't think there's any chance he plays before then I think there's a very real chance he's out for the rest of the regular season but I also think the thing you got to do here is number one add Paul Reed because you'll be a top 100 Centerville  just wait they're gonna have to give a timeline at some point here I don't think it's going to be much longer he's the reigning MVP he was probably gonna be the MVP this year before you got hurt so what Shams all these guys they're gonna be digging  they know people need to know more and they're going to be digging on it and they're gonna give us whatever the team gives them  I call it a coin flip  we see him beat anywhere during the regular season at this point 50/50  meaning I don't think you can drop him if your league goes to the end of the regular season if your league and three weeks early you can almost definitely drop him  your league might not even let you drop him because he's a first rounder so they think you know you're trying to muddy the waters there but again if you're in a rodeo goes to the end you hold if you're in a head-to-head League that goes to the end so like a Yahoo publicly you hold because you need to see what happens you can't like FNB MBT is obviously a player that's so good that you would stat you'd stash him for eight weeks if you had to for probably a half a season if you had to but certainly if it's like if there's any chance he's back in six you absolutely need to hold so try to wait see what's happening here let's not freak out yet we just got a hold a little bit longer find get it let's get a timeline on this but I had Paul Reed in the interim and that is I think basically our show very quick glance over at the chat room to make sure that you guys didn't bring up a player that I forgot to oh tari Easton he said he's close  I like to our Easton a lot I don't think he's gonna play a ton of minutes right away because they're gonna ease him back in so even if he played by midweek let's say I don't think he'll have fantasy value for probably another week to week and a half after that so just make sure if you are stashing tari Eason don't expect much out of him until maybe more like February 15th or so  I like him a lot I love his Fantasy game I just want to try to make sure that everybody's expectations are kind of held in check here  is Ben Simmons worth holding my answer that I think is a no is Andre Drummond a League winner if he gets traded to Philly I don't think he'd play well I don't think Nick nurse is gonna play Andre Drummond more than about 22 23 minutes of ball game so I don't know about League winner because he's also got awful at the free-throw line and just a super weird Fantasy game  he would be an ad if he gets traded there but I think you're probably looking at more like you know top 100 top 120 range because he won't have the energy to do what he did you know he filled in for vouch for like a week and he put up some giant numbers he'd have to pace himself a little bit more so very much an ad if Drummond gets traded somewhere where his minutes get into the 20s  and very much and if wooch gets traded all the that feels like a little bit more of a long shot I don't think I'm stashing Drummond because I don't know that the  I don't know that he's like a definitely getting traded kind of guy but he certainly somebody to watch so good name to throw out there good call by hunkus here in the stash room and  is kante Georgia stash know he played big minutes yesterday because the bench unit went nuts it and that I gotta wrap it up guys I gotta get my wife off to work we're all flooded in here I'm gonna do my best to get over to social today in some capacity there will definitely not be a second show today thank you to the over 100 of you that were
