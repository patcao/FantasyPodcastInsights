welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I've really begun  letting that song run its full course at the beginning of these shows you guys gotta hear the voice at the end it doesn't really  I guess folks listening after the fact probably don't get quite that same experience but that's okay we're all we're all good here happy Tuesday to you all hoping to make this a two-four I think we'll have a Buy Low show this afternoon if everything goes according to scheduling plans this of course is our Monday recap show I am Dan Vespers and this is fantasy NBA today a sports presentation find me on social at Dan best press or just Google search Dan from sports or Dan from hoop ball our old name  and you know include the word Twitter probably in there somewhere in will pop right up Sports ethos on Twitter is at ethos fantasy BK the website is sports ETA OS Comm make sure to check them out as well they've got amazing amazing stuff going on over there and obviously this podcast is one of those amazing stuffs he said to confidently with his hands on his side's you all may have been wondering where the hell was Dan yesterday on Sunday I did yesterday's show which I actually think went relatively well I'm not gonna have time to do that every Sunday but if there's an opportunity to do so it makes some sense the only problem of course is that most weekends were not going to have all the games done by Friday night  most of the time if I'm doing a Monday recap show or a recap show on Monday  we're gonna need to wait until the stuff happens that ends about Sunday about give or take  a few half an hour's around 8:30 Pacific time  which for those of us who have multiple children in the house you guys fully aware I talk about that all the time  that's not exactly a great time for me to try to pop on a live show that's right around kid bed time anyway yesterday why the hell was Dan why did you do a show why would the schedule all kakami  well my seven year old had a birthday in mid-november and we asked him  okay you got a choice do you want to do a birthday party  here's the and of course my wife and I are like cringing at the idea not that we don't love throwing our kids a birthday party it's just that he has friends from elementary school he has friends still from preschool a couple years ago he has friends from a baseball team we have I have about 4500 so you like you're always at the risk of excluding someone  and then you got invite the kids parents because they're not old enough for this for most of them to just drop their kids at a birthday party these days that'll be at some point relatively soon and that'll thin out parties a bit but right now all of a sudden now we're talking about  I don't know 40 50 kids from all these different walks  all these different universities  then yeah the parents then yeah the family and you're talking about like an 80 to 100 person party in our apartment Courtyard  so we're offering that to the kid my wife and I are going please Lord don't pick this one your other choice we said young man is you pick your best friend  and we take you both to Disneyland  we leave your little brother at home  because we don't want him slowing you down this is your day and thank the good Lord kiddo picked a day at Disneyland but of course  that meant trying to figure out when it might fit  well he hadn't missed a single day of school the entire year school started in August 4 months in kid had missed a single day not one I mean he had a cold or two in there but he just powered through it took some nasal spray and boom off he went tough little customer  so this is first day of school the entire year yesterday because Mom and Dad took him to Disneyland and it was  pretty awesome actually  this is one of those things you learn as your kids get older when you try to take them to an amusement park and they're like three it's a little bit fun but mostly it's just exhausting now I'll admit I'm completely cooked my legs my hips my back all parts of me feel like I just ran a marathon I think that's what it feels like to run a marathon for a normal fit individual I'm not one of those by the way I don't care if you guys are sick of these stories in the beginning of the show I don't do these very much anymore and today I just freaking felt like it so too bad I'm gonna get some thumbs Downs on today's pod cast but whatever  so it was really cool we got there we had to drop are younger son off at preschool and then the nanny slash babysitter picked him up and took care of him all afternoon and evening but that also meant that we got slightly later started we wanted to so we didn't get there till like 9:00  which anybody that's a Disneyland Enthusiast is like no you got to get there at opening because that's when there's like 80 people in the whole Ballpark and ballpark somebody's got Sports on the brain the whole amusement park  and that's when you can just run onto whatever ride you want to run on because by the middle of the day it's nuts just throngs even on a freaking weekday a school day how these other all these other people were there their kids only hadn't missed a single day in four months fee on them I say  my seven year old is also a little bit of a thrill seeker which was a good a good bonus which meant that he picked a friend who was all one so they wanted to actually do the rides that are kind of interesting even for adults so that was really cool personally I never really done these Star Wars land  I know it's been up for open for like three or four years now but like how many how often I know I'm from Los Angeles but how many times you actually go to Disneyland it's freaking expensive  Star Wars latest pretty cool actually did rise of the resistance ride for the first time that was  kind of mind blowing  so that's why everything yesterday was was gone there was just no way I was going to be able to do anything from Disneyland and by the time we got home we were all just completely destroyed so this morning I was able to go through a research all the stuff get everything kind of resituate storm didn't come until this morning on social that's why this show isn't happening until like an hour later here so apologies for the slightly later release that's what was going on with Dan and family yesterday let's do some fantasy basketball today  it's time we've waited you've we've all waited long enough let's talk about everything that happened on a wild Monday give you a quick little Tuesday preview but frankly  almost everybody played yesterday so we'll we'll cover almost all of that  Indiana beat Detroit one Thirty One to One 23 also a mere asks did you hit Space Mountain absolutely that was what my kid was lusting for was Space Mountain  because we went one other time while he's been alive and he was too short for it they actually recently lowered the height limit on Space Mountain but we couldn't tell him that because that it was like well what are you waiting for all this time loved it loved it  I I forgot how fast some of these things go  he started to get older and you're you're equilibrium is not as good I'm sitting there going oh my God I'm gonna jelly like these damn things and my kids just like grinning ear to ear eyes as big as the sun as hares blowing back and dads like oh all right so anyway Indiana be Detroit 131 123 bennedict mathurin had a Mondo game Off the Bench 30.7 boards eight assists and a couple of steals  he's gonna get grabbed a bunch of leaks and I'm here to tell you that even though he's the cover art for today's podcast I am not adding him after one big ball game I would love it if matheran somehow turned into this Majestic scoring beast but here's the thing he's starting behind or he's playing behind Obi topping who's the starter  topping was fine like he was bad in this ball game Madden went nuts and so that just meant that he took toppings minutes but On Any Given night that flips back the other way and most of the time it's been Obi topping like lately  I would like to see this happen at least one more time before I make a move on and on Benedict I get it if you want to try to get out in front of it I just feel like we've sort of seen enough of a body of work there to know this is not a thing that happens every ball game and if it starts to then we change our stance  we were wondering after the injury to Marvin Bagley while the Pistons would handle the not really having any competent centers left and the the answer that we expected was also indeed the one that happened which is that Isaiah Stewart shifted up to play the five I know he didn't do much in this ball game but if he's the center on this team he should probably be rostered  we've seen it a couple of times pocket marked over the last you know whatever it is year when he gets to play the five big minutes the rebounding numbers go up the defensive stats typically are a little bit better he didn't have any in this ball game but the field goal percentage usually a little bit better as well that probably is enough to get Isaiah Stewart over the streamable cut line he's not a not a juicy option but he's also not really a bad one anymore  I was our Thompson slid back into play power forward so he's at least for the moment I guess back out of the dog house or whatever you want to call it does he have enough adrenaline to kind of rev it back up again might as well add if he got dropped he probably he was held in most League's  I thought he was going to be a Buy Low when he was sort of getting phased out for a little bit  I don't know what the hell he is right now he's a play if he's starting basically he's no longer a buy low because he just got slotted in Jaylyn Duran's out for a couple of weeks we might see Bagley well I mean we'll see just sort of stay tuned on that front but that's the the pivot here for Detroit Wizards God blown out  now you can do is go into these ball games and hope the Wizards can actually maintain some sort of contact with the team they're playing against and they most certainly did not hear  so the usuals were generally kind of bad kuzma had 21 and 9 which is at least sort of salvaged the game and everybody's gonna like right he's so at 21 points so that means everything's fine guess what guys kuzma's down to number 93 in nine cat now mostly because the free throw percent is coming down just the way we knew it would it was like one of the easiest calls ever  when he was top 60 I screamed sell when he was top 70 I yelled sell  when he was top 75 top 80 I yelled sell  because guys at that stage of their career generally don't just magically flip a switch and percentage is get better  just doesn't happen unfortunately for kuzma and I like the fact that he's getting a lot of usage but unfortunately for kuzma he's still running above his career Norms in percentages so there's still an opportunity for him to fall farther in nine cat I am also somewhat tired of arguing with folks on Twitter about what Bilal could believe is this year and what he is and I'm not going to just change my stance because he has a game where I don't even know what are we saying this game was this was a this was a serviceable result  serviceable ain't good enough for me  13 points is subleague average eight rebounds is a positive for assist is just barely above League average  one steel okay one block great okay I like both two threes I mean two threes a steal a little block that's good but he's also been shooting 50% at the free throw line is turnovers are very high  he has all the making of a future fantasy asset how many times have I said that on this pot now 20  he's not great yet  I think he's good to be pretty good I don't know why we can't hold these two thoughts in our head at the same time if you can afford to stash him  I still don't think that you have to  he thought I was gonna go a different direction with that one I don't think there's a guarantee that cool to believe is putting up nine cats like solid enough Nine Cats stats this season he's number one seventy five right now in about 27 minutes per game when he's getting up near one near 30 minutes per game he pushes inside the top 150 but barely if the Wizards start pulling the plug on people Jordan Poole gets yanked off cosma gets yanked whatever then you start to see enough shots that's the thing that changes it  globalized averaging six and a half shots a game right now and 11 in this ball game was certainly much closer to what you'd call sort of a nine cat playable Line This was close to it but the bad percentages and high turnovers is the thing that sort of weighing this one down he's getting 11 shots of ball game he's probably started on the head-to-head side  consistently but this isn't happening consistently wrote All I don't know that he gets there ever this year  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run at end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop

ever because people are going to be like wait he said ever and then he said this year after that this year I don't know that he gets there this year I think he will be a fantasy play at some point in the future based on sort of the outlines of the fantasy game you can see because then these young guys they start to fix their field goal percent they may be fixed their free throw the turnovers get better the things that young players struggle with slowly improve and you can already see there's a making of some other stuff there  but I need him take him more than six and a half shots of ball game I need to make sure he's actually on the floor for 30 minutes a night which isn't the case necessarily in their competitive ball games and they're still waiting on to line right to come back so same thing second verse same as the first  I think Kelly oubre is probably still worth the grab on the Sixers side I know he wasn't great in this ball game you only played 18 minutes which is a downside but this ball game was also one of the most severe blowouts of the Year top three blowouts I think so it's kind of hard to see who was gonna get extra minutes they're not gonna run Kublai Kublai Kelly oubre how many names did I have to Mush together for that one guys I'm a little tired today they're not gonna rush into extra minutes when they don't have to write now as he works his way back from again this sort of nebulous car bicycle walk pedestrian accident that we don't fully understand but whatever he was hurt  I still like him as the bench Gunner and a game where they actually need any of that he'll be quite useful but this game was out of hand so let's not read too much into it  he beat the Hornets the zombie heat there's still missing at a bio there's still missing Tyler Herold they're missing  Heisman bits and pieces remain of this ball Club Duncan Robinson was great remember after he had the worst ball game of the entire year I said I know it's a very hard time for me to say he's still very much a stream but he's very much a stream and you know this is the sort of bounce back effort there Kevin Love has put up a couple of decent lines lately I don't think I can bring myself to trust him Caleb Martin has sort of jumped over Josh Richardson and Jaime jacquez in terms of who you can trust as the fill-in power forward for this team not that Richardson was playing power forward but call it like wingy  wingy filling the non Duncan Robinson ones  I still think Kyle Lowry's probably streamable while Tyler Heroes out I still think Orlando Robinson is probably streamable while both bam and Highsmith they're out  and then I don't think I'm streaming Hawks anymore I do feel like I like the efficiency put up in this ball game but the peripheral stats of completely fallen off a cliff and I think some of that is just sort of the grind of an NBA game on a rookie and he's starting to lose a little bit of the  the adrenaline the Ozark Thompson adrenaline  a perfect example of how you kind of saw that happen and it it happens all these young guys unavoidable almost  so I having a season to just bulk up in the NBA like Chet Holmgren has is actually turning out to be really good for his stamina  on the Hornet side no Mark Williams so Nick Richards seemed like he was going to be a really good start he didn't do much in this one but anytime Richards is the starting center you play him because it balances out too good enough  and then the rest of the starters are go the one player that's kind of been back and forth for me is PJ Washington  who was just good enough in this ball game mostly because of the block shot and like neither of percentages was good but neither was all that bad  I think PJ's a go and head to head I think Rotel I'm too nervous to spend a game's gap on him right now even though probably like it won't be bad  I just I feel like we can do better Cavaliers had nothing in this ballgame they shot 35% as a team Donovan Mitchell was unfortunately part of the problem in this one Darius Garland was quite good he's been playing a lot better after his very slow start to the year my good friend Max Drew's finally had a bad ball game he was sort of overdue for one clunker but don't worry too much about it it dropped him like 10 slots and rankings overall this year he's been great this was just a bad field goal percent ball game and I wouldn't read too much into it he also had foul trouble in the first half and then you know just sort of mixing and matching as the game went on Jared Allen fouled out in 15 minutes if you want to talk about a possible like one night by low opportunity this would be that opportunity  for the magic go go batad say now with two good ball games in a row every time I come on air and I say go good and moving to decided that neither one wants to do anything then goes like yes I do and he has one or two good games I still think in general you can probably ignore the center battle while Wendell Carter Junior is out for the magic but as has been the case but today is the better play between the two of them he's number 102 on the season he has a solid week which is in right now and then he has an atrocious week and that's kind of been happening for the last four weeks in a row if you can figure out when one is gonna happen versus the other congratulations  I personally can't this ball game screamed difficult day for Go-Go but there was no Evan Mobly and then Jared Allen picked up a bunch of fouls and that sort of changed the way the Ballgame went better news on the magic side Jalen Suggs is back already I did not expect that with the way he went down  fire him up  if you got him basically to quote the great Rick Moranis in Spaceballs  smoke if you got him Toronto Dennis Schroder had his first good ball game in a while that'll push him back up the board he was down outside the top 130 this moved him back to number 110 in nine cat and the big reason why forget this the points and assists he's been able to do that most of the year the steals the four steals was a big float for him oh Gianna nobe a good ball game certainly we expect more defensive stuff from him but he's up to number 86 now that's up about 25 slots from when we had him on the Bi-Lo board that's good news and that's it for Toronto for the next I mean every time I try to quit you Josh Hart you go and you put up a great ball game like this and I just keep going back and forth  he's number one 23 on the season  but he's also been better over the last month than the first month  was that was RJ Barrett being out though and it's pretty it's almost impossible actually this point two really great out what Josh Hart is when RJ Barrett is healthy  he's been on a heater lately so that's sort of artificially inflating the numbers hardest number 67 over the last two weeks be shooting 66% that's not a sustainable number if that 66% was more like 48 49.50 or something in that range then his 7.3 shots  and I didn't do much damage  in a good way I meant in this one the two three-pointers come down the points per game comes down the field goal percent impact comes down any Falls probably outside the top 100 so I think I'm gonna stick with my valuation on Josh Hart which is  yes you can basically you can definitely play them on the head to head side he's been good enough to do that if you need rebounds or add a position rebounds and generally better feel goal percent that you get from most shooting guards  but overall like if I can I feel comfortable deploying him against the games cap onto Roto side I don't make me wait too nervous now a guy that I do feel comfortable deploying in Rhode Island Isaiah who just stepped into a fantastic spot  Mitchell Robinson's ankle situation turned out to be worse than expected he's out for two months yikes  that makes Mitchell Robinson by the way very hard to hold if you don't have an open IL slot for whatever that's worth I know it's really difficult to drop a center that had been performing well but two months is a long time to sit on a guy if it's gonna cost you a zeros you're probably sort of soul on that one but heart and I know he didn't start I don't care Jericho Sims started when Sims is playing well he's gonna get this many minutes 2021 Harvest Time just gonna generally be soaking up the bulk of the minutes he can more than put up fantasy value in 2526 a ball game last year we heard he was playing through some foot stuff sounds like Isaiah is healthy this year he should be on every fantasy team because you got two months of probably top 100 or better  and that's that's a guy you want you know you're getting like a free eighth rounder basically out of this  Denver beat Atlanta Julian strawther  yeah I didn't see that one coming if you did congrats and if you think it's gonna happen again  yep Denver is basically the starting five  starters had some light shooting issues in this one outside of the you know the main two if you want to call them that I guess you know Aaron shot the ball well so sorry and lump you in with their everybody else yolk and she was good Jamal Murray was good tweaked and ankle and played through it hard to know if he's gonna have to miss a game just you know this feels like it's sort of one of those years right now for Jamal which is not that surprising after a championship run guys do tend to have weird follow-up seasons  keep an eye on that you might get a you know one night stand at a Reggie Jackson kind of deal kcp Michael Porter Jr both shot the ball terribly they'll presumably be better in the next one  Bogdan bogdanovich meanwhile put up a 40 Burger on the Atlanta side  that's this really something he's having himself a dream season so far he's number 42 in nine cat and just everything is going right he's still getting bunch of steals yet 103 pointers in this game  that's wild and of course I'm against him in one of my old lady very rare head-to-head leaks of course  in any event it doesn't change much he's still a sell High because you know at some point that he's gonna act up it hasn't yet so keep bride and  but I mean right now again he's 40 and with every good game what you can get back gets closer and closer to where he's at right now you could probably get like a top 65 guy back for both dumped on it you probably do it but if he has two or three more good ball games you could aim even higher  that's the dice roll I guess  I can't tell you what to do exactly but I can tell you what to consider doing  I know that's really  planting my flag in that one  hey before we get to Chicago and Milwaukee I want to quickly remind you guys that well Hanukkah still rolling right now and

button subscribe if you're new I promise this stuff is going to be helpful for you there's a reason that folks keep coming back and it's because we are generally dunking on people I had one I think 2021 was not that great of a season  because all of the like slightly risky end of first early second rounders didn't pan out oh that's where we often take a few swings and so when that doesn't work then I'm not gonna have the greatest of teams but every other year that plan has worked the old man squad is is just destroying right now so keep coming back if you could by hitting like And subscribe and hopefully we can hang out a bit more know Alex Caruso for the Bulls obviously know exactly Levine he's out for a while yet meaning that Kobe White's Just Gonna Keep destroying here while that's going on DeMar DeRozan at 41 in this ball game that's gonna make him a more difficult by low and 11 assists vouch was fine if un spectacular Andre Drummond actually had a pretty good game Off the Bench but you know gonna read too much into that Tori Craig fouled out in 29 minutes and I I sort of use all of those little data points to to note again that Patrick willms when Levine and Caruso are both out he's probably playable in all formats when only one of those two guys is out specifically Zach LaVine so if sitting right on the borderline and makes more sense  as kind of a stash to see what happens to the Bulls  the problem right now is that this morning a report came out that the Bulls are now looking for win now players which okay does that mean that they're gonna sit on Zach LaVine all of a sudden I lose um  it's weird let's just let's call it weird that also means that if they trade Zach LaVine they're looking to get NBA level Talent back not picks and throwaways that's not great news for the stash appeal of Patrick Williams it's definitely not good news for the Statue of Iota sumo  and unfortunately and he's rolling right now it's also not great news for Kobe white if they bring back somebody who you know is a point guard shooting guard type not that they're gonna take his job or anything but anybody that comes back would be bad news for  everybody because you just create more lug Jimmy Miss that's a thing that's a real word I'm sure of it  anyway just keep an eye on it the Patrick William stash appeal did kind of decrease a little bit this morning no I think we have to be on with ourselves on that one  for the Bucs the only thing I want to point out in this box game because you guys know my feeling on Bobby Portis sees a points rebounds only guy which means he's not really playable in most formats had to head schedule stream the actual thing I wanted to point out was Chris Middleton getting 33 minutes and I hope that doesn't break his body but perhaps he's ready to be more than a headache we're only two months into the season maybe now I'm so glad we dodged him everywhere thank the good Lord  bucks got pretty lucky in this ball game they were able to win it with Damian Lillard have a having a terrible terrible game  damn is a little bit of a Bilo right now actually shooting only 42% from the field that's the number that I do think ticks up when you sort of comes after this ball game so he sort of at a low in field goal percent most of the time he's gonna be much better than this and so  I don't know what it would take to get him but I might try  Pelicans beat the wolves are not surprisingly better with CJ McCollum back here's your surprise surprise the Lakers thumped him in the in-season tournament but overall this team is much more dangerous  don't get them too much credit certainly Minnesota was without their best player Anthony Edwards is back out again with that hips issue  nasri is a stream of Wally super hot right now absolutely that continues were into week two of the nas Reid megastream Rudy gobert slowed back down and we don't worry too much about that Carla Town's fouled out and  now we're back in a situation where the Pelicans are basically at start the starters and then Trey Murphy  I think does still belong as a stash because typically up to in as few games back he's been getting enough shots to just barely have all formats value  but I've said it before and I'll say it again all of his value last year all the good we saw  came when stars were out  this is really four times last year the Pelicans were healthy this is really the first time we're getting a chance to look at this team fully healthy  in like  13 months  and Marin lies the rub Trey Murphy doesn't rebound or pass all that much he's basically an efficient 3-point specialist  who gets a defensive stat every once in a while  is that going to be enough I think the answer is still barely yes  but I also don't think that he has the runway at least again while the teams healthy to get anywhere near where he got last year and that's that sort of up and down of the whole situation oh the Spurs you're clever tanking does not amuse us Wendy started at the five again you just racking up blocks right now 18 rebounds five blocks for weapon Yama that's pretty amazing  not so great for everybody else in this ballgame Devin cell was very bad  Jeremy Sohan was very very bad Malachi Branham was I guess fine Kelvin Johnson was okay shot awfully from the field but at least he just free throws and had four steals to kind of float his value Zack Collins who actually played well coming off the bench in the last ball game did nothing Off the Bench in this one trade Jones had a bunch of minutes in the last ball game he only got 16 and a half and this one  oh it's ugly man it's ugly and Spurs town it's when Ben versus the universe right now  so when he's doing fine he's number 27 is Big rebound and blocks games are sort of pushing him back up the board he had fallen and outside the top 40 prior to the last couple at Center Zach Collins is now outside the top one 60 I think you probably hang on a little bit longer to see if they drop him back into the starting lineup but if he's not in there for a couple of games and he's really only gonna get like I mean this this felt like a an outlier and number of minutes on the low side but if he'll it really does only end up in like the 2324 range that won't be enough  so hold a little bit longer  but not indefinitely  and you guys know my feeling on most of these guys when they have a good ball game I think you try to sell  because again there's so much tankage going on there's so many guys with inefficiency going on Devon sales now number one 13 in nine cat  you can yell at me all you want I like Devin vassell as a basketball player but from a fantasy standpoint it's free throw percent holds him back his lack of rebounding and not that many assists kind of holds him back the steals I'd love to see get a little bit higher and it's possible maybe his minutes do Trend up because he's been sort of like on and off the injured list  I just don't think there was ever a chance that he got into that 60 range as the teams currently constructed  I avoided almost everyone in this person I had a couple of Zach Collins because I figured all right why not draft him at like one tan and see what happens and for a while it looked like it was gonna be a win now with all the tankage going on I don't know if it is anymore  yup  keep saying the same thing about this person and that is basically the word yuck tari Eason 26 and a half minutes yet 18 and 14 two steals two three-pointers if we had any kind of guarantee that this dude was gonna get 25 or more minutes a night he'd be an auto ad and frankly I think you should check your wire to see if he's available because he's one of those guys where you kind of want to be out in front of it if it's gonna start to stick  I have no guarantee that it will is the most minutes he's played in any ball game all year previous high was 22 minutes against the Thunder two games before this one but he has a great rebounding rate he has a solid defensive stat rate  I think it prudent Universe we could wait one more game to see if it happens again and then make the ad  but fantasy League's are not always brewed in meaning if you need to get out in front of it you should probably try to get out in front of it if you think you can hold off and it'll be okay then  okay that's the choice you make on that one  well I Dallas is banged up aren't they Derek Jones Junior went down six minutes into this one  we'll see if he's back quickly he was on his way to seemingly a pretty good ball game but we'll never know Kyrie is out great Williams was still out Josh Green was still out Maxi clima still out now Derek Jones's out  meaning Lucas obviously start we're back to sort of Luca lifting an entire team onto his shoulders which great short-term not a great long-term  Derek Lively is an obvious play  he's amazing right now  Jaden Hardy got to play for the first time basically all Year Seth Curry got the start but only played 20 minutes  we're at a point now though we're the team so thin that you can probably stream Curry for threes and donate some for some stuff in a bunch of different things  because that Sims played well for two and a half ball games now and unless a couple guys come back for Dallas it feels like there's enough space for him to be a play  our last show on Sunday I said I don't think  I could add some because I thought Derek Jones would play obviously an entire ball game here and I thought they Grant Williams might be back but he wasnt and  I don't know that he will be in the next one maybe even then he probably slots in now and takes the Derek Jones Junior minutes  so we're like just barely injured enough for Dante Exum to be playable  if one more guy comes back like if Derek Jones junior is back and Grant Williams is back  then you probably have to be careful or if Kyrie Irving shows up then you got to be careful  but it seems like we might see these guys all out again and it feels like Grant is the closest to coming back again just kind of half reading tea leaves and half guessing so exams probably gonna be playable for at least one ball game now  any who Grizzlies side  Jared Jackson Jr he's coming man he's on the rise maybe he's getting excited about job being really close to coming back but he's moved himself into the 60s remembered out outside the top one hundred I'm not sure that anybody on the grease needs to be rostered besides  Jackson and Desmond Bane at least in terms of healthy Grizzlies I should say Santi aldama is the closest I've said that before I'm repeating myself I know  but even he only played 20 minutes the good thing at least with all dhamma is that he has a pretty well rounded Fantasy game he gets deals he gets blocks he gets three he's sometimes gets boards in assists not many boards in this one Dallas was hitting a lot of shots  you can hang on to aldama if you want I don't think it's necessary Marcus Smart's close Jaws closed those are probably the guys you're looking at in terms of gonna call it stashes I guess right now  let's keep going  Utah hey keyonte George had a good ball game and look I love it it's fun it's wonderful it's good news it's gonna make his past week's numbers look playable which by the way they're still outside the top one 40 17 and 7 are the averages over that stretch but  not many defensive stats lowfield gold low free throw High turnovers  like you gotta be good and more than two two and a half things to be a nine cat player but  this isn't the poop on keyonte George our you guys know how I feel I think he's someone that's going to be really interesting in February or March  I feel more strongly about him being interesting in February March then I do some of the other rookies we talked about earlier in today's show  Mostly because George seems to be a pretty good assist guy  and that's a way that you can kind of float your value but you gotta get the percentages fixed and they were in this ball game but that actually unfortunately probably means that he's due for a really bad one to balance it out because he's not there yet one good ball game doesn't make you there  I wish he was but we know enough about how basketball Works to know that it it's up and down it's a sine wave he'll have a good game you'll have a bad game  and with guys like him rookies learning the game they're gonna be more bad than good and then it's gonna slowly work its way towards the midline  he's he's National a lot of places I get it I think I've said before you can probably play them Head to Head side and just hope that he doesn't tank you in a given week Roto if you could guess which days gonna be the good one have at it but I don't think he needs to be stashed on Roto yet because they're guys out there that are giving you consistent top 90 or better type numbers  now if your team's been incredibly healthy this year congratulations you're the lucky is person on Earth but if your team's been incredibly healthy then okay fine you're probably running ahead of the game's cap then you can basically just treat him like an injured player Jordan Clarkson's been back for two games he's been horrible in both I been talking about Clarkson for two years and still nobody believes me that he's not a fantasy play Walker Kessler was out Kelly Olynyk was back  I mean honestly  if I had heard Olynyk was starting I probably would have picked him up so maybe it was a good thing I was at Disneyland yesterday  if a Linux starts the next one  I might go with it  hey got the bad one out of the way here that's the way we'll look at it  nothing on Oklahoma City so let's keep going Brooklyn at Sacramento the king's hit 25 3 pointers in this game five a piece for Fox and Lyles for a piece from Monk and Keegan Murray you're just not gonna lose if you hit 253 pointers in the modern NBA there's literally nothing the other team can do  if the threes are dropping at that clip  I mean that was like what the Lakers did in the in that Pelicans in season Tournament game if you just hit all your threes you're gonna win  there's literally nothing the other team can do  it's actually part of what makes betting the modern NBA harder than it was six seven years ago because they're going to be games where you think you've got your handicap all right and a team is just gonna shoot 55% from downtown and they're gonna hit 17 or more three-pointers and that teams just gonna win in a blowout no matter what all that said um because this was sort of a semi blowout the minutes weren't perfect but they were closed and I think we can make a few claims on this game one claim we can make is that cam Thomas has cooled off he got off to a very hot start this year I think people were  feeling like he was just gonna shoot you know High 40s all season  and sadly that's not the case now he's a great points specialist at this point for free throws two he is also a bit of a violao  because he's gonna go through these lulls of terrible shooting outside the top 200 because of field goal percent volume if you're hunting field goal percent then you can just disregard basically everything here but again this show is tailored towards nine cat  and you buy low and then we gets hot and he'll do it for a couple of weeks is heaters tend to last in his culture it's 10 they're not it's not like one game at a time with him it's usually like a week or two at a time and then you try to sell off once someone's looking at him scored 35 points a night for four games in a row then you sell them off I don't think I had another notes on the Nets feel like I'm forgetting something here for the Kings we knew Keegan Murray was gonna get cooking at some point this is just the beginning friends Malik monk just keeps trending up slow start to the year but he's going now and then Trey Lyles is more of a deeply guy but he had a big ball game here you can probably just Chuck that sucker out the window and we will move to at long last the final game on the card from last night Anfernee Simons ladies and gentlemen we know he's gonna have to do a ton because Jeremy Grant is out Malcolm Brogden is out DeAndre ayton is out  23 more shots for Simon's and 13 free throws  I only drafted him in one spot and it's more of a points League type format and I am the Yiddish term is coaling over ant right now 38 points five threes four assists in a perfect 13 out of 13 from the free throw line he's been great in all formats by the way again small small sample size he's hitting yes he hasn't missed a free throw and I think he's something like  what is he like 25 or 26 out of 26 or 25 out of 25 or something right now he's very good foul shooter but he's not nobody shoots at 1000 I do still think that 43 pointers a game is not out of the realm of possibility for him because they're not like he's shooting the ball exceptionally well from the field he's gonna have a ton of usage this year and he's making up for lost time  a little bit of a sell high but I don't know that anybody believes it shaedon Sharpe is very much a cell High we've talked about his efficiency issues but they don't matter when he's get able to play 40 plus minutes a game and take 15 to 20 shots at night so sell  scoot Henderson solid ball game Off the Bench here like a lot of the rookies you'll get these individual games where they look like it's all figured out and then it's going to come apart again you know Humpty Dumpty repeat until all of a sudden they start to figure it out and then it clicks and everyone of these games is just a little reminder of what will be in the future so it's going to be an outstanding fantasy player  but this one ball game doesn't make him that now  could you stash him  be a difficult ride you could I'm not but good I think the safer play here for nine catalysis Matisse steibel who was not as good in this ball game but when he's playing 30 minutes you're usually gonna get two three defensive stats or more out of him and some three balls to money Kamara he continues to be close but not quite at Fantasy value and we see somebody come back for the Blazers in the next ball game but if not that's this the way they've been going Clippers I keep getting this Norman Powell teas 25 minutes he had a good ballgame here I still think probably the end result on Norm is schedule play and then otherwise  you know good stuff basically play the Blazers you're gonna put up a bunch of points that's good for Fantasy if you want to know where everybody sits right now Kawhi Leonard is up to number 13 on the year  Tada just a matter of time he's also played in 20 to ball games everybody eat it  everybody eat it why is number 10 by totals this dude is getting drafted in the late 20s early 30s in some spots and if you really want to feel silly for not taking James Harden when he was going in the 60s ha he's number 25 per game right now and he's all the way up to 17 ball games played which is more than a lot of guys who were supposedly healthy to start the year Harden's cooking  Paul George number 16 he started leveled off in the second round which seems fine if eats a Zubat she's playing big minutes right now Daniel theis came back from injury in this one this is one of those ebb and flows for Zoo who we knew was going to be helped by Russ being around and buy hard and being around  like don't don't buy too much into zubats hot runs he's up to 126 you're not able to sell him because nobody's gonna buy but he's a guy you can play when he's hot which is kind of what's happening right now that's you know one of those newer lessons for this year that I've tried to incorporate it more so into this season which is  it's okay to play a guy while they're hot even if they're not arrest of season play even if there isn't any magical like there's a guy out in front of them and that's why they're playing well right now zubats is just running hot so  play them  that's okay  not going to do a Tuesday preview because I think we covered the entire league right now I do want to take a few quick looks at the chat room just to see if anybody got a point in there that I'd like to address or respond to many of you at the beginning said you enjoyed the story so I appreciate that I know it's not gonna be everybody but every once in a while I'm just gonna talk about my own life it's I you know I'm human and I'm very tired today and that's that's when the stories come out  here's a good one it's this about a heart and shine a lot of a lot of heart and shine questions basically should you this is an answer actually to a question that up above this person says should Harden Stein he should be similar to Mitch Robb what do I think about heart and Stein is probably the better question for me to ask  when he was healthy  prior to New York  he actually had stretches of top 70 when it wasn't even full starters minutes it was like 26 27 minutes a game and he was going inside the top 70 sometimes even crept up his eyes top 60 I don't know that that's necessary necessarily going to be the case in New York just the way they play the fact that he is Off the Bench behind Jericho so they're gonna be some games where like if Sims is going crazy hot he'll get 25 26 and then hard and shine gets bumped down to like 21 I do think overall he does have a pretty good chance to get inside the top 100 that's kind of where I land with it he'll be a good field goal guy a bad free-throw guy he gets Steals and blocks and rebounds  one of the things that he does well that might not really happen in New York is passing  that's the part where you're like okay that you know in the past I've seen hartenstein be as good as a top 60 that's what we were just talking about a minute ago  but he's not gonna be a ball mover on the interior here in New York the way that he was like say with a Clippers with the Clippers they were using him out of the high post to just get the ball to Paul George and Kawhi Leonard then the next have multiple guys that they trust to make the pass Jayden Brunson Emmanuel quickly when he's playing Josh Hart is a ball mover Julius Randle starts a lot of offense  there's just too many of those types of guys either ball movers or usage guys on the next so heart and shines value is unfortunately not going to be in the assist he's not going to get for assistance game like he did at other when I don't know if he ever quite got to four but you know three plus three to four he's gonna be lower than that so it's gonna have to be rebounds defensive stats and field goal percent and I think there's going to be enough of that for him to be start over the next two months but I don't want to get too high on him a lot of questions about Disneyland I do appreciate them guys I do I I don't want to use too much more time on that though  um let's see what do we got here is Garland back as a third rounder um so he's number 79 on the season right now and he was outside the top 130 for a while but a lot of that was the turnovers he's a second rounder over the last week while shooting 52% with two steals a game  I think the likeliest scenario for Darius Garland is what we got last year which was a late fourth early 5th  his numbers were good 22 points 8 assists  two and a half three pointers good free throw numbers like he's gonna be good but turnovers are going to be high  Stills are decent field goal percent is probably gonna be a net negative he doesn't like any shots at all he doesn't rebound at all  so I just don't know how he ever gets up to that next rung as long as  was as long as he's not in Mitchell is upright  you know if Donovan Mitchell goes down and Garland starts taking 20 shots of ball game every night and yeah that's how he jumps to that next level and how many shots did Darius get in this ugly ball game 23 so this is there's your example like this is what it looks like when he gets the big usage roll on a night it's it's glorious but it's not gonna happen every ball game most of the time spied is going to be the guy there so  I think between  let's say between 35 and 55 is where Garland probably goes the rest of the season  does he get all the way to that Mark hard to say because this first you know four or five weeks he was he got up to really slow start but he could probably still get there and that's kind of what I'm looking for with Garland  um let's see anything else that I want to hit before we go  Denver says come on Dan Harden was not going in the 60s nay I say to that I did a I did a handful of  drafts at the very last second like I think I did what I actually on the very last Monday and I was blown away at how everyone just kept dodging and dodging and dodging and I legitimately got James Harden at 58 which I know is not 60s I'm aware that's two slots away so my apologies for rounding  but I got him at 58 and if I didn't take them there I don't know there's no guarantee that the guy behind me would have taken him there was just no way I was gonna let him go into the next one like if I had waited my next pick would have been what like 62 or 63 I'm screwing up the math here  60  to  Dan can do math what do you've gotten back to me at 62 just so that I could really say he went in the 60s I wasn't willing to take that chance but he was basically at 60  which is nuts I know it's nuts and I couldn't believe it either but it actually happened  and then I showed this roster on Twitter and people were like oh my God your team is so old they're gonna be awful  nope this team's pretty good pretty pretty good there's one team in front of me I mean second place in that Roto league and the team in front of me is like 10 games ahead so it's hard for me to say if I'm in a catch them but that team has yolk itch and tires Maxi so there are like they got some pretty good players at the top it's going to be a good battle that team has some really good picks too so we'll we'll be duking it out I'm sure down the stretch we roll out that Roto League I know it's not his Denver says that's wild I know it's wild  I actually saw it happen right before my eyes and it's happening and he's sitting there and I can still remember the feeling of like sitting in this draft room  and you know this is a publicly so I don't know who the hell out these people are but I'm like looking around me  like it's gonna change something like I'm looking behind me like if like something's about to jump up and scare me and there he is just sit in there  45 50 55 what are these people doing I get it he's on the trade block but like a worst case James Harden is 35  worst  anyway he's mid second rounder now so or late second rounder butt  Super Sonic baby all right wrap it up I got 55 minutes in this vocal cord after yelling at Disneyland all day yesterday I want to try to get a Bi-Lo show going later on today time dependent but if nothing goes nuts I have a babysitter so it should happen again please do find me over on social at Dan Bass Pros come hang out with us in Discord I have forgot to yell at you guys about that earlier we're having a ball over there the NBA General channel is cooking man it's cooking we had like what do we won two three four five six seven eight nine there are literally nine questions that people are asking each other  since I started recording this podcast in that channel  which I know that sounds like a lot but that's like a question every five or six minutes and then everybody's voting on it  everybody gets to vote you got to give it it's got to make it multiple choice because people are not gonna like type in a long answer every time but you make that sucker multiple choice you'll get some votes it's great way to crowdsource your NBA decision-making with people that follow Sports ethos myself and all the rest of our Incredible Minds here  people that have been following us for a long time you guys are really really good at Fantasy Basketball give yourself a lot of credit like there's a reason that I joined publicly  because I don't want to play against you guys with my information to use against me feel sort of unfair but also  like if I want to be an eight or nine League I don't want to work super hard in all of them maybe a couple two  leeks should be really hard  I know I'm a wimp anyway hopefully see you guys in a few hours thanks for watching everybody oh wait last question here Adam asked in Rojo how do you catch up in games played there's some streaming to do with the end of the year certainly as as you get into silly season you can pick up some weirdos to drop into your lineup but honestly there's just this like ebb and flow I know I've used that expression two or three times today but that's the way this season goes you'll have stretches where you have 12 or 13 dudes healthy on your team and you want to play them all and you play them and then there'll be stretches where you have six guys heard at the same time and you'll fall behind you don't want to fall behind by more than like 10 15 games against the like the expected number and Yahoo does a good job of showing that down in the sort of corner of the screen on the PC but there are a lot of ways to make up ground and and one of them is picking up injury Replacements as they come okay now I'm done for real we went an hour that's enough see you guys later today thanks again for watching please like And subscribe on your way out that makes a really big difference hugs and kisses later everybody
