welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  all right guys I thought I'd let the music run out both on the recorded and the YouTube side today welcome into the show  it's fantasy NBA today I'm your host Dan Bass Pro I am at d a n b e s b r i s Dan best briefs on the socials  and the NBA season starts tomorrow  I am quite sorry I didn't have a show over the weekend  I was hoping to but  as those of you with multiple children know it's quite difficult to get anything done and then on top of that I had four fantasy drafts so over the weekend I have two more today  and then the season begins tomorrow so we're jamming in as much as we can and today we're talking  the best players on the board  at large  we've got a per game analysis we've got a totals analysis so technically we have 24 things to cover although  there's quite a bit of overlap  and the explanation on a lot of it is relatively straightforward in fact I think once we get through the per game side you'll see the totals list and you'll think okay well now I know who Dan thinks is gonna play a bunch more games than anybody else and you can kind of run from there so today this is really about helping you navigate the first round and then some parts of the second round  trying to think of it comes into play in any other meaningful fashion know that's probably it  and then as far as what's coming up on the show or the the feed I should say this will be a one show date today because again I have a draft in 85 minutes from now I have another one for hours from now  tomorrow no more drafts tomorrow we'll have two shows in the morning we'll break down some real results from drafts you guys can get a feel for how I kind of assess the way the board is ending up and then all in the afternoon tomorrow before the game's actually start and I know there aren't that many so we don't have to be overly concerned with just the tomorrow's stuff just two games like there's in Denver Phoenix is in Golden State and then things get hairy on Wednesday but you do have weekly lineups that need to be set you want to look to see if there are some sort of light days there are by the way my thoughts on streaming all kind of talk through on that show as well so that'll be a really important one to kind of get things rolling get the season underway the right way  so that'll be tomorrow  for those that are watching live please feel free to throw thoughts in the chat room I think we'll have some time at the end today to get to questions if they're show topic relevant for those watching live after the fact or listening on traditional podcast Channel please take a moment to like And subscribe to everything we're doing here at sports Depots specifically here fantasy NBA today and anything that I'm throwing out over on the video side  I was a four minute intro I'm not I'm sorry about that as longer than I intended but I wanted you guys to know what was coming up on the show we have a lot of listeners that are sort of every day's and I want them to know what to expect I think that's useful  here's the board well here's the empty board best players in fantasy basketball will start on the per game side and I'm gonna put all 12 names on at once for you guys so we're not gonna walk through this thing quickly and there they are for YouTubers you get to see it for those that are listening I will also ruin the surprise for you my top 12 on the per game side Joel embiid number one per game might surprise a lot of you but I've been sort of hinting at it throughout the run up to the season Nicole yoka J very very tight number two Shake he'll just Alexander remains in the number three slot Kevin Durant who I do think takes a small step back this year but I also think that everybody around him is taking either a small step back or not a big enough step forward and so KD stays basically where he was last year and again I'll get into the the explanation on on a lot of this in a minute Steph Curry number five I think he also kind of hangs out around the same number Kawhi Leonard makes a big leap forward from his full game full season  last year but not much of a change off of the second half Tyreese Halliburton a little bit of a move forward he was eight last year he goes to seven and my board this season kauai's ascendance up is the only thing keeping him from getting any farther Anthony Davis drops down to number eight I think we saw the free throw stuff really start to become an issue towards the latter parts of last season and if you look at the final couple months which I know he was playing through injury add just wasn't that guy at the top of the board anymore so I think the reality is that it falls somewhere in between but Anthony Davis was number 14 down the stretch last year despite 2.9 defensive stats so it was really all about a bad free throw stroke that I think is gonna be an issue but again getting too far ahead of myself Jayson Tatum at number 9 Jaren Jackson Jr at number 10 Kyrie Irving at number 11 and Jimmy Butler at number 12 not a ton of changes off of last year but some and so let's go through these names and figure out why I have some of these adjustments and where they end up because of it  at the top of the board Joel embiid who technically last year was in a statistical or maybe call it a z-score dead heat with Nicola yokich  and it wasn't like it was because one guy was better for builds than the other guy both guys were incredibly Elite at a handful of different things Nicole kach elite rebounder elite passer Elite field goal percent very good but not Elite in points and for a first rounder kind of meth in points frankly steals were solid very solid for a center blocks were not so great free throws were fine but not a massive positive and pretty high turnovers but again relatively common for first rounders  the reason I moved Joel embiid in front is that James Harden ain't showing up  and  as we approach opening night which is basically you know hours and not weeks anymore  there hasn't been a trade yet involving James Harden so I know everybody's like  and this is accurate to say someone's gonna come back in that trade  yes someone is going to come back in that trade  when it happens  they don't have to move him quickly  the Sixers as a team can stay afloat without hardened they have plenty of talent around him be Tyrese Maxey is very good they have some depth now obviously D Anthony Melton to buy his Harris these guys can all do some stuff I mean yeah you're not it's not James Harden it's not the star power but that team is still above 500 ball Club even without hard and so and it's not like the front office can't communicate to the team either Daryl Morey can walk in there when hardened is continuing to not be around and just say guys I need you guys to just keep this ship afloat I promise you I'm gonna do what's best for the team I'm gonna go get a really good package for this for for the beard  and then we're gonna turn a corner and hit the afterburners at that point but just don't give up on me guys don't give up on me Daryl I'm doing fanfiction here as Daryl Morey don't give up on me team I'm Gonna Get You somebody good in the meantime I'm gonna need you guys to go full throttle and for MB that means last year and maybe even more  and be last year in scoring in rebounding very good in Blox at one point seven not in that upper upper upper most Echelon but right behind it positive impact guy and feel goal Big Time positive impact guy in free throw percent steals actually not bad at one for a center 4.2 assists is not terrible but he's obviously not Nicole yokich level one you must all that stuff together those two guys had almost the exact same positive impact just in two decidedly different ways  the reason I have mbed in front of yokich on the per game board this year and I can continue to stress the per game board is that I think you'll get off a championship and everybody can say that he just floats along and does amazing MVP level stuff without even really having to focus or wanted but that's just not true that's an act it's a stick it's a stick now for yolk it he obviously wants it you don't win an NBA title without wanting it and off a long title run there's gonna be a little bit of a dial down  Denver's got plenty of weapons they don't need yokich to average 2512 and 10 every single ball game and where you might see it is perhaps do the minutes come down just the tiniest bit  are there are there additional rest days that doesn't really factor into per game  is he the best field goal percent impact guy in the entire league again next year if any one of those small things is not exactly where it was this last season embiid who's gonna be asked to do even more without Harden  passes him on the per game side and I think there's a pretty decent chance that one of those things happened  literally any one thing that I just listed does he do a tiny bit more he passes him  doesn't beat play an extra half minute he passes him  does yolk at shoot 61% said of 63 and bead passes him  as yolk average 11 and a half or nine and a half assists instead of basically 12 and 10 and beat passes him  so I don't think it's really that controversial to say that indeed is my number one per game guy but  the reason everybody's drafting Nicole yokich including myself is that embiid could fall apart and play 55 ball games where with yoga you just don't really see that as a possibility  the fall apart for yokich is probably low to mid 60s  the reality is that both of these guys are going to be gunning for high 60s in games played and one of them yokich to be coy about it has a better shot to get there than the other one  I have Shae Gill just Alexander still in the number three spot I know that there's this this thought that he's gonna take a massive step backwards and there may be some like maybe the free throw volume comes down a little bit I don't know that anything else changes all that much for him with Chet Holmgren around he's not like gonna be a big usage dude and yeah other guys on that team are going to get better around him and maybe they don't need him to do quite as much  done matter he had an edge on Anthony Davis for the number four spot I think Hades going down he had an edge on Kevin Durant who was right behind Anthony Davis in that sort of four or five range I think KD's taking a small step back so if you just assume all three of these guys are taking some minor step backwards why would anybody pass shade I don't think they do and I don't think I need to go into much more detail than that  number four Kevin Durant who again is the same general assessment of the previous one yes Health stuff is always going to be hanging over Durant and Anthony Davis and Joel embiid and Kawhi Leonard and  Kyrie Irving health and other Jimmy Butler nagging injury stuff but that's why this is the per game board  Kevin Durant was the number five player in Fantasy last year I don't think that is numbers changed that much in Phoenix because he was already kind of doing the share with someone else thing they come down a little bit because now it's share with a couple someone else's in a way that was not you know he had Kyrie Irving now he's got eight and iteration of Kyrie Irving and in Devin Booker and another one in Bradley Beal but this is still Kevin Durant  he's still maybe the most efficient score on planet Earth  and the farther that we get removed for him from catastrophic season ending full year missing injury I actually think I know he's getting older but I actually think that there's a chance that his Arc kind of like Klay Thompson a little bit still had room to come back up a little bit now is his overall workload going to be lower probably I don't think they want to play in 35 and a 36 minutes a game they're gonna need it sometimes because Phoenix is going to have all kinds of chemistry stuff at the beginning of the year and when I say beginning I mean like probably the first two to three months of the year  29 six and a half and five is what year was at last year you could see that coming down a little bit and everything but again he had some space on the game side but behind himself separating himself from Steph Curry who was number six per game last year Durant's turnovers probably come down a tad I would think all so maybe that creates a little bit of a buffer yes and everything that he doesn't do is and is a pain in the butt because you want a guy who has those efficient marks doing as much as humanly possible  I just don't see anybody behind him and close enough and overall rank to potentially pass him  number five I have Steph Curry who again not a big surprise he is role stays about the same the guys in front of him come closer to him in Durant Anthony Davis and Shay Gillis Alexander the guys behind Steph from last year this is a pretty easy way to do the analysis but again you know me and trying to simplify things Dame was right behind Steph last year I think he does less Halliburton was behind Dame I liked Tyrese and you'll hear we'll talk about him here momentarily Kyrie Irving was the next one down the board then Jimmy Butler those guys are not about to do more this coming season so I see absolutely no reason why basically anybody other than the next name I'm gonna say has any chance of catching Steph in per game stuff based on the kind of things that Steph still can do  and in a delightful perfect world maybe you get the steals back up a little bit for curry who dropped down all the way to point nine last season that's Dame territory you usually he's more in that 1.1 land and maybe we get there and now be fun for everybody  we can all sit back and have a bowl of stew  next name on the list is Kawhi Leonard and like some people might wonder why the hell this is there but we've we've gone over this I've tweeted about it constantly Kawhi Leonard last year  wasn't himself the first half of the Season he didn't have lift he had soreness remember he played you know a handful of games and he sat out for like another five six weeks there is mass panic across the fantasy landscape I tried to quell your fears as best I could  I still remember and this drives me absolutely insane that that there were analysts out there saying sell hard on Kawhi Leonard when we were like a month and a half into the season and things were scary but the problem was that all you could get back was like a top 100 guy that dude's not moving the needle anyway  even if you like the top 100 guy that guy doesn't move the needle  so you had to ride it out there was no other way to deal with it well then he came back and he was top four  the rest of the way second half of the Season while under was number four he was ahead of Shea Guild just Alexander he was behind only Dame who was in full one man gang operation mode yokich and embed it was those guys and then Kawaii  on average is a 27 two and a half seven board to have threes I should say seven boards four assists 1.6 deals points 7 blocks in a 5390 percentage splits he was insane  I don't know that he's gonna come out and put up those numbers and if Harden gets traded to the Clippers that's the way that Leonard takes a step back I didn't put him at number four I put him at number six he could go higher nice and Kawhi Leonard has a really good season this year  but that's why he Creeps in in front of Halliburton he just has a well-roundedness to his game that nobody else in the NBA nobody I repeat nobody else NBA has  those last three months last year Kawhi Leonard was a positive impact guy in all nine categories he did it on one point eight turnovers over that stretch  that's Bonkers man  absolutely nuts  so it's not a slight on Tyreese Halliburton who you guys know I like a lot a lot a lot to put him at number seven I just don't see how he can add enough to his stuff from last year to pass some of these guys that I put in front of him  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of

quarterbacking from you guessed it  your armchair  download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's dri z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  because nobody that I've put in front of him  was really all that close to Halliburton in per game numbers other than maybe Steph  so could Halliburton come roaring in and get in front of Stephen Kauai and rotate this order around absolutely yeah frankly four five six and seven on this board and maybe even eight are all some in interchangeable but the reason I have them the way I have them is that I just I think Kauai is in nine cat is just in is wild I think Halliburton kind of replicates last year could he add a little bit of scoring maybe I don't see how the assists really go up from 10 and a half but they're just not that much more to add because I don't think he wants to score that much more I think he wants to get everybody involved run and Gun and do the way he does that is by being very efficient making really good passes and Indie gets good looks  number eight is Anthony Davis as much as I do think he takes a step back it's hard for me to drop him much Beyond this spot because he still Anthony Davis he's still a guy who gets three defensive stats scores in the mid-20s rebounds over 10 11 boards a game and I know like there's like a d gonna be playing the four a lot this year that  he's opening the season as the starting five ladies and gentlemen LeBron's the starting four Taurean Prince is the starting three when Jarred Vanderbilt comes back I guess there's a chance that  he could slot in there but so far it doesn't really look like the Lakers want to run a Christian Wood Anthony Davis duo in the front court or a Jackson Anthony Davis Duo because  would not a great defender  while he can kind of space the floor a little bit they want the defense to open up the game and jaxson Hayes can't space the floor so you get a little bit better defense but you don't get any offense meanwhile if you move Anthony Davis to the five you get both and you can put in a decent Wing Defender who can also spread the floor in a guy like Prince  it just makes sense like the other centers in La they'll see time but at the end of the day Anthony Davis is still going to be logging a crap ton of minutes at Center  if you should 73% at the free throw line all year then he's behind this Mark it's not a punt number but it ain't that far off of it it was the first round pick but if he's in the mid-70s this is where he ends up and again with the amount that he does on defense it's really it's frankly it's hard for him to fall much Beyond this  I move Jayson Tatum up to number nine  you could convince me that I was wrong on this one pretty easily this is mostly because I think his seasoned pretty well replicates what he did last year which for Tatum was number 11 but you know he was like one or two good games away from being number nine and he was one or two poorer games from Kyrie Irving or Jimmy Butler away from being number nine so six of one half dozen a little bit but I did move up the board because I just I like his consistency and so we'll roll with that number 10 Jaren Jackson Jr who is number 12 last year so it's really not that nuts for me to say hey how about we give you know Steven Adams for the entire year yeah I don't know if you guys saw that news over the weekend but Steven Adams is out for the entire damn season for Memphis so hi JJ you're gonna be logging more sentiments again because ain't no way they want to play Xavier Tillman there all night every night we saw that the second half of last season so the board is still be there the blocks will still be there the field goal percent will still be there and how about this JJJ how about you get to play the first third of the year without your team's leading scorer  you want to take more than 13 shots this would be the time to do it  he takes a small step forward  that's fairly straightforward handicap I think on him to say oh he'll do a little bit more and he only played by the way 28 1/2 minutes of ball game and it wasn't always about foul trouble some of it was but a lot of it was just  they want to keep as minutes in check they don't want him getting hurt I mean if they push him to 29 and a half or 30 which still isn't all that much you add some rebounds you had some scoring you just add a little bit on top of a little bit on top of the baker chunk of hey you get to do more on offense with no jaw around for a while he's the guy that should take a step forward and I get it as a first round pick he's kind of a difficult guy to build around because he's so very good in one statistical category but if he elevates himself to being a small positive play in points a bigger positive play in rebounds than he was  as a second rounder well he's an easy call  I've got Kyrie Irving down at 11 and I may regret that decision he probably frankly belongs back up in front of the last two guys like Tatum like JJ  because Luke Cage is questionable for the season opener he's been dealing with this calf stuff he's gonna get games off  and Kyrie already knows how to play alongside of a very high volume guy he's done it for years he did with Braun  he did it with Durant  I don't know that his numbers suffer all that much alongside Luka Duncan frankly if you look at the tail end of last year they didn't I know Luca was kind of in and out of the lineup of that track but Kyrie was number five the last 20 games last year on 275 and 6 with crazy great percentages steals blocks and threes remember talking about guys in the league that can get nine category positives Kyrie was freaking close  he needed about a rebound more to get there  and gonna get that 6-3 bound so it's just never gonna happen for him but 1.3 Steals and 0.6 blocks out of your guard  that's pretty damn good  so Kyrie at 11 again maybe under shooting a tiny bit he's probably ends up in the nine range but I went light on him here just in case there's any kind of all right I got my contract I alongside Luke all take it easy and finally Jimmy Butler at number 12 which again relatively easy call his team actually got worse he was number nine the second half of last year  no reason to think he can't duplicate a lot of that maybe the 55% shooting comes down  but the assist could also be up the steals were at one point six we've seen him get up near two for stretches  he's another guy that because of his free throw volume his steals  and frankly the field goal percent it's actually very hard for Jimmy Butler to fall all that far down the board so I've got him at 12 and they're really weren't as I look at these the names that I just kind of left off the list they really weren't guys that I was like oh I there's someone else I really wanted to get in there because the closest last year  was Kristoff porzingis to being in this the top 12  and Damian Lillard who I think Falls just outside of the top 12 on a per game basis not by much and frankly he might get in there and knock a butler to 13 or you know if JJJ doesn't step before frankly Jayson Tatum could be a little bit worse and he might be the guy who ends up at 13 but the honorable mention here was certainly Damian Lillard he's kind of your your top 12 snub on The Dan Bass Pro side  and I'm Allyson  that I probably need to rearrange one name on the totals board right here in the middle of the show so while we're doing that I'm gonna remind all of you guys to please take a moment to like rate subscribe to this video find me on social media at Danbury and b e s b r i s now with the season starting tomorrow we're gonna breaking news all day every day in the NBA that's the place that I can actually get that news to you  in fine fashion all so plug for our draft tracker tool this year that Andre put together it's unbelievable I've used it in all six five five of my cash drafts so far I'm playing on using it in the other two going on today I think I'm at nine totals leagues this year and that's basically where I want to keep it I got it down from was it like 15 couple years ago and it was just too many I've used it in every cash draft so far I found it oddly even more helpful in head-to-head where you can really lean into strengths as you're looking at what the other teams are doing on road you're trying to go balance balance balance balance balance but then at the end of the draft you can find yourself kind of tilting into certain stats and maybe doesn't give you the world's best assessment because in games Gap you don't play your last four or five guys every time they go head to head you're playing them all  amazing tool that's in the fantasy password which against starts just six bucks and if you want to upgrade to the All Sport fantasy past there's a coupon running right now that coupon is ethos 246 ethos two four six gets you two bucks off  four six months on the all sports so that comes from nine bucks down to seven which is just one dollar more than the NBA solo so you're paying one extra dollar a month with that coupon to get baseball and football stuff that'll again just one dollar more over the next six months so that's October through April um  the slight adjustment that needed to be made on the other side I don't know if you guys can see it as I'm doing it I'm hoping you can't this is Dan doing crap on the Fly I think I did it while you guys weren't ya good for me  all right let's go over to the total side and it is oh there we go it's switched right in front of your very eyes  oh man I gotta get better at this video stuff wow we'll get there at some point  totals you'll notice there is a bit of a shake-up on this side and you know explanations don't need to be all that long for it because it's pretty obvious why certain guys are not on the total side that were on the per game side  let's start at the top those of you watching live on YouTube or after the fact you guys can see all 12 names those of you listening we're going to read them to you right now those names are Nicole kid's at one then she'll just Alexander at 2 Tyreese Halliburton at 3:00 Joel embed it for Jayson Tatum at 5:00 Jaron Jackson Jr at 6 Kevin Durant at 7 yeah I know I'm a little more bullish on his health this year probably he'll bite me Michael Bridges at 8 Mr 83 damn games last year Steph Curry at 9 Jimmy Butler at 10 Desmond Bane at 11 and Damian Lillard at 12 and the totals snub is Kawhi Leonard who is right off the board there I just think is per game numbers are going to be so beefy that Kauai missing whatever it is missing an extra three four game something like that that keeps him out of that that uppermost Echelon but I do think he's gonna be awfully close to getting into that first round and so that's why I'm actually okay in most formats taking him mid second round and Beyond so I think even by totals he beats that Mark but just a few thoughts on the totals board we're not going to go through this through this one piece by piece yoke which I have it number one cause I have him playing about the league average number of basketball games and and that should be enough to kind of keep him in front  of Shea Guild just Alexander that's the guy that I think in challenge him for the number one spot this year but I think she only plays maybe two three more games than yokich on the season so that gets him into the number two hole Halliburton I have playing in the mid to high 70s actually I think it's going to be a really healthy season for him back to basically what we saw not this last season but the one before that remember Halliburton the when he got traded in Indiana played 77 games that year and if you're like Dan you seem like a total crazy person well Howard was number seven by totals that year while being a late second round or on the per game side and this again this is all just about  assessing what a game played actually means so Jayson Tatum being number four last year despite being number 11 means for Halliburton who I just told you guys I have  at number seven per game well he's playing a bunch of ball games that's way more than enough games to get him climbing over a few of the guys in front of him  and beat I have a number four I think the extra workload is going to knock him down into the low 60s and games played but per game is going to be so awesome that he's still will stay in the top five by totals Jayson Tatum is back up at number five basically a repeat of what he did last year which I know isn't super creative on my part but also I think that's what happens Jerry Jackson Jr who was a late first rounder for the entire season this time around not starting the year late like you did last time I remember JJ missed the first month of the year after that he only missed a smattering of games the rest of the way I think maybe five or six after missing the first month if that's the pace he keeps this year and he gets into the low ish 70s and games played by being the number nine ten eleven per game guy pretty easy for him to get up to number six by totals I got Kevin Durant and number seven by totals again you know lower than Lee averaging games played something like 6364 keeps him here in the middle of the first round Mikhail Bridges I have up around 80 games played very similar which again I know sometimes it's like the same thing is not going to happen two years in a row but with Bridges I think you have an okay shot of getting back to basically what happened this last year so he's up there at number nine I think he plays a little bit again fewer than the typical amount for the top of the board so that drops him a little behind his per game Mark but not by much Jimmy Butler same general story Desmond Bane is one that she'd interest you guys because I think he's right around 20 per game this year I think he's relatively healthy and honestly he could go higher than this by totals if he stays super healthy but I wanted to give a little bit of wiggle room so I got Bane plane around 7172 games this year Grizzlies are going to need him Stephen Adams being out job being out this going to need to be a lot of Bane  so I'm thinking teens per game for a while good health drops into the 20s maybe when when is back so around 20 19 20 on the per game side good health gets him to the end of the first round by totals and Damian Lillard who I think is gonna have a decent season  as you  didn't see I should say on the per game side he was this snub at number 13 but I think he plays probably like 69.70 games somewhere just above League average and then does creep into the very end of the first round by totals  so those are your best players in fantasy basketball on the per game and total side let's take a look at some of the questions over in the chat room as I once again remind everybody to find me over on social at Dan best persons a couple of you got guys did it while I was talking I think you might have actually that's kind of fun the power of suggestion on YouTube  I got a points league question we're going to jump over that this is not a points League episode so sorry to know their  Matt's talking about JJ we've covered that  should I feel bad drafting LeBron in the third round at picked 34 yeah a little bit I'm down on LeBron this year he may be gunning for 65 games for various all NBA stuff so that would be the one Saving Grace with him but I think you're looking at a guy who was in the 30s on a per game basis this year he was at about 23 24 25 last season and I think he does less assist probably stay about the same shots come down boards come down minutes come down free throws might come down there's a lot to be worried about with LeBron so I I've been avoiding him if he fell to the fourth round I would probably do it but I haven't seen that happen yet  Timothy says I feel like lamelo ball is a similar Halliburton but he just got hurt last year what do you think separates him from Halliburton on the best player list field goal percent  is a night and day Halliburton was at 49% on only 15 Shots by the way because Albert and  was much more of a past first element there let me know about was at 41% on 20 shots he was effectively going from someone who was  by the way a positive for a point guard but you know League average was basically about a net neutral in that to lamelo ball whose a full tank  he's a field goal guy that makes a big big difference Halliburton to Morris's lamelo you know two and a half more rebound so that's where he has the edge both guys hit a bunch of three-pointers Halliburton a better free throw shooter by the way so that's on top of it as well more efficient turns the ball over less is actually quite a lot that separates those two guys Matt says Maury Moments by Dan bass procedure that fanfiction yeah earlier in the show I did a little I'm pretending to be Daryl Morey thing sorry Darryl I don't know if I said what you're saying but I think it's quite conceivable  Kenny Lewis Cruz says I see Katie forth here but is 80P is very high as he first round on 12th I believe so  we have to hope that he his health is better this year I'm hoping that Phoenix keeps the minutes in checked a little and then you hope for you know no weird like slipping on a wet spot during warm-ups crap buddy is Kevin Durant he is very long and lean and so little things can happen like that I'm just hoping that they are much smaller  where is Luka doncic well this is nine cat and he's mean we're going by strict ranking he was number 16 last year he's dealing with a calf that still an issue so I can't in good conscience put him forward and he probably finished his around  Xavier Tillman in 9 cat I'll go Tillman just because he's the safe place no dream on opening night news coming out should we roll with Jonathan kaminga um yeah he'll probably get to do some stuff now the problem with Kim mingi is that last year he really hurt you in a number of spots on the nine Cat Side Kevon Looney is your safer play here who's not going to be that exciting he's only gonna score eight points but he almost definitely gets you nine to 12 rebounds probably a steal maybe more maybe you get two defensive stats out of him my streamer is probably Kevon Looney I'm just not a coming to believer  maybe he does it while dreams out  and  would you trade your DeAndre ayton for Jeremy Grant and Klay Thompson  you know I might actually  I think Aidan's probably a per game  40s guy this year maybe early 50s and I think Klay Thompson's probably early 50s and Grant is probably late 50s so yeah I think you're actually getting more on the two players side but of course it depends on who you got to drop  Matt says dan is there a player statistics storyline or other that you'd like to nominate for the first entry into the Weird Al index for this rapidly upcoming season if you guys are not aware by the way Matt rewrites songs to NBA theme's Allah Weird Al but this is all fantasy basketball related um it's got to be James Harden doesn't it I know that's a little Buzzy butt here as I finish my water on air  feels like we need a hardened song because the Dame Saga ended  jpx says with one IL plus and two bench players is durability first priority  like dictate him instead of embed Bane over Kauai that's what I did is it's a good strategy  yeah if you've only got one IL slot IL Plus or otherwise and only two bench players you badly need your guys to stay upright  that's rough man like mistake because that means that  you know you're talking 12 players and maybe a 13th if you can squeeze him onto the aisle plus so you're talking about between 39 and 52 games a week probably out of your whole team call it about 44 405 meeting every 0 you get is huge almost  I mean  geez like that's it that's a massive deal it's more than 2% of your weekly output so if you got guys with durability issues  they can knock out 5% of your week 10% of your week pretty quick now the other side of that is when MB does play he puts up numbers that are a lot bigger than Tatum and Kawaii puts up numbers that are quite a bit bigger than Bane but I get it man like you want you guys out there maybe you go one and one in a lead like that or just be a little bit more careful as you move later on so there's a couple other ways you can look at it  Janice says what can we realistically expect from Xavier Tillman uh-huh not a lot I mean people like oh Xavier Tillman time and I admit I gave him the nod in one of the questions earlier but like  he basically had this job for the whole second half of last year and he ended up hanging out right around the edge of the top 100  which is fine  you know it's good enough but  it's not gonna blow the roof off the building I think probably more like 120  on his way maybe later than that  YMCA says how many assists you think Maxie averages this season with hardened gone so yeah last year that was a big knock on Maxie's that he really didn't pass at all he only had three and a half assists  with no Harding around I think that probably gets up into the high force is my take people generally over gas on assist like oh and he's gone Max is gonna get seven assists for ball game now it's gonna be a lot of spreading it around I think that three and a half goes to about 4.7 4.8 maybe as high as five but I don't think he gets much beyond that if at all the scoot Avatar 100 season per game no totals may be  depends a little bit on how he's used and his health I don't think he gets inside the top 100 per game though  when B will end up being a first rounder won't he says bleep Scott Foster  uh not this year I mean he's gonna be at some point um  the NBC is gonna catch up a little bit hey his numbers are Gonna Be Wild  um you know there's a lot of gonna be a lot of Jaren Jackson Jr to his numbers but picture JJ with kind of a bad field goal percent I think it's kind of a reasonable way to look at him this year  and that's like a  that to me is is like a really good outcome or maybe like Myles Turner with a bad field goal percent no I mean Gojo screw it make it JJ he could be a second rounder I'm not sure he will but he could but I think you're just eternals field goal percent are going to be issues the rigors of a season are going to be issues all that stuff is going to creep in he's gonna be fun as hell though  sheesh  Don Vito says Chris Paul or screwed Henderson I'll go Chris Paul and everybody's gonna kill me for it but  he's just gonna quietly plot along Health could be a problem he's quite old  to Padre my father says what is your opinion on what to focus per game or per totals predictions they're an argument for choosing someone like Bane over Anthony Davis they're an argument I don't think those guys are quite close enough to Warrant it I'd rather take the shot on the crazy per game guy and hope that he has a relatively healthy season  but totals really matter with your best players because you need them on the floor you know if you take a bunch of guys early that end up missing games and getting hurt you got no shot  as a draft goes along or as your numbers go once you get to like that top 675 range where it's the guys that are kind of like just sort of keeping your team at Baseline performance that's where you want to start looking at pregame more I think totals matter more early on if  all other things are equal like if your chick in this one Bane versus Anthony Davis said to me there's a little bit too much of a gap there but if you were talking like  hmm  Kawaii versus uh like demonic sabonis who everybody  maybe that's not even a good example  maybe like Jimmy Butler versus Mikhail Bridges I think I'd probably rather Butler and just pray he stays a little bit healthier  but it's a little bit farther part I go the other way I know not a great answer the question but there is a cut off well Chris Paul be roster will this season or more of an assist Stihl streamer I think he'll be roster stable  Jonathan says Xavier Tillman or Santi aldama I'll go Tillman Weston says please touch up on lamelo as a 24th picking points League not a big Points Guy but he'll be fine there I like it  Don Vito against his would you rather roster so honor Kobe White  give me so Han and let's see what the hell  see what the hell happens  Sac accountant says well Cunningham finishes at the top 20 player in nine cat head to head no  Cirillo says I'm a 12 team 8 cat Rodeo league in managed to get and then nothing after that surely you leaving his hanging man  that's unfortunate Don Vito if you had to pick one of gaffer or Congo for the entire season who would it be give me a Kung whoo I'm a little worried about just all things Wizards um  Gafford could go higher but what if capella gets moved or heard or whatever I'll go Kong will cause he's showed himself to be extraordinarily durable and there's  we already know he's top 75 and only 22 23 minutes a game we need more than that to get Gafford there  um someone Marco says someone took Wendy to pick 14 in my league yeah it's happening all the time he's going early to mid second round now big preseason will do that I think most of these folks are gonna get a few big games and feel like they've won and then ignore the fact that there will be some bumps after that and that's okay because again he'll be fine at the very least  oh no Jonathan says please rank the following Sohan quickly Kobe white Taylor and Kyle Lowry in nine cat  give me quickly at the top of that board then so on  if we're actually if we're going per game I'll go quickly than Lowry  then so on then white then Tucker and then obviously if it's totals Kyle Lowry ends up at the bottom because he's probably going to pass out after two months  would you rather have asked her Thompson or I'm in Thompson in a dynasty draft I'll go ask her yeah it's more room I think in Detroit oh here's Cirillo's question  oh it's just your team buddy good job but I can't that's not a question  Paulo says is Bilal worth the last pick and a 14 team or yeah you'll probably drop him you can do it if you want but you'll probably drop him  is Bam worth the top 20 pick for durability purposes no I don't think you need to reach on him there I think he'll be there you know when he comes back kind of early third round anyway  so nah  Dame or Kevin Durant with the 9th pick in a roto draft I probably go KD if there's a game's cap  Sac accountants back says if I go when be should I look to trade him now or enjoy the ride um  you can get a couple of big games out of him I would trade him for a second round and never look back  Anthony says and then I gotta wrap it up the questions are flying in here at the end of the show I'm trying to catch up and I'm not doing a great job of it hi Dan which side is better value for and James Harden or Desmond Bane I'll probably go Bane get me off of the messy mess is Al Horford roster and a 14 team her head to head know he missed 20 games last year and they're gonna do it again Roto Maybe  don Vito's is hard and fell to 65 in my draft yesterday is that too far yeah that's too far all right it's got to go before 65 you can sit out a month and he'll he'll be of value there  Matisse says last four pics of my draft for Bruce Brown the Anthony Melton I'm in Thompson and Obi topping is any one of them worth dropping for a streamer spot yeah odds are that you'll have at least one streamable but let's give him a week or two  YMCA says are you high on Melton why I'm see if you've been watching any my shows man I've talked about DeAnthony about 15 different shows yes I love Dean Anthony these Gonna Get You crap ton of steals it's going to be great  Marco says favorite draft pick and one of your drafts this year I got Chris Paul at 104 in 30 DP and then those those bozos let me come right back and get Jaden McDaniels at like 1:37  having the best time having the best time  my T says I drafted on Yoko Kong would 82 is that too much now that's fine F Scott Foster says will Ben Simmons be a top 75 player he's truly healthy that's basically where I'd expect him to be if he's healthy is 75.80 range  jpx come oh no it's that same question again Weston says do you think Jeremy Grant could potentially go back to his Pistons version of himself yeah  yeah  I'm hoping he remains more efficient than that but it's a distinct possibility  Sac says are you high on Drew holidays is it worth A fifth or sixth round pick yes absolutely fifth sixth round that's a great value third round now fourth round  50 yes six oh yeah  Anthony says are you big on Dennis Schroder I am not his game doesn't translate very well to nine category League's even when he was playing a ton he had trouble getting inside the top 100 last year he played 30 minutes of game on the Lakers and he was numbered 2 200 and 16  expectations for the Thompson Twins bumpy ride  as are I love the the combination of defensive stats assists rebounds he can do a lot of cool stuff he's a guy that I think I'd really like to have maybe both on a dynasty deal but I'm doing redraft we're talking redrafted right now I think you might be able to get stuff out of them the second half of the year but the first I think both are outside the top one 50 is RJ Barrett this is Don a must roster player in category leagues nope  cirilla says I'm concerned with durability so I'm thinking of trading Kauai from Michael Bridges would you do that I'm fine with that I'm good either way I like both of those guys for different reasons  and Vivek says pick one Drew or kristaps we're seeing us I will go pour Singas  give me the wild
