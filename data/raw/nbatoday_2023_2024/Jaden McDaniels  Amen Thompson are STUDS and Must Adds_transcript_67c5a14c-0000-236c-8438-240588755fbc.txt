welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast Sabbath and everybody welcome to this Wednesday  days of the week who needs them Edition  fantasy NBA today  I need a  I need to relight the fire  I need to re like the fire we're so close to the end of the season  and  you know for rotol League's this is a time when you really want to hunker down but it's  you know it's less so about the sort of day-to-day Insanity on the Roto side  and it's more about  isolating the  key stats you need  so it's a really different process and Rodeo right now and then of course Head to Head we have our second show every day where we break down who your streaming whatever I'm trying to figure out a way to synthesize this and the best thing I've come up with so far is doing these back-to-back shows but if something else pops into my Dome will try to do that also working on a side project right now where I'm hoping I can catalog my feelings on basically every Fringe fantasy player in the NBA and there's a lot of them there's like probably 100 so it's gonna take a minute but I feel like that would be a really cool way for people to be able to sort of refer back oh what did Dan think about this particular fringy guys this guy that danced high on is he low on you guys don't have to and you know  me repeating myself as also part of this equation that maybe comes off the table as well  follow me on Twitter at Danbury if you're watching on social pretty easy you just hit the button if you're watching anywhere else or listening somewhere else it's at d a n b e s b r i s this of course is a sports ethos presentation where the Fantasy Baseball draft is available now make sure to go get yourself a copy of that on the fantasy pass baseball fantasy pass or All Sport today  yesterday was a short card will move our way through it methodically a couple of teams I do want to kind of stop and and freeze on for a minute Houston is not really one of them but there are a couple of quick notes on the Rockets know number one Jalen green and the month of March has now officially become a thing if it wasn't before it is now he's going crazy this month and he sort of  say historically he hasn't been in the NBA all that long but historically he has been very good at the tail ends of seasons and it's very strange how does mentally what's going into this process that that makes him a different player when the end is in sight  it's almost like he's done getting out of his own way so to that end this is probably one of those rare times where I'd say go ahead and and play the hot guy normally you know I like to avoid streaming a player who's just sort of running hot  but it does feel like Jalen green can just be it in March  maybe April 2  I'm in Thompson he's slid into a role that we all always wanted him to which is the minutes that outbreak in left by the wayside Rockets have definitely opted to go small  yeah they've won a few games in a row here so they're feeling better about themselves and there are a few things happening on that front well that actually six games straight they're now only two and a half back of the Warriors interestingly enough but it's also worth pointing out that you know win over the Wizards is not exactly something to write home about and they have two of those during this six-game win streak also wins over the Spurs and the Blazers so four of the six wins have come against teams that are actively trying to lose basketball games they also beat the Cavs who basically haven't had half of their starting lineup and they beat the kings that was a pretty good win so you know credit to the Rockets they are beating the teams they're supposed to but also these are some really bad teams when they get challenged with this lineup I'll be curious to see what happens next they've got the Bulls coming up that'll be a semi challenge but then they've got the Jazz and the Blazers again  before the schedule gets a little bit tougher they still that actually still have three games left with the tanking Utah Jazz but basically every other game besides that is gonna be against pretty good teams and there's one more Blazers game down the line all so  that'll be an interesting test for the Rockets we'll see how they perform in that situation fantasy wise I'm in Thompson obviously just a massive massive win he didn't play great the first game or two when Schengen went down but  it was so clear that those minutes were going to eventually land on him should cam Whitmore reappear at some point well want to take a look in his Direction uh I don't think you have to preempt that and you certainly wouldn't drop Thompson for any reason  on that front and then you've got jock landale who came in Off the Bench and blocked seven shots in 20 minutes  20 minutes ain't enough you know as much as I love the seven blocks 20 minutes isn't enough and we do this thing in fantasy where we only look at the last game a player played and then try to make a call based on that alone and for landale you know the first game when Schengen went down what did he play 26 minutes you had 11 4 and 5 with two steals in a block and then he basically did nothing for two games and then he had this seven block massive massive outlier  I think you guys know what to do with outliers but just in case  watchlist you don't need to go any farther than that  Wizards on the other hand are an interesting Bunch right now so Kyle kuzma was not on the injury report immediately after the last ball game where he was out and then he got re-added to it  I think late on Monday dealing with that Source shoulder I don't think he's totally done for the year I think if he was done for the season they'd just come out and say it they're sort of no reason not to you're the Wizards you're losing a lot of basketball games  but I have also no idea when he may reappear that's the the problematic side of this all so tyus Jones doesn't sound like he's close to coming back Marvin Bagley doesn't sound like he's close to coming back Deni avdija I don't really know so the Wizards have basically wiped out their starters  pretty much all of them  if you consider Jordan Poole a bench player now who moves back into the starting five so all of a sudden you have a completely different Wizards roster  when I did yesterday's podcast whose mom was not on the injury report so most of what I said was like look if who's comes back he takes 22 shots off of these guys and then you know  Justin champagne and Patrick Baldwin and and Anthony Gill and Jared Butler and like all these guys that got a bunch of extra things to do yesterday probably working to get all of those extra things to do  but then kuzma got re-added to the injury report ended up getting ruled out and they all did get all these things to do so we kind of have to have two parallel paths for the Wizards in terms of how we react going forward  if you're on the head-to-head side they don't have a particularly good schedule they play tomorrow they play Saturday just two games left the rest of this week there are a lot of teams left that have three games we talked about it on yesterday's streaming show I think they're 22 teams yesterday that still had three games left in the week that number goes down a little bit after last night but still quite a few remaining so if you're making a move you're probably going to somebody that has three games left  if you're on the Roto side and your stat hunt hunting there are a few names to keep in sort of the back of your mind name number one is a guy we've talked about for a while that's Corey kispert who's going to score  and I don't know what's going on with his free throw stroke lately but he's gonna hit a bunch of three-pointers and you usually get you a couple of rebounds couple of assists if he's out there for 35 minutes so probably sort of bungalow his way into a steel not exactly his thing but the minutes are so high that type of stuff will often happen so I'm gonna hold on to Corey kispert despite yesterday's game being relatively quiet  Rashawn Holmes belongs on rosters right now he is not going particularly High usage which is a little bit of a shame giving the dudes around him it not exactly deserve it more than he does but 26 minutes or more for homes that's a top 100 play historically even though he's you know very much very clearly lost a step over the last couple of Seasons 12 and nine is stealing a block he's also a good percentage of guy from the center spot it's very easy to put a fantasy stats when you're a center who has good percentages  then you get into some of these no neighbors well Jordan Poole you're starting because the usage is just gonna be through astronomical while he's kind of The Last Man Standing but then you get into all these relative no neighbors who have suddenly stepped into much larger roles those guys are Johnny Davis who played 27 minutes and did absolutely nothing with it so that's an easy don't need to add Patrick Baldwin who actually looked pretty good in the previous game but it's got shaved back down to 21 in this one fantasy line was fine but unspectacular watch list on Baldwin  Jewels Bernard had 16 points in 19 minutes off the bench I'm going to keep a very very soft ion same story for Anthony Gil who had a pretty good bench line but the minutes were in high enough  and then you get to the two guys that probably deserves the hardest look of all these kind of new to the equation players Jared Butler and Justin champagne Butler took 19 shots in his 31 bench minutes yesterday the second is used to join the team behind Jordan Poole and ended up with 15 points on 19 shotts nine assists though a steel and a block and so the question then becomes is this a guy that they start to make well just the replacement point guard  and the answer is we don't really know yet  we don't really know yet because his minutes have been higher for two games really well three kind of slowly ramping up in the previous two games he played 22 minutes a piece  and at a total of 13 points and seven assists and then yesterday all the sudden out of nowhere 19 shots in 31 minutes 15 and 9 I don't think you need to race out and add Jared Butler I think you should probably call him a strong watch list in case this is a type of thing that sticks  and then Justin champagne who is clearly the closest out of all of these guys to having  a more consistent level of fantasy production played 36 and now 31 minutes in his last two ballgames with all of these guys out now if DIA or kuzma comes back I don't think you can rely say oh yeah I shouldn't he's going to get 30 plus minutes but in these two games he's got nine for 20 shooting which isn't bad a debated the free-throw line that's good 16 rebounds for steals over those ball games that stuff feels somewhat repeatable if the minute Stay High  I think if you're looking at champagne  from a head-to-head standpoint it's almost too hard to make that call because our schedule isn't good they play in all the high traffic days next week and none of the low traffic days and we don't know if kuzma and aviar coming back at any point so that makes it really hard to make that call for Roto  you know if you have dead weight you could pick up champagne stick them on your bench and just kind of see how the next game or two goes  I don't know that I would just immediately drop him in Sacramento should be a relatively high scoring game Toronto there in sort of relative tank mode these days  if everybody remains out  what I have the stones to play him against a games cap in their next ball game probably not all though you guys know me I tend to be a bit more conservative using up stuff against the games cap but  that's where I sit kill me if you like  Charlotte I don't care about the schedule stuff we'll talk about that on the second half our other show later on today as far as you know Rodeo who do you play against the game's cap Miller Bridges Man meets itch all four of those guys have been solid against the game's cap lately man is going to be your closest to dropping out because of the holes he has in his Fantasy game Nick Richards is remains in the doesn't matter grouping you know between 100 and 150  yeah great Williams is finally cool off kind of knew that was coming he's also in my eyes in that doesn't matter grouping  and with Trey man back  that hurts Williams I think Grant still probably plays enough to have some fantasy value but inconsistent and also kind of a weird Fantasy game  Jaylen sucks has been playing well lately and look I mean we know about enough about the Jalen Suggs experience this year to know that number one he is an outstanding real life Defender and number two he's had these stretches where he's run very hot and then he's had stretches where he runs very cold  it's hard to isolate  them or to know when they stopped and when they end  right now he's in the midst of about a three week heater we shooting almost 60% over that run and when he shoots well the ball well when the field goal percentage is not a giant negative the defensive stats carry him through so right now  Jalen Suggs I think we can officially upgrade  from doesn't matter range or schedule range to a play because the defensive stats are back it seems like he's got his legs back underneath him he's just playing really well right now and  you know it's not gonna be every single ball game as a winner but if you look at his recent performance he shot over 50% in three of his last four ball games he had a couple games where you was injured prior to that but even before that he had shot over 50% in seven consecutive ballgames  this is after a stretch in the middle of the Season where he shot under 50% like 80 to 90% of the time for almost two months  so it's roster ship is going back up he's always been a great steals Guy that's been the case all season long  and he's pushed himself back up to a start so go ahead and start Jalen Suggs see how long this heater goes at some point it will write out and we want to be careful about it but there's only what three and a half weeks left in the season anyway so you know maybe it lasts the rest of the way I don't know  honestly it's just nice to have something to talk about on the magic fantasy wise  the Peli pellets man it is hard to hang on to Jonas Fallen asuna's right now I don't know if you can I mean you kind of have to look we  this is a hard one for me to talk about because I was in fade mode on valentina's during draft season if you guys remember way back when I basically just said I didn't want to draft him he still number 86 on a per game basis on the season but that's largely because the first two and a half three months this year he was very very good and during that stretch I was like good Lord did I really with this hard was JV like the man and I had no idea  and as it turns out no he is not the man he was just running crazy heavy for a while the Pelicans are finally kind of rotating into a little bit more of a small ball situation they'll play Nancy Center when they need some defense they'll play Zion at Center when they need some offerings they just haven't needed JV lately and for the better part of a month and a half now he's been sitting close to the edge of the back of like the top 175  that's a hard player to hold on to and I honestly I don't think you really have to I traded for him I think I mentioned this on a previous show I traded for him in one League where I desperately needed big man stats field goal percent rebounds basically so I'm gonna hang on to him there and I think a lot of spots you can hang on and at some point they'll have her game where they need Valentine's to play big but right now they don't herb Jones is healthy again Trey Murphy's been running warm not as much in this ball game but you hold right now Naji Marshall has been getting it uptick and playing time Nancy's healthy that's a big one for JV  so very the softest of hold recommendations on valentina's right now these softest of hold recommendations  but again  I drafted him in precisely zero League's  I mean eight Yahoo cash League's I'm in a couple of others  I'm in about 10 ish this year I drafted Valentine's in none of them  he was in avoid guy for me and it's finally looking like that's the case all the  geesh first three months not so much  anyway so it's hard for me to put myself in your shoes but I think I would probably try to hang on just a little bit longer even if it's very complicated you guys know me I love Larry Nance Jr I've been tricked so many times on the nonce thing I can't do it guys I can't do it he needs about 23 24 minutes to be a consistent fantasy player and he's gotten that in four of his last five ball games but he had only gotten that one time in the previous seven  he's on a stretch right now where they're leaning into his skill set some of its opponent some of its just line ups and whatever I can't do it guys I can't do it  they play on the off days next week meaning the light days so to that end like head-to-head side he makes more sense Roto I just I can't I can't do the nonce thing again  Brooklyn's terrible they've been so terrible for so long they thought a coaching change would magically fix it it didn't they're just bad  they're a bad basketball team they're four and a half games still back at the Atlanta Hawks who don't have Trey Young and the Nets are so bad that they can't catch him we are now finally to the point where people were like should I bandage on the Nets should I drop everybody three weeks ago I'm like this just know like there's no reason for them to shut everybody down on March 1st  I don't believe they have their pick this year they were still mathematically within Striking Distance of the play in tournament we're starting to get close now to the point where  even if they don't have their own pick it'll just be time to pull the plug because there's no reason to Mikhail Bridges gonna want to play in every ball game that's his shtick  and cam Thomas is gonna want a chance to just go nuts but at some point here you're gonna probably see Nick klaxon get a day off you're gonna see shrewd or get a day off I would imagine you're going to see cam Johnson get some more days off although he's missed a bunch this year so maybe not  all that to say  a couple players to keep an eye on day Ron Sharpe who had 17 rebounds in this ball game but again as long as clocks in his upright you can't take that Plunge  keep an eye on cam Johnson should everybody else take some days off and he's like and I missed enough time this year I want to play  keep an eye on Dennis Smith Jr if Schroeder takes any time off  and that's probably about it you're not making any moves on Brooklyn right now this is a ugly ugly loss again they have no offense they can play a little bit of Defense when they try but that's a tough team to watch these days so just keep one eye on those guys in kind of have them on the top of the could I add this guy board if the right other person took a week off Dallas from a roto standpoint Kyrie Luka Gafford this is a rare off day for Luka easily his worst game of the season but luckily we're so deep into the year that it doesn't really impact rankings all that much he's firmly in that number five hole  pretty far behind Anthony Davis and a pretty good deal ahead of Kawhi Leonard from just a an overall z-score standpoint  Derek Lively is schedule level Dante Exum is like kind of teetering on that PJ Washington's schedule level that that's really all you get out of the rest of these two so not much with the maths just nice to see the max actually playing gaffer again these days  all right  for this Spurs I'm officially upgrading trade Jones back out of the doesn't matter group and back into the play hymn group he's been warm lately  and you know this is the the  say sports or a game of inches fantasy sports are all kind of a game of inches because Trey Jones kind of burst onto the scene when they finally let him start  well I should rephrase that sentence when they finally let him start games this year he had a bunch of really good ones in a row and then through February he cool not the beginning of the month more so like middle end of February and into the beginning of March he basically wasn't taking any shots he went from taking eight to 11 shots of ballgame to like five or six almost every night just completely abandon ship on being a part of the offense  over the last four ball games now 15 6 7 and 11 again you've got a six and a seven mixed in there which is not exactly what you want but if you roll it all together two out of four games in double figures and shot attempts that's very important  he's also at 9 3-pointers over those four ball games which also feels wildly unsustainable but I just like the fact that he's trying  take some shots trade Jones take some any do anything at all on offense besides just handing the ball to someone else which is what they needed earlier this year hey be a point guard and so it was like oh okay assistant steals great and field goal percent but didn't hit any threes wasn't involved in the offense it's sort of like the good field goal percent was nice but he wasn't taking off shots for it to be worth anything  that's why we need trade Jones up in that eight nine ten shots range instead of five six seven it makes all the difference last 30 days Trey Jones is taking only seven shots a game by the way and that still got him inside the top 80s the last two weeks he's now taking over seven shots a game and that hasn't been signed the top 60 and over the last single week which again this is going to be pretty front-loaded he's taking eight shots of ball game  and that has him inside the top 50  so that's the magic of Trey Jones get him to eight freaking shots a game and he can be a difference making fantasy player  doesn't take that much but the five or six shots per game just isn't going to do it because you need that field goal percent to be an actual impact category and for that to be the case he needs to actually take a few shots  over the last two weeks  I abandoned I moved off of that table let me move back to that table over the last two weeks straight Jones is averaging 11 points almost nine assists and 1/2 steals per game  that's good  so play him he's warm weather he's warm or not he's actually taking shots that's what's important right now so we officially have a third San Antonio Spur that you can play every day  and that's the other thing about that doesn't matter group that we talked about now guys that just land in the 100 to 150 range the doesn't matter guys if you can isolate the ones that have the ability to maybe take a small step forward those are the doesn't matter guys where you try harder to hang on to them and then there's the doesn't matter guys were like a Nick Richards there's really no place for him to go forward kind of no place for him to go back as long as nobody else comes to take those sentiments so he's a true doesn't matter use Nick Richards only when you need is exact stats trade Jones is always kind of like a doesn't matter but could it get better  and it has now for a little bit  I was late to upgrade him I should have upgraded him you know one or two games back but I wanted to be sure so here you go otherwise everybody on this Spurs you know if you want to play some of these guys when they have a good schedule be my guest but the three guys you're playing every day are obviously we sell and now Trey Jones  Denver hasn't had a fantasy note this year other than there was like a week where Reggie Jackson was filming in and he was actually good enough to be considered a fill in but on the minus side let's briefly pause here on the infirmed Timberwolves they got a bunch of guys out these days Minnesota down cat for the rest of the regular season down Rudy gobert down well wait a minute excuse me Monte Morris actually came back he left the previous game I think but he came back in this one  slo-mo had left the game recently and then came back  right now there are five Timberwolves playing starter level minutes  those five and it's gonna find this hard to believe because you look at the box score and you wouldn't notice it  but Kyle Anderson who played 26 minutes you're like 26 that's not right Dan he picked up 3,000 the first three minutes of yesterday's game I think he played like a total of maybe six first half minutes and played almost the entire second half  the goal was not to stop him at 25 and a half minutes he was supposed to get 30 but fouls were a big time issue early so Anthony Edwards duh  play him all the time Mike Conley duh he's a play  but then you've got these other miscellaneous goofballs like nickeil Alexander Walker who had a couple of good ball games and then really pooped the bed in this one Kyle Anderson who's been not really involved on offense it is minutes this year for whatever reason and then Jaden McDaniels who hasn't been involved in the offense  ever  is a brilliant perimeter Defender  but needs a lot of people to get the hell out of the way for him to finally like actually go trust his shot a little bit  what do we do with those guys because those are sort of the three Fringe or fantasy players Alexander Walker  you know you've been on a pretty good tear lately and I think if so I you know  stipulation number one is we need cat and go bare to remain out  okay if either of those guys let's say either my cat's not coming back if gobert comes back in their next ball game the whole play here gets blown up they're by the way also down Nas Reed almost forgot to mention that I was reminded when I looked down I saw Luka Garza play 22 minutes nazri also out so they're all they're down three centers right now and it's like well you only have so many centers on a roster so everybody else gets to play up a spot so Kyle Anderson was the starting center which I guessed might happen on yesterday's podcast like I'm actually kind of surprised to did  he's a start  Kyle Anderson starting at a big man spot use him well three centers are out for Minnesota  Jane McDaniels started well three centers are out because more than the three centers being out the usage is in I like to talk about everything going in with usage pool there are X number of shots and passes that occur in an NBA game and when you're a guy who doesn't generally get to do many of those the guys in front of you going down and sometimes guys you know sort of jump over you in the pecking order but right now three guys in front of Jaden McDaniels that typically took shots and did stuff are out of the way and so he gets to do a couple  so start Jaden McDaniels right now start Kyle Anderson Nicole Alexander Walker is a little bit more of a coin flip I think he probably settles in that sort of doesn't matter chunk  with a little bit of upside if you catch him on a right night you can get a bunch of assist boards three steals blocks he can do that across the board stuff but if you catch him on a wrong night like this one usually sends a chill up your spine  so Nicole Alexander Walker I don't know that I use him against the game's cap I think Kyle Anderson Jane McDaniels I would provided all three centres remain out for the Timberwolves in their next ball game a mid-show reminder a lot of you watching on social media these days which is super cool thank you for to the Twitter algorithm for making that possible but hey if you're watching and you just

looking for new contributors at sports ethos.com so reach out if you're interested in making the jump and think you can hang on the analyst side quick look here at the chat room see if anybody brought up some names that I didn't talk about on the show what do you think between Walker Kessler and Santi aldama I like Kessler between those two guys Brandon says hello chat I got four players injures in two moves left for the week as everybody else fantasy week going yeah you're not alone bud I don't know if you guys watched one of our shows yesterday when my good friend Andre was posting you sort of making jokes about what he should do with Isaiah Stewart he was talking about my team actually but in that League where he and I are playing each other I think he's down he's got two injuries already this week and I think I've got two or three I forget what it's like five or six guys that have already been ruled out for the front half of the week it's a stupid time  and I always said and your league three weeks early if you want to dodge the Silly Season but it might have to be four weeks early next year because the Silly Season is very much upon us and now you're even seeing the tanking teams that were already losing shutting additional people down luckily we haven't gotten into the part where the teams that are at the top of the board  are doing anything completely and say other Boston's had all these back-to-backs and they're resting half of their guys in them and that's a pain in the butt  honestly all of this is a reason to do two things one if you're in a head-to-head League set a weekly games cap so that way if guys skip a game here and there it doesn't really matter all that much you get your best opportunity it's there's more strategy in it you're not only trying to maximize games or two just try Roto  people like I'll roll those boring know it's not  go win at all I promise you winning at Road always not born  if you're asking streaming questions in the chat room I would encourage you to put those in our streaming show later on today  so I will not be answering those here on this morning show  yeah these are all streaming questions  streaming streaming streaming streaming streaming streaming  mikal Bridges is hege bus this year yeah even kind of crazy even by total still a bust yeah that that's kind of amazing actually the fact that a guy who plays in every single ball game is still not gonna hit 80P he's number 92  just can't shoot  43 and a half percent and it's free throws were supposed to be higher he's only at 81% there  just an epic disaster disaster of a season for a guy drafted at the tail end of the second early third his number 54 by total so at least he's in the fifth round on that front and playing every day is useful but man he's been taking people's percentages all season long  I drafted him only in one spot because typically you guys know me I'm in Roto and so at the end of the second round I wasn't taking Bridges I was taking I was taking Kawaii that was my Target in that spot and I got a lot of kawaii Leonards on my fantasy teams and I am  so grateful that that's the direction I went there  oh  but but hey Dan Patrick Baldwin got in foul trouble early in the game does that change your mind he's still a watch list guy I'm still not adding him  not until I know more on coos  so good question though it's good question somebody bringing up what do I do about what I pick up key on Ellis this question is about it Matisse diebel and if you're like hunting defensive stats but instead of taking that exact question I'll just talk about key on Ellis so head to headers you guys know Sacramento's got a great schedule starting tonight they start a five game in seven day stretch and we'll talk more about that on our other show later today I I do think that Ellis probably is a top 100 Guyanese  you know with guys that can get him open maybe he takes four or five six shots a game instead of like three or four just a couple extra it's it's the same thing we just talked about with Trey Jones one or two extra shots a game for these guys that live on the edge  of fantasy value is so critical  and so I think Keon Alice's a guy that maybe takes one or two extra shots Sacramento is is beat up right now and not like hugely beat up but like no trains as a reserve role know Kevin herder they're just a few extra shots there and I'm hoping that Ellis takes one or two of those that would then push him into a place where you're like yes this is actually kind of an exciting start  here's a good question here's a rotor question all into this one good from Albert is it a strategy to save some game caps for possible Silly Season hero performance is think Jalen horde a few seasons back  I'm gonna say softly know uh but let me get into the strategy of this just for one or two minutes and then we'll we'll  pause all other thoughts until we get to the streaming show in the afternoon again if you're asking streaming questions please come back for our second show today make sure you subscribe so you know when that second show is happening and that way you can come catch it live as well  the reason I don't save moves in sort of like the saving sense  for Silly Season hero performances is because your starters are going to miss games  that you can then just quickly fill in with the Silly Season guys  so you don't need to create an opening for those dudes the openings just gonna happen  if you're running basically parallel with the game's cap when I say that I mean like right now if you look at the bottom of a Yahoo team page it'll tell you how they expect you to do  against the game's Capital like are you write on it are you running ahead are you running behind you sort of like are you running hot or cold on that thing if you're running right on it that's the perfect place to be right now with three weeks left in the season you don't want to be too far behind because it's going to be hard to catch up soon when half of your players stop playing and you know what to be running too far ahead for this very reason but also because if you're running parallel you can start to  attack specific categories better than if you've already used up your games cap someone else can attack categories and try to pass you  so right now you want to be pretty close to right on point because between now and the end of the regular season your regulars are going to miss a couple of ball games whether it's one two whatever non-zero number for almost all of your regulars and that is where you take the Silly Season guys plug them into those holes immediately you stay right online to fill your games cap and you get to use the Silly Season Heroes sort of in the moment  it's a quick thing your starters out Silly Season starters in if you're running behind you're silly season guys are gonna have to replace your starters and you're going to need clunky your guys to fill in the game that you were falling behind hopefully that made sense thanks again everybody for watching this first of our two shows today we'll be back this time it'll be right after lunch okay I'm not
