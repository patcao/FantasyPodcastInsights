welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast you guys might see a little bit of mouth breathing on today's episode apologies for that my  nasal situation has devolved since this morning  I am  bit congested  it's fine I I didn't want to use Afrin yet because I want to save it for when I got a fall sleep  I guess I could do it now and then more later but  damn man what am I some kind of afraid attic  oh I am oh okay then that's fair maybe I should have done that oh well  screw it it's fine again I don't feel all that bad light headache just from being so congested but Joe mushy through here oh yeah that's a handsome dude on your screen right there welcome to this bonus edition of fantasy NBA today I am Dan best press snuffle up against for a day at Dan best person on Twitter wish I could change my Twitter handle to at Snuffleupagus that didn't work uh you could check out Sports ethos.com ethos fantasy BK and of course our trade deadline live coverage coming up next Thursday  February the 8th at 7:30 a.m. Pacific time we are at 565 thumbs up  and Counting  I can't just say that noise right now that's not gonna work with the current sinus situation  but let's go ahead and dive in we'll keep this one to someone on the brief side my goal is 15 to 20 minutes kind of a quick hitter  seems fun right  see if I can remember to turn my mic off when I'm sneaking through my nose I feel like that the Doctor Seuss type thing why am I wearing a red shirt actually this is my at home shirt I forgot to take it off and switch into something slightly more presentable so it's pretty dirty actually like kids boogers my own Bookers see there's one reference per show  Bi-Lo  Bi-Lo weak 15 that's where we're talking about on today's episode quickly here's what happened from our last buy lows Steph Curry yeah that was a pretty easy one he had fallen outside the top 20  a do he's back up to number 19 that gigantic game against the Lakers was certainly helpful and he's just gonna be better with Draymond back and the thing is I people that were coming to be on social that were like how the hell am I supposed to buy low on Steph freaking Curry Steph Curry  simple  you offer somebody that was ranked higher than him  because he was at what like 23 24 something like that I forget what it was last it wasn't last week it was the end of the week before we had our last Buy Low episode you offer somebody ranked ahead of him with the understanding that Steph as he works his way up the board will pass that guy so like a Tyrese Maxey would have been someone you could offer I would even have gone as far as like a Chad Holmgren or a Scottie Barnes I probably would have said Devin Booker and then he went completely insane the last week but I mean all the  concept of ships passing in the night so to speak it's by low is not like  you know you're  you not offering up trash No One's Gonna Give You Steph Curry for trash you got offer someone ranked near where he was with the understanding that he will then move past them a lot of people get this concept way wrong  you hear Buy Low and they're like who lowball time no that's not how it works  you offer something reasonable  because your assessment your projection of this player is how far they'll move so you should be willing to spend anything basically up to some distance from where you think they're going to finish so if you thought Steph Curry was gonna finish at number 13 and he was ranked at number 23 you're willing to offer something in between those two and then all the way back down to the end of time all so like obviously if you could get him for over 30 you would but you're not gonna cause he was deaf  folks don't understand how this game works  last show I said Darius Garland I thought would be back in one to two weeks it's been one and a half weeks and it will talk more about Garland later because he's actually a repeat offender on today's show because of some news that actually broke right before I went on air couple a little by low notes on some guys we've covered before mikal Bridges finally on the way up cam Johnson still on the way down Jimmy Butler good news there he's been a second rounder since coming back from his injury I think that's eight games back he's pushed himself into the third round in actual per game rankings and to me again it's just sort of a matter of time until Jimmy gets this thing sorted out so that's pretty easy stuff we don't need to hang out on that slide for too long  our Bi-Lo of the day is actually Chet Holmgren of all things who is still ranked just fine 2021 22 20 it depends on what side you're at basketball monster hasn't but to get 22 Yahoo hasn't been 27 the real key here is that over the last month he's number 61  and I think folks are  I don't want to say like not as excited about him but that's probably the best way to describe it I think folks have become slightly less excited  by Chad Holden and whether they should be or should not be remains still kind of Up For Debate  main thing is a lot of stuff for him is just a little bit down from where it was early in the season remember we got off to a first round start shooting 50 some odd from the field 40 some odd from the 3-point line 97 out at the free throw line he's a 5490 got to start the year and I think we all do that wasn't going to stick but the question was where would it end up and then how would it get there is maybe even a more important question  because if you thought he was going to end up at 80% free throws and he shot 90% for a month  you know law of averages would suggest maybe he shoots 70% for a month but it doesn't always work out that way  he might shoot 80% for the next month and then he might have two weeks where he shoots 50% or something like that and that's how the number comes down it's not always this perfect like oh you're gonna get to Seven Points here's a week of nine and then oh a week of five  that's not how averages work I mean it is how I just work but it's not how they work in the NBA it's not that consistent  so the nice thing here about Chad homegrown is that over the last month while he's been ranked outside the top six it's largely because he's shooting 50 some odd percent at the free throw line  as a result of that that 90% going down to 50% his overall scoring on the year is all so down because you lost like roughly a point at the free throw line and yeah I mean I guess you could argue that his shot per game number is perhaps a little bit lower over that stretch he's at 11.8 field goal attempts per ball game prior to that he was in the low 12 it's a small adjustment  so the scoring is down largely because the efficiency is down the blocks are a little bit down just because you know 2.7 or whatever is at the first month and a half was gonna be a very hard number for a rookie to hold an entire year and over the last month these at 2.3 which is still very very good  if you just took his numbers flat across  and adjusted his free throw number from 58 percent back up into around that 80 range he would jump from the mid-60s what did I say 61 no 60 yes 61 back into probably the 20s or 30s  I think there's a very real chance that  whole grids getting a little bit worn out  and you've got trade deadline and then all star break not too far away  which kind of brings guys back out of the Dog Days a little bit because right now it's like this oh my God they all star break is so far away I'm tired the beginning of the season is so far in the rear view how am I gonna have the energy to go forward as soon as you start to smell some kind of Finish Line even if it's not the end of the season even if it's just like a checkpoint Christmas  uh  All-Star break these types of things that kind of wakes guys up a little bit  I think because HomeGoods having this kind of down month  that he can probably be had for someone ranked a little bit behind where he is on the entire season because I think homegrown by and large people are like yeah we knew this wasn't gonna hold now we're seeing him tippity tippity tip coming like slowly working his way down the board what do we do now what kind of a player can we offer up to get it back my suggestion is start with somebody ranked around 30 that is not hurt  I would have said Jalen Brunson if the Julius Randle news if he didn't dislocate his shoulder that's one that I think you could throw out their cat coming off his 60 some odd point game I think is actually a really interesting player to offer up for Chad Holmgren because I had his behind him right now but over the last week obviously cats in front 60 whatever it was 6162  and jets been kind of slowed you've got some other names mixed in there depending on what stats you're looking for LeBron is intriguing he's been outside of the ridiculous double overtime numbers he'd actually been outside the top 100 prior to that game over the last month you've got someone like a Brook Lopez who looks like he's gonna have a better role under Doc Rivers maybe that's the name you offer up if people are valuing him higher than that probably won't be enough to get it done dear and fox is interesting if you're if you don't need the big scoring and you know if you want to try to get out from the free throw issue that might actually get it done believe it or not even though Fox is actually having kind of a Down month all so because he's been shooting 43% I don't think anybody's noticed because he's still scoring 20 some odd points and game but look if we're talking about nine cat here which is the way I like to talk about fantasy basketball not points it's the different monster you're talking about nine cat all we need is for homegroup to go back to shooting high 70s to low 80s range which I think you know mid to high 70s feels very attainable for him and on the season  that's where he's at and that hasn't ranked basically in the early to mid-20s which I think is probably where he finishes  I think this one's a very doable one because his value is tied up heavily in blocks and not smashing your percentages and some teams don't see the value in a player like that I do  we talked about dejounte Murray on a recent show I think it was a couple episodes back because he had actually been slumping a little bit I put him back on the Bi-Lo board now for a very different reason  and those that are watching the video you can see I wrote nine cat Rank and then after that colon I put doesn't matter  it doesn't  no one cares what Deontay Murray's been doing lately this I can promise you because all anyone is thinking about with him is The Strife fees causing right now we focused know the rumors folks of seeing the weird text messages or DMS floating around on Twitter  you know the images of them  nobody cares these number 41 on the season nobody cares what he's done over the last month two weeks two months whatever it is nobody cares  all anyone is thinking about is  where he's going to get a traded  and the nice thing about that is  when someone is on the Block like that  especially if it's a player who's had a lot of you such  and even more so if it's a player where the destination feels like it could be a downgrade people are going to be afraid  just a lot of fear around dejounte Murray right now  and it's fine that's allowed he's probably not going to get let's say he does end up on the Lakers who you know the rumors now is that they're souring on him a little bit number one because they're happy with delos play lately and number two I think I would my guess would be that they don't like some of the attitude stuff their hearing about him he's not gonna get 17 and a half shots in LA  but let's say he does replace d low the assist would probably go up from five because I know it look again I you're alongside LeBron but LeBron is not Trey young it's not that type of like one person initiates ball dominated basketball you see a lot of Austin Reeves initiating do you love initiates in La sometimes they play through Anthony Davis it just it's a different kind of ball game so yes usage does typically equate to valuable we've seen a Deonte Murray as recently as the San Antonio days or even year One in Atlanta one and a half to two steals per game that's a reasonable thing for to look for for him in La where they're going to ask him to be a big-time defensive presence probably getting better looks at the bucket  so maybe you'll see a slight efficiency uptick I don't know I'm on a bank on it but I don't know that his shots are gonna get much worse  playing alongside Brawn and add  as opposed to Trey Yuen  I would look for steals to go up assists to go up even if points go down and so a lot of that in my mind kind of balances out  like you might look at a guy who's ranked in the early 40s what's up what's what's a reasonable Target for him like even if there's a slippage you're still probably looking at late 40s to early 50s  and I think because of all the fear around him if you went out there and you found someone on your club that has some pretty good name power in the 60s you might just be able to get yourself a Deonte Murray you might be able to offer up a Devin vassell or an OG&E or a France Wagner or uh oh I don't know Keegan Murray who's 55 would probably get it done what I get a voucher 502 questionable probably though is the answer  Nick Clacks it a 49 probably give that up terrorism at 51 I definitely give that up um  trying to think of what other player has pretty good name power in their Jalen Brown at 75 absolutely fire that one off yesterday  so I think there are a lot of names that would actually get that thing done I mean hell you might even want to go as high as like a DeMar DeRozan who look I like a lot that one maybe feels more like a lateral move but not insane not insane  yeah maybe a little insane tomorrow does feel safer especially if they move Levine and he just gets to continue coasting along at his like right around 40 clip but think about all those first names I gave up  Tobias Harris put him on the board klaxon Myles Turner Nicolas vuskovich Keegan Murray  who did I say France Wagner Jalen Brown ogn and Obi Devin vassell  see if the Deonte Murray manager is panicking that's where you want to jump in and that's where maybe you can get something for it and then I want to talk about Darius Garland one more time  do do do do do let's see here  so there's been too much time on it because we talked about Garland a week and a half ago and I said I thought he'd be back in one to two weeks and that's turning out to probably be accurate right before we came on air today JB Bickerstaff mentioned that Garland is very very close so we take a quick Gander at the Cavaliers schedule this week they played tonight  and then they got a Detroit Memphis cruising back to Beth San Antonio wow that's a nice schedule this week they got the Clippers that's a tough one but then Wednesday Thursday Detroit Memphis I would not be at all shocked to see Darius Garland back in at least one of those two ball games meaning  because this news is not being heavily reported like the big aggregators haven't turned it out yet on Garland  this is your last chance truly truly  to trade for him  and I don't know exactly what it's going to cost that's the problem here it's hard to know because if the Darius Garland manager in your league did see the news that he's super close you're probably not gonna be able to get him but it's one of those things that could have slid under the radar the beat Riders put it out like 40 minutes ago but again the aggregators didn't catch it yet  Garland's number 87 this year before going down with injury This Joy injury that's sidelined him for a month and a half that stinks but a lot of that was tied up in the fact that he was at almost four turnovers ball game without being Hyper Elite really and any other statistical category to make up for it in the way that someone like say you know embiid or Luca these guys are in the high threes internals but these guys are absolute goliaths in everything else you can't be at four turnovers a game and just be pretty good at a bunch of stuff that won't get it done  if you're punting turnovers which I know a lot of head to headers are because that's just the nature of the Beast these days Garland jumps up to number 44 so a flying Leap Forward and you know fourth rounder instead of whatever I said 7th 8th rounder that we were talking about before  I do think the turnovers slowly come down over this second half of this season  I think 20 points and six assists which is where he's basically out right now is relatively repeatable so  think about it from this perspective you're probably going out and getting somebody who nine cat and ends up between 40 and 65 on a per game basis  eight cat baby a little bit ahead of that depending on what you think happens with this turnover stuff and I think you could probably get Garland I put top 80 on the board here that might not be enough although it again it kind of depends on what player you're offering up like if Zach Levine was healthy he's 76 that would have been one you could have contemplated their Jalen Brown at 75 with almost definitely get it done Brandon Ingram at 85 would almost definitely get it done because again like looking at the numbers these are not guys who are that far down the board because of one bad commonly punted category these well Jaylen Brown I guess free throws is a big deal but these are guys are farther down for some sort of small assortment of reasons  if you wanted to go Garland with someone that doesn't have quite as much scoring sock that's a little bit farther up the board Michael Porter Jr in the early 70s is someone to consider  I don't know if I sell at 66 is someone you could consider we just talked about him in a different trade situation and a nobby is one although he's likely to have a bump in value here with Julius Randle going down we just mentioned France Vagner a minute ago that's not a terrible idea Bogdan bogdanovich just talked about Keegan Murray a second ago  these are guys that frankly Garland might lose to some of these guys on the Nine Cats side but if it's because of turnovers which basically is the case for Keegan who look you guys know I love Keegan Murray he was on this show as a Bilo early in the season and he's cashed in hard on that front but he's at 0.8 turnovers that's one of those things where if you're not as concerned about that let's say you have a low turnover team in nine cat or if you're an eighth cat you don't care or if you're punting turnovers in nine cat you don't care that's a situation where an adjustment to your team changes the valuation so much that one dude simply Zips past the other but this is very much a Time dependent one very much time dependent because as soon as the news breaks which is probably going to be tomorrow or Wednesday morning that Garland's coming back you ain't gonna be able to pull this one off  no promos today nothing extended at least you guys know the manscape code its ethos 2-0 all I'll do again is ask you all to please take a moment to go like our trade deadline live show please like rate subscribe however you take it in
