welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  it's true I still exist  there were doubts I know afternoon show on a Tuesday after being gone since late late late on Thursday what the hell happened to Old Danny boy but I'm okay  I'm actually good  I told you guys what was going on I'll admit today show a little later than expected but  just very quickly on the general concept of it I initially I thought I would get back into town last night to those that didn't watch our late Thursday early Friday episode  my family and I went to Yosemite  over New Year's  or the Yosemite area I guess I should say no snow this year they got a little bit on Saturday morning well we were  floating through a good friend of mine from high school lives in the Bay Area we kind of meet in the middle get our kids together it's a lot of fun we've done it a couple of times sometimes over President's Day weekend sometimes near New Year's but it does make for a difficult podcasting schedule not like I can run a live show from a cabin in the middle of no place  so we did our big old show on Thursday night covered the whole  week in review  streaming preview into this week because you got the overload days coming up tomorrow and Friday  and I thought that I'd get back into town yesterday in the evening which we did that part actually did come to wish we got back home Friday or  New Year's Day around dinner time  and I thought I'd be able to kind of dive in a little bit get some get caught up maybe even do a storm  no  now what happened because what I forgot in my mind and I don't know why I forgot this it takes a lot of effort to get two kids resettled at home after a vacation and unpack a call it a winter trip because you know we're in I'm in living West Los Angeles so most of the time I wear this  a Super Mario Bros t-shirt and jeans and sometimes I throw on a hooded sweatshirt you know if it's frosty outside so you got to pack a whole frickin' house to take two kids to a cold environment unpacking all of that is a load and a half I didn't want to put out anything last night or even first thing this morning without making sure that I was truly caught up on the events  and so then I got to midday lunchtime early afternoon out here and I thought you know what nobody wants a recap of Monday at like 2 p.m. Pacific time on a Tuesday that's a show that's gonna have an hour and a half shelf life that's stupid Dan do something smarter  so this was my idea for something smarter and it's basically to do another of our Friday type of shows but this week we're doing it on a Tuesday  because we had Friday Saturday Sunday and Monday games basically four days worth of games and even the last Thursday games since the last time I was able to bring you basketball relevant back fantasy basketball information so that's what's going on on today's show you can see it if you're watching live on YouTube we've got the thread or the Microsoft Word document loaded up hovering to my right  it's a week 11 mid week recap thread and instead of recapping an entire week's worth of games were recapping about five days worth of games that's the plan for today um I don't think it'll take as long as our Friday shows do you know well I guess we'll kind of see how things go as we work our way through it a lot of things are going to need explanation because again I have been able to give a lot of context over the last couple of days anyway it's gonna be back thank you all for hanging out with us those that are watching live after the fact podcast channels which by the way I'm realizing now we probably need to do a better job of promoting that there are like regular podcast channels where you can get all this good stuff  Happy New Year  I don't know why I didn't start the show by yelling Happy New Year  we made it  2024 my wife likes even numbered years  I don't know man 2020 was pretty terrible  doesn't that blow it up  happy Leap Year everyone we will have a February 29th oh basketball this season  we are mere weeks away from the greatest  fantasy basketball day of the calendar year that of course is Martin Luther King Junior Day where there are a bazillion games that run from the first moment you wake up out here on the Pacific coast until the moment you go to bed what a hell of a day that will be that's I know Christmas is like start to finish but you got one game at a time MLK days like that like times two and a half  that's the that's the fantasy basketball Junkie day  so anyway that's coming up all good things in January again happy new year thanks again everybody for all the listenership the follows whatever find me over on social media at Dan best person I am Dan best person this is fantasy NBA today a special sort of jumbo size Tuesday show  tomorrow or later on in the program I'll tell you guys what's coming up the rest of the week because it is a little bit of a goofball week with me missing yesterday for the New Year's Day holiday and being out of town and so forth but listen at this point you guys are sick of my rambling I just felt like we needed to get a few things resettled here let's dive in week 11 midweek recap we'll start with the ads over the last few days of course one of them and you know burying the lead I guess a little bit there was a relatively large trade that happened over the weekend with the Nyx acquiring OG anunoby and precious of you but listen I don't think we have to go too far down that rabbit hole for Emmanuel quickly and RJ Barrett Barrett prodigal son returns to Canada quickly who had been badly misplayed by Tom Thibodeau just dog house right from day one team decided they didn't want to afford to pay him so he's off they got himself somebody that they're presumably much more excited about Raptors got a young player who can score like you know what and so on both sides of this there are a few things to think about  the obvious one of course is on the Raptors side if you didn't add a manual quickly already you've Beyond missed the opportunity to do so  I had somebody popping into my mentions and talk about how oh if a manual quickly wasn't already on a roster then he  had a you know a lame or League he's a guy that absolutely had to be fully rostered everywhere uh hello he is outside the top 150 in nine cat so very much not someone that needs to be rostered everywhere and on top of that a lot of his value is tied up in the fact that he has delivered but one turnover I get it people love somebody who scores but he's averaging 15 points a game pre-trade  this is not a guy that needed to be started every day and he was doing more harm than good on every format points 8 cat 9 cat whatever in fact he's worse than eight cat than he was in nine cat  like I said one of his good ones was turnovers  good news is he's not going to be playing 24 minutes a game anymore  Toronto went and got him that's the prize for ogn and Obey in this package he's gonna be taking far more than 11 shots per ballgame so expect his value to rise considerably I would expect points threes assists number of free throws per game probably all so turnovers all of that stuff on the rise if he can keep his field goal percentage for 45 uh keep it sort of a medium-sized negative as opposed to a large one it's not a big steals or blocks guy but if you get them out there for another six minutes maybe that gets him to a point 8.9 steals per game instead of 0.6 I don't know we're sort of extrapolating we're drawing the best fit line either way an extra basically 20 to 30% on top of everything he's doing right now very much does move him inside the top 100 and if you're hunting steals say and on I had to head side or either side I guess that adds to his value because he's not a very good steals Guy very traditional shooting guard type fantasy build good scoring good threes good free throw percent gaping holes that were not going anywhere while he was only playing 24 minutes for the next but look  that's the fantasy side the reality side is he's a pretty good and fun basketball player and the Raptors are going to turn him loose and that's a guy you want to see how high he could go and fantasy  I think this moment might actually also be your best sell High window on quickly before people catch on that he doesn't do much beside score threes and free throw percent so if you're in a nine category league and you scooped him up super fast when the trade went down and you're looking at it like well this guy's gonna get me I don't know 18 points maybe 19  two and a half to three three pointers I like that but what am I gonna do with three and some odd rebounds and three and some out of CIS and like 0.8 Steals and no blocks is this really gonna be a guy who gets inside the top 75 I think that's debatable  feels like 75 might be kind of the Apex for quickly but I mean maybe there's a chance you could get like a round higher than that but you could probably trade him for someone in that rain right now  someone's gonna assume that he's going to go get 20 shots and that apparently Scotty Barnes and Pascal siakam are going to stop playing and maybe they're Raptors do trade see how come he's still on the Block as far as we know that would open things up even more but for the time being  you're gonna get more time you're gonna get more shots that's very much true and so perhaps the trend line isn't flat for quickly maybe it does Arc up a little bit but he doesn't have the fantasy profile  to be better than like a top 60 kind of guy without adding assists or steals or improving upon his field goal percent some might be like oh well what if he could be Tyrese Maxey maxey's at 46% from the field they're not all that far off in that department so look  first of all Maxie block shots second of all Maxie gets assists  those are pretty big two very large changes between these kinds of guys  neither one rebounds all that well so you could probably draw some parallels on the sort of scoring threes free-throw percent side and D diminish  pretty significantly the usage rate so I mean  we can't just gloss over things going from no blocks half a block of ball game is important you know that's a difference if 35 to 40 blocks of seats and that's a big deal  and going from three assists to six and a half that's a big deal  so if you can sell quickly as much as I like the simple answer is just to call him an ad here which I could have done and just moved on but as I'm saying it out loud it's like look if you can get like a 75 range guy for him I think I would probably do it  other names on the ad board Josh Hart Donte divincenzo are I mean they're kind of like above watch list right now they look pretty good for the next and the first game with Anna nobe in there even chenzo got the start he had some three-pointers Josh at his 11 rebounds Off the Bench that's what he does it feels like it's easier for heart to maintain fantasy value because the percentage the field goal percent in particular tends to be decent for him I'll get you some threes get you all those rebounds from the guard position  if I'm picking up either of them I'm probably picking up heart if you can afford to wait just a little bit longer  that might be your best move  just give it the tiniest bit see what it looks like in that next ball game and then move from there  people are gonna ask me about Jade and Ivy and why I'm not high on him at all it's because I talk nine cat and even when he's playing well is 9 cat numbers don't tend to be all that great because he's a bad foul shooter feel goal percent is a sort of a smedium negative turn over his tend to be higher all the little bit less this season of course with Kate Cunningham back on the ball dominated Duty  points and I'm gonna try to do a better job of slotting these remarks in he is an ad so I probably should have been clear on that front when I'm like oh yeah I'm not interested in Ivy I'm not interested in nine cat I don't think he can maintain nine cat functional Play points yes because the stuff he's bad at least two of them are the things that are somewhat diminished in their impact on the points League side I'm leaving Tori and prints on the ads board I know that this is sort of like he's not a particularly exciting one but he's been number 62 over the last two weeks 3.33 pointers 1.6 steals  and the Lakers after being healthy for like two games are back to not again the Angela Russell's missed a couple more strain a calf down they go down go the Lakers again  Marvel Darvin ham is screwing with rotations and players are in dog houses and Lakers can't rebound at all and Princess part of that problem he doesn't rebound  but he can shoot  and the Lakers are trying to strike a balance between  can we guard anybody and actually clean the glass and like what if we have a guy that's wide open because Anthony Davis and LeBron on our team that guy's been Taurean Prince and they just they're shoveling minutes to him because he's the only guy with an outside shot on the whole damn team right now  Simple Solution simple answer at least on that one put them on your fancy basketball team and then Trace Jackson Davis who started in the Warriors last game that was a big deal because his minutes were wildly in flux but at least if you're starting it's not that you're guaranteed 20 minutes but it's damn easy to get to 20 minutes because you start the game let's say you don't completely ruin things and like the first seven eight minutes if you can do that in the first and third quarter you're already at 16 17 minutes and then presumably the guys that come into spell you we'll get tired even if they played 13 14 minutes in a row that's still leaves three or four minutes at the end of each half so now you're basically at like 20 minutes even if you're playing poorly  and on a better night as we saw  you know mid-to-high 20s and minutes he's an easy start so make sure he's back on rosters here he was someone that I I think we call the sort of see I would go Zaid going into the Christmas they had a three game in four night deal going into Christmas and I was like let's see how this thing goes and it's we're bouncing around but they gave him a longer look and we should too  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game-winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a

holds board and there's a lot of names on the whole Sports some of them who perhaps don't need to be there  but I'm putting them there anyway because damn it I do it I want  let's see how many of these guys actually need explanations here's the hole now Aaron any Smith who's coming off a poor game but he's been starting for the Pacers so he's got to stay in there and he's the guy that they all talked about you know he's the guy who makes us want to run through a brick wall he's the guy that plays with such heart all the time he's the guy he's the glue guy he's the guy that all really all the teams in the NBA needed to do like that who's just like going Full Tilt all the time Pacers won four games in a row mostly because Tyrese Halliburton has been insane but you're holding on an E Smith  Dennis Schroder is a hold I do want to see how this thing shakes out because the Raptors effectively gave up one big rotation guy and one kind of small rotation guy for two like medium to large rotation guys in quickly  and RJ Barrett  giving up a Chua and Anna nobody who was playing a lot of minutes I don't know that Shooters role changes all that much he's sitting at number 118 on the season in nine cat mostly because his sister at 8  but he hasn't really been a positive in anything else so far this year after that very hot star when he was averaging like 17 points and nine assists he hasn't really scored since then the steals in the threes have come back down to Career marks for him and so yeah you know and of the 10th round guy now  funny thing funny thing that's over the last two weeks I should say not in the season funny thing is that over the last two weeks trayce Jackson Davis in only 23 minutes a game is actually ranked ahead of shooter if you like oh well it's because of turnovers  I mean sure there's only a 1.6 Jackson Davis is at one that's not the big ding there the big thing with Schroeder is that he's really kind of a one one and a half trick pony and  people are still coming to me like Dan you really whiffed on Schroeder it's like what  did you just stop paying attention after the first three weeks the season  he's fine he's a hold I mean we're talking about him in the context of him being a hold on this weekly show or this now by weekly type of show but he's not a game changer the way it looked like he might have been the first three weeks of the year  his teammate Gary Trent Jr I'm holding four now that one has a shorter shelf life I think I just kind of want to see if Trent has  he does he have a path to like 20-8 consistent minutes I think the answer is no  and given the fact that the sort of gambling defense the Nick nurse get all those steals defense has been to some degree replace this year on the Raptors  if you take the steals away from Gary Trent there's just not a whole lot left there  you know it's like that it's pretty but maybe Trent needs a little makeup to be pretty fantasy wise another guy that I'm holding for now is Colin Sexton I figured he would dry up when Jordan Clarkson came back and it's been mostly still good for him  but a little bit of a mixed bag he's number 107 over the last two weeks  he's another guy who appears better  because our eyes gravitate to scoring he scores well  this is a bit okay lately it just like it feels like he's on the way to trending down I think we can hang on because who knows I mean someone could easily get hurt tomorrow and Utah and he hasn't been so awful that's like a mandatory drop and frankly like most of these games have been pretty playable but last one only had 19 minutes it was a blowout in effect  8 points 3 boards six assists the issues of course sex and doesn't shoot that many threes doesn't get that many steals so he's gonna have to score hit a bunch of foul shots  and  do it extraordinarily efficiently  basically every night to cover up the shortcomings so again not an indefinite hold on sex in but certainly a short-term one let's see how this whole thing goes cuz you talk messes with their lineup every day they've been playing better lately so I guess you know whatever will hardy keep throwing your guys into a carousel see what happens but at some point someone's gonna have to win out  maybe or maybe they all lose like the Pacers had been for a couple years here  buddy hield kind of the same story he's been certainly much worse coming off the bench but overall he's been good enough coming off the bench is minutes of trended down the threes are staying up a little bit but again like not having  that secured playing time those secure shots  I do think there's a very real chance we end up punting on buddy hield and Colin sex then and Gary to all within the next week but I'm just gonna give it a little bit longer in case something jostles loose for anyone of those three guys they're kind of they're kind of all three in the same general boat for me not necessarily the same stats at but just the same approach which is like  looks like things are on the in the wrong direction here but let's make sure they get all the way there I don't want to be too rash  he said well so noting that we had a couple of pretty good ads for the week Malik Beasley who does have a similar stats set he's been hanging on hanging on it's that same thing not an indefinite hold Beasley's defensive stats have really dried up he's pretty much done nothing besides take and sort of make three pointers over the last couple of weeks  he's been like these other names I just mentioned serviceable number 84 over the last week 15 points on almost five three-pointers a game shooting 58% but he's done nothing else nothing else  he's another guy who feels like maybe by the end of the next week he'll move into my stream while warm group of players which is growing by the way the more basketball we take in the more I can sort of slack guys into that joint  Derek Lively the second needs to be rostered I know I know everybody's like are we really sure cuz like there's all these bad games mixed in with the good ones yeah he's got to be rostered because when he's getting consistent playing time  he does enough sometimes it's big game little games sometimes it's okay game okay game and that can be frustrating I get it but the blocks are there the rebounds are there the field goal percentage there and then we just got to make sure that you know they're there isn't that one game every three or he gets taken to school by a veteran of the NBA and then everything will work out okay  that's Derek Lively Malik is a hole I thought that was one that I probably needed to have on this board maybe before his last Gigantor ball game because he woke back up in a huge way pushed himself back up to number 128 on the season in nine cat I was a slow start kind of a big middle about a week-long cold spell which I do think may have had something to do with that sore foot but he looked great as last time out so this is a name that I probably could have  just you know taken a fountain pen and crossed off before going on air but whatever he was in there as I was doing my research so screw it D'Angelo Russell is hurt for the Lakers  some weird going on in La they've benched Russell they won't let Austin Reeves start their  I actually like the idea of moving really hot tomorrow into the starting lineup and then he got hurt you know seven minutes into the ball game and he'll be out for a couple of weeks probably  cam reddish is not playing every every day right now he's still banged up I like I don't really know what the hell's going on with the Lakers as a team I do know that at some point D'Angelo Russell is gonna get some more playing time because offensively he's just so much better than all these other guys and  like the fact that he's not a great defender or rebounder is just it shouldn't be that big of a deal during the regular season if you have Anthony Davis behind you and just like anybody else competent on a basketball court so hold because Something's Gonna Give  Max druce is on the holds board and I know everybody's gonna be like damn what the hell dude he's been terrible lately you're not wrong you're not wrong because over a month now streus has been shooting 32% from the field  for a month  that is an icy chill  and icy chill but you want to know what else is going on there over that same month he's playing 34 minutes a game averaging four and a half rebounds almost four assists 1.4 defensive stats and almost three three pointers  the only thing missing here is that his field goal percent is in extreme extreme punt mode  and I've made this mistake with players before I will not make it again  of giving up on somebody when there's very when there's one extremely obvious statistic that's not running right  on the season now he's dropped under 40% from the field he's at 39.4 and he's ranked number 99 and 9 cat on a per game basis while in my eyes shooting almost as poorly as it could go over the span of a full season but he still playing a ton of minutes he was among the league leaders and minutes played because he's largely been healthy so far this year last I checked at least I don't know why the free throws are only at 79 and change whatever doesn't matter he barely takes any but rebounds assists steals blocks all that stuff is better this year than anybody expected and now all we need is for that field goal percent just wiggle back up into the low to mid 40s give me 43 I don't care I don't need 46 give me 43%  but on the number of shots he's taking right now that ends up being a really really big deal  I mean 33% for a month people  that's way down  fix that points threes field goal percent all float up  pretty easy call in my eyes to hang on but you can bench him if you want to because the shooting right now is killing Roto teams  Grayson Allen remains on my whole board not just because Kevin Durant was out although that certainly doesn't hurt but just because he's been  one of the most efficient players in the entire NBA over the last month and so now is number 25 in his last 10 ball games going like full Derek white mode here 15 points almost three threes four boards two and a half assists 2.5 defensive stats okay he's not going full Derek white because he's number seven over that stretch but 53 and a half percent from the field 95 at the free throw line could he completely dry up when all three Superstars are back for Phoenix yeah  is this efficiency sustainable nah  but does sure feel like he's the fourth guy that's not Yusuf nurkic in that main group that he's kind of played his way to being the other dude  hold  and finally Jalen Suggs who's been kind of a little Hit or Miss lately that a couple of big ball games he's had a couple of bad ones free throw percentage has been a little bit low  the minutes of bounced around because of injury the number of field goal attempts to bounce around he's only a point eight steals over the last month per game  I think it's health so in my eyes that's another really good reason to just hang on because that's the type of thing that usually sorts itself out and so I'm going to go ahead and assume that it will oh hey we're you know 27 minutes in seems like a good time at any remind you guys to go and like And subscribe however you're taking in the show traditional pod channels and

I mentioned the beginning of the show that I meet a really good buddy of mine in his family in Yosemite we try to do it once a year  we are in Los Angeles there in San Francisco we visited them up north in end of August I think it was  and they talked about how like literally if you leave anything exposed in your automobile right now it's probably gonna get stolen it got me thinking  about one

subscription expressvpn.com slash hoop ball go there today  all right here's the I'm scared and nervous crew  such a silly name  I couldn't come up with something better come on Dan  so herb Jones had a slightly better ball game against the Lakers and then I was like let's dig a little bit deeper on this one he said and realized of course that dreamer he was out for that ball game because this is one that I was trying to watch on my phone while dealing with four lunatic children and Yosemite trying to watch the Laker game stay up to date  yeah I mean pretty much a one-to-one correlation at this point when Trey Murphy is around her Jones doesn't get enough to do  so maybe he slots in as an injury replacement at this point  Gordon Hayward was on this board on Friday I'm doubling down on that one he's hurting he's not good anymore magic Center is Wendell Carter Junior just slightly better ball game but I mean look we've seen enough of him to know he's not a nine cat guy if you wanted to hold on to Wendell on the points League side you could convince me to buy a little bit more time and that's fine Zach Collins hurt right now um and we talked about him a little bit on that late Thursday early Friday show just because this whole like when bananas only gonna play 24 25 minutes a ball game he's not gonna play back-to-backs  the honestly this is a lot  the Spurs always got it like reinvent the wheel with this sort of player this load management stuff this weapon Yama thing reminds me an awful lot of like a triple A reliever coming up who's never thrown more than 75 innings in a year and then they're like you know what dude you're gonna start but you're only gonna go through the lineup one time two and a half Innings and we'll play again in five days  and there isn't really that much data on what happens at the end of all of this  but damn it this person gonna do it  and while we're on the topic of Cullen's John Collins has lost his aggression I thought he would start the year with the whole lot of like oh yeah I gotta prove that I'm more than I was in Atlanta and now he's just falling back into this whole you know Utah rotating Cavalry of of players and you know he got off to a pretty good start when Walker Kessler went down and Collins was playing Center that was pretty good last month he's at 12 and 7 with 1.5 defensive stats which puts him basically right on good stream type of level  and that's okay  I do good stream level for John Collins but does that mean you need to have him on your roster all the time  watch list says a few of the same names from Friday morning show and if you new ones Julian champagne out in San Antonio starting but I don't think he's gonna get anything going there I would just soon moves on my watch list although we did get news today that Zach LaVine is progressing  what that means we'll find out soon enough  I had him as a Bilo named last week  you could probably still Buy Low on Levine's I'm guessing a lot of people didn't see that news it was slipped by  we had it on our ethos fantasy BK fee for whatever that's worth but it might have slipped by somebody because it was a Billy Donovan quote like oh yeah and he got reassigned Zach LaVine got some practice in with the windy city G league club  and if the lane really does come back and play for the Bulls again then a whole lot of stuff gets screwed which you know Kobe White's  interesting season terrible start insane like three to four week run after the awful start and then he's been pretty bad again lately that gets derailed whatever that is too soon MO is not going to be close to useful once Levine comes back I think Patrick Williams probably all so falls into that not really close  Andrew Wiggins is that a couple of okay games like two of his last three ish  I had really hatchimal on this list now he's hurt we don't have an exact time table on him but he's still watchable I think if it's like they wanted to get him into the starting lineup which like that's good is he's out there and he'll take shots he's not afraid to be aggressive  but if he's out for like two weeks and obviously you're not gonna do anything with it Alec Burks he's been scoring a lot but his minutes haven't been that high which is why I can't get him above watch list I'm in Thompson in Houston they've got a bunch of guys out he played more in the last one because it was a blowout but who knows maybe they ramp him up a little bit here with all the various injuries to keep players on the Rockets Simone fontecchio out in Utah yeah is a good one he has a bad one he has another bad one he has another bad one he has a good one he has an okay one and then a bad one and then an okay one and then maybe a good one again not enough good ones and then counting George while we're on the topic of Utah he plays he doesn't play he plays he doesn't play he's a long-term stash kind of guy which puts him on my watch list and the reason I really am not all that excited about kente George right now is that Utah has actually been winning some ball games by playing some of their more Veterinary type of guys  Jazz are 10 and 5 at home which is I mean no that's a record that is up there with like the good teams in the west they just happened to be five and fourteen on the road but they've won two in a row they won seven of their last 10 that's one of the better last 10 records in the western conference right now and certainly among teams that are  flopping around under 500 it's far and away the best mark  and they've done it without giving yante George the keys to the team and I don't think they're giving him the keys until March so can you wait two and a half more months I cannot personally and the stream while warm category plus other I have to and add another to this because you guys know you recognize Bobby Portis nazri and Cole Anthony from the stream well warm list from last week I've added Kelly Olynyk who I thought was a stream while starting but he's really more of a stream while he's sort of in coach Hardy's good graces which he is right now and then we don't know when that might disappear but he's getting enough assists and rebounds to sort of cancel out the bad shooting games or the non-shooting games you want to call them that Kevin Love is warm right now he's streamable while warm as his Deni avdija who started the year strong at about a five weeks stretch where he was terrible and he's been good again for the last like two of the last three ball games so I'm like that so that now is the stream well warm slash stream wow  I don't know like logistically positive if you're talking about a Linux guys we've added to that list and then this is the one that I was sort of deep breathing before the injury replacement board  is smaller  it's smaller today than it was on Friday mostly because Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving came back so yay let's guys are on a lot of my teams it because they are old and hyper-efficient  and it took some names off the board here but let's see who's left Andre Drummond  for vooch  Al Horford for literally any Boston starter at all because Drew holiday was out and Al Horford started for him  silly I know you know they're just there aren't handcuffs in the NBA anymore outside of like sometimes a center  but Horford is a center and he started when the point guard was out  they just moved Derek white down to point  Brown down to shooting guard him down to small forward Chris stops stated Center anyway careless alert well there is Garland is out Kobe white Wells accla is out as Patrick Williams also  song Zach Levine Brandon Miller with lamelo ball out PJ Washington with lamelo and Gordon Hayward out said he'd pay is a stream while DeAndre Hunter is out Nick Richards for Mark Williams who is now  it's like a month at this point  they won't say what the hell is going on  Grayson Allen I had him on this board with Bradley Beal out I should have changed the name Beale to Durant because he had another big ball game here with the rant album Grace Allen might just end up being like a straight hole so you know as we talked about don't punt on him should just take him off this board that would have been more clear but whatever stupid Dan Malcolm Brogdon I did manage to change the name in this one Brogdon was a start when sharp was out sharp was back Simon's is out he's got that respiratory thing  so start Brogden while Simon Says out now and then reassess when Simon comes back which could be as soon as tomorrow I believe right  Papa or is that tonight Portland play tonight  hi guys I'm Dan I'm supposed to be knowledgeable about who's playing on what night no that's tomorrow Portland Place tomorrow yeah okay got that one right good good  I met jacquez Junior when Jimmy Butler is out and Duncan Robinson when it's both Butler and Caleb Martin out and that is your injury replacement board which again not nearly as grotesque as it was even as recently as late late on Thursday night  I do want to take a couple of questions from the chat room if I can find a few I think there were a couple things in here I saw as I was skimming that hit on players that I didn't discuss and if I can figure out where those were hey I want to get this one up there this is Reese Harmon hey Dan firstly I just wanted to say that I ordered a lawn mower using your code two years ago use it almost every day and it is still going strong fully recommend to anyone out there bingo manscape.com  but Reese also has a really interesting question second is it just me or a steals really tough to get this season I feel like so many players have a lower steel rate this year while a few key players like Shea are still up what has changed so Reese you're both right and wrong  because a lot of the usual dudes are right where we expected them to be Shay obviously like you mentioned Marcus Smart more limited sample size but his steel rate is good spider melting Bible  Darren Fox Kawhi Leonard Paul George like Jalen Suggs Deonte Murray's at one point five there were a lot of names that are doing fine and even Trey young is that oh very a goofy 1.4 steals per game this year LeBron steal rate is back up  I think that you like me and like all of us at times Reese we are  kind of prisoners of a few key moments and one of them  maybe the most obvious one is Freddie Van Fleet who's I mean still having a perfectly reasonable season he's number 37 right now only at one point one steals  every time it looks like he's about to get that number up to 1.3 1.4 just sort of levels off a little bit  now he's at his ADP right now so there really aren't any complaints and he's been largely healthy so far this year so I don't think anybody's super upset about it but I think Jalen Williams would be another example he's at point nine steals per game that's not where folks wanted it ogn and Nobby is another example of a steel specialist type who's only at one point zero this year so there's kind of three  guys that were drafted heavily for their steals but then aren't getting it but at the same time a lot of other guys are  so I don't know that steals are necessarily down I think you're just seeing sort of the weirdness that can happen in an NBA season and in this case it's happening to three very steals specific players who haven't been able to get to where we expected them but others have been  it is weird though  Andre asked how was Yosemite um not that cold this year  we've had this is this is the fourth time that we've done this with with my good buddy to meet kind of in the middle there uh twice we've almost been blizzard in power outages the whole thing one time we drove from I don't know people know where Oakhurst is but it's you know it's like 30 ish minutes outside the the main gates to Yosemite National Park on on the southern side  one year we stayed there and drove in did the journey in and it was a chaotic mess  um  but at least all three of those years we we did see snow this is the first time there was literally no snow  no we had the super wet super snowy 2022-23  like  wintery campaign and it has been quite the opposite so far this year  in fact it rained pretty hard and around Los Angeles last week and they didn't get any of that in this year's so a lot of fun but didn't feel like a winter trip to Yosemite like a cold fall trip  still had a blast though  um let's see what else we got here Delonte says is manscaped order arrived today a lot of manscape stuff going on in the chat room that's awesome cool man everybody else should get that too I know today was Express VPN live read on the show but our buddies at manscaped that's promo code ethos 20 ethos 20 for 20% off and free shipping over at manscape remember the expressvpn one is expressvpn.com slash hoop ball it's not a code it's a website so URL  hello says is Marcus Smart a mustad if he was dropped yes we've had him on our ads board for a few weeks in a row going back to kind of stream time so absolutely  baby stay Flo says I got the number one seed as of right now with the seven and three record after 10 weeks of fantasy Hoops thanks Dan for sharing your knowledge your lots of help my pleasure  grabing Jalen Johnson best advice you gave me and  I'll take all the credit on that one because the B150 was like you could probably draft him and the A3 round and you'd be happy well  yeah  um let's see here would you trade a manual quickly for Bradley Beal yeah I'll go get Bradley Beal  sure  although here's the thing on that one um we kind of know what the beal cap is this year and it's 50  if Toronto shuts everybody down in March you guys gonna be pissed at me if I tell you to do this trade I'm really more thinking about and between now and silly Seasons so if your league ends before that I'd rather have Beal and then Rodeo I definitely rather for Emmanuel quickly or Kobe White  I'd rather Emmanuel quickly which I know  makes no sense at all but now we're getting all this this stuff about Zach LaVine coming back and  we've all been reminded of Kobe White's gigantic fantasy holes by the way he's back outside the top 100 on the season friends um he is not officially Steph Curry he went on a Steph Curry like run for three weeks  and folks anointed him the greatest player in the history of mankind  obviously he's a lot better with Levine out but if he comes back I mean we saw Kobe white Winslet he was healthy Kobe was outside the top one 80  there's almost no way that quickly is going to be outside the top one 80 pretty much no matter what the Raptors do the rest of this year  is Trey Murphy a hole yes he is  is Andre Drummond worth holding long-term  I mean on a long time it's worth holding I think until vouch comes back because he's grabbed and frickin 20 rebounds a game right now  are we seeing Marcus Smart just as a steals Guy yeah I mean I think so there's a few I know what you mean here old man in the sea yeah steals specialist is what it seems like I think the hope for me is that he settles into a nice role sort of complementary to jaw and Bane and JJJ  and he really could keep up a crazy steals right all year which should make him valuable enough on that front and then you just kind of hope that he can get you a little bit of other stuff along the way and that would ultimately be enough  oh okay we're caught up  there will not be time for another show today it's obviously way too late in the day game started in a half an hour  tomorrow will likely be a two-show day recap hopefully a Buy Low and then we'll kind of get a feel for what's happening in the rest of the week  we'll probably do another show just like this one on Friday with all the Recaps stuff but we'll kind of see how things shake out of any news breaks things of that nature I am of course at Dan bastards over on social media please please please please please please please please please please please like subscribe rate and review all that good stuff it's a big deal it really is a big deal  find me on social  please do continue to tell folks that maybe aren't you know play fantasy sports but aren't in your league I get it nobody wants to tell their league mates about the thing they're listening to that helps get them in Edge but we got to grow and we want to get our tentacles into more beginner leagues which I get at that tougher because beginner leagues these people probably not listening to very dry fantasy podcasts like this one but  that's the goal that's the next step so whatever you can do again thank you all for listening appreciate you giving me a few days to rest the old pipes there's still beat up because I yell at kids every day  or time  hope so  I'm Dan again we'll see you guys tomorrow everybody welcome back and happy New Year
