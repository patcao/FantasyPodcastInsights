welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right we're trying out a new format of show today ladies and gentlemen and this is going to be a quick hitter it is the playoff Head to Head schedule guide  my goal and I'm just doing this because it's the first one I'll try to make this much faster and all future episodes is to do one of these every Monday through Friday through the rest of the fantasy season to carry us through the playoffs the goal of course here all so from the show standpoint is we're going to look at two days four days six days and nine days as kind of like the key streaming windows for when you use your players and when you use your weekly moves you guys know for me as you hit the playoffs and many of you were starting them on Monday long streaming is key so guys that you can pick up for six or nine days are critical because it allows you to stream more roster slots you make a move for someone who's got a nine-day stretch where they Place six times that's a movie you don't even have to use until the end of next week right now and there is a team that that fits into that profile you use a move for six days that's a move that you don't have to worry about until towards the end of next week it's a way that you can then stream three or even four sometimes roster slots if you have like a 14 or a 15 roast depth on your head-to-head team obviously it's harder Yahoo leagues they only have 10 starters and three bench slots with some ill so you can't stream as many slots because the guys are generally too good for you to cast off into the ocean but as you get into again sort of deeper rosters deeper leaks whatever you can squeeze out more streaming positions  the reason that this is important and again I'm not going to do this Preamble at the front of every one of these episodes I'm gonna tell people to refer back to the you know the first minute of our first streaming episode is that if you take one roster slot and you pick up a back-to-back player basically every day you use a move on Monday Tuesday use a move on Wednesday Thursday you use move on Friday Saturday you was using move on Sunday in to the following Monday and so on and so forth you're basically turning one roster slot into a slot that plays every day  so the best case scenario there is you're taking a slot that may have had only three games coming into a week and turning it into a seven you're using four moves to gain four games played over that week and you can't stop doing it  in some scenario as you might even have a guy who has a four game week that you move off of so you're actually only in that scenario gaining three games with four moves in a given week that's fine but that's the bare minimum that should be the worst thing you do from a streaming standpoint with my help I hope and with using these kind of long streaming techniques if you take three roster slots and or four roster slots even and you take them and you're turning a three-game someone who plays or a team that plays two or three times over six days into someone that plays four times over six days you're gaining a game maybe two in a great scenario and you can use that other move on another  slot on your roster if that makes sense it might not let me try to clear that up just a little bit before we get into the actual analysis today  if you're able to do that with three or four different rosters slots basically what you're doing is now you're gaining more than one move it might not be too too would be perfect that's like the optimum you use a movie you gain two games played over the link of the long stream  but it's going to be better than one by and large one is the worst two is well maybe you might have like a three every once in a blue moon but one is the worst two is the best and hopefully you average those out and you're gaining you know if you're streaming three or four different roster slots instead of getting three or four games with those four moves you're getting somewhere between five and eight so it's a way to get two to four additional games played out of your playoff roster  all right let's get into what's actually going on today and this is the way that most of these shows are going to be formatted going forward what you see on your screen is our schedule streaming charts available to NBA fantasy pass subscribers they can see the entire calendar for these shows I'm just gonna show basically like a two week span it's a little bit more than that on today's you know what I can even zoom in just a tiny bit closer so that you guys can see it more clearly on the video feed but don't worry for those that are watching or for listening after the fact I'm going to explain everything as well  today is March 1st it's Friday what we're going to be looking at basically is today through the end of next week which is when Playoffs begin and this is what you're looking at  today if you were just going back to back there are two teams that  fit that bill whatever that  we're ready to say it but you guys get to the meaning the Memphis Grizzlies and the Portland Trail Blazers Memphis is a hard one because you don't really know what players are actually going to play in the back-to-back one could probably assume that Santi aldama will Vince Williams likely will Zaire Williams probably will we don't know about Jordan Goodwin we already know Jaron Jackson Jr is not going to be playing in those back to backs Luke Kennard pretty much never John conchar pretty much never so it gets paired down a little bit there over on the Portland side we don't know what the deal is with DeAndre Aiden but do a brief will probably play in the back-to-back maybe he gets a couple of starts to money Kumari is what intriguing we haven't heard about anybody else coming back  for the Blazers so I would assume then that  and I'm not a huge fan of it  do I want to go even farther yeah I don't think that I go any farther than that poor Lynn like  probably should have decided this before going on are  well I didn't so now you can stick it up your nose Jabari Walker was the name that I was sort of kicking back and forth my head he's a no but he thought I will probably plays in the back-to-back you might get for Steals and two blocks out of him so that's intriguing as well if you want to go beyond the back to back so that's the two-day Outlook the four day outlook still the Grizzlies and the Blazers who we already talked about but the Clippers and the wolves get in the mix as you go to now the four days so these are teams that play three times in four days that's the second thing you're looking for it sort of the second highest percentage of games you're going to get that happens pretty regularly in the NBA  for the Clippers we don't know if Paul George is going to be back whether or not he's back Terrence Mann actually does make sense as a three games in four nights kind of stream a mere coffee would make sense if we knew that Paul George was going to be out which we don't normally if he's not on a roster he's probably a streamable guy with the advantageous schedule and then you get into sort of the afterthoughts which would be coffee if he's not starting Russell Westbrook Mason Plumlee would creep into that kind of afterthought not really as far as I'd like to go but if you had to you could and then for Minnesota I think was the other one that I said right just to make sure I get that yeah Minnesota's the other one players on the wolves that you could consider using in a three and four scenario again we don't know if Kyle Anderson is going to be playing so he'd be a little bit dangerous to go there nazre should have been added anyway but Jaden McDaniels moves into playable because of schedule Alexander Walker probably is playable due to schedule you can even go as far down the board as Monte Morris but that's super iffy because his Fantasy game is not all that great you just be kind of hoping for like 55 to 60 minutes out of him which is like two starters level games for someone else and that's why it's so important to get these three games in four nights as well  if you want to go real far down the rabbit hole the teams and you know like this is this is not going to cover everybody because I don't know that we need to go quite that far the reason three and four is actually really notable on a Friday show is that that takes you into Monday of next week  Monday of next week is a relatively low traffic day it allows you to hold your roster moves next week until I at least Tuesday possibly farther so the next thing you'd look at would be does anybody go four times in six days that we have already talked about and the answer is yes the Cavaliers fall into that department so if you're looking and they're not they're not super outstanding  for the end of this week they've got two games the end of this week and mostly his teams have been talking about have two games ahead of this week the Cavaliers don't play Monday of next week so if you're gonna go that route you definitely then want to hold all the way through Wednesday Cavs also don't have that many Fringe players that are streamable on the schedule style most of the guys on the calves are rostered already and The Fringe guys are probably over roster because of things like points leak so like Caris LeVert who should be on the wire in nine cat often isn't you might be able to use someone like an Isaac Coral that would kind of be the only player on the Cavs that's not heavily rostered that you could maybe consider using for the four games in six days stretch they've got starting this evening  the teams again we've already talked about our good on that front Clippers are one of them that has four and six I don't  make sure that I'm getting all of these right just so you guys can kind of follow along with me Memphis who we already talked about as four games in six days  to Philly actually is another one that that starts slowly here but then it finishes strong because they've got their back-to-back on Tuesday Wednesday of next week Philly does have a couple of sort of Fringe streamable guys I think the last time they played was Tuesday if I'm remembering rights we can go back and make sure that we're picking out the numbers right didn't they get spanked in that ball game  trying to remember what Philadelphia's last ball game was figure this damn thing out Philly you've got  not a ton  in the way of Fringe level players there another team where it's kind of like it sort of feels like they basically have their in and they're out guys Kyle Lowry maybe sits on the borderline I don't think Nick button does enough there but like uber read  Harris Melton not melting sorry Melton's heard again Uber read Harris healed Maxi are all started right now so would you take four games of MOBA over six days ah you're talking about like two starter level games from a guy and that's final over four days but over six  yeah I don't think that there's really anybody you can pull off the scrappy to play for Philly we already talked about Portland they are all in the four games in six department and that is it however as a Dan best for special the one team my favorite team of this whole stretch starting today is the Portland Trailblazers and we've already talked about their Fringe streamable guys the reason the Blazers are my favorite team over this stretch is they go six times over nine days  that is the ultimate in Long stream they also have a pretty advantageous schedule over that stretch Minnesota really the only good defensive team they're playing in those six games the other ones are two against the fellow tanking Grizzlies the Thunder who played pretty high Octane Game defensively they're a little better the Rockets and the Raptors it's a lot of high scoring games on the docket here  so if you're looking at a fringe Portland player you could go Matisse Bible and getting six Bible games out of nine days I mean six Bible games you're probably talking about 10 Steals and four blocks  that's huge in head-to-head and you don't have to make another move there until next Sunday  the other thing to keep in mind is your work your way through the weekend is the Brooklyn Nets how do you square this one up is the question because if you're making a move today to try to shore up your roster Brooklyn actually doesn't make much sense they've already played three of their four games this week the time to stream Brooklyn started all the way back on Monday which by the way we did talk about on Monday show we did show on Monday talking about the weekly preview and how grabbing a Brooklyn Net for the next 14 days was actually a really good decision but how do you pick the next point to get back in on them the only way it really makes sense to go Brooklyn is if you have someone playing today that then plays one more time over the weekend or not at all and you could pivot to Brooklyn tomorrow because they go Saturday but not Sunday and then they go five times next week  truthfully the time to pick up a net would be 1201 a.m. on Monday morning but you'll be fighting with everybody else for those guys and frankly a lot of those guys are probably gonna get picked up this week because they had a four game or going into the five gamer  also if you happen to have a player that sort of fringy on the Bulls they don't play over the weekend the Bucks don't play over the weekend the Pelicans don't play over the weekend the Kings and the Wizards don't play over the weekend either so if you have Fringe level players on those teams you could potentially pivot to Brooklyn tomorrow at one game this week and at a bunch next week  of course the downside to that is there is a team in Phoenix that plays it back to back this weekend so if you have a player that plays today that doesn't go Saturday Sunday you could actually make a back-to-back pickup that gives you  two extra games this week which frankly you might need if you're battling for a playoff spot or if you're jockeying for position whatever it might be like you might need to use that move sooner for the Suns Royce O'Neill is the obvious choice of Eric Gordon comes back he would probably squeeze himself in there it sounds like Bradley Beal is probable for the Phoenix Suns game tomorrow Bowl has been getting like 20 minutes so even he might make sense in a back-to-back Sons do go three times in four days and four times in six days starting tomorrow so if you picked up a son you could potentially hold them through Thursday of next week but again that's a front loaded four games in six days so you don't have to you could get through the back-to-back and then you could pivot and go another Direction and that's basically the way that I want to run these shows that was 15 minutes flat today and that's because I had a four minute Prelude most days we're going to spend about 10 minutes talking through how to balance your schedule how you can potentially stream a bunch of slots at the same time but again today the big takeaways Portland six games over nine days Brooklyn a five-game week next week and then we had all those names that we talked about earlier in the show of guys that either go back to back three and four or four in six if you liked this quick hit or format please let me know over on social I'm at Dan best person on Twitter follow over there like rate subscribe and again I'm going to try to get one of these out 10 to 15 minutes per day Monday through Friday through our fantasy playoffs we're gonna longstream our way to Victory together have a delightful Friday everybody I don't know about a weekend episode I'll do my best but if not I'll see you guys Monday for real this time to do
