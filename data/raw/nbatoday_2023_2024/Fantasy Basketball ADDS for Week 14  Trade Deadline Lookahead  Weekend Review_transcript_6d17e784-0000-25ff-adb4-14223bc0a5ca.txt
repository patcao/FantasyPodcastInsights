welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I got a new week going don't we  close that something  we are  half past the halfway point I think that happened Saturday see the Friday or Saturday the NBA season is officially more than halfway done  the downhill here will also have a All-Star break mixed in there and I always feels kind of like  well because the fantasy season if you're in a head-to-head league and ends some number of weeks early  and then you've got the playoffs you're actually well beyond the halfway point in head-to-head Roto this is where  this is in my opinion this is like the moment in the season where a head-to-head and wrote a really take off in different directions because if you're in a rodeo League you could still make some very large changes but you just don't see them as quickly from a strategic standpoint it's a really interesting phenomenon because you know rodo side you can like try to shore up rebounds hypothetically and you might not actually see the gains in them for weeks  and then perhaps it starts to roll up a little bit where with Head to Head  if you're making a move right now you're likely making the move  with a playoff  stretch in mind you're showing up something you're already really good in you're going for five or six very very strong categories  and  nothing else matters so you're going in the two different formats you're going in totally different directions right now  head-to-head you're Shoring up what you're already good at Roto you're probably I mean maybe if you're like you know second from the bottom and something you might just give up on it but if you got two or three things that are mid-pack you want to lean into those  lean into something where you're like bottom third the areas where you can gain two three four rotop points are often the exact opposite in the areas and head to head where you're looking to try to make that big pivot  but it doesn't mean you should stop acting no matter what format you're in head-to-head or Roto you should be trying to improve your team I had to trade this morning proposed to me in a Yahoo public league  I say this with uh  total honesty because I simply don't have the time to go out there and propose trades anymore I like if somebody proposes one to me I might do a counter because then I at least I know who they're trying to move but like I don't have time in my personal life I got too much going on with the kids and weekends are and complete cluster mess from me to go in and just like look through teams for players that doesn't work you know the guys that I bring up to you on our Buy Low shows I might go type in that player's name and see you who has them in a league and I might be able to make some kind of offer for that but that's like that's basically the amount of time I have  which again raise the question of why the hell I'm in as many League's as I'm in if I don't have time to maintain a lot of them well it's fun you know it's sort of a volume game for me at this point I'm good enough in most of these leaks without having to give you know every ounce of my energy to them that ends up being sort of a positive Financial Roi but then someone proposed to me a trade this morning which was effectively I'm going to take the filler names out because they're sort of pointless and they're gonna get dropped anyway Joel embiid coming to my team somebody proposed a trade to me where I get the number two player in all of fantasy sports Joel embiid  and Zach LaVine for Freddie Van Vleet  Darius Garland who like Levine is out right now and Michael Porter Jr which  I was blown away  and I get it look Freddy I love it I have been a ton of League he's he's beating his 80P  considerably now after being behind it early in the year remember when he was number 50 and I was like this is an easy Buy Low he still doesn't even have the Steels he had before and Freddie's already moved up to number 206  but 26 is not number two  right now if you go to basketball monster and and you know we're gonna Fuzzy Math this a little bit because we don't have time to get into like how statistics and probability work but right now Joel embiid in one roster slot is worth almost four times as much as Fred Van Fleet that's the gap between number two and number 26 what Joel does in one roster slot is so unbelievably over the top important that there's almost no combination of players from outside the first round that are not enough to go get him  because he's literally a negative  intern overseers  and a very small one in three pointers  that's it  this also happens to be one of the head-to-head like leaks I'm in so someone's probably somewhat concerned about MBS knee I get it like I am too but this is still Joel bead we're talking about here  and if memory serves Philly doesn't have a weird playoff schedule I don't have that in front of me right now but I'm pretty sure it's all threes and fours there isn't a two in there so it's not like I'm taking on a guy who has a bad playoff schedule and Zach LaVine he's a right now but so is Garland  and I was just like I was taking a back by it and this is a team that's been trying to trade me Joel embiid in other scenarios but I just I couldn't pull the trigger on them because of other pieces that were involved in just like how many bodies I was going to get in this thing but what a way to start the week huh what a wild way to open up your your email and your legs and start the week anyway hello everyone welcome to Fantasy NBA today a new week begins we got a whole weekend to go over I got some ads I got some drops we got some stuff we gotta dig through here it's reverse chronological lightning round time I am Dan Bes at Dan Bass Pros on social media if some of you are watching we're all over the place right now we're going Live on YouTube and on Twitter where obviously after the fact on all traditional podcast networks and channels  through the belief Sports Network now  however you're taking in the show please find me on social at Dan best person if you're watching on social it's very easy to just go click the follow button right now

then in the show description and also in the live chat room which I think only YouTubers can see I am making sure that you guys can see the link to our trade deadline live coverage show it is up to 300 and 19 likes right now and we're still two and a half weeks away I am stoked because our goal was to get to 500 and it feels more and more like we're going to be able to do that I think going back the most we've ever gotten on one of those shows is like 700 and something but a lot of that allow it happens during the actual show but I beg of you all please however you're taking in this show live after the fact  please take a second to go to that link in the show description for our trade deadline live coverage page and click the thumbs up button on YouTube it's such an important deal for us it's such a fun day where I'm going to be on air for four and a half consecutive hours just talking basketball actually that's five and a half hours no yes no  whoa it is five and a half hours whoops oh my God  I might need to take a minute break in the middle but please go hit up three thumbs up on that  because what happens then is when we hit the start button on that show and it already has 500 however many likes we get to  it just hits the ground running in a way that show with zero likes and a handful of people watching really gets it but because so many of you are going to be liking it and hopefully subscribing to the YouTube page boom we come out of the gates all these likes people just watching it the show can take off it's sort of like the day where I want to make the biggest footprint possible and that's how we're gonna do it  I don't know why I talked about trading my legs some of you guys say you like to see these things so anyway we did that here is the weekend in review we'll start from the top of work our way backwards so we get through every team that played either Friday Saturday or Sunday ah this is the the full reset I think the Warriors are actually the only team that didn't so believe it's gonna be 2019 teams today Brooklyn look I mean this is crazy man they LED this game by 18 points and down the stretch the Clippers at 1.1 on a 22 to nothing run starting from about the five minute Mark in the fourth quarter it looked like Brooklyn was gonna sweep the L A teams that would have been really something  anyway the good news here is that mikal Bridges is at a couple good ball games in a row hopefully this meltdown late doesn't disrupt what was a nice little two or three game stretch for him that's pushed him back from around the edge of the top 100 and a number 80 in nine cat  still a long way to go but it's a start  Spencer Dinwiddie has bounced back a little bit I remain extremely skeptical of his continued fantasy relevance Nick blackson's been fine  cam Thomas went huge against the Lakers he went okay medium against the Clippers if he goes on a little heater that's the only place you actually utilize him  and then cam Johnson I kind of saved him for last on this discussion because I am beginning to get a little worried I like that he got 29 minutes here he outplayed the folks behind him which in this one was like basically so Neil uh but as this team's been getting healthy you've seen less and less cam Johnson I did not think he was going to be the guy to get iced out a little bit and yet  here we are  11 shots is not going to be enough for him long term and it's been worse than that on a number of occasions now this particular ball game is line was actually not awful 9.6 assists a couple threes in a steel  that would have been fine if he hits you know five out of 11 shots instead of three then you're talking about 12 or 14 points something like that and maybe an extra three pointer that would be the kind of line you're looking for so overall this type of production  is okay and kind of like a low level Target for him  but we've seen the minutes lower than that and that's been worrying because he just doesn't look hyper engaged right now  I'm not dropping him if somebody drops him you pick him up because he still better than most of these other options but things continued to be a little bit goofy in Brooklyn  and we'll see if if or when Ben Simmons my deck actually resurfaced and look you guys know I'm on the record saying I don't think Ben Simmons plays more than five more games this season so I'm not expecting it to change anything but you know you never know and his return could actually help some of these other guys the Russell Westbrook had a big game for the clippers but I don't care  people ask me who I would prefer between Xavier Tillman and Mason Plumlee and I said I had a slight lean to Tillman and everybody yelled at me  that's the life of the analyst  um now plumblee actually hit five out of six free throws in this game but one of the other concerns of course was could the Clippers run small and against certain teams they can this is one of those scenarios you also saw Daniel theis gets 17 minutes  of a little bit like you know more floor Spacey I guess on offense  and that's the fear here plumblee is not guaranteed 30 minutes of ball game I know he had that one good ball game  no this is why I didn't race out and pick him up in a lot of spots  some of the magic has kind of probably not the right term to use since the Heat played the magic but some of the heat sorcery has evaporated they're still 2419 but they've lost three games in a row  and shots are just not dropping right now for the heat there's they shot 37 and a half percent in this ball game now I made those a good defensive team but  as the heat in kind of a weird twist have gotten healthier you've seen some of that like everybody else was playing over their head that shine has come off and now they really need the Stars to go big the Stars don't go big which they didn't in this ball game then they're gonna lose as far as the heat go like listen I don't know what himeya keza's job is gonna be when he comes back the fact that they're losing without him suggests he probably will get some decent minutes here  I just I don't know how there's enough left for him to do with hero Butler and Bam all healthy and playing he would probably start to replace either probably replacing to call the yovich in this starting five right now I think Caleb Martin can likely continue to hold his spot  that's not to say that you should drop by me a kiss if you can stash him in a injured slot you might as well just to see what happens when he comes back but if you can't I think that probably gives you an opportunity to drop because I don't know that it's a guaranteed productive run when he comes back  meanwhile all over on the other side no Go-Go batad say in kind of a weird twist for the magic he sat this one out what no Carter Jr played 34 minutes he's been rolling lately we know the magic are trying to move one of their centers because they're just a log Jam there with mobile Wagner all so now he finally got to play in a ball game Franz Wagner came back  and now you've got magic on a back-to-back so you'll like really have Mark Health faults and and or Jonathan Isaac sitting out of ball game who knows what no Carter Jr friends Wagner these guys are just came back those guys put potentially sit when out let's basically ignore possible rest stuff when we break down the magic and say number one markelle fultz should be rostered now he was someone I think we call the stash about 10 days ago or so when he was sort of working back into shape I continue to believe that false does not get inside the top 90  I also think there's a very real chance he doesn't get inside the top 110  could he sort of Teeter on the edge of 120 130 range which is like barely startable in most formats yeah he could get there with real with field goal percent and some points in assistance steals I just I don't you know like I feel like one of the usage guides and he needs to be out for him to have enough to do now his line in this one was good because he had two Steals and two blocks and he shots six out of eight which you know I feel good is going to be decent because he doesn't shoot the three ball but he's not he's the point guard but he's not like the primary initiator on every set they've got France they got Paulo to do that sort of stuff but I do think he needs to be on rosters Jalen Suggs is doing right now just barely enough to stay on my roster and every day I look at it I'm like I'm gonna give you like two more games and if you're okay I'll probably give you another two games  but we haven't had the sort of explosion that I need a four Steel game or something like that out of Suggs  so yes to false being on your roster yes to Suggs being on your roster know to Cole Anthony you guys know my stance on him is only play him when he's Lava Hot which he's very much not right now  and then Wendell Carter Junior is an interesting one because he's actually been playing pretty well the last two or three ball games but we also know that he doesn't get defensive stats he's almost exclusively points and rebounds and if those things dry up for even a game or two his value nose Dives  so I'm not into the window Carter Jr thing I think  in a in a very good scenario if he's playing you know 3233 minutes a night as the starter he could get you like you know 0.6 deals and 0.6 blocks and good field goal percent and then maybe in that scenario you could get 1415 points and eight rebounds at him and that would put him like in that one 10 range 100 to 120 and that's startable I don't know that he gets there consistently  you could almost think about Wendell Carter Junior as a little bit of a trade deadline not stash necessarily but consideration guy because if he gets moved or if GoGo or Wagner gets moved it gives him a better path towards 30 minutes which he very much needs to get near fantasy value frankly I think he needs more than that but 30 at least would put him close  because right now he's kind of like in that one 80 to 200 range in 25 minutes a game so that's just I mean that's not good enough  Denver beat Washington in a very weird game Wizard scored 104 points and they split it up and just the worst way possible if you were hoping to get fantasy value out of your guys tyus Jones at least was good again Daniel Gafford is back so Marvin Bagley who did have 14 and 7 Off the Bench but 18 minutes is not going to be enough for him to get it done so you can part ways with Bagley unless you think Gafford gets traded which is very much a possibility so Marvin Bagley who you know I not particularly excited about but if you want to put him on the stash watch for the trade deadline okay we now know that he's very much the sort of first in line for the center minutes and they're not much in the way of competition there when Gafford is out  and a lot of teams could use a guy like Daniel Gafford I talked over the weekend about the Mavs maybe trying to trade for a Clint capela Gafford would be another option as a team that badly needs a center who is not a rookie  tyus Jones another name that could be on the move which and I talked over the weekend on our trade deadline show about bilali being a possible stash as well  good defensive stats again like here's 31 minutes for him and he got fantasy value in them but we just need these other guys that shoot the ball to not be there  we need kuzma to be gone we need pool to be gone we need Jones to be gone we need something to get out of the way so put cool ability and Marvin Bagley on your trade deadline stash watch list and maybe I'll do another show at some point with more stashing names in addition to the ones we talked about but a little bit was on that show  or his name was the person I did not have the law on the program  Boston rested a couple of folks know Drew holiday know Al Horford so Al who would normally be the first man into the starting lineup when a starter sits was not it was Sam Houser instead and you cannot even beg me enough to care about the fact that Luke kornet had 23 decent minutes off the bench or Sam Hauser played 31 decent minutes as a starter because in all likelihood you'll get Horford and Drew back and then porzingis will probably rest some game coming up here who by the way KP what a freaking huge ball game he put together  Perseus is number 21 by the way this year in nine cat  it's damn impressive anyway that means that I'll Horford is probably gonna have a decent game because he'll be back and he'll start for porzingis  Houston arrested Freddie Van Fleet Jabari Smith Jr also had the day off so Dillon Brooks took it upon himself to take 23 shots  would you believe  in the expression of the late great Vince Gully would you believe Dillon Brooks do I need five points on 23 shotts yo  that's not the story though I mean it is something to think about like if they rest a couple of starters still in Brooks would be kind of a one-day stream and then you just pray flip a penny into a fountain pray that he shoots better than 35% which he did not  Shane goon triple double with a couple guys out he's been playing well anyway since it's coach called him out but I think the names you guys were hoping that I'll talk about and I will now are I'm in Thompson who Double-Double in a spot start here and cam Whitmore who did not Double-Double had a quiet game in a spot start as well those two guys go back to the bench when Jabari Smith Jr and Freddie Van Vliet are playing  but something to think about again  and I don't think this is gonna come up regularly because the Rockets are not in the playoffs right now  there are game back of the Jazz and Lakers for that last play in spot so they don't really have a lot of opportunities to sit guys but they want an overtime game I think was it the night before it was the night before at home against the Jazz  and so they just  that was kind of like look we got one out of these two against the Jazz and the Celtics let's the hell with it and they're off until Wednesday now so very light week I think there's a two game week for Houston so they figured all right we'll give Freddy the day off I need to play between Saturday and Wednesday  I don't think that they do this  it's possible they don't do this ever again this year this might have been the only time that they gave those guys just scheduled day so do we need to worry about it probably not by the way folks are asking in the chat room trade deadline is February the 8th  it's two and a half weeks  two and a half weeks coming up quick and again a mid-show reminder that if you didn't do it before here's the link on screen or again if those are listening without a video element here it's in the show description that's the link to our trade deadline live coverage page so please navigate over there throw a thumbs up on it before the fact we are as of this moment at 300 and 19 and not any of you not one of you watching live has hit the Thumbs Up Button after I asked you at the beginning of the show but perhaps someone will do it now  question mark  go there please hit a thumbs up we want to get to 500 before before we get there  and I think we can do it I think we can do it  Phoenix speed Indiana 117110 buddy hield as a starter is very much a goal  things are gonna be okay Halliburton got this game off he'll be fine I was very surprised the TJ McConnell didn't have a better ball game Indy went to super weird looks Myles Turner got just obliterated and a number of spiders starters did so Indy ran heavy bench lineups a plus buddy hield and Pascal siakam for stretches this is like the Rick Carlisle mix and match day and this happens every once in a while don't worry about it everything's gonna be fine  in these basically in a posture right now where you start their starters not I mean I even in this game I probably would have no no way to know this was how it was gonna turn out and don't worry about the rest of these dudes  same story for Phoenix actually start the starters Kevin Durant 40 points on a ridiculous ridiculous game 72% shooting from the field and I had three blocks  and those guys have been on fire lately Cadiz back up to number nine on a per game basis Devin Booker's back up to number 20 after his 50 Burger over the weekend  Grayson Allen continues to roll Bradley Beals having good ballgames they shot 50% that'll get it done  and then the Lakers blew out the Blazers because well the Blazers are really really bad  like real real bad  Malcolm Brogden has been real good though he's got some trade value through the roof  he is a opposite trade deadline situation he's a trade deadline sell High because someone's going to trade for Brockton that's gonna use him as their you know six or seventh man that badly needs some secondary scoring sock I mentioned the rockets on a show last week that really needs someone else that can score he'd be a great fit for them other teams are going to kick the tires on broadband but I don't know if everybody like it feels like Houston of the teams that are fighting for something right now and don't have the pieces they need feels like that's the team that badly needs him the heat would also be near the top of the board for me as a team that needs a consistent offensive contributor  no that there's too many other clubs that jump out as super obvious I mean the Thunder they're so good right now but it does kind of feel like they could use someone else to shoulder the load a little but that's more of like a take the pressure off of Shea and Jalen Williams and Getty kind of thing the Rockets really just need  they need a bench of any kind  who else  um I mean the king's actually I know they've got a lot of scoring sock but you know be nice to be able to give Darren Fox a little bit of a breather but they got Malik monk who's kind of in that role already  yeah I mean those are probably the top two who DeAndre ayton got pushed around by Anthony Davis he'll be fine fine being sort of the operative word here Aiden's just not gonna have a great season  he was always a little bit overdrafted although I'm  generally as rebounding it's gonna be better than this and I don't think he's gonna always lose time to do a brief this game was Out Of Reach and that's gonna be a problem for this team because there's gonna be a lot of blowouts  because they're awful but if you're wondering does anybody like get a big bump if Malcolm Brogden gets traded know the answer is not really because Brogden basically has been the Sixth Man for this team who slots in as a starter when one of Jeremy Grant Anthony Simon's shade and sharp is out  right now sharp is out if he comes back Brogden gets pushed to sort of a marginal role anyway so this is very much a cell for him and then in terms of what are you looking out with Portland like is there anybody on this team that could see a big jump forward  I know teams won Jeremy Grant it just kind of feels like his contract is a little bit prohibitive but maybe they move him I know they're looking for a lot back let's say that someone on this team does get moved the guy I'd be looking at is probably Jabari Walker because he has a translatable fantasy game in a way that some of these other dudes don't because I don't need him get moved I don't to me he feels almost too difficult to move and he's not at he's not a Difference Maker for a team  Matisse diebold could get moved but that doesn't really change fantasy value in Portland at all I'm not all that interested in timani Kamara unless a few guys get out of the way so when you look at them you're like okay Jabari Walker he could score a little he can rebound a little he'd do it on okay percentages give you a three maybe a steal or a block that's the guy where you're like oh  if somebody gets out of the way he could actually have sustainable fantasy value but I don't know that the ceilings high enough where I am feeling like I need to badly go out and  stash him  for the Lakers really nice to Stats at a Christian Wood in this game by the way I know is a blow out he didn't get the last four or five minutes as he normally would this was such a wide blowout that Colin Castleton and Jalen hood schifino and Maxwell Lewis these guys those guys got to play down the stretch so you know Christian Woods been fine as sort of like a schedule level play and Camera reddish was back here and he had some Steals and Jarred Vanderbilt had some steals but the Lakers right now at least and they you know maybe they probably be active here at the trade deadline please go get Alex Caruso Lakers please Lord don't blow everything up for dejounte Murray please go get Alex Caruso and then you never have to think about who that fifth starter is ever again  Dorian Prince was out really hachimura played got the start in his Stead  um  and that doesn't matter but if you I mean you throw up Alex Caruso and that spot this team sealing leaps  because right now they have  they four guys in the starting lineup who can't keep their defender or keep the offensive player in front of them  Reeves  D-Lo  LeBron and like I'll give like a 70% tutorial and prince who slightly better than the other guys but not by enough and then came reddish was the guy that they were like oh maybe you can keep a dude in front of you but he was so awful offensively and literally just like dropping passes in transition that that didn't work  having even one guy in that group that can keep a player nearby and create stuff defensively please go do it like Lakers it's all I want for Christmas this year let's go back to

click follow  let's zoom in a tiny bit here let's talk a little bit about Saturday Milwaukee beat Detroit Dame giant ball game that rocketed him back up the board he's now up to number 14 and 9 cat y'all may remember when we had him as a Bi-Lo and he was down at about number 24 this is as far as I think we can expect him to go but there's actually more room if things break the right way cuz he's still only at 43% shooting if that gets up to 44 405 he likely does then climb ahead of wimby who's in front of him there's a pretty good gap between 13 and 12 right now in terms of just general value so I don't know if Dame can get into the first round but he's kind of where we need him at this point  no other real notes on the Bucks Detroit we got a few notes Alec Burks continues to be an amazing fill-in I know he's coming off the bench but he's effectively right now A fill-in for Cade Cunningham  Jaden Ivy who's been  the this continuing Battle of is he good enough  in nine cat  versus  uh points league and for the last week he's been good enough in nine cat  he's been much better if you're punching free throws because that's been his big downfall lately but like if you look at two weeks three weeks he's outside the top 125 in those ranges so again like he is the poster child for a punt build or a points League guy but I think you're basically playing him with Kate out even though I think Kate's expected back later this week so just keep that kind of in the back of your mind no Isaiah Stewart for this game which I don't care about I don't want Isaiah Stewart I know my fantasy teams but it did open up some minutes for Oscar Thompson who had 22 and 9 he's one of my guys that I'd be targeting for a late season Mega Run when that starts remains a bit  nebulous I don't know if it'll be trade deadline or sometime in March but at some point in their these very very bad Pistons will have their very very bad season finally winding down and there will really be no reason not to have Thompson playing some decent minutes so if you can pick them up off the wire you're not too far I think out from a stash possibility here if you want to trade forum for somebody cheap this would be the wrong day to do it after a good ball game but assume that his games get quiet again before they get big and see what you maybe a movie you could make their  so that's another trade deadline no  San Antonio Jeremy so on is on a vicious shooting tear right now but I mean  50% from the field is vicious for him and 92% at the free throw line he's been cooking he's also at 3.3 combined defensive stats this is like the definition of a serious heater  yeah I mean look one thing that I've learned over the years is that it's actually okay to just play a guy with a lot of value that's fine who's hot  I should say play a guy who's hot  a couple years ago I might come on this show and just say no I'm just gonna ignore it altogether but that's that's too long sided you need to be a little bit shortsighted sometimes in fantasy because if you can get a guy who is super hot for a game two games three games whatever that can be useful but that's basically what we need to be remembering is happening here having trade Jones as the point guard has been very helpful for all of these guys but this is a game against the very very bad Wizards defense so everybody put up numbers including Sohan who's been hot  he's gonna cool off at just the way the universe works he's not gonna be 5092 the rest of the year he's not gonna get three and a half defensive stats the rest of the year but if you want to play him while he's hot or sell them for a top 100 guy if someone will buy then hell yeah or maybe you throw him into a deal that sort of like a throw in and people like oh cool he's hot right now maybe this is something  that's the best way I think to utilize him with the again the understanding of what is likely to come  no other real notes on this ball game Zach Collins by the way he did come back late last week he'll be your when Yamaha fill in for when Victor sits which will probably happen at some point we already talked wizard so we can skim past them to Philly Charlotte this was a game where it looked like everybody took a Valium Prince Valium before the ball game the only thing I think we learned from the Philly side is that Kelly oubre Jr Is Not Gonna Get Enough usage to put up numbers even as a starter as long as embed and Tyrese Maxey are in there those guys are in there it will raise a know frankly even if like a Tobias Harris one of those three guys if one of those three guys sits there's probably enough usage for ubering to get 10 11 12 shots of seven or eight but while all three of those dudes are healthy  no  no lamelo ball so Charlotte promptly put up 89 points in this one PJ Washington fouled out in 26 minutes that's the Joel and beat effect but as long as Nick Richards  and Mark Williams or out I think you can start PJ Cody Martin had five defensive stats but generally isn't doing enough  just from like handling or touching the basket ball to be a roto start so here in this iteration I think you can go Rozier Miller right now with lamelo out Bridges and PJ  when lamelo comes back I probably don't play Brandon Miller I probably play The Other Guys and then if anybody else ever shows up for Charlotte we can reassess at that point but it sounds like Mark Williams isn't getting any closer I think we probably seen Nick Richards in the next couple of ball games so that would Ace out PJ Washington so just you know stay locked in on the the news basically to find out who's in and who's out for Charlotte and we'll make our calls from there  Cleveland has been annihilating people they've won seven games in a row they had a pretty easy schedule  so not to take anything away from them but they got the bucks without Giannis they've got this Hawks team that's mostly in a free fall they beat the Bulls Nets Spurs Wizards a couple of times prior to that so it's not like the most overwhelming seven game win streak of all time but Jared Allen has been a first rounder for the last five weeks  Max Drew's left this game with a hip injury he came back and actually put up kind of decent numbers finally shot 50% have been forbid but he only got 20 minutes that is not because they're phasing him out it's because he was hurt for part of the game and then it was a blowout late so they didn't need to overuse him right now you're playing Donovan Mitchell you're playing Jared Allen I have benched through my Rodeo League's head to head and you just throw them out there and hope that the slump ends at some point soon uh George and Yang's been on a little bit of a heater I don't think I'm gonna do anything with that same story with Dean Wade who got hot Sam Merrill was hot Cavs needed more shooting around their guys and they they got it man those three dudes Wade and yang and Merrill ended up with 14 of the teams at 16 three-pointers  yeah  Trey young took a headshot in this game he's in concussion protocol we'll see if he's good for their next one if not you'll just get more dejounte Murray more Bogdan bogdanovich so on and so forth no real changes on the Hawks I did mention over the weekend  that on Yoko Kung Wu is someone that I am looking at as a possible trade deadline winner so do what you will with that information  Gary Trent is another possible trade deadline winner I don't know if there's gonna be quite enough shots for him even if Bruce Brown gets shuttle along to a new team  Bruce Brown is talking like he expects to be traded  all of his quotes are like I have a signed any loose leases yet and I think someone was like Hey do you think Tom you'd love playing for Tom and he's like I'll do anything that Tibbs asked like dude you ain't on that team he doesn't think he's gonna be in Toronto which makes me think he won't be in Toronto the player doesn't think they're gonna be there why should I think they're gonna be there meaning you probably do get pretty consistent 30 minutes for Gary Trent Jr but even beyond the minutes can we guarantee 10 to 12 shots a game because that's what it's going to take to get Trent inside the top 100 because you're gonna need three three-pointers you're gonna need a steel steel and a half something like that to cover up the fact that he doesn't rebound or pass  really at all and you know the free throws will be good but he's not gonna take very many of them  so he's a guy that I've stashed in a couple of spots where I I kind of had some free players to just sort of cast off into the wind and if you want to know more go back to that damn show from Saturday we did a specialty show on this and we talked about him uh where the hell was I Nick's side Donte divincenzo Josh Hart those guys continue to battle for you know Wings Supremacy it's still to me feels like to even chenzo is the play I know Hearts had a couple of decent games in a row but I'd go Dante and then Isaiah hartenstein left this ball game early dealing with some ankle issues hopefully he doesn't miss time pressures that you had 18 and 11 basically feeling in her heart and Stein but we've seen a chew enough to know that he can get you some rebounds and he gets you some steals but he generally does more damage than good he turns the ball over his free throws and not good he's feel well number I know he went nine for 10 and this one but that's typically not a positive for him they are off and just way too many negatives on the achua side  I get it certain head-to-head formats blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah I'm talking about if you're actually attacking all nine categories if you're punting something that he's terrible at fine make that adjustment yourself but I can't say that about every player in the NBA because there's like a weird  hedge maze that I could talk through to give almost every player fantasy value in the NBA oh if you're punting these four categories it's like now that's that's a nine Hour podcast it's not helpful free throws or field goal or a bunch of things if your points or whatever and hardened Stein's out and itchy who gets the start fine have at it but if you're going for nine cat wins  we've seen it enough  okay see is sort of a non-story fantasy wise not because there's nobody good on the team but because it's the same good players every ball game and it's Shay chat and Jalen Williams and we've had a little bit of a bump lately for Josh giddey but he cooled off here basically as I talked about over the weekend another guy when they run hot yes when they don't know  he'll be fine but he's not in my opinion I don't think he gets inside the top 100 and I think even getting back to where he was last year is probably a little bit of a stretch  Minnesota are we about to get a little Nas Reed heater and Cat fouled out of this ball game so that played a little bit of a role there was  so a few extra opportunities and Nas the units he was a part of we're very good  you guys know he's on my stream well warm board and if this is him getting warm then you want to be a part of it it's just sometimes kind of hard to know  Chicago blew out the zombie Grizzlies who did still have Jaron Jackson Jr among the the zombies that playing playing with the zombies and JJ you know the story here is basically he can we get a week or two of good games out of him and then maybe convince somebody to give him up for like a 50 range dude  to me if you can get that back that would probably be a win  I'm good with Vince Williams Junior I'm good with Luke Kennard  I think those guys are basically every day starts right now no Xavier Tillman in this ball game so Santi aldama got the start didn't score much but aldama does have the ability to get some fairly well-rounded fantasy lines boards assist steals blocks some threes the percentages are  Obama's a guy that I've got my eye on for more so silly season then trade deadline because I don't think there's really anybody who the hell else can the Grizzlies trade at this point all their tradable piece is our hurt  except maybe Kenard  if Luke Kennard gets moved I don't know that that necessarily gives Santi aldama a path to Value maybe David Roddy gets some more there but his Fantasy game and all that good what we really need here is for Tillman or JJ to be out of the picture in some way and I don't think it's by trade it's probably by shut down and then I'll Damas it go so that might be more of a March stash as a February one if you're kind of great and out the timelines on this stuff Chicago back to life without Zach LaVine for a couple of weeks here this game ended early so Andre Drummond saw some extra run Iota sumu got some extra run Patrick Williams obviously he does more when Levine is out  I'm not playing any of those guys in Roto  head-to-head let's see what is I'm just got Chicago's schedule I don't have that right at the tip of my tongue here but we can look it up Chicago not a great schedule they played a night and then they don't go to a Wednesday and then they're off again until Sunday after that they go three they're on a stretch of three three three three three and then the trade deadline or the All-Star week so bulls not in a great schedule spot that would be the place to use Patrick Williams or to sue me or drumming and it's not happening right now  Patrick Williams of those guys probably inches the closest to being someone you might be able to use on a day-to-day basis  we saw the last time Levine was out it was kind of like sometimes in sometimes knob maybe you play him and Rodeo against really bad defenses or something like that or is that getting too cute probably so you probably will vouch tomorrow Kobe white Alex Caruso and then I don't know that I dabble with the rest of them  we talked to Houston already the Utah side Jordan Clarkson continues to be on a serious scoring binge these days I think he's like top 50 over the last two weeks now top 65 last two weeks his lack of defensive stats hasn't hurt him on very much because his scoring has been so good  he's shooting 47% over that stretch on 18 shots per game and of course that's the story with Clarkson if that if field goal percent is not a massive negative and he's putting up some scoring and assist numbers then he can be playable and right now he's playable I think sellable is probably the better term for him this is all an overtime game where he did some extra there but I don't want to put it on overtime he's been hot for about two weeks  see what you can get for him somebody will give up a top 80 or 90 guy you do it  if the best you can get back is like a fellow streaming level dude then you just roll with the hot guy  Sexton's a play Walker Kessler's a play Laurie marketing is a play same story there so much complaining about Walker Kessler and I get it he hasn't been as good as people want but I think he's number 70 right now when in a season where it seems like almost everything is gone the wrong way  yeah you drafted it you know 45 or 50 so he's two rounds behind that but it's not like it's been a team ruining number  you probably thought you were getting about three or four extra rebounds out of him then what you're getting right now and the rest of it is not that far off from what your your projections probably had I'm just saying  meanwhile Kris Dunn got 27 minutes in this ball game and again over time helped and I just man I want to play Chris Dunn so bad and I just can't bring myself to do it  because every time it looks like he might be able to hold value he has like a 14 minute game and the whole thing comes apart  do I want to say we should get out in front of Kris Dunn  I don't know how we possibly can because half the time he's Blitz time with John Jay George and sometimes they just go point guard list for a little stretch or sex in her Clarkson is playing point  it just too many guys getting minutes on a game to game basis ah man I really want it though Chris Dunn's Fantasy game is just so nice I enjoy it so much  mmm  you know let's say this if you're punting points go ahead and add him  I don't think anybody's about to get out of his way like you're thinking trade deadline  I don't know that things change much  in fact it's more likely that they moved done  which right now I don't know that they like Utah's playing well these days so I don't know that they want to go selling pieces anymore they have a lot of assets already  so this is this is it probably he and keyonte George you're splitting point guard minutes and some of the time it's gonna be okay and some of the time it's going to be bad  can you catch it on the right days I'm guessing probably not so I'm leaning towards no on Kris Dunn but damn it every fiber of my punt points body wants to say yes  and I just can't do it  a quick glance at Friday reveals that  the Pelican's didn't play Saturday or Sunday  and I think that was it I think we covered the other 28  no that's not right  screwing something up one day I'll actually remember to go and see who did and did not play on Saturday and Sunday before I actually launched headlong into this thing but a quick glance at the Pelicans JV got more minutes in this one they needed the offense more than they needed Larry Nance's defense and this is why I could not bring myself to play Larry Nance in Roto formats because you just knew an 18 minute game of almost no stats was coming  and right now the problem with the Pelicans is that their healthy  it's good for them generally lost this ball game but generally good for them  but bad for Fantasy value because her Jones Can't sustain value in Trey Murphy is healthy train Murphy has more trouble sustaining value when the sort of big names on this team are healthy Trey as a whole by the way JV has trended down from top 50 to more like 80 to 100 range since Nance came back Nance is not quite good enough as long as Alan she has around and so you got all these guys that are all vying to get right near the cut line and JVS above it and Trey is probably just barely above it and Nancy's like just barely below it and herb is a little bit farther below at the net  maybe the pills thin the herd a little bit at the trade deadline that'd be swell we've heard herb Jones is potentially movable which seems kind of silly but a possibility and if he ends up in a place where he gets a little more usage he could be a winner  and if he moves that helps Trey Murphy  I don't think they move Nance or JV but anything is possible I suppose  not to say that you need to be like stashing her Jones for the trade deadline  consider it but I don't think that I would do it Trey Murphy if you're getting annoyed with him just call him a trade deadline stash and your mind in case somebody gets moved and then Nance know and JV yes you obviously hang on to him because he's very much been good enough  and that is our very large weekend review quick look at the chat room here to see if anybody brought up some names that I didn't cover  mostly names that I've talked about all ready here as I skip through it oh here's one hey Dan does it hurt to Shante Murray if he's traded to the Lakers yeah I think a little bit his stat line will probably look different he has never gonna be the Deontay from San Antonio where it was Murray against the universe those were that was an amazing year where he jumped all the way up to the first round putting up 21 points and nine assists and two steals a ball game and eight rebounds that's not happening  the only way that happens is if Trey young is not around in Atlanta and he goes back to basically being the only guy there  what he's done in Atlanta which is still about 20 points five boards five assists one and a half steals  I could see him getting maybe like 16 shots 15 16 shots in LA but probably not 17 or 18  he's not gonna get nine assists you could definitely see the five to six like the D'Angelo Russell range continuing for him  you could see the steals stay pretty good maybe even improve a tiny bit but just general usage likely comes down I know playing with Trey young is hard because you're always going to be fighting for usage there but add Braun those guys combined are going to take more basketball than Trey young does now the nice thing about La is that like playing with Anthony Davis yeah ads gonna get usage but it could be dejounte getting him the basketball that could be where he collects his assist so I don't think this is like a precipitous drop-off situation but I I don't I do think that there's probably a small hit  and this is something that we just have to remember because it's so easy to keep talking ourselves into oh yeah everything's gonna be fine this guy's gonna do the same kind of stuff there's drop offs when guys join teams where they just don't have the ball quite as much  uh Damian Lillard who again he's climbing the board and you guys know I I had him as a Buy Low for a long time here  there's just no way that he's gonna be that like top six guy that he was when he was the only man standing in Portland  because he taking 17 18 shots a game in Milwaukee and he took 22 was a Blazer first stretches  it's just the way it is like James Harden he's been awesome for the Clippers and they that team just piles up fantasy stats but like best case hardened is like what he was with Philly he's not going to be lead dog top three James Harden anymore we just need to not overthink these things I over we all overthink it too much so yeah small hit but not massive and frankly if I'm the Lakers I that's not the guy I'm targeting but you know we'll see I know they feel like they need to shake things up a little bit oh let's see what else we got here Rich says go go was a dnp I didn't I didn't say he sit out I said he was out  but I think we may also see him resurface because the magic liked him and he played a lot and I think there might just kind of be seeing what they have right now  which I guess is nice because that lends itself towards it trade deadline where maybe one of those centers gets moved and that clears the deck a little bit for whatever centers are left  um some questions about himani kumara and Bilal we talked about them is Jalen Brunson a sell High I mean depends I guess this sort of the general answer there he's number 35 and 9 CAD he's been on a little bit of a heater lately  I don't think he's a sell High I think he was probably a Buy Low when he was like number 55 or 660  kind of guy for Brunson and and that's fine uh Dan bait this is basically like what do I do with Chris Paul  you might see him back in like three weeks in a best case scenario  would you drop him for Trey Jones or Wendell Carter Junior if your team is in a dire spot I would definitely drop him for trade Jones if your team's not in a higher spot then no I mean this is very very team specific situation but we haven't talked about Chris Paul in a while  does tears here gets shut down if he's not traded possibly but this is another great reason to end your League's three weeks early and then you don't really have to think about it  hey Dan thoughts on Dante Exum that's someone we haven't talked about in a little bit good question um I don't think that anybody for the Mavs outside of the two Superstar guards and Derek Lively has sustainable fantasy value exam could be the closest because he was hitting threes at a super high clip and that's just like an easy way to have fantasy value because heating threes without ruining a field goal percent is a combo that helps you sort of stay afloat  I don't think he has enough to do on a game to game basis to be top 100 when he comes back schedule wise I think you should be a very good schedule play When the Mavs have a good schedule which I guess they do this week but he's back midweek they go three games in four nights and they have a three game week and then a four so yeah I mean there's some spots in there where I think I deploy him but I don't think I would use him on the road outside Kirk Royce says thank God I didn't cut D-Lo yep  you're welcome  you're welcome  is Amon Thompson worth a stash I don't think so I think Houston this was like a bye necessity thing the only way you're getting that one is if they get eliminated from the playoffs with like two weeks to go and then all the Vets shutter down but I don't see that happening there game out of the play in spot they're much better at home than on the road and they'll find a way to start hanging out clothes at the very least and if they get let's say van Fleet is done resting and let's say Barry Smith Jr is healthy and tari Eason shows up they'll win a few ball games and so that's gonna keep a guy like Thompson more towards the periphery  that'll be that  plans to try to come back and do a weekly preview show later today we'll see if that happens I can't guarantee it it's a pretty damn busy day um and I got to get with the folks over here to get baseball fired up yes I'm not doing anything for it but I am involved in the planning and marketing and so that's a pretty big project that it's time to start thinking about as well again if you're following along please drop a follow at Danbury
