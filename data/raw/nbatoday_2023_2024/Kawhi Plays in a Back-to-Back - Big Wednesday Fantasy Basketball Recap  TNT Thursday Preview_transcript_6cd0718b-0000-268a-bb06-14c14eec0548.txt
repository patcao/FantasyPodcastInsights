welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  good morning everybody  that's what I'm getting down to here good morning still the late morning here even on the Pacific coast managed to squeeze it in there little man parent-teacher conference day so  schedules a little  wonky today he's off school  but we did have to go there for a half an hour and come on back and you know learn the things that we got to work on with our kid blah blah blah all that same old stuff we have a big Wednesday to recap and I don't have the vocal strength to do a whole lot beyond that so please I just beg of you here at the front end  check out our premium stuff over at sports ethos.com I think a handful of you have have tried the fantasy pass and a few of you even got in on the wager pass which I believe you'll all be extremely happy with  and at the very at the very least come hang out with us in our Discord because right now for me like I've said if you find me on Twitter it's at Danvers d a n b e s b r i s there is a Discord link that one should never expire you can come hang out with us over on Sports ethos Discord it's free to get in there there are hidden rooms that are available to those that have fantasy passes and wager passes and stuff like that so just ping us once you're inside if you want to learn more about that  first things first though here  actually I guess that was the first thing  ah well let's just dive straight on into this stuff and for those that are watching it on YouTube you guys will have the box scores float up on your screen here in a matter of moments for everybody else don't worry we'll be going through each thing piece by piece I will not miss a thing much like Aero Smith did in their hit song all those years ago I think the vote yesterday was that more of you preferred it when I put my face down in the corner and it did block a few of the names but at least I could sort of get one whole team's worth of stuff on the screen  sorry or you're welcome I don't even know what the proper answer here is but at this point I'm really just trying to get through the week and hopefully my voice will recover over the weekend so these shows will not be as animated or as fun as usual but there's plenty of information so I want to really Jam that down your throat so I can hear Toronto Blue out Milwaukee this game was over pretty early so the minutes are a bit all over the map this is basically why  and the sons to are another example of this these are the reasons that you fade teams pushing Superstars together not because they're not going to be good but because it takes time for them to get to that point bucks are going to be great by the end of this season  Celtics are already great which is kind of amazing  but Drew holidays such a guy that fits in everything and then poor Singas is a guy that you know that he just sort of got to drop into a role that pre-existed and the other things were around it but like for the bucks they they really did blow things up Chris Middleton is not right yet he played 17 minutes yesterday  as I mentioned  I don't really want anything to do with Middleton this year I think we're talking about like a month and a half long ramp up here  unless you can get him for two pennies I think is what I said yesterday I will not pay more than two pennies for Christmas Middleton this season  but as far as like you know the name Yana's thing goes they they exploded in the first ball game and now that was adrenaline and teams not really understanding what was going on but now the Bucks have to figure out how to fit the piece is together this now comes the hard part and they'll be fine they're going to get very good but the number the season-long wind total number if you're getting back into the sports betting side for teams like the Bucks like the Suns is built on an idea that these Superstars are just going to be great together from day one and they're not they get there over time but they very rarely hit the big season win total numbers that we're talking about but I don't want to read into the fantasy stuff in this one they were terrible let's just look at the Toronto side where Dennis Schroder continues to impress I am so sorry Dennis I doubted you this year and I should not have doubted you he's an assist machine he's fully running that team Scotty Barnes Pascal siakam also doing some ball handling but like  the Dennis Schroder show is upon us so  like you know I  talking about a miss a lot of the other guys I think the jury's still out on whether or not it's a hit or miss this one I think pretty obviously I vastly underestimated how much he was going to be doing with this team and as a result and I didn't draft him I don't think anywhere Gary Trent was the guy where you were like well could he get some of the point guard stuff if they let Scotty Barnes run point the answer so far it's not really I think Gary Trent is is trending pretty hard towards a drop at this point again I don't have him anywhere but trying to put myself in your shoes if you do he probably is not someone that ends up on your roster a couple weeks from now so if you want to get out in front of it I'm actually kind of okay with that no precious to chewa which means that yakka portal really didn't have anybody breathing down his neck finally and he had a really good ball game with a double-double and four blocks let's hope that that's the type of thing that keeps up a little bit from there  Portland beat Detroit and I don't want to read too much into this either but scoot Henderson left this ball game early  the you can see it on your screen if you're watching that it says he will not return as of the four minute Mark of the fourth quarter but that's not when he left the ball game that was when he got ruled out for the remainder of the game he left in the third that's why his minutes were at 20 he's actually playing a little bit better in this one but also Portland got a whole lot better when he left because that meant more Malcolm Brogden who's just frankly a better basketball player right now and that's not to say that's good won't get better as the season goes on as his career goes on but in this exact moment if Portland wants to win games they'll play a whole lot of Malcolm Brogden at point guard because he's far away the best option they've got their  shaedon Sharpe was unguardable in this game any time he took it to the rack they fouled him anytime he shot from the outside he knocked it down it was really a pretty special game from that young dude who obviously belongs on rosters especially while Anthony Simons is out and certainly will scoot his out with scooping out I think we just get an even higher dose of Malcolm Brogdon and also can we talk about and I made this rhyme yesterday but I'm going to do it again why is everybody hating on ayton  please stop hating on Aiden  because you guys know what Aiden is ranked so far this year  number 18 in nine cat  and obviously the Steels are unseasonably high he's averaging 2.2 steals per game but he's also I believe the League's leading rebounder so far tied with demonic bonus at 14 rebounds per ball game he hasn't even had to score yet which I think is a thing that comes around if you're getting better point guard play which Malcolm Brogden would certainly bring that so I don't think we should be surprised at 8 and scored 16 points and yesterday's game either  I don't know why everybody's hating on Aiden maybe it's a little bit of a cell High because of the Steels but also I think he scores more so  yeah there's a total disconnect there on what his value as actually been so far this year versus what people seem to think he's been really good  and Portland won another ball game which is  dare I say astounding  Blazers are two and three it hasn't been a complete disaster  not that far off but you know  could be worse  well this wind came at the hands of the Pistons who were in control this game for a while but just sort of ran out of steam as the game went on Marvin Bagley had the fill-in at center with no Jalen Duren if Duran's there I would imagine the blue Pistons probably win this game although Bagley was actually a plus eight when he was on the floor it was James Wiseman that was a disaster big surprise there  Marvin Bagley not a great fantasy line the big turnovers kind of the main problem there so a little bit of a deflated  if you want to play Bagley again in the next one if Jalen's out I'm okay with that I think you could probably even get away with it on both rodeo and head to head but definitely her head to head and then I say a Stewart with no Duran his job gets a little bit bigger I said in my opinion the jury still kind of out on whether Stewart is going to be a season-long value right now he's ranked one 53 and it feels like he's actually been kind of okay so far it's the lack of defensive stats and he only had one more in this ball game if he gets anything in that department he boosts himself inside the top 100 but so far he's legitimately had one steal the entire season and one block that's bad  Marcus Sasser is someone that got a popped a couple of questions popped up he played 23 minutes at a whole bunch of defensive stats not something that I'm reading too much into unless this is an upward Trend but I wouldn't need to see more before I buy in on that  Pelican's had a pretty nice comeback win here over the Thunder and we just got word right before going on are that's Shae Gill just Alexander has a knee issue and he'll be sitting out their ball game tomorrow so that's sucks a big old weenie as far as the Pelicans go you don't understand made the most of his 21 minutes I'm gonna tell you guys to sell High basically any time he has a big game in 21 minutes because I don't think we can count on him having a big game in 21 minutes every single night but so far he's been able to do enough in about 23 minutes per ball game to just barely ease his way inside the top 100 and that's a time where you might want to think about moving so could JV be a top 100 center it's a possibility I still think it's probably not gonna happen as long as this team is healthy but Brandon Ingram has been out and that's good for him because that allows them to they need a little bit more offense when Ingram is healthy they need more defense that definitely hurts him so and I guess we should also throw the caveat in there the Pelicans are almost never all the way healthy  so when I talk about this maybe I should  listen to my own words  and maybe that means that there is a path for JV because the pals almost never have all of their guys together at the same time  herb Jones was the other guy we were watching in this one he's kind of slipped back into these bad habits of really not doing anything and his 30 minutes per game I'm a little worried I mean they're better when he's on the floor because of his defense basically but I am  pretty worried that when Trey Murphy shows up in a month that herb is going to be the guy that that kind of disappears also Jordan Hawkins filling in for Brandon Ingram pretty fantasy friendly line at took 19 shots I don't know where he gets up taking 19 shots but if Ingram misses any more time he's dealing with tendonitis right now and technically day-to-day so I don't know that I could Advocate and a Hawkins pickup but it is good to kind of know  if you're making a movie with the last moment if you if we do find out that Ingram's out for the next ball game that's the direction you can go  as far as what to do on the Thunder side with shame missing tomorrow's ball game I don't know that there's an obvious pick up Lou Dort probably gets a few more shots but his game isn't particularly fantasy friendly who slides into the starting lineup is still a little bit of a question is it like Lindy Waters is it Isaiah Joe we saw him get in there and take a bunch of three-pointers last year in some of these spots  I think I would just assume that giddy Jalen Williams and Jed homerun become a little bit more valuable for a game or two and I don't know that anybody actually moves across the cut line  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown well in line oh no

drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's drizly.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  ah the coughing  Indiana got blown out they lost by 51 points with no Tyreese Halliburton Andrew nembhard got the start but as I've warned you all his game is actually not super fantasy friendly TJ McConnell is the point guard that has the fantasy friendly game  but McConnell got a whole lot of garbage time I don't know that we can trust either one of those guys to play enough if Halliburton misses another one so I am not advocating any sort of pickup there and then everything else you can just throw out because the box score was a mess  same general story for Boston they blew this game open early nobody needed to do anything so moving along Cavaliers beat the Knicks this was a home in home situation actually I think both of these games are New York so I think this was a  home and still at the same home rematch it's very hard to be the same team where you're kind of evenly matched two ball games in a row and the defense came to play in this one Nic shot 35% Cavs just 43% Carrie silvert was back in there  he's probably worth a pickup while Darius Garland's out he might even continue to be playable when Garland comes back because you know we saw Evert play pretty well down the stretch last year he's kind of carried it over into this season  this is the best iteration of Levert we've ever seen  so  why not certainly better for head-to-head than Roto because of typical efficiency issues but he's very much on the map and then I'm sure I'm gonna continue to get Max strus stuff anytime he doesn't have a great ball game and he's been very cold lately dude shooting 35% from the field  but I don't care  because that's not gonna happen all season long worst case scenario shoots 39 or 40% from the field I think probably he even gets higher than that  he seems to be up among the league leaders in minutes or team leaders and minutes I should say hit four boards for assistance in two blocks addition to make all three of his free throws had a high turnover game yesterday for whatever reason but I am not moving off of Max Spruce until his job changes and right now he's getting plenty of playing time and that's all that we really need because at some point these three are going to start dropping as far as the Knicks go we came into this ballgame hoping to learn more about whether Josh Hart was gonna get playing time then RJ Barrett was ruled out and Josh Hart got the start and so that question kind of went up in smoke  if heart is starting then you start heart  if heart starts you start heart  easy peasy  but I do still kind of need to know and so I guess to that and you could pick him up and just ride with it to see kind of how long RJ Barrett is out and if Hearts still gets minutes when he comes back if you want to kind of get out in front of it  that would be the path to take their you manual quickly 28 minutes in this ball game so that was a better sign for me the jury still out I think he he's more of a head-to-head type I don't know that it quickly is going to have the playing time where the usage day in day out to be a roto play and I don't think much that I see over the next bit is going to change my position on that and unless he starts playing 30 plus minutes at night and I don't think we see that happen  Brooklyn 109 Miami 105 the main story lines here no Nic Claxton know Spencer didn't witty on the Brooklyn side and they still managed to pull out a win cam Thomas three steals to kind of help what turned out to be a pretty rough shooting night and this is kind of what you like Gunners like that are not going to shoot the percentage he had been and I kind of told you guys I was like cam Thomas he does belong on rosters right now because he's getting all the usage he can handle there's absolutely no reason to move off of that but he was shooting like 58.59% coming into yesterday's ballgame we knew there was no chance that was gonna hold up  so now is the other shoe dropping is this a cold streak or just a cold game for him  we can't know really until the next one but just be aware that when things go cold they go real cold he is a streaky as they come  Dorian Finney Smith solid fill in at center for the klaxon Royce O'Neill actually got the the start for Spencer didn't witty because three of the starters are out for Brooklyn right now and only had a pretty well rounded game did sort of The Quiet like I need to be out here for 40 minutes to get my fantasy stuff but if we know he's gonna be there for 40 minutes then he moves into that burger board position as well  something that was kind of floating under the radar on the heat side that I want to point everybody's eyeballs to his Josh Richardson playing 30 minutes off the bench and I believe making a case to start I don't know if that means that they benched jaquez or if they bench Kyle Lowry  but someone's got to go on this team Richardson was terrible so it's not like they're gonna Rush him into the starting lineup  but I think seeing him play 30 minutes off the bench was it kind of an indicator of what they'd like for him to be doing at some point going forward you know shooting one for nine obliterated anything that could have come from it on the fantasy standpoint but a steel a few rebounds a few assists if you put a couple of three pointers on top of that he actually becomes then a starboard fantasy place so  I don't know that you need to get out in front of this one I don't think anybody's going to be racing you to the waiver wire to pick up Josh Richardson today but if you have somebody that's completely useless and you can cut them this that's this is a guy that I would think about doing it for because I think that this is a you know the nothing's working for the heat right now they've been one of the worst teams in the NBA there one in four  only the Grizzlies are without a win to this point and so Miami is going to start to shake things up a little bit that's one way that they might do it  Wizards this actually was a blowout they made it closed at the very end during garbage time so that's why the minutes are a little screwball I wouldn't read too much into it other than to just note that the Wizards are going to be in a lot of blog games because they're awful they're really really bad  I thought they might be able to hang in there with some of the more middling teams but they're getting smoked by even the middling teams right now  Mike muscala got the start  because Daniel Gafford still out I think his return will help them a little bit but how much I don't know that's gonna make that big of a difference  Jordan Poole has been atrocious to this point tyus Jones had actually been kind of okay before this ball game but this knocked him down a few pegs he's now number 93  he still hasn't shot free throw interestingly so far this season notice that as we're looking at his numbers Kyle kuzma has been able to kind of stay above The Fray Denny had a better ball game here but he's been kind of all over the map prior to this point this good one pushed him back inside the top 100  I don't know that I trust Aveda to post efficient lines like this every day he definitely profiles as someone you could look at in a points League nine cat is still kind of on the fence kuzma is a yes Delon Wright only 22 minutes here but he had three boards a three-pointer nine assisted two steals so that's kind of why you have him rostered if you have him rostered up and I do in a few spots because I like the assist the Steals and sometimes the rebounds combination from a point guard  Jordan Poole obviously is rostered he is he's on this list that I've been slowly amassing on the show of guys that are buy lows but also ones I don't really want all that badly he joins the likes of window Carter Junior and Andrew Wiggins all guys that are by Lowe's but all guys that I'm not super into  and then no other valuation changes there on the Atlantis side we saw Jalen Johnson moved back to the bench still almost doubled doubled so I'm not super worried about that so Dick Bass lead back into the starting lineup which is good for him that's gonna buy him a little more time on Ross's DeAndre Hunter has been playing like a man possessed so far this year he very much belongs as a start until he cools off  unless he cools off and less or until  I don't know either way and then this ball game was over early so we got some bonus So Kong woman it's again  I can I finally do I have your Collective permission to stop reminding everybody that they need to hold on to on Yahoo can this finally be the day where it's just like we don't have to talk about it anymore  he's a must roster player  and very little is going to change that other than like  Clint capela starting to play 32 minutes a game which ain't happening any time soon  Denver decided not to show up for this one so don't read anything into that Minnesota decided they did want to show up for this one so we got a nice one out of my Conley  I got a bunch of Mike Conley questions does he suck blah blah blah this ball game pushes him inside the top 70 and the early going  this is what you drafted you drafted a guy who's gonna hit a three-pointer or two is gonna get you somewhere between four and six assists on a night the night basis  do it efficiently and hopefully there are more of these coming up where he actually gets to be a slightly larger participant in the offense  slow-mo I'm a little bit disappointed with I'll admit Kyle Anderson you know 25 to 30 minutes a game I thought he'd be able to do a little bit more but the rebounding hasn't really been there the assists haven't really been there you've gotten a smattering of steals from Anderson so far but those are available elsewhere  if he doesn't pick it up then I'll move on I'm gonna give him a little bit longer though just because again we know when he gets the minutes he gets fantasy stuff and you know I if his role changes considerably that I guess that's where we would make a little bit of a pivot but I'm gonna give him a little bit longer before I do anything too rash with slo-mo  Houston beat Charlotte the Rockets getting their first win of the year and the Hornets  could probably use lamelo ball not being kind of a mess lamelo's been bad so far this year this ball game is shot was a little bit better but he's actually outside the top 100 in nine cats so far shooting 30 and a half percent from the field only 15 and a half points per game  really rough start to a guy that you may recall we referred to as a field goal punt build guy on draft night  even with a field goal punch he still not anywhere near a first round value  no massive changes to my valuations here I think you stick with Brandon Miller he had five thousand twenty four minutes so that was part of it but he was still okay a Gordon Hayward continued to play well we'll wait and see what happens with the front court with Miles Bridges comes back but that's all you really need to worry about from there I'm in Thompson heard his ankle grade two ankle sprain is the report right now they expect him to miss a couple of weeks doesn't change the rotations very much in Houston other than maybe shortening them up a little bit Jalen green had a slightly more efficient ball game that's good Dillon Brooks has been a bit of a fantasy surprised but I wouldn't read too much into it mostly because Dillon Brooks is shooting wait for it 59% from the field if you wiped that out go back into the low 40s where you know he's eventually gonna land it's gonna be a fantasy number that's not all that great also his five steals yesterday hyper inflating his Steel's numbers for the season kind of in the same way we just talked about with the Andre but with Dillon Brooks you've got all these things that are different than usual meaning the field goal percent is different Steel's number is really high the free throw is actually bigger than usual he's going to tape her  off he's playable in points League's should have been from the get-go playable in field goal punch type rosters but I'm still not trusting him in nine cat Freddie Van Fleet good ballgame Jabari Smith Jr good ballgame Alfred and shengwen pretty good ballgame  not a whole lot to take away  Chicago Falls in Dallas to a the upstart Mavericks who've opened the year four and oh no Kyrie Irving for the second game in a row on the Dallas side as far as Chicago goes this is a team that really does seem to bounce back and forth between decent ball games and kind of uninspired ones  but hey  at least voucher to 2020 game so we'll go ahead and we'll take that he's now back up to number 61 per game after a slow start cool Zach Levine was a little bit better DeMar DeRozan was fine I keep waiting to see if Alex Caruso is going to jump over Kobe white he hasn't yet but Kobe white is not a good fantasy player so he should be dropped Caruso's the one you're waiting to see if maybe he can turn it into something but he's not playing enough right now  on the Dallas side I can continue to be teased by Grant Williams he's number 98 in nine cat on four three-pointers and good field goal percent and that's almost it now if he could get some defensive stats mixed in now you start to cook with something  I don't think he's gonna be added in all that many places even though he had 73 pointers yesterday but he is in a really nice spot with the Mavericks he makes a lot of sense as sort of the tough power forward who's very very very good at hitting Corner three-pointers and Lucas gonna get him open and Kyrie is gonna get him open when he comes back  but I don't think again I don't think you need to race out and get him  this is one of those ones where you can kind of be late on it because the what is the upside really for Grant Williams like top 90 how much better is he gonna get than what we've seen so far not much  Tim Hardaway Jr continues his hot run to start the year he's another one where I don't think you're gonna be able to sell for anything because nobody believes that he's gonna do this all season long know Kyrie has been helpful for three pointers a game is not gonna stick 20 points a game is not gonna stick  just take it while you can get it because at some point you know he's going to get cold and then it's gonna hurt the better news in this one the good news I don't want to say Maxi Cleaver being hurt is good news but it is excellent news for Derek Lively who got 33 minutes because the three-headed Center monster went back down to just being a two-headed Center monster and Lively played really well 13 boards six assists two Steals and a block and when one of the other centers is down he is very much a guy that you need to be playing and so perhaps with that knowledge under our belt we can amend the probably droppable when all three centers are healthy to probably stashables three centers are healthy because he can put up some pretty good lines when one of them goes down and Maxi Cleburne Dwight Powell don't exactly have a clean bill of health  Grizzlies lose again the boobs are coming at this point there's not much longer than they can go without a win before people start to get a little antsy  Xavier Tillman only 14 minutes the question with him is always whether or not he's going to see playing time against teams that can spread them out and the answer right now is no  by the way Santee all dhamma still isn't back yet  but you know they'll run JJ up at the center spot if they need to  and I the thought process for me was what if you tall runs a whole bunch of Walker Kessler which they did not do they instead decided to spread everybody out run Kelly Olynyk as the floor spacing passing big man and that kind of forced memphis's hand to go away from the Xavier Tillman offensive rebounding Bruiser type  and nothing that Memphis is doing right now is working anyway so  oh man I really wish that I had my voice back this is really a struggle Larry Martin in another good ball game he's off to astounding start this year he's number 10  I thought he'd take a small step back so far that hasn't happened at all Colin Sexton woke up but we can ignore that Jordan Clarkson woke up which you kind of knew had to be coming he still not inside the top 200 in nine category League's but again you know what you're getting on that point so I'm not gonna be labor it no you're not adding Kelly Olynyk John Collins still playing fine tht let's just drop him and move on from this nonsense and then Walker Kessler you gotta sit on it at this point because  eventually Utah's gonna go to him and it's just not happening out of the chute  I wonder what price you can get on Kessler in a Buy Low I don't know right now but I would think about it especially if it's on the cheap Lakers Clippers was a fun one overtime game Paul George fouled out I think that was right at the beginning of overtime if I'm not mistaken and that was a big deal because he was kind of the only Clipper hitting shots down the stretch and into OT and then he hit LeBron on the elbow and that was the end of that but still a massive game for PG he's having one of the best starts he's had to a season in a very long time he's number four in nine cat to this point Kauai big ball game missed some free throws and kind of a weird twist but I don't care because he's Kawhi Leonard and the better news in this one is that Paul George and Kawhi Leonard played in a back-to-back  I mean I know it was Lakers so there was sort of more on the line  but whatever it happened  Russ had a big one  could this be his last big one before James Harden shows up  it seems  possible  because he's not going to be running the offense once Harden's there but there's gonna be so Much Chemistry stuff to work out on this team Norman Powell kind of his last hurray  bones kind of a little bit of a last hurray Evita zubats actually think he'll be okay he's always already settled back into his normal outside the top 100 valuation so that crap didn't take long had one giant ball game to start the year and then he's gone back to being regular old Evita zubats  what do you do with all of this information on the Clippers is probably the better question than me just highlighting what what's going on you can't really do much anything because nobody's gonna buy on Russell Westbrook knowing that James Harden showing up you're not selling on Paul George and Kawhi all though again with hardened showing up if you could sell on Paul George and get a different second or first rounder maybe that would be something to think about but I just don't think it's gonna happen so screw it  just play the hand you're dealt and go with it from there if you're wondering why is Kawhi Leonard ranked outside the top 25 it's because for some reason he's been a very bad free throw shooter so far this year shooting 2/3 he's making 2/3 of them on almost four attempts per game if you crank that up near 90 where it normally is kauai's back up near the first round where he normally is as well and if these guys are playing in back-to-backs holy smokes  as far as the Lakers go I think the big story is in this one forget the fact that Anthony Davis has been incredible so far this year all so he said number one by the way number one player in fantasy sports mostly because he's shooting 85% the free throw line that's always the thing with ad a LeBron is much higher than I expected to this point largely because he's been forced to play a boatload of minutes but that's still only puts him at number 37 because he's been also quite terrible at the free-throw line they need to get LeBron's minutes down and at some point that's gonna happen but they couldn't do it in this one because they wanted this damn ball game Lakers have a really tough schedule to start the year and they're trying to get off to an okay start in it  those are not the fantasy points fantasy points are the Angelo Russell  number 45 and he's going to be a great value all season long Christian would 29 minutes A Team best plus 14 he and Anthony Davis are really figuring out how to work together nicely and I think what is played his way into a pre significant role for this team he is a must add player  Austin Reeves also woke up halfway through this game he put a move on I think it was Norman Powell that dropped him where you just hit the jumper and then he was just sort of back to being clutch Austin after that so congratulations right in the middle of this ball game he got a kick of adrenaline and busted out of his slump and the Bi-Lo window is probably closed on him now and then Klay Thompson a game winner for the Warriors over the Kings that's become quite a battle in the Bay Area Davion Mitchell hit 33s and had three steals filling in for deer and fox but that's about as good as it's gonna get for him I would prefer to stream Malik monk well Fox is down and then you just kind of hope that everybody else is a slightly better offensive game than they did in this one as far as the Warriors go Andrew Wiggins already talked about him he's a buy low but I also don't really want him on my fantasy team anyway Chris Paul closed this ball game but he only had a usage of eight  which is a little bit nerve wracking I'd like to see that number come up  we knew that Draymond coming back was gonna have a negative impact on Paul and now he's going to kind of have to figure out how to play off of Draymond because those two guys are gonna be on the floor together Dre's gonna be running things a bit more or they'll figure out a way to work them both into it I have faith that they'll figure this out but admittedly I am a little bit concerned about the Draymond impact on CP3  mid show reminders to please follow me on social media because I can't talk that much longer or my layering is just gonna fall right out of my throat I'm not even going to do promo because I just don't have the energy for it today but my Twitter handle again is at Dan best briefs uh please drop a like rate subscribe as a thank you for me because I am I don't all feel like I have to tough it out all that often because podcasting is fun but I'm freaking toughing it out right now  tonight Toronto oh my God I got a cough  this hurts guys this really hurts I cannot wait until this illness is over  oh deep breaths best Bruce you're almost there Toronto I want to see if yakka Turtle can keep it up and I want to find out if Gary Trent it is officially a drop for the Sixers do we know if the new players are available yet I don't think we've got word on that but if they are finding out who's the starting power forward is Paramount and I might consider doing a pickup of that player before the game even starts and if that player ends up getting caught in a massive Carousel minutes then you can drop them but I just don't want to be late on it if say you know what if they give it to Rob Covington what if he gets the start do I expect him to play 29 minutes right out of the shoot I don't but Covington in high 20s minutes is a fantasy gold mine and I just don't want to be late on that now if they start him he plays 19 minutes fine you drop at the end of the Ballgame no big deal no harm done  Pistons  please say Jalen duren's back  if not  you can throw Marvin Bagley to the mix we already talked about that I'd also like to see Alec Burks back because he was playing relatively well  Pelicans we just talked about herb Jones and Jordan Hawkins as a possible Burger board member if Brandon Ingram is  possibly back well that sounds like Zions gonna get rested for this one so  that's good for Johannes Valentine's by the way wide open Avenue for him does a Zion absence change  some of the other front courts stuff will find out  the magic I have become a Jaylen so file I think he needs to be on rosters to see all this thing develops but so far as Fantasy game looks pretty good and I actually kind of looks like thugs took a step forward  I need confirmation on whether Cole Anthony is a streamer level only and then Wendell Carter Junior who I mentioned  kind of caught us straight earlier in the broadcast  a guy that is both a Buy Low and someone that I still don't want for the Jazz I'm ready to just move on from tht so we don't have to talk about him anymore and then obviously Walker Kessler is what everybody's thinking about as well for the Spurs same stuff as always I get tired of repeating this but I'll do it sort of lightning round Style  how long before Trey Jones is the point guard because they're better when he's out there can the other main guys fix their efficiency issues and that's all of them when banana field goal percent and turnovers keldon Johnson and Jeremy Sohan both percentages Devin vassell kind well right now I actually free throw has been a bigger issue than field goal but again percentages and then Zach Collins it's been turnovers if this person can clean that stuff up I'll get a little more confident and what those guys are providing and the zombie son's Booker has been upgraded to questionable so there's a chance they might get some of the zombies back they may  fix some of the undead and and get back to upright  if Booker's back I think I'd leave everybody else alone  and by everybody else I'm not referring to use of Kevin Durant I'm talking about the Joshua kogi's and the Grayson Allen's and the Eric Gordon's and so forth and we just got our update on Jalen Duren he is still questionable for tonight  and so that's the short Thursday TNT Thursday game should be some fun out there I mean I'm gonna enjoy these damn basketball games even if I can't  vocalize my joy the Pistons  injury report dropped right here as we're getting towards the end of the show Alec Burks is also questionable so that's something to put on the list  thank you guys for bearing with me on that let me see if I can handle any questions I'm going to scan the chat room for ones that I think are possibly relevant to multiple people so if you're asking a question that's very team specific with my humblest apologies I just don't have the vocal strength and go through all of them but I want to try to get to questions that might be relevant for everybody here's one  Mikko says is Trey Murphy a good pickup and stash  So my answer to that is actually sort of complicated I the short version is yes because I don't think the Pelicans are ever healthy they're just not a team that's going to be healthy Brandon Ingram is always hurt Zion is always hurt McCollum is getting older even if he's probably the most durable among them meaning there will probably be an Avenue for Trey Murphy to get to do some stuff at some point once he comes back when the team is fully healthy I don't know that Trey Murphy's gonna get enough to do but like last year I kept saying it when they're healthy he didn't get to do very much and guess what they were never healthy  they had four games all year I believe whereas Zion Ingram and McCallum all played together and how many have they had so far this year before Ingram went down to how many games is Ingram played so far I need to make sure I'm getting this right two  out of how many  what are they at in games played are they at four or five  Pelicans are at four  so two of their four games they've been fully healthy if Trey Murphy was around for the two games at Ingram was out he'd be a value  So my answer this is probably yes  should I trade Walker Kessler for Dennis Schroder and 9 cat Rodeo uh I don't think that I would as much as I like what Shooters doing so far there are a few things going on with his Fantasy game that don't feel fully sustainable to me  most notably almost three three pointers a game is not a number that he's usually accustomed to and I don't think he sticks it nine assists it's really hard to get nine assists and night maybe he does but I think that comes down  I don't think that I would sell on Kessler right now because you're gonna be taking a hit  and I know that there's this whole like sunk cost theory thing  I in fact I'd be more on the other side to say what can I what can I use to buy on Walker Kessler because there's just no way he's this bad I'll season long  Christian wood or Jalen Suggs and 12 team Rodeo League  let's go Jalen's Suggs right now  because of this one Denver is good question does Christian would maintain value once Jeff Jarred Vanderbilt comes back  so there's going to be a matchup thing that happened so yesterday I think most of what you would have seen Jarred Vanderbilt do was done by cam redish now I know that some of that had to do with the fact that really hot tomorrow was out and Gabe Vincent was out and so the Lakers are pretty thin right now with no Vando know Vincent no rui that's why I picked in the previous question because I think the Lakers do go a little bit match up heavy when they needed those big guys when they needed that extra rebound and kick when they needed to have Rim protection as teams try to pull Anthony Davis away Christian Wood is the one that makes more sense than those other names so I think the answer is probably here because I think Christian what is elevating himself above the pack a little bit but all so why I like Jalen Suggs more is is for reasons like this one because there are guys coming back three of them that make life harder on the non-superstar level Lakers  what do I think about Derek white rest of season I think he's gonna be really freaking good he was one of the like main B150 targets that a lot of people were fading after the Drew Holiday trade he's number 19 right now so as much as Walker Kessler has been down white has been way way up  Matthew asks should I drop Bobby Portis if he's a zubats or Kevon Looney and 9 cat I think they're all droppable frankly so I don't think it matters which one of those three players you pick  let me see if I can find some other one do you think DeAndre Aiden can keep these stats up would you trade DeAndre Aiden for Kyrie Irving yes to the second question if you can use to get Irving you absolutely do it there's no chance to see under Aiden keeps up two steals per game that number comes down the points probably come up for him but the steals drop off probably impacts his value more still I think that ain't has a really good shot to be top 40 I think Kyrie Irving has a really good shot to beat top 10 so that's the that's the direction you go on that one let's see here I'm going to skim past some of these questions that are streamer related hey Dan can Nas read keep this up does he get just 20 minutes per game moving forward can you rank nasri Time Lord of manual quickly and Mark help faults I love nasreen he's a stat magnet always has been I was praying that he was gonna get traded to a team that would give him more opportunity than the wolves have  he didn't so I would say keep nazre on your roster for now but among these players I would rather have Mark hell faults  and probably Robert Williams although he had not reader are relatively close and then in 12 team Roto manual quickly is at the bottom of that list  hey Dan should we be concerned with Mark Williams minutes right now  yeah probably a little bit I mean this is what I talked about during the preseason I I was concerned that they run PJ Washington at Center sometimes and they have and they have Nick Richards whose a viable backup I just I didn't think that they were going to turn the keys over to Mark he still number 63 though so it's not like everything has been disasterous but the answer is yes I don't know that he's guaranteed 28 29 minutes of ball game hey Dan can you give me some Hope on Walker Kessler and Scoot  scoot the hope is that he'll be good by January or February so it's the same thing rookie ball handlers  if you don't if you don't know now you know  Walker Kessler I don't know why they're yanking him around like this I  I do think he'll come around I just don't know exactly when it's going to be I would hold on Kessler scoot is someone that I would I never would have drafted in 1000 years because you know how the seasons are gonna go for these rookie ball handlers instead he's someone that I would think about trying to buy low on in about a month if he still struggling like this  Xavier Tillman or on Yoko rest of season on Kang woo and it's by a mile  is dejounte Murray a good offer for Kyrie or Jimmy Butler right now  sure yeah go get Kyrie Irving for Deonte Murray I like that a lot actually did John days had two really good ball games after a couple of slow ones he's number 27 he probably finishes somewhere near 25 to 30 range Kyrie has that top 10 upside Butler is a Bi-Lo also  um  yeah I mean either way I'm actually probably good with this  John Alves is suggesting I go to Jason's Deli get some sweet tea and mixed juices with lemons and limes  John for me I just gotta stop talking man  I have the laryngitis because I keep doing these hour-long damn podcasts  let's see if we got anything here  Roto sorry guys I know those that are listening are  are hurting right now as I scan through hey a visit from Josh Lloyd what the hell is he doing awake right now what's up my man he called me sexy voice here let me go let me get in real tight to the microphone although that was 40 minutes ago I don't know if he still hanging with me  that started a chat in the chat room what's this one  oh two Padres calling me Dan Gasol I got a new nickname guys that's kind of fun just wanted to know your thoughts on when does value Trump team comp in a trade I just got off for clay for Mitch Robinson but their stats are so different that it's confusing this is a really good question and I truly wish that I had the voice to get through a good answer to it I would say that at this juncture  I'm hunting for the best possible player so I'm probably taking clay in that one even if Mitchell Robinson makes more sense for your team although it's worth pointing out these guys both might end up ranked like near 60 because for Klay Thompson  he's had some games where he didn't take quite as many shots so far this year for Mitchell Robinson  his actually his number seem relatively normal other than a very low field goal percent they're probably both going to put up numbers that are a little bit better than what they have been doing so if you're in that type of situation you definitely tip towards the player who is the better fit but I actually think both those guys end up moving up towards that 60 range so  I think you probably could go fit in that particular trade but in general like if someone I don't know what a good example would be here Klay Thompson or like Rudy gobert No One's Gonna offer that right now because Rudy's off to a pretty good start  yeah  Theodore says the Discord link under the video isn't working good to know my man I will fix that I will fix that literally as I'm on air with you guys right now because I can do that I thought I fixed it the other day but I maybe I copy and pasted over from a different show that had the Old Link but that should be fixed if everybody refreshes now and I where did I put the Discord Link in here up above there it is here's one that works  thanks man good looking out I want to make sure I have the right one in there in case anybody wants to pop in and and join our Sports eat those Discord  let's see here thoughts on cat honest to goodness I haven't even looked to see what he's ranked so far number 60 he's number 60 shooting 37% that's the number that's going to come up actually otherwise I like a lot of what I have seen about cats so far this year I don't know that people even realize he's down that low if they do he's a by low if not it's you know write it out  he's Walker Kessler a holding a points League yes  dream on Greener Xavier Tillman Draymond  is Chris Paul a streamer now that dream on his back nah man it's gonna take some time for them to sort of work out the chemistry I know Paul wasn't as good yes yesterday but you can't move on after one after one of those bad boys yaakov says Chris Haynes reported that Middleton would be on a limit for six to seven games as a change how you feel Vittle Middleton even if he sits back to back everyone in the league does anyway I don't think everyone in the league sits back-to-backs actually think the league is going to be pushing their guys to try to play a little bit more this year and look last year we got weird reports on Middleton all season long so no not really I just like I said if I can get it for two pennies I'll do it I'm not gonna say no to a really good deal  that would be against  my heart but I'm not going in paying much for Middleton because I do think he's lost a step I do think he's slower than he used to be I do think he's gonna be back seeded to yahana and Dame and I think you're looking at a guy who  when things go right for him he is not top 40 anymore but he's more like top 70  oh boy I'm running out of steam here let's see here  what do we got here Dylan says just please don't pay wall the shows yeah I don't plan on ever pay well and fantasy NBA today  Dan do you happen to know if a player who is out but in your starting lineup counts towards your game caps and Yahoo leak so it's a good question they do not they do not so you do not get penalized the only way you get penalized if they actually check into the ballgame  let's see what do we got here a lot of people telling me to feel better so thank you I appreciate all that Brandon Ingram or Julius Randle I don't care  Randall's gonna play more games so probably Randall  what are your thoughts on as our Thompson I think he's amazing it's art Thompson I've been really impressed with him he is going to have sort of the rookie growing pain stuff it's why he's only ranked number 91 because he's shooting 39% from the field 75% at the free throw line and two and a half turn over as well not even really being a primary ball-handler but 10 points 10 rebounds four assists 2.8 defensive stats like  the outlines of a truly impressive Fantasy game where there and I would buy on him if given the opportunity  and  I think that may be what I have to do today  oh here we go here's a quick one  foot or Jamal Murray  that's fair that's fair that's fair trade I was fading nuggets regulars this regular season because I thought they'd be in kind of a does the regular season really matter posture  and they came out and won a bunch of ball games right out of the Chute although you know you might even argue that they've been a little bit they've been coasting wow winning mostly so maybe a slight lean to vooch here but I think both of these guys you know Jamal Murray will probably end up in the 45 range which will probably end up in the 440 to 45 range maybe gets as high as 35 so totally fair trade  and should I aim for okongo on the waiver wire absolutely make sure he is on a roster stop letting go Kung Fu float around everybody seems surprised by what's happening so far and it's exactly what happens every time that both he and capella are healthy at the same time so just enjoy the ride it gets better all the time and he had a big ball game yesterday and now I go to try to rest my voice thanks everybody for hanging out with us I'm basically Whispering here by the end of the show please like rate subscribe we got the Discord links everywhere if you want to hang out there hit me up on
