welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  double checking to make sure I actually turned the music off today I think I did  good for me  looking at myself in a camera I feel like this hat sits a little high on the old Dome rule but  doesn't matter I got a fun shirt on today it's Tech Mobile day here in the best Bruce household what does that mean well just means I put on the shirt that says Tecmo Bowl otherwise it means  we've got a Wednesday to recap here on fantasy NBA today I am Dan best Bristol thanks so much for watching listening subscribing and liking however you take in this content and if you're feeling so inclined if you feel moved  the spirit of fantasy sports moves you to drop a five-star review on the traditional pod channels thank you to everybody that's made this just an unbelievable start to a season the run-up part of the Year September October the growth of the podcast the growth of YouTube the growth of sports ethos has all been pretty damn cool  one thing that I have not been doing a good job of over the last couple of days on this show is starting with the news it's sort of slipping into the show as we talked about upcoming games or games that just started so I want to change the format just a little bit today to talk breaking news first  if there's anything breaking so stuff that kind of pops up like first thing in the morning here then we'll get into the recap of last night then we'll do a little bit of a quick preview of what's coming up this evening and if there's any time we'll hit a few questions from the chat room  as you guys have probably noticed I don't have quite as much time to hit all of the questions so if you're here you're watching you want to throw one in there make sure you do so on the early end because I will likely go through them chronologically  which means the folks that post your question part way through the show they just might not get answered okay all that said we'll do some promo in the middle of the show right now I just want to jump in we gotta report this morning from Sean's that boy on bug zdanowicz is day to day could be back as soon as tonight actually I think the Pistons have another ball game here so you might get his debut it's not going to be a full complement of minutes right out of the Chute so don't expect him to explode on night one but check your league he's only rostered about 60% of Yahoo leaks which means that you may be in one where he's not and if he's not you should stash at this point specially when he's this damn close assuming there's a week week and a half two weeks something like that ramp up to get his legs underneath them and so forth understanding that along the way you might have a couple of decent ball games but the Pistons of lost a franchise record is it 15 now games in a row they haven't won a game in the month of November  they've got the Knicks whistle and getting any easier  they're going to have to change something  and watching that game I haven't watched that many pistons Games Live I'll be on with you guys because most of the time I have a pretty good feel for what's going on out there it's just like not much is changing with Detroit but this is an opportunity for kind of a Delta for them something's changing  so one you should watch it but two if you have it you should watch the Pistons because they're very bad offensively they have issues defensively it's just a mess all the way around so like you get a veteran that can score back in the mix they're probably gonna play him that's my thought like what could it possibly hurt they simply could not be any worse than they are right now so if you're thinking will he get minutes the answer is probably because they're awful  all right let's let's dive in let's talk a little bit about what happened yesterday speaking of like Lakers Pistons they were the worst first game on the docket last night DeAngelo Russell went nuts there's  by the way the stat popped up last night on d low this is the first time a Lakers guard has scored 35 points on 17 shots or less since  Kobe Bryant  which doesn't eliminate that many like legitimately good players because since then guards have mostly been kind of filling in around LeBron  but still kind of a fun little stat and when Dilo gets hot he gets so hot not cold I mean Kobe was but like that next level hot when he really got cooking  but there is something exciting about watching a player in the NBA that that gets on these heaters in the middle of a ball game like the heat check guys where they start just taking like idiotic shots that have no business going in and they're going in and D-Low is one of those guys and it's why he actually ended up and talking we know we talked many times about that Utah Minnesota Lakers trade last year it's why everybody got happy at the end of that one Lakers got Dlow because they needed somebody that could just get hot around LeBron Minnesota got Conley who's the veteran boat steering type there's been a lot of really cool stories about Mike Conley's leadership in Minnesota over the last week you should go seek those out if you haven't  and this is a good reason why and with this gigantic ball game D'Angelo Russell pushed himself back up inside the top 65 on the year I think he's number 62 in nine cat he's played in all 19 of the Lakers games which actually makes him number 30 by totals believe it or not some of that's because the Lakers played a game or two more than some of the other teams but a lot of that because he hasn't missed a game yet as Dan knocks on his desk 17 and a half points six and a half assists I said it right after the first like two or three games of the year  you know he wasn't somebody always targeting in drafts but he just kept falling outside the top 100 so I ended up with him in a couple of spots and I couldn't be more pleased  but this is not a d low show because nothing really changed there and frankly nothing really changed with the Lakers because this is a blowout so you got blowout minutes for guys like Christian Wood who put up some numbers late ignore cam reddish came back played Off the Bench as he gets sort of revved back up again he might be a steals Guy  if there are a few more games before say really hachimura gets back we know Jarred Vanderbilt is starting to get closer but they'll bring him along kind of slowly so there might be a window for reddish to be a steals stream but that'd be about as far as I go with any Laker stuff Pistons are a disaster uh they took a ton of three pointers yesterday because that's basically what the Lakers were daring them to do pistons are a bad 3-point shooting team and not surprisingly it's a strategy that kind of worked because Detroit shot 401% for the ball game doesn't put them in a great position to go get rebounds and the Lakers won a rebounding Battle For the First Time In God knows how long  and nobody was good for the Piston's Jaden Ivy fouled out in 19 minutes D-Lo just worked him Jalen Duren got eaten alive by Anthony Davis  and they work in a push him late in the ball game because he's dealing with ankle stuff sort of systemically  and so yeah nobody with a good game for Detroit and  I feel like we need to go a tiny bit deeper on the Pistons now with boy and bogdanovich coming back it's it shakes things up a little bit but the main point here is that well first of all let's start with the guys you're holding obviously you're holding Cade Cunningham you're holding Jalen Duren you're holding us our Thompson who I did have on my cell board yesterday because I still felt like he was gonna go farther down before he rebounded back up again and this game was a shining example of where that could go although you know he did fine at least in field goal percent it just to me felt like his defensive stats and rebounds were gonna continue to go the wrong way some of it in this game was because he only played 21 minutes blowout city like no reason to extend your young guys  however if Thompson continues to Trend down this hard he'll actually very quickly move back onto the buy board something to keep in mind  so those are your three guys and then add boy onto the list that you're like okay I think I'm okay with these dudes but then these other dudes are bouncing on and off of roster I think Jaden Ivey's a guy you're going to hold on to a little bit longer just to see how this thing plays out  it's not clear who goes to the bench with boy on coming back probably nobody when he makes his debut but after what two or three games is it going to be Isaiah Stewart that hits the pine is gonna be Ivy and slide in Cunningham back down to point guard we don't actually know  so you can hang on to Ivy for now but I'll say this I don't think the nine cat upside is all that great for Jaden  turnovers free throws field goal like there's gonna be a lot of stuff where he's gonna have to overcome to hit value and  when the team is this bad and when you're not the primary guy it's pretty hard to overcome that so I don't know that you need to hang on to him in any format I try to it had to head just to see how it goes but Roto you can probably look somewhere else  Wizards God blowing out again once again Kyle kuzma was the only whizzle played over 30 minutes he was the only whiz who played over 28 minutes in this ball game Deni avdija had some pain in his arm says he's fine we'll see for their next ball game but at least he did play well leading up to it and after he went through kind of a little bit of a dip warm start to the year then a mini dip now he's back inside the top 100 after this ball game  Jordan Poole was a little bit better  I mean you'll take it this is I mean absolutely a game you take Daniel Gafford only got two shots off in 26 minutes that's unfortunate but he did still make both of them and somehow salvaged his game with you know perfect shooting and three defensive stats he's a hold tyus Jones I have to put on as a hold that's my wife calling me right in the middle of a podcast so I think we may actually have to pause the show for just a second you guys enjoy the music while I find out if everything's okay  okay everything's fine I didn't even bother to turn the music on that went quickly sorry guys  family stuff you know it's reality I thought I had a window here so tyus Jones is where we were taught and  I totally understand the frustration I am also frustrated I thought he was gonna have a much better year but he's not getting normal minutes ever  so ever I guess is not entirely accurate because basically every time he has gotten normal minutes he's put up a nice fantasy line see you know three or four and five games ago  Wizards have competitive games against Milwaukee and Charlotte in those  and Tyson good ballgame games scored 18 points with three assists to rebounds in the other one he had 13 and 7 with a couple of steals in the game after that oh excuse me I actually looked at the wrong ball game that he had a 22/7 game with a steal  like we've seen it every time he gets to 29 minutes he puts up a good fan is he line it's just that too many of these damn games are decided super early he doesn't clear 26 and then there's just sort of not quite enough there so what the hell do we do  I think you got a hold  because we've seen it a thousand times when he gets starters minutes he's good fantasy player  and it just aren't that many guys on the waiver wire where you can say oh yeah like he's he could be a good  and on top of that how many of the guys you picking up on the wire are the starting point guard or is the starting point guard for an NBA team  very very few this is a starter who if is crapping team could just play a game that's within 10 points in the final five minutes he'd get 29 minutes and he'd put up a good line  the problem is that we are now I don't know how many freaking games deep for the wizards but that's only happened let's see how many games of the Wizards plays that were actually competitive in the fourth quarter one  two three  four  five six  seven eight  is that it ate  ate out of what 18 is that what we're out right now  absurd  but it should also be pain like very strong reminder  that you know this team is running on like less than 50% competitive basketball games which is very unusual even for a bad team usually they kind of hang in there a little bit  I cannot imagine that this team plays more than 50% blowouts  I cannot imagine that over the course of an entire year they play more than 50% blowouts that seems nuts  could it happen yes but the odds still seems somewhat low which means that at some point here they're gonna play for five six out of seven games something like that that are a little bit more competitive and then Ty's Jones he's like a top 60 guy when he gets starters minutes  it's just happening 45% of the time  the rest of the time he's getting bench player minutes and he's like a top one 50 guy in those  how do we reconcile that you kind of have to hold on  kuzma you guys know my take on Coos I still think he's probably a cell hi guy he fell like 20 slots with this game yesterday simply because like he didn't shoot the ball well or get defensive stats it just he's got a score a bunch and he's gonna have a ton of usage but he's another guy where you can see the bottom kind of fall out a little bit so try to get somebody inside the top 60 for coups if you can because it's gonna be hectic and the Wizards being this bad kuzma and Jones sadly and pool and gaffer everybody else all these guys are risks to take days off going forward  I think we can move a little bit faster on most of the other teams from yesterday but I fell like the Wizards needed a little more discussion Franz Wagner has been on a heater I've talked down on him a few times but he's been great lately I think he's rolling top 40 the last week or two and that's pushed him up inside the top 70 on the year he's taking more control of the team that I expected honestly I thought that he was going to maintain kind of the same job as last year but they're a lot of games where he's just like yeah my team right now  now playing against the Wizards helps everybody  but you know hang on run that out  Cole Anthony is on a heater for the freaking ages  he still not inside the top 130 on the year but over the last week he's a top 25 guy is this Gonna Last Forever no it's not he's out there and he is just like mad firing but enjoy it it's okay to stream a guy who's super duper hot just understanding that it's probably not arrest of season thing and that's okay and if markelle fultz over resurfaces that everything gets shifted oh someone was asking me like two days ago if they should drop Jaylen Suggs know he's number 64 he's one of the best steals guys in the NBA this year and it's not a fluke he's freaking everywhere  also Goga but today  top 100 110 center stream these days that's actually probably good enough in a lot of formats so feel free to drop them in there if you continue to need kind of a center with limited potential  that's okay he's only 31% rosters  so folks generally don't feel like they needed but you could  Devin Booker turned in ankle about halfway through this ball game he was in the middle of having a very bad game anyway but the ankle was not the reason for that it was certainly the reason that he couldn't get anything going late in this ball game but  this is like like  it's it's not a Victory lap people  Booker fell the number 10 13 excuse me from number seven in one day  and unfortunately that's what happens if you're at the top of the board and you don't have even a good game this is a very very bad one bad shooting like no peripheral stats but we kind of knew something like this was coming not this bad I didn't think this was gonna happen  we just do that a lot of the stuff he was doing was not full-time sustainable and then on top of that like  there was just no way he was going to take 22 shots a game of the team ever got healthy  I still think you can sell high after this ball game and if he's dealing with now an ankle injury this may be not the time to do it but that's why he was on my cell board yesterday  if Booker Mrs time we get more Kevin Durant versus the universe kind of ball game and you know if you got KD and a bunch of spots which I do and all that upset about it  I end up with a lot of Kevin Durant's this year  we're like oh no he's always Gonna Miss time yes stuff isn't really like the nagging injury type he's just got to dodge that one weird one every year  if Booker misses a game you can probably stream Eric Gordon by the way just to flip that out into the mix I don't know if you want to get out in front of that and pick up Eric Gordon this is droppable Guys these days but feel free  Scotty Barnes got going late ogno was a little bit better in this ball game I might still like to see him a bit more involved on offense I mean precious to chew it took as many shots as OG did in this game but at least in Adobe had three steals so it's a step in the right direction still think he's a Buy Low still think OG finds his way into the 60s as the year goes so if you can buy for something you know one and a half two rounds back of that that would be the way to do it  no other particularly strong thoughts on the Raptors after that ball game Memphis beat used to Utah 10591 Walker Kessler 9 and 8 with 6 blocks in 28 bench minutes he's back baby you're good to go there  Larry marketing would probably be useful for this Jazz team right now because some other funky is starting and he did for three pointers in this game but that's sort of a big who cares  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up missing the game winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it luckily you can avoid

z l y.com today must be 20 one plus not available in all locations people were asking me what they should do with Omar Yurts event that was very surprising nothing he's a he should be best left alone  and then we probably need to go into a little more detail on keyonte George Who  look as far as the Roto side goes he was more of a kind of luxury stash to see how this thing panned out because it looked like maybe he was gonna get a bunch of assists  you know it hurts him when marking it is not in there because he doesn't have one of his best options to pass to but also he's still a very young guy so I think if you're if you're trying to figure out what to do with George after another bad ball game  you're head-to-head side you're probably sitting on him see where this thing develops Roto I think you could probably go find something better  individual game hot streamers things of that nature and I'm totally fine with that  Memphis hey JJJ finally had a better ball game came up with six blocks that's a nice little boost for him he jumped about 12 ranks Lots with one decent ball game yesterday he's up to 2.4 defensive stats now combined still needs to get that field goal percent up from 41 but you know what we'll take the good where we can get it  the bigger stories on the Memphis side is that they rotated their starting lineup to get David Roddy and Derek Rose in there  and Derek Rose in particular was extraordinarily effective he was a plus 20 in this game David Roddy had a bunch of three pointers but doesn't really do much else and she kind of look at his numbers like well what happens if he doesn't shoot 7 out of 11 from the field and the answer is not a particularly juicy fantasy line I don't know that you have to race out and grab any of these guys also bismack biyombo continued to start at Center Santi aldama moved to the bench still ended up doing a decent amount so I'm not dropping all dhamma yet I think I would consider Derrick Rose  as a pickup with the very obvious caveat that  he's not going to his body's not gonna be able to withstand whatever punishment a starting job is going to do  like this is a guy who can play 18 20 minutes of ball game Max for a couple of weeks and then he needs time off so enjoy it but I think even the Grizzlies know that this is not a long term solution he cannot possibly log 25 26 27 minutes at night  if you want to run him out there tomorrow they've got a back-to-back he's probably sit one of those on his way we don't know which of the haves he's going to play but if you want to run him out there for whichever one he's in have added just know that you know this is more of like a rodeo spot play as a post to head to head because he's not gonna play every ball game and the day you need the most he's probably gonna be hurt  best movie here probably see what they all happens in the next ball game but if you really if you're feeling trigger happy and you want to go do something you probably play Derek Rose and whichever of those two had to hit or whichever those two back-to-back games he's actually upright for Philly was without Joel embiid I unfortunately was out of the house when that news came down so I didn't get a chance to pick up Paul Reed who didn't do all that much so I guess I feel less terrible about it but still reads a guy that you want to play when and beats sits the good will outweigh the bad in those situations Nic Batum got hurt mid ball game I think it was hand what finger sorry the screen tells me it's finger  yeah I don't know if he's gonna miss another ball game he's Nick Batum he's old as hell which means you could probably pick up Rob Covington and just try to sort of stay in front of that thing Kelly oubre could also resurfaced here and then not too distant future  so whatever you're doing here understand it's not for a particularly long time but generally if you can squeeze a starter's minutes game out of robbing to you do want to do it  that's the only reason I bring it up is that when he gets  25 or more minutes he can put up a seriously well-rounded fantasy line  as you saw last night for three is a steal some rebounds you got to go back like two weeks in the last time he played normal starters minute and that one he had 16 points no threes oddly enough a couple of steals six rebounds he gets steals he gets blocks all that kind of stuff  but even if he starts there's no guarantee he gets more than 21 minutes so understand that the floor could be kind of not the prettiest thing in the universe  but he should be pretty available he's only 6% roster  across fantasy leaks so he's gonna be available a lot of them and what Philly plays yeah they played tomorrow in Boston they'll probably need him to play some defense  just make sure you don't start him if Nic Batum is back or Kelly oubre's back all of those things would blow up a robbing to situation so you got Eric Gordon and he got robbed Covington right now if you guys wanted to sort of  step in front of it or Derek Rose a lot of interesting will they won't they guys that we won't have more information on for a little bit  CJ McCollum what a fun little tidbit he came back after only three and change weeks from a partially compressed lung which I realized Probably sounds horrifying it's actually when air gets into the space around the long and creates pressure externally that deflates the lung it is scary but it's not typically life threatening if they can sort of catch it and you know guys are getting nailed in the ribs then these are things that they can usually find so CJ seems to be fine he played 28 minutes where he was gonna be on minutes cap but  it's pretty high one your first game back  all streamers are done so for New Orleans who by the way they're gonna get a lot better now with CJ back herb Jones is in one of those lulls you this was gonna happen after the insane starting to the year he's fine hold even if he falls off a bit which we all knew he was going to and we talked about relentlessly on the show he wasn't gonna be a second round pick all year but now he's gonna go through a slow spell the field goal percent is going to come back to earth the blocks are going to come back to earth he's gonna dip back down but he still right now at least while Trey Murphy's out seems to profile as a guy that sits inside the top 100 and that's a starboard guy even if it's a pretty big drop back from where he was  what happens when Trey Murphy comes back I don't know we'll deal with that we'll cross that bridge when we get there  Freddie Van Fleet missed this ball game for Houston hopefully it's a short-term thing Aaron holiday got the start and didn't factor into the fantasy equation at all so basically move on  no news for Houston Denver had some news Jamal Murray came back played 22 minutes and kind of tweaked a knee in this ball game it wasn't well reported but shout out to Mark Pereira  so I can make sure I get his name right one of our longtime listeners longtime Twitter followers who was actually at the ballgame  I think he covers Utah a little bit but he lives up in the mountains there so he was there and he said that at the end of the game Jamal Murray was actually moving pretty gingerly so that's something we should keep an eye on nothing in the reports about it yet but just you know one eye on it  Justin holiday continued to start for Aaron Gordon he actually had a decent ball game here but you're not gonna play just in holiday if unless you're in a relatively deeply and then assuming Jamal Murray is okay Reggie Jackson goes back to being pretty much an afterthought and we can continue final game from last night Clippers caught the kings in a maximum let down mode those of you that watched our recap show yesterday you heard me talk about the fact that this was  the prototypical let down game the Kings had an overtime emotional 20 some odd Point comeback win over the Warriors to clinch a spot in the NBA cup quarterfinals  and then they had to host the Clippers who were coming off getting beat by the Nuggets without Two Three or a little 60% of their starters  and this one just had all the makings of a team that just wasn't gonna have their  full attention and sure enough the Clippers came in hard and got him off to a great start Kauai got cooking and the King's never really recovered from that although it was fun to see the old guys for the Clippers get going and so this isn't it kind of an interesting little moment too James Harden right now is number 34 in nine cat and it doesn't really feel like he's done anything yet  in fact he's averaging under 10 shots of game so far with the Clippers  you can't buy low after this one because our net a big ball game with five threes and five Steals and five for five of the free throw line Yahtzee  and six assists  obviously you're not buying love to this one but there probably will be games where you can buy low again with this team I don't think this is just like the magical fix it all the kings defensively our very up and down they've had some games where they get a crap ton of defense deflections and then other games where they're like nowhere to be found and now the Clippers are on a back-to-back in Golden State so the sort of the Bay Area and adjacent properties back to back they drive down to the Bay are they going to have a lot in their tank for this one I don't know are they gonna play their guys all of them for this one and another back-to-back because you know Kawaii played in the last few but  the last back-to-back was only a week ago  did he have time to recover  Warriors defensively will probably be better tonight than the kings were last night  all things to consider still  not complaining Kawhi Leonard's big game pushed him up to number 21 on the year in nine Cat still think we're gonna see his free throw and field goal number Trend upward  and then everything else will just sort of level off and like this is the magic of the top of the board this year why is really not doing anything all that poorly this season it's just that everybody else has been insane  and  I still believe there are a handful of guys in front of kawaii that are just gonna fall back and that will move him up the board  but either way you can't buy low after a giant ball game that's the rule you just have to wait until they cool off a little bit and know you're not picking up Terrence Mann he's been super quiet before this one as far as the king's go dear and fox was the only player on the whole damn team who seemed like he was remotely engaged in this ball Game Malik monk got 28 minutes again if he got 28 minutes every night I'd be kind of excited about him buddy doesn't and my only King's thought is could you possibly Buy Low on Keegan Murray while he's out right now Maybe  meanwhile demon is a bonus is still ranked in the 40s nobody's talking about the fact that sabonis is having kind of a I don't say a down year but he's  he's scoring a little bit less and more than anything is free throws have been an epic mess  you could probably buy law on sabonis if anybody noticed  it doesn't feel like anybody noticed  oh well  all right so that's yesterday mostly the story of last night is the handful of guys you could sort of grab if you thought they were going to get a start in the next one so Eric Gordon Rob Covington Derek Rose ah I'm not as high on David Roddy but David Rotty all so kind of in the mix as we sort of scroll our way back up the board make sure I'm not forgetting anybody and then the Boynton of it stash in assuming that he is back here in the very near future  we have an extremely busy Thursday for the first time in a long time and some of that's because things are about to slide into this sort of in season tournament quieter weird schedule of next week all the teams trying to mash in a bunch of games at the end of this one  but before we get into the Thursday look ahead want to remind everybody take a second to drop some questions in the chat room I will get to those that I can right now there aren't a ton of them which is good but also

from watching a billion rookies over history  calves nothing Charlotte we know lamelo's out for a little bit now I I have to admit I really thought Gordon Hayward was going to do more  I'm giving him a week as I said a couple days ago  other than that  I think you have to think about too much with Charlotte you can roll Brandon Miller because he's been hot lately I don't know you have to but you could  Brooklyn  Camp Thomas I believe is back for this ball game oh hey and oh more hey more breaking news in the middle of the show  oh my God there's breaking news everywhere Anthony Edwards was not present at shoot around so he is doubtful for Minnesota's game holy moly  cam Thomas says he will play tonight  Jesus Trey Murphy could be back as soon as tomorrow  Nic Batum and Kelly oubre were both full participants at Sixers practice holy crap there's a lot of news happening right now okay so quickly on the news before we get back into talking about the Nets because the camp Thomas one is relevant if Trey Murphy's getting close to making his debut make sure he's stashed just to see how that whole thing shakes out if Kelly oubre and Nic Batum were both full participants in practice you don't need to worry about picking up Rob Covington that's definitely off the table now and you definitely don't need to worry about picking up Nic Batum because Uber is gonna be the guy once he gets fully healthy and then if Anthony Edwards is out it will be interesting to see who steps in and takes his job it sounds like Troy Brown Junior in the reporting is gonna be the starter but that really doesn't mean he puts up numbers I'd be more inclined to think that either Nicole Alexander Walker gets enough shots now to be relevant or Kyle Anderson comes in and does a little bit more orchestrating so something along those lines will be a part of it so good news all the way around with a bunch of guys likely coming back and then not great news on the Anthony Edwards front but as far as Brooklyn goes I be worried if I was rolling Spencer Dinwiddie  lately he's been super hot but campus is going to come in there and he's going to take a bunch of the shots away  probably does put a dent into Cam Johnson as well which is a shame because he was just getting super fired up but I'm not worried about these guys I'm not worried about cam Johnson I'm a little worried about didn't witty cam Thomas you could probably give him a game to get his legs underneath him I don't know that you necessarily have to start in this first game back but that's good news certainly on that front Detroit let's see what happens on the boy on front we talked about that for the Knicks let's see if the Josh Hart complaining actually has any lasting impact this game all so screams blow out so we'll see Nick's favored by 14 and a half  yucky  but anyway I just ready to quit Josh Hart and then he had 29 good fantasy minutes in their last ball game  Indiana's sort of a big I don't care these days they look like they're settled back in all though I did get some questions about what to do with Buddy hield after one slightly lower minute game he's a hold as a starter  there's no question on that the heat we need the injury report they're one of the teams where we haven't had any injury news so far today but presumably we'll find out later on if Jimmy Butler is in if he is you got to rethink a lot of your streamers when he and bam we're both playing Duncan Robinson was the guy who was still putting up numbers since Butler went out you saw what much more out of Kyle Lowry and Jaime akez and Josh Richardson who definitely turns into a know if Butler's back  Hawkins and Lowry are babies probably they  you know long-term if that was the lineup and Tyler hero never came back which he will but let's just sort of hypothetically say what if you're on never comes back what would that mean Lowry and Hawkins were in a universe where it's Butler bam and Robinson All In those guys would probably be borderline startable probably a yes but  if he  but again we gotta find out we gotta wait we don't know who's playing yet  Lakers  kind of a tough back-to-back although they did get to rest most of their guys late  we've seen the Lakers have not fared great on the second half of back-to-backs  and honestly it feels like a lot of teams have kind of struggled with the back-to-back and I don't know if the energy is just higher expenditures or whatever  but this profile is an awful matchup for La they got nobody they'll put camera on they'll put him on Shea but like without Jerry Vanderbilt that would have been a guy they would have used without rui they need that strength I have no idea how the Lakers handle this ball game but we'll see we'll see nobody on the streaming side that I would consider Oklahoma City you know I did in one League I grabbed Isaiah Joe just on this idea that I don't know what's gonna happen with Josh giddey but if it feels like he's probably gonna have to take some games off here in the not just the future although I guess maybe the this investigation results in a whole lot of nothing and then maybe he plays through it but I did pick up Isaiah and one or two spots just to feel it out also this all this really does feel like the game where Jalen Williams wakes up for the Thunder I mean really what's Gonna Get You Going other than playing Braun if you want to buy low this may be the time to do it  Hawks I think we know what to do with Jalen Johnson out a while Spurs  I haven't heard anything on Jeremy Sohan in a little bit  be misses a game  and Trey Jones gets to start I think I would think I would play them  the Bucks what do we play another Malik Beasley stream I guess he hasn't cooled off yet  Bobby Portis has been disappointing lately I'm gonna talk too much about Portis I thought he was gonna be better and it seems like he's tapered off even with Jae Crowder out he's more of a head-to-head kind of guy doesn't really fill it up on the roadside so you know do it that as you will  Chicago you've got basically all of the regulars questionable for this game which feels like someone has lit the fuse on the TNT and they're just waiting to see if they need to  kind of wet it and pinch it out  we'll see  if everybody's out you better Jam Kobe white into your lineup probably Patrick Williams too but stay tuned see who's play who's in who's out Caruso's questionable DeRozan's questionable Lavigne's questionable I think vouches the only regular who feels like he's gonna play and I think it's I may be getting I'm not even gonna talk about the contract stuff because I get that wrong but I know they signed him to that three-year deal does that mean that they have to wait to trade him I think it might so perhaps  perhaps that's at play here and then we got a report from Johan vua who covers the Lakers saying that they're not interested in Levine they're actually interested in tomorrow and bringing Caruso back so all these guys are starting to get in the mix and it's just getting worse and worse in Chicago which means it's definitely stash time now because the smoke is getting thicker the Flames are starting to emerge it's getting hotter around the Bulls  Jazz We Believe marketing is still out I believe he was listed out for a couple of ball games I think two games back so you'll probably get a little bit of a repeat of what they've done the last few  they're gonna need a lot of walking here to deal with the Minnesota front court but then we just talked about Anthony Edwards possibly being out so could there be some sort of drop in to use for the Wolves yeah I mean to kill Alexander Walker in a points League probably deserves a look  if Anthony Edwards  and Jaden McDaniels are both out and it seems like they probably are like it feels like he's just gonna have to take three or four more shots don't think  I kind of think it could be wrong maybe that doesn't make him Roto friendly but it feels Head to Head friendly we talked Clippers already Norman Powell was off the radar and then the Warriors  Andrew Wiggins woke up in that last ball game he got aggressive he was attacking folks I don't know we see it again  I again I like I picked him up in one League where he got dropped because I mean I would have dropped him  so I don't blame the team that did I just thought you guys could check your Waiver Wires to see if somebody got impatient there too  so make sure they Warriors wings that are off to terrible starts are on rosters  Chris Paul by the way his injury was listed as a nerve issue and then what would she came out and was like no no it's it's they consider him day to day which  took a big weight off my shoulders because I heard nerve I was like oh God no this is gonna be two months and they're like oh yeah they think he's gonna be back pretty soon so whatever that means maybe it's the kind of crap I got going on in my hip which  old man me and CP3 dude we're only like two years apart so I I'm older I shouldn't say I feel your pain Chris Paul you feel my pain I'm older than you  oh  sad face I'm older than everybody in the NBA now come back you don't Aslam  you were the only one  Abba zabba You My Only Friend um  anyway Chris Paul should be back relatively soon he was a little bit of a sell high with Draymond coming back now you can't do it because he's hurt so it is what it is what it is what it is  so that's what's going on tonight let's do a few questions before we wrap up today's show and I'll try to go in chronological order and it looks like there's about 20 so maybe I could lightning my way through these let's see hey you better be hitting the like button if I'm answering your damn question  I'll be pretty upset if I'm answering your questions and you didn't hit the thumbs up on the show that's not cool man  you could subscribe to that would also be nice neat nice of you  this person's name is hello all right Uncle Leo what do you got which side are you taking Edwards Fox and Clarkson or siakam Turner and Mitchell oh crap in ski dude this is a big team turnover all right so Donovan Mitchell is your best per game guy in that mix  Clarkson is kind of your throwaway guy in that mix because he scores but he's actually killing your team in more categories and he's helping Edwards and fox in my opinion are both guys that are gonna end up somewhere between 20 and 40 siakam I don't know what the hell he ends up being but he better than he's been so far this year see how come it's been outside the top 100 mostly because his percentages are kind of weighing things down but he's averaging 27 and 5 Something's Gonna improve for him my hope is that it's the field goal or steals but  I have them I have more than him improving than say Jordan Clarkson Myles Turner he's in the 30s Donovan Mitchell is up at the top yeah give me the give me the down of Mitchell side  I like Edwards and fox but I think Donovan Mitchell and Myles Turner are at least equal to those guys and then The Optimist way better than Clarkson  it's Funko grab no no no no he's not  points League I traded Bane Grant and Jared Allen for JB Jaylen Brown Jaylen Duran and Ogden and Obey and Draymond Green Oh man oh wow we're doing all the giant trades this morning aren't we um yeah you got depth but I think I'm I think I prefer getting the three I think I prefer getting the three guys because Jared Allen could still improve over his numbers as well  Desmond Bane may be comes down a tiny bit obviously with with jaw Jalen Duren got that hot start OG could work his way up the board a little I think I might still prefer the first side but it's not like it's super lopsided here what's your take on Bulls players in this busy week besides Levine and DeRozan is okay to play vooch in a weekly head-to-head or sit yeah I think I play boots we haven't really heard about anything about him taking games off so I play vooch you play Kobe white because all these guys taking games off he'll do a bunch I don't know that I'd go as far as playing Patrick Williams but he's not totally off the board  10 team right I need to drop a player to for Trey Murphy who should I drop Austin Reeves Zack Collins John Collins or Jabari Smith  probably Zach Collins unfortunately I like what he's done from sort of an across the board production Style  buddy he's outside the top 100 because he hasn't been awesome in any one thing  John Collins would be probably the next one on that board because he's not all that far in front but he's a little bit in front and he doesn't hurt you in as many things as that Collins has I also don't know that Trey Murphy is gonna be a 10 team her  because with the palace healthy there's not a lot of wiggle room that he had last year  can you recommend an elaborate a bit on streamers for the amazing New Orleans Friday Saturday Monday the problem is that New Orleans doesn't really have any streamers now that CJ mccollum's back  sorry guys specially if Trey Murphy pops up  it kind of screwed there  sorry  who do I drop I'm as or Duncan Robinson probably hot as  rest of season question what are your thoughts on players on tanking teams versus players on contending teams guys like Jalen Duren Mark Williams Victor weapon Yamaha how does losing so much affect these guys if at all well my hope is that you guys are playing road with a game's caps so if they sit out the last two weeks it's not that big of a deal or you're playing in a head-to-head League where you're playoffs are over before the final two or three weeks so it also wouldn't be that big of a deal that is my hope if you are stuck however in a league where the commissioner or Yahoo public refuses to end it soon enough on the head to head side or impose A Game's cap on the Roadhouse side  yeah you probably need to be a tiny bit concerned but one of the good notes is it's not like Jalen Burns a veteran that needs to take the end of the season off neither is Mark Williams and certainly not Victor weapon Yama I think I'd be more worried that these guys just get miscellaneous days off in the middle of the year and they'll add up a little bit but overall it's not really something you can do about it so ride it out  here's another oh it's the same question again  someone says his backup is better I'm not actually sure who that's in relation to  to some question that was up above but I'm not really sure  unless it's about me is my backup better I don't have a backup who does this show when I'm not here  I should get it back up  John Collins sighed or Brogden and see yakim wait oh John Collins and Brockton or C Occam  you probably go past and hope that he turns it around  how do we evaluate Max Drew's as of now isn't top 35 Rim just too much yeah he's not a top 30 Five Guy Max Drew's number 57 per game in nine cat  I don't know that he stays inside the top 60 I've been really excited about what he's done so far this year he sure feels like a full season dude but yeah no not no not top 35 I love Max trees but that's too high it's keonte Georgia 1 0  in fact I don't know that he gets inside the top 100  on a consistent basis in any format but if he does it'll be real close to the end of the year and the only way you could consider holding him that whole time as if it's head to head and like you just need his stats but Rhode Island like I don't I don't think I can sit on him for long enough for it to matter  boy on or Trey Murphy yeah you know the funny thing is they might not be all that dissimilar Trey Murphy's gonna be better defensively  boy on is gonna probably score more I think I'd rather have Bogdan of itch  because last year we saw a tree Murphy get loose but Brandon Ingram was out and Zion was out and  CJ missed some time  I just I don't have the same high hopes for Trey this year especially not everybody's back I thought maybe he'd beat McCallum back and have a little wiggle room but like  they've got a really good starting five he's likely going to be the bench Gunner and so how much is there is a reasonable question I'm hoping there's enough because I haven't in my eye on a couple of Yahoo Publix where you have three I also slots but I honestly don't know and I'd rather probably have boy on mostly based on the fact that the Pistons are terrible  they need him and the pills are currently healthy  would you rather have Steph Curry or deer and fox Steph  what's the board in the back for hey dude so you must be relatively new and this is fun I like to tell this story once every month or something this board behind me and you can see the FJ fantasy logo in the corner they were kind enough and you can also see the year right over here it says live industry mock draft 2020 hosted by Dan Vespers that's me  you guys might remember 2020 was a very unpopular year for being alive because it was a pandemic and so the NBA season ended restarted we had a bubble the playoffs ended in like October November and then the season started again seven weeks later um  so I thought it'd be fun because everybody was doing everything on Zoom to do our my annual industry nine cat mock draft on Zoom with all the other industry guys because what the hell are we all doing we're all sitting at home with our kids screaming in the Next Room screw it anyway the guys from FJ fantasy were kind of they do these big boards if you ever want to buy one and have a you know a draft party they're very cool guys over there at a Cleveland I think somewhere in Ohio they were on the zoom call and as the industry folks were making the picks behind me they were slamming stickers on the board they were in one of the windows it was kind of hard to see you know it was all put together kind of last minute by me you guys know I'm someone low Tech when it comes to the video side but when it ended I realized that they had this board sitting in their warehouse of all of our picks and I was like look how much like how much of that cost to ship it to LA and they were like 30 40 bucks I was like here take my 30 bucks but they might have even done it on the house I don't remember they're very nice guys and they send it to me and at the moment I was like well this is a fun  toy to have a nice member nice Keepsake from a terrible year  and then I realized that my bed frame which is right on the other side of this has a slot down below right here and I jammed them into it and that's how I do my show every day this big draft board behind me blocks a very messy bedroom two bedroom two bath apartment in West Los Angeles  because things are very expensive in La I don't know if you guys know that Los Angeles is kind of pricey we can't afford to go somewhere bigger the kids bedroom that they share was my office seven years ago it's not anymore and it never be again my office became the corner of this room I don't know if you guys remember when I used to do shows with bruske  the background was just my bed  like that I don't know a place to do the show  there were people in fantasy League's that were renaming their teams Dan best versus unmade bed  it was absolutely hilarious but then I realized like if we're gonna put this stuff on YouTube I can't do I need a background of some kind  well I  there's your story  I got offered Mark Williams and DeMar DeRozan for Walker Kessler and Ogden and Obby should I do it it's pretty fair I think Kessler is a little better than Mark Williams I think DeRozan's a little better than OG  pretty fair trade  is Trey Murphy a better stash than Ben Simmons yes because Trevor he's probably back this week and Ben Simmons is I don't want to be the most pessimistic person on Earth but I don't know that he's playing against this year and if he does it's probably like last year we played three games and then realizes it's not better  who has the best upside in a 10 team points league so really just a points League cam Johnson miles bridges are boy and bug notovitch  unfortunately it's miles Bridges and then Cam and then boy on  nine cat 9 cat Roto games cap who to drop to activate Jalen Williams County George or Santi aldama probably all dhamma  really you could go either way I'm not sure either of those guys as a is a nine cat Roto right now  who's your better streamer for tonight  white is that Kobe white or Kyle Lowry well if everybody on the Bulls is out it's Kobe white but if a lot of the Bulls are back that it's that it's Lowry  is it time to trade we  hmm  well so it depends a lot on what you could get for him I'm I think the answer is probably no because number 32 on unless you could get like  someone inside the top 25 I don't think I would do it  should I trade for Singas or JJ for demonic sabonis um  sure either one of those is fine actually in my eyes I'm good are we expecting Lowry marketing back soon hammy stuff it can linger a little bit he got ruled out for two games at a time I think he's gonna get reevaluated this weekend  I'm expecting back next week  you got the two game week though so it's possible they might just be like that what does it hurt us to rest him for one more so maybe  maybe set your mind to like December 13th and if he comes back sooner call call it lucky  which side is better in a points League Trey young Cam Johnson Walker Kessler or Kyrie bogie and Jaylen Duran  it's probably the first one  row do you think it's too much if I offer Paul George Darius Garland and Jamal Murray for Nicola yokich uh-huh yeah I mean unfortunately that probably just blows too many holes in your team technically on just like sheer value that's fine but I don't know that you can afford to give away your like second third and fourth round picks for a first it might be too much to replace technically it's fair but I don't know  uh should I look to trade anyone here's my roster this one's kind of tough Jazz um  let's see Curry Booker Kyrie Levine Beale LeBron Butler Olynyk wow you got a lot of top dudes on that one Wagner cam Thomas Kobe White Manual quickly Harrison Barnes top-loaded I think LeBron was a guy I had on my cell list I think he's a guy that Trends down he's you know basically like a career low in usage right now but his stuff is being floated by exorbitant field goal percent and very high Steals and blocks I think some of that stuff comes for Bronx if you can get it top 25 guy for Braun that's probably the guy I try to move on your team  I thought you were a Dodger fan Dan what's with the Kansas City Royals hat my kid was on the Royals that was a little league team  so I'm gonna every time his season's end I get to rotate a new hat onto my wall oh hats which is up here there's not that many of them  MJ or LeBron  oh we're not talking fantasy right now  um  I mean it probably has to be Jordan although what LeBron is currently doing is maybe the most impressive thing I've ever done because he's almost as old as me and  you know I need Tylenol to deal with a sinus headache most of the time and LeBron is doing this  so who  who who's gonna have the most impressive overall career it's probably LeBron but who is the greatest single player or who had like the greatest single seasons and greatest single run that's got to be MJ  because what he did for the in his prime  is Untouchable he just beat everyone constantly  there was no hole in his armor ever that's crazy  and LeBron for as unbelievable as he is like  they are times when people beat him  but his overall body of work it probably puts LeBron in front like because how do you not look at the whole thing MJ retired twice LeBron didn't  that's the difference  what's the cutoff for 10 team for you top 100 top 90  yeah probably 90  cool show thanks bud  found out what he basketball was five weeks ago completely new now five and oh and people complain that I stream too much what to tell them legalized six to seven add drops depending on weekly you tell him stream 2 you jerks it's not your fault they allow six to seven moves a week you're doing it right  they should be listening to my pod  Jalen Johnson or Chris Paul well  depends on your team I mean if you can withstand a four week Jalen Johnson absence then it's Jalen Johnson if you can't it's Chris Paul  because it sounds like he's back pretty soon  um let's see here you guys the questions came rolling in late you guys are now posting questions as I answer them  who is the ad between bogdanovich and Trey Murphy points League yeah I'll go boy on  what should I expect for us our Thompson I think he probably bought him out outside the top 100 and then comes rebounding back so this is a cell moment and then when he bought him out it's a buy back if that makes any sense  are you worried at all about Trey Murphy's well due to Jordan Hawkins know I'm worried about his role because everybody else's healthy  and you think keyonte George is gonna be top 100 no  not soon at least  is John Collins in nine cat Rodeo Games cap guy yeah he's probably around top 100 I'll say yes  was offered Dame for Booker in a points League should I go for it yeah I think I'd go Dame I don't think it's that far apart but I think I'd go game thanks for the daily content brother shout out FJ fantasy sports yeah  I've been getting the the draft board for the last three years and never going back there you go so he knows FJ  is Shay overtaking yogic as the number one player this year maybe I actually thought Joel embiid had a chance to overtake him this year and he does Joel's right behind you right now  but she is way out in front I don't know that it's two and a half steals per game last all season  but she's been ridiculous  it's possible  this is sort of the post championship year  what will be heroes possible ceiling when he gets back from injury he's at his ceiling right now by the way tell her was number 42 before he went down there and Away getting higher than that steel is probably come down percentage is probably level off a little bit I think ceiling is probably 50 to 60 range for hero although again right now  Scotty Barnes for Larry and is that fair yeah either side's cool would you trade Scotty Barnes for demonic sabonis and a category League  no I think you can do better right now  can Caruso be top 100 in Roto when the Bulls blow it up kind of depends where he goes if he's part of the guys who go the answer is yes but I have no idea where he ends up we crossed the one-hour Mark we done so oh do you have a favorite player in basketball Dan holy crap so the answer is not really uh playing fantasy sports for this long has made me  kind of not attached to anyone my favorite guys are often the guys who provide me the best value like Brooke Lopez has many times lately been my favorite fantasy player Chris Paul's been my like not the guys that you talked about so unfortunately my love of basketball is strongly influenced by my love of fantasy sports you guys know I'm a Laker fan so I'm gonna generally cheer for the dudes on that team I find Anthony Davis's playoff playoff Anthony Davis is one of the most fun things I've watched in a while like what he did to teams to completely blow up everybody's offensive game plan until they had to deal with yokich was amazing I found that amazing but like day-to-day I don't have a favorite player play too many fantasy sports good question though  all right we out we crossed the one hour mark oh can Chuck has Ken Hawk has hold his fantasy value once they're fully healthy probably not Tyler Heroes the kind of reading step there okay now we're down right like a little try that again Dan rate like subscribe on your way out much appreciated thanks for watching Everybody well back with you tomorrow big weekend review show I know those are a big hit I'll see you guys over on social at Dan best friend's face
