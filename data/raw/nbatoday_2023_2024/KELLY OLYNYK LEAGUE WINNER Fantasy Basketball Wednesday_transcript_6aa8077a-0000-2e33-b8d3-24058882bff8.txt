doesn't have to be in some other radio station well welcome to the welcome to the Kelly Olynyk hour here on fantasy NBA today  we're gonna be talking about Kelly Olynyk and I don't know maybe some other stuff too  doesn't matter we don't need to talk about anything else because all we need to talk about is Kelly Olynyk  yeah so anyway welcome to the Kelly Olynyk our I'm Dan Bass Pro this is

what we're doing on this one this is a two show Wednesday again we're gonna break down yesterday's results give you some ads drops all that good stuff on this episode later on today in fact depending on how time shakes out I might try to do them back to back if not back to back it'll be early in the afternoon like right after my lunch we'll do our schedule analysis show which is gonna be a little bit shorter today because there's not a lot that you want to be looking at but we got a few key things I put him out on social already at Dan besser if you guys want to check that out and have kind of like a little bit of a Prelude to it I would suggest you do it that way you have it kind of written now but we'll do that on the second show today for now however let's start talking about the card because that's frankly the importance stuff or Lando took care of business against Charlotte this game was not as close as the final score would indicate and you can kind of see that from the minute distributions on the Orlando side Orlando is all scheduled streams at this point with the exception basically of Franz Wagner which is fine because they actually had a good schedule starting yesterday but from a you know full season like rest of season standpoint  you're not picking up any of these guys for rest of season it's you know Paulo If you're at a points League Franz if you're in an anything league and then a whole lot of man  Charlotte on the other hand we have some stuff that kind of pivots back and forth Cody Martin has been out for a couple of ball games so if I Celia meets each got another start and a nice performance 215 and 4 with a couple of steals in a three ball  I do wonder if this is the beginning of a more permanent pivot  for the Hornets into mitts the rest of the way  you know I have no proof that that's what it's about to happen because it's not like Cody Martin is a super old guy but  I don't know I feel like maybe at least with me to their still trying to figure out what they have  the issue of course now is for those that are dealing with a schedule situation Charlotte doesn't play today or tomorrow so we're not gonna get any data on this for another couple of days they play Ethan the 9th back to back which is Good Friday Saturday but we won't know more about whether or not Cody Martin's coming back we won't know more about what the actual plan is there on the for and again I'm trying to keep this show geared a bit more towards those that are  not concerned about their schedule that's going to be the second half of our two-parter today so if you're not worried about your schedule I do think he deserves kind of a speculative add where you can just sit on him for two days where nothing has to happen necessarily and then you know if it goes great great if Martin comes back and destroys whatever meets it was doing okay fine we move on at that point because he was playing 15 16 20 minutes in the game's before Cody went down this has been very much a one-to-one michi's the  injury replacement for Cody Martin  but this is the kind of year where a guy goes down for injury and then just doesn't come back that's again I'm not saying that's what's gonna happen here but I do think we need to be at least somewhat  cognizant of the possibility that it could happen  anyway I do think he deserves a speculative Adrien man had a better ball game he's been kind of bad lately but this is basically what I warned you guys about everybody got way out over their skis on Trey man after he got traded and had a bunch of games where he was like rebounding and assisting and stealing and scoring they look like this game frankly seven out of nine shooting obviously tilting the numbers for him but he's come back to earth which has been generally now out just outside the top 100  and that's fine he's startable he's a hold you're not gonna drop him because he's got a really good thing going here and I don't think we see lamelo Ball but that's why I called him a sell high if you guys are wondering  the aggregate  Davos Burton's is kind of like a weird little three points streamer right now I don't think I'm taking that plunge but you know anything's possible these day and age Grant Williams 33 minutes off the bench but Nick Richards is back and played the center spot I think I'm very much into Grant Williams if he gets like a lot of sentiments but if it's only a few I'm not into it Nick Richards we saw the good game's seen the bad games he levels off as kind of a little bit in that sort of doesn't matter group we've talked about  the guys that sit like between 100 and 150 and don't don't really matter  like you could start where you don't start and  who  that's Charlotte so we finally got through our first game of the day Boston blew a big lead in Cleveland is the week for blown leads across the NBA oh no notes on Boston they're the same every day sometimes they just started  take their eyes off the prize Cleveland is a more interesting scenario because they lost Evan Mobley in this game as well to a turned ankle apparently he left the arena on crutches that was the report that surfaced last night after the Ballgame not a great sign for a team that's all ready down Donovan Mitchell and so they're back down two main guys last time it was Garland and Mobley now it's Mitchell and Mobley Kara's little bird did come back  and now we have this new profile so we know Donovan Mitchell's gonna miss a couple of ball games still we can I think safely assume that Mobley is going to miss a couple of ball games if he had to leave the arena on crutches what is that mean for the guys that are left well first things first Dean Wade went nuts in the fourth quarter yesterday he had a perfect fourth and end up with 23 points 8 boards and six three-pointers that ain't gonna happen again in the next ball game  does he start the next game  I'd say there's actually a pretty good probability that weighed starts but typically he doesn't get that kind of usage  even with a bunch of guys out  if you need three-pointers and a couple of rebounds you could stream Dean Wade I'm not that doesn't mean you can't again like you don't have to do exactly what I'm doing I'm just I'm just not  Jared Allen obviously is a go Darius Garland is obviously a go Max druce dealing with a knee strain we don't know how severe that is he's another one that's like well could he pop back up in the next ball game Sam Merrill started forest druise and we know Merrell can get wild from three-point land  so that's again where one kind of hangs in the balance a little bit I think we find out that Spruce is still out you pick up and you start Merrill  and  the calves actually just started a five and seven run yesterday five games in seven Knights so they play again tonight they play on Friday Sunday and Monday they'll a lot of games coming up over a short period of time so we're gonna get opportunities here for individual daily streams we just don't have a report on Spruce yet for today though it you know we don't know it might be coming soon if stresses out you play Merrell tonight and again we're talking about more so on the like not using up a head-to-head roster move kind of thing this is again we'll talk about that on the second show I don't want to get ahead of ourselves we're talking right now about things you're doing basically against the Roto games cap or if weakly moves are not a factor for you so Meryl's ago in my opinion of streus is out okoro is a go regardless there are enough guys out where he can do now enough to be fantasy relevant in this game is fairly well rounded when he actually gets a little bit of usage Carousel vert all so a go with Noble and Mitchell it's just too much usage that's been thrown back into the main Pond where even with these Levert in particular has some severe efficiency issues but I think he can overcome that with volume  so just to recap Garland Jared Allen  Carousel at Isaac a car I think those guys are ghosts regardless of maxus status Dean Wade is three-pointers stream so you got to be like category hunting a little bit there and then Merrill is a go in my opinion if streus is out so that's the calves breakdown hey before we get to Detroit Miami this thing seems to have hit some sort of Twitter algorithm today I don't know what I did differently but I'll try to do it again if you're watching out on social and this is sort of new and fun for you and you stumbled upon me hi first of all please take a second to like the post that brought you here and please take a minute to follow at Danbury d a n b e s b r i s we grow when you guys can tell people that we exist so thank you for whatever you can do in advance I really do appreciate that let's keep chugging  Detroit was able to kind of hang in there with Miami 4020 points and he's been on a little bit of a like a mini run here a ultimately and and you know you guys know your team's better than I do but fontecchio is Fantasy game generally tends to be a little bit limited he'll get you a steal every now and again it steals have been okay and he'll let you some threes with some okay feel free throw percent but he hadn't rebound much he doesn't pass all that much he's actually slightly underrated passer but in this way his role that he's got in Detroit he's not gonna be asked to pass all that much so mostly it's threesome points and free throw percent with like a smattering of steals now if you just go over the last two weeks he's been right on the cusp of startable like around number one ten fifteen points on 33 Pointer's it does kind of feel like he's running warm right now  if you wanted to try it I would not yell at you  I'm probably not going to stream funky against a game's cap I just died I don't have the confidence in it they're down to Grimes right now in Detroit so he's another guy that could take some of those minutes when he comes back so you know short term do you need some threes like at this point I would prefer to go with the Cavaliers 3-point shooters because it just feels like they're gonna bomb away from out there but he'll maybe have a little more upside in free throws or steals but just an overall minutes like Merrill if spruces out we just talked about or weighed with Mobley out those guys are gonna play minutes and they profile somewhat similarly just less willing to Chuck  I'm not into Isaiah Stewart I don't like his nine cat game so Detroit for me is Jalen Duren Kate Cunningham as our Thompson and  that's basically it and for those that are watching for the first time Jade and Ivy is more of a points League guy and that's why I left him out  for the Miami Heat Tyler hero continues to be out Duncan Robinson is your one to one fill in there and then you really don't have to worry about anything else because Cade Lamar and has a high game every now and again but it's not someone you can start every single day right now so it's Butler Robinson bam and Roeser that's it like I gotta worry about him Miami easy  the Atlanta Hawks down one starter took care of the Nicks who are down like four right now and got good numbers from all of the guys and so no no evaluation changes on Atlantic Lincoln's continued to slowly tick up as he works his minutes cap up into the high 20s so you basically have six guys on the Hawks you can start every day right now Jalen Johnson Murray Sadiq Bay DeAndre Hunter Bogdan bogdanovich Clint capela easy  the next a little bit less easy still relatively easy honestly precious chew as minutes were down yesterday and it wasn't like it was foul trouble it was again Tom Thibodeau realizing he needed to get some more offense on the floor so you've seen an uptick in minutes for Boyen book zdanowicz lately  that's been pretty well tied into Jalen Brunson being out  so yes we'll get to do some McBride and just a second boy on his playing more right now because the Nicks can't afford to go  offensive  like look at the guy look at the line of their running out there without bogdanovich presses Chua  no real offense Josh Hart Middle offense Deuce McBride not much offense Dante even chenzo was turned himself into an offensive hero but I mean look at this game 24 Shots the efficiency starting to level off there there's no offense  so they've had to lean into bogdanovich  the report by the way on Jane Lin Brunson just to kind of circle back to that one was somehow pretty good  which is amazing  I'm like it looked like the way he went down it looked like there was no contact I guess maybe there was some slight needed knee but he's being listed as having a sore knee and that's the win of the century that's the winner of the century I mean it's it's it's it's mind-boggling honestly that that  anyway so assuming Brunson is back in the not too distant future where obviously very hopeful of that I would think at that point boy on bogdanovich goes back to much more of a fringy role so I'm not picking him up here he needs a lot of shots and a lot of playing time every night to be a thing  and with Brunson no time table you can't take a chance on that  by the way quick shout out to the chat room for pointing out that Cody Martin was ruled out for more than a week already so if you want to take the plunge on meat stitch in most formats I think that's good enough to say yeah he'll probably have you know a handful of games here Charlotte starts and excellent schedule on Friday so head to head side you probably wait try to make that move on Friday Roto you could do it now and that at least gives you a window to kind of see what this becomes but they go six games in nine nights starting on Friday if you're into that sort of thing  well we were talking about with New York Do's McBride played 45 and a half minutes basically for the second ball game in a row he's played mid 40s and minutes this is a regulation ball game provided his limbs don't fall off you stream McBride with Brunson out Hearts to go divincenzo's ago precious is still a go I'm not into Jericho Sims as I just mentioned I'm not into boyan but zdanowicz even in the short term and then I say a hardenstein is one of the hardest calls to make in fantasy right now  largely because  we just don't know when his minutes cap might shift and he's stuck between 20 and 24 minutes a game right now while he's dealing with his Achilles soreness that's not enough we need him at 25 26 or higher to start him he's a top 100 Guyanese  we saw when he was playing in the low 30s and minutes mid-30s and minutes he was stopped 30 top 40 range  so the problem of course here is that when you have a player with that ridiculous level of upside third fourth round pick kind of stuff you can't just throw him back into the pond but we have this indefinite situation so head to head I think you just got to play him and hope you get something Roto you stick them on your bench and wait for some sort of good news to come out  the Philadelphia 76ers went into even higher like Defcon one of zombie mode now Tyrese Maxey is in concussion protocol so they're down there two most important players show on bead still without a true time table on his return but when one player goes down you know a door closes a window opens and all of that stuff there are plenty of streamables in Philadelphia now that may be weren't there a couple of weeks ago  let's do what we've been doing with some of the other teams and just try to Blitz through this one by one campaign got the start for Maxi he played through an illness and had an okay line  campaign is not a great nine category fantasy player hasn't been ever even when he got some fill-in opportunities last year in Phoenix he'd have one big game and then he'd have some horrible shooting nights and he leveled off outside believe it or not the top 100  if pain continues to start and if his minutes tick up into the high 20s you play him in points  buddy hield as a goal Kelly oubre is obviously a go he took 20 shots yesterday  you go I would I would stay off of the centers now they didn't have to go big in this ball game Bamba played 12 minutes Paul Reed played 19 because Brooklyn is not a particularly large basketball team from just a standard size standpoint there are long team the Nets are and yeah Paul Reed had two pretty good games coming off the bench but with the minutes not secure I think I'd rather treat and bomba as schedule plays and you may have noticed the one well two players that I haven't talked about yet Nick button too old even for me and Kyle Lowry who had been on my two old board which is saying a lot because you guys you guys know me and my love of old players  Kyle Lowry is a start now  because not just because he's playing 30 something minutes because he played 30 something minutes a few times in Miami and didn't really do anything with it the difference of course is that  when you're handicapping fantasy basketball you're looking for two things to come together  well three really we talked about this during the run-up to the season it's kind of like how do you handicap a card how do you handicapping entire league thing one opportunity Thing 2  usage thing three fantasy stat set  now if all three of those things come together you get you know top 50 kind of basketball player  if you can get two of those to come together you typically have a guy you can start in most formats and right now that's what's different for Lowry in my Army he had minutes but he didn't have usage or the fat the stats set at that point because the usage kind of actually impacted the stats at which  maybe I should talk about a fourth thing stats that kind of ties into role on a team so opportunity and role are not the same thing so we're gonna roll stat set and and  team role together I use the word too many times in two different iterations of it  Lowry in Miami his role was to stand there shoot three-pointers give the ball to guys that were younger and better offensively and take charges on defense  Lawry's role in Philadelphia right now with maxi gone  for we don't know how long they called it a mild concussion so hopefully he's back in a week and indeed gone for a while still most likely I would think at least another three weeks maybe more Larry's role is suddenly be involved  you're the point guard and you get to shoot  you get to orchestrate a little bit you get to run some plays you get to gamble on defense go for some steals so all of us and now we're gonna get a little bit more not all the way back to Toronto but you're gonna get a little bit more of the Toronto Lowry and a little bit less of the Miami version because he's also back with Nick nurse who  he's gonna give him a little bit more leeway because there's a trust Bill there  so you saw four three-pointers and five assists in a steal and his last couple of ball games even with maxi around we're pretty good and so yes I can't believe that I'm saying this out loud for the second day in a row Kyle Lowry is an all formats fill in play right now and I know what you're thinking Toronto schedule is not that great you are correct but if you pick them up tomorrow then you at least get two games the rest of this week and for next week  and I think he's still puts up probably usable numbers even when Maxie comes back that won't be the case when embiid is back around but  we got a little while there  if the Anthony Melton happens to show back up again that would also blow up the Kyle Lowry thing but he's out indefinitely as well  uh Brooklyn Brooklyn you lost cam Johnson cam you were finally playing well and now he's out again and I think it's fair that we can probably call Cam Johnson injury prone at this point because this is getting ridiculous but again one one man oh you know door closing window open again for the second time on the show will go into that with Cam Johnson down Lonnie Walker got 30 minutes yes yesterday  Lonnie Walker is not a great nine category fantasy player he's mostly points in Three's a smattering of other stuff but not much as a very traditional what we call a shooting guard Fantasy game which is points threes typically free throw percentage is pretty good once in a blue moon you'll happen upon a steel or an assist but it's usually not enough without a lot of shots to translate into 9 category value that said Brooklyn is in a rare day off during their you know their five and seven game stretch that was hustling along here they have three and four nights starting tomorrow and I'm gonna presume that cam Johnson ain't coming back quickly because he very rarely ever does so if you really wanted to grind out some points in threes and hope that Walker can catch lightning in a bottle you could do that starting tomorrow and head to head Roto I don't think I'd do it  I don't like do I don't like his game that much  I actually like Lonnie Walker I think he's fun to watch I just don't like his Fantasy game that much I should say  so he's now a thing Dennis Schroder is a very much a thing because you said just keeps getting heaped onto him there was a few seasons back  I'm trying to remember what player we were talking about at the time and I struggled to come up with the name but we were talking about I said that one player had a voodoo doll is there any long time listener remember when we used to talk about the voodoo doll it was someone in Sacramento I think because every time one player came back another player went down and the guy who I said had the voodoo doll was just like knocking out one teammate perpetually so he that he always had a starting job mmm  can't remember who it was well Dennis Schroder seems to have a Brooklyn voodoo doll because everybody's just dropping around him like flies out there  like flies I say Ben Simmons who you don't need a voodoo doll to knock him out but cam Thomas is down now cam Johnson is down  Schroder's got plenty to do so he's in all formats go Bridges Dorian Finney Smith is in all formats go again there's just like there's enough playing time and usage where he is gonna get to do enough  it's a glorious thing when a team gets thin down it's unfortunately if you if you lose if your player is the guy that goes down but for everybody else like all right sweet we all get a dozen shots now  delightful  keep one eye on Dennis Smith Jr as well it doesn't seem like he's gonna get enough playing time but you know you never know  ah here's the one we've been waiting for New Orleans at Toronto and you're like dance  dance  game is a 40 Point blowout  damn  why are you getting so excited about this one  well you know why I can't contain my enthusiasm I gotta start on the Toronto side we'll come back to New Orleans don't worry there's one or two things to talk about on the belly side Kelly Olynyk and Gary Trent Jr I feel like I need to whisper his name because I'm so over the top excited so here's the thing and I said it in a tweet I sent out sometimes it's better to be lucky than good  because the Kelly Olynyk thing  for us for me whatever like if you want to call us a group of effort here has been  kind of a running gag at this point  everybody knows how much I love Kelly Olynyk I always talk about him anytime he even has the slightest hint of a chance of putting a fantasy value I'm in on a Linux in even to my own detriment  but  it won us a bunch of League's when he got traded to Houston a few years back  and it just might win us a couple of League's now  we got lucky I'll admit it when he got traded to Toronto I picked him up everywhere and then when it looked like he was only gonna get back up sentiments I dropped him  luckily there were about three or four days in there he was able to clear waves and nobody picked him up before Scotty Barnes went down  and then I added him again  and it still looked like he was going to play backup center minutes and almost nothing else  and then yaakov Pearl dislocated a finger and had surgery on it and is out indefinitely and if you want to talk about voodoo dolls  Team Canada Kelly Olynyk there's there's no stopping him now there no other centers on the roster jontae Porter not I mean okay like technically he plays center  there no other centers on the roster  they basically have no choice and I don't think that it's something they don't want either they just signed him to an extension to your deal so they love him but from just a do we even have the Personnel standpoint no  Linux and I have to play 28 or more minutes if this game's not a blowout he probably plays 30 or more minutes  and Kelly Olynyk in 30 or more minutes in a even like a sub feature role which is basically what he is on this team now he's arguably the best point guard on the team at the center spot we are going to get some truly intense well-rounded lines out of him yesterday this game went about his poorly as any game could have gone for Toronto  Olympic by the way was only a minus 14 in the minutes he was on the floor and a game they lost by 40 so I guess that's a positive 15 points six rebounds seven assists two steals two blocks a three-pointer just for good measure four out of nine shooting which by the way he's been at 50% shooting for a couple of years now and six out of seven at the free throw line and for you 9 category friends myself included one turnover I mean this is the jackpot moment yes we got very lucky that we were squatting on Kelly Olynyk and thinking oh maybe somebody gets out of the way and then everybody got out of the way  Super Lucky  totally willing to admit that  but you know what  sometimes it's better to be lucky than good  by the way I also think Gary Trent belongs on rosters he's getting enough shots which is always the thing for him Scotty Barnes being out is the big deal there just dropping enough usage to quickly and bear it who's an absolute disaster dumpster fire of a nine cat guy but you know those two guys are the only other dudes on the team who are gonna be willing to take shots don't not stop at Jordan Aurora 15 shots Off the Bench you keep one eye on him if you want but he's not going to be a thing but Gary Trent can be a thing and we know from historically when he's taking shots he's a nine cat guy threes steals almost exclusively those two things but generally enough of them so yes Gary Trent also  let's slide back over here so everybody can see what we're working on San Antonio lost at Houston we  seemed to be hurt near halftime but then this kind of funny the Spurs beat folks on Twitter we're tweeting that not only did he come back out for the second half but he sprinted back out for the second half just to make sure everybody knew I'm fine  so thank you Wendy that was good to see a tiny little seven block game for women Yamaha this actually looked a lot more like his early season games six turnovers difficulty scoring the Rockets were giving him kind of a hard time and I'll print Schengen was just going right at him  shout out to Shen goon by the way for having zero fear in this ball game and he's the reason that they toppled us first team that it actually been playing a little bit better lately you're not picking up Malachi Branham you're not picking up Kelvin Johnson the Spurs are Victor weapon Yama Devon vessel and that's kind of it these days actually Trey Jones says has tapered off I think you can stream trade Jones's spot which honestly sometimes it's sort of feels good to be able to say oh yeah you can stream a slot now that you couldn't before because at this time of year we want to have some sort of mobile slots to use on our rosters feels good to be able to move bodies around  I get an itchy trigger finger though  Houston we were watching to see if I'm in Thompson could get enough playing time with Freddie Van lead healthy and it does seem like the answer that question is likely know I know Kim Whitmore had a nice ball Game yes yesterday but he had had what four or five bad ones in a row so you can't just say oh when a good one pops up you have to take the bull breadth of it and the breadth of it is that for the Rockets right now with Shang Van Vliet  Jabari Smith Jr who had a bad ballgame here those are the guys that tend to sit inside the top 100 or certainly a lot better for the first two names I mentioned in nine cat Jalen green points League only  that's as far as you go  Indiana team Jacqueline Hyde blows out the Dallas Mavericks I mean  didn't they just I feel like Indiana just lost to a tanking team the other night  I've lost track of their schedule but I feel fairly confident that the Pacers just lost to someone who doesn't belong it was the Spurs yeah we just talked about him it was this Birds and wimby  anyway as the Pacers go I think Aaron niece Smith these probably playing through something right now but you can also likely stream his roster spot you're not picking up Ben Sheppard you're not picking up Andrew hard TJ McConnell is actually been streamable lately in all formats even with wildly fluctuating minutes he's just been really really good at assists and Steals and field goal percent and that's often enough as a combo  it's an extraordinarily dangerous dream to use against a game's cap because the guy playing 18 to 22 minutes a game the bottom can fall out fast but he's on a heater right now and you guys know I love TJ McConnell so I give him the sort of wink nod nod do it if you feel like it though again with the number of guys popping up right now that are set to play 30 minutes that I didn't yesterday oh hey yeah good point chat room I skipped the Pelicans we'll come back to that one in just one sec sorry guys uh  the Pacers I think you just you keep it at Halliburton siakam Myles Turner the obvious ones and then McConnell  probably stat hunting a little bit if you need a Steals and field goal percent that's probably a safer way to put it if you need everything to be a little dangerous let's talk Mavs and then we'll scroll back up to Pelicans my bad everybody  Daniel Gafford 16 and 10 with a steal and three blocks Derek Lively had some early issues he also was just kind of bad Maxie kleeba also had some foul issues was also kind of bad  of course the problem here is that all three of those guys played 15 minutes or more  that's  annoying  but this is what Gafford can do if you just give the poor guy 20 minutes  Daniel Gafford can get inside the top 100 in 20 minutes in 28 minutes as we saw early as 26 and a half minutes he was top 35  he doesn't need we don't need 30 minutes we need like 22  this is why it's so hard for me to drop Gafford and I did admit I dropped him in one not everywhere a couple of like a half of the teams where I had a head-to-head spots because I just you couldn't sit on a guy doing nothing wrote oh I just stick them on a bench that's the easier call there but I mean like can we make the pivot here yet Dallas  Dallas is searching for defense right now that's then that was the talk during all the post-game stuff they are basically unable to guard anyone at the moment and so if one of these guys can somehow separate themselves on that side of the floor  that's how they get their  I think you almost have no choice at least on the Roto side but to keep gaffer on your bench until the end of time because it just again doesn't take that much to get him their head-to-head I get it like you it's impossible and then PJ Washington is on a heater these days guys go on hot runs sometimes it's a week sometimes it's two sometimes it's a month sometimes it's one game  I think Washington's heater is about four games now if I'm remembering right I'm sure we could look it up fast but I don't really care to  he's a guy you can stream when he's hot if you like  I can continue to be very skeptical of ride the heater type of streams but I get it if you guys are frankly look I play a relatively conservative style of fantasy basketball yeah but that doesn't mean that you have to also if you guys want to take the plunge see what happens screw it have at it but you know they say well what are you doing Dan I avoid situations like that for the most part because I feel pretty confident that I'm going to play them on the wrong day I'm just way it goes for the Pelicans trade Murphy is on a heater for the ages when it's funny for me to say I don't like playing guys that are on heaters but you got no choice here  and the nice part about Murphy was this ends up being sort of like a streamer with Benefits because McCollum went down Murphy used that opportunity to get into the starting five get his rhythm and now he's carried it over into his bench role again  play him until the wheels come off  how many threes does Murphy have over the last  what was it four five games now I got to look this up I should have had this ready to go but screw it you guys can wait six seconds while I look at it up he's gone completely Buckwild  Trey Murphy has 24/3 pointers in his last four ball games whoo  and that's what the two for in there  at Indiana you went this is bad shooting game all the way he had seven assists that one he's on an absolutely insane run over his last four you could even call it five ball games and if you want to go back to the McCallum absence he's been on a really strong run for about the last two and a half weeks or so  and so again you just play them until it all comes apart but he is volcanic level hot right now  volcanic  65% this last ball game with 10 3-pointers 57% the previous day with six previous game rather  two games before that 9 out of 14 shooting with six three pointers  and by the way when he can face space the floor the Pelicans are pretty formidable team  and then when he cools off  it's kind of amazing actually how much the pals rely on Trey Murphy to space the floor and Herb Jones these days  okay so that was your Pelicans report which is basically just keep playing guys until he doesn't work anymore and then Phoenix in Denver that was the last one went into overtime Grace and Allen finely balanced back oh man was he overdue he had been on a really rough run for two weeks but a great season for Alan overall so you hold him as long as you possibly can and this certainly evens things out Royce O'Neill is also a hold in my eyes I mean 39 minutes in overtime 34 in regulation is typically enough for him on Neil's a guy where you can get him to about 32 minutes then he's a startable fantasy guy usually gets a steal or a block mixed in there just kind of weird that he didn't in this ballgame but if you had I mean like this is a game where if he he shot three out of nine if she's if he shoots four for nine and it's a three-pointer then you're like oh sweet ball game  the difference between feeling like you got a good game out of O'Neill here and you didn't was one three Paulina or probably won defensive stat  that to me is an easy hold call until Booker comes back and you guys know I hate Eric Gordon's Fantasy game I hate it set it  15 times this season and probably a hundred in the existence of this show  and then with Denver Casey P back in there he had a nice ball game he's been he's kcp by the way he's very much a member of the doesn't matter Club sometimes he's okay sometimes he's not the end of it all  dead matter  I'm sure the Lakers are looking at this ball game and gone come on Michael Porter what gives  after a perfect 10 for 10 night order goes eight for eighteen and yokich was cold in this one too  I do Wonder  and did Denver play somebody in between  no they had two days off after that Laker game this sort of felt a little bit like a letdown  they got the Lakers not that Phoenix isn't a team you get up for but they got the Lakers in Boston on either side of it  I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm talking out of my  rectum  yep got to say rectum on today's episode and that's your program today ladies and gentlemen that's your recap I again I have no idea how this happened but we nailed some

grow this  motorboat turn it into a  what's bigger a motorboat or a schooner I don't know anything about water  crap about aquatic stuff the closest thing I've ever come to learning about Maritime Affairs is that I was a an SAT tutor right after I graduated from college and I tutored this this  this girl who lived in Pacific Heights in San Francisco and for those that haven't been there  it's expensive and they're house  was a square it almost looked like an apartment complex with an Atrium in the middle and if you went out  there on the top of Pacific Heights so one side of their home faced the Golden Gate Bridge faced North  in that room was just like Maritime artifacts and that's what I knew I was in an expensive home was just like who has a room for a bleeping like boat steering wheel  also in that room a secret door  pull out a book from the shelf and it swung open to reveal a wet bar  for they had all their liquor store behind that wall that was freaking sweet I want to live in a house with a secret door make that those big fantasy books baby anyway to everyone who's watching I love you all I appreciate you all please like rate subscribe however you're taking in the podcast it is very much appreciated Quick Check of the chat room here before we sign off for our morning show I do think we'll probably hold off on the schedule streaming episode until the early afternoon Pacific time we'll wait on some of the injury reports to come out that's a good way to at least better know who we can drop into our lineup because today is an eight game day there's like there's a decent amount going on I don't want to guess at who we can stream  I'd rather have a pretty good idea about it but let's see what we got here do we think Kelly Olynyk has a better game versus the Suns or should I lock in his performance last night oh I didn't know that  uh oh it's a locally  you know what I'm gonna say the sun's I think he does better against the Suns because I think that game ends up more competitive I think Phoenix has a little bit of a letdown they got Denver Toronto and then they've got Boston so Boston's dealing with all these teams at the same time Toronto feels like the game where Phoenix kind of coasts a little and that's going to allow a guy like a Linux to to Chow Down  I got I did get a shout out in the chat room for saying one in Hebrew  do I think bench pool is an actual Improvement not only do I think it but the numbers very much Barrett out he's actually for the first time all year actually been startable for more than a two-game span  since the All-Star Break Jordan Poole's top 70 in his bench role  yeah it's crazy  about 24 points a game three and a half three pointers field goal percent still at 43 but I mean whatever like he's actually finally doing some volume stuff  it's go time man bench pool is very much a go  all about it  let's see here can you rate my team not live on a show sorry about that you can maybe throw it in the YouTube comments section I can try to take a look at it there  can we roast Paul Reed on this ball game too yeah he's dunk I think they're both scheduled Place those centers out there  Dan my man hey what up calls I'm closing in on back to back regular season championships playing the second place team up two and a half games thank you once again you are welcome my dude old man squad forever would you drop read or Reef for Drummond  um I would probably drop reads like it points League I think wreath probably does a little bit more here in the short term  you know neither one of those guys is all that exciting to me and then Chicago has a really good schedule here but again this question probably fits our later show a little bit more  look to do do do do yeah Manila says come on into the Discord we don't bite  that's a good way to that's a good way to call it no biting in Discord that's our rule for sports though so again that link is in the show description if you're
