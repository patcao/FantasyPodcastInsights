welcome to the fantasy NBA today I thought we'd try a brand new show type today welcome to the first ever edition of Dynasty movers here on fantasy NBA today it's not a new show it's just a new show type I am Dan Vespers I am your Ernie Johnson for this afternoon I will be keeping the Train on the rails as best I can but I am fortunately joined by the great Mark Camaro at Mack Attack 145 I am at Dan Bass Pro Mac attack by the ways m a c and then the word attack the numbers 145 Mark of course is our Dynasty lead at sports ethos on the fantasy basketball side and today we're going to be going through some risers and fallers basically effectively treat this show like we didn't do it in November because we didn't do it in November I had the idea in November not that it's like this is something groundbreaking or anything like that  but we're covering basically two months at once and the hope is that this is something we can do basically monthly and everybody can track the dynasty fates of different players as they go Mark first of all thank you so much for popping on and second of all people want to Dive Right In so that's what we're gonna freaking do here today again please do follow Mark on Twitter at Mack Attack 145 Mark you want to start us with some risers because people like good news before bad news right it typically I tend to go that way so yeah let's Dive Right In the first biggest riser for not necessarily biggest Riser but I think one of the biggest stories for dynasty has been Scotty Barnes and you know he came into the league with a lot of hype a lot of one of those tools he wings that maybe has some problems shooting but if you put like together you can see this all around well-rounded fantasy monster and for the first two seasons it was a little shaking on the shooting seemed a little streaky in the defensive stats weren't there so me personally I was questioning well  okay if it's shot doesn't come around fully and his defensive tools don't translate into defensive stats which we've seen with plenty of tools he prospects okay how can he really rise and this year he's so far has kind of Silence those doubts a little bit and the shoot it's still only two months in the season which sounds like a lot it's really not so I'm still a little iffy if the shooting is real but the mechanically on his death back three years they just look much more put together it looks much more confident with that creating really nice separation in space getting to spots well so I'm  soft by the scoring output and the defensive rates both box and seals that just ticked up and we're seeing this while around 9 cat fantasy player right now I think he's top 10 or top 15 so far in the year so my my follow-up on each player that we go through I like the initial take and then my thought is what would you recommend viewers do about this information because there's something actionable can you get him right now I'm assuming his price is pretty high is it actually like he ticked up but maybe there's an opportunity to cash in on it so how do you how do you play that side of the equation  it's one of those things where you have to first ask yourself your question how do I think this is and if you don't think it's real then yeah it's so so but I think it's fairly real he's a still only 21 22 years old I don't have his birthday memorize that people probably a little creepy but he still young still ascendant still had could even have some room to increase his usage and scoring outfit more so you probably just a whole and enjoyed the ride which is a perfectly fine answer for Dynasty is I mean if you have him he probably Hope was hoping hoping for this breakout this is what you go on if you can get maybe someone you know the top five or top 10 you know if maybe but those players are even harder to get in a fire and trade for so I think you're just very happy with using Scotty yeah that makes sense all right who's next on the board all right let's talk about one of my teams players Albertson goon  so Wilson goon I think the question for a lot of us or at least for me coming in was can defensive  so much shortcomings I'll call him so much shortcomings that's a whole nother debate with that issue it's kind of weird yes would it be a hindrance to him  and can he then see the minutes to operate as an offensive Hub and would you coach a mayor doca actually give him the key to the offense and  along with Fred Van Lee he really has he's been pretty Unleashed and it's not necessarily and its usage rates per se they're actually somewhat in line we saw on his more limited minutes but it's just keeping that same pretty high usage at the with more minutes that's gonna lead to more fantasy points minutes plus usage that's a really good recipe  so we seen that pick up now the help of Defense to rock his defensive scheme this kind of more switch to  playing him more in high head not as much near the rim and this more such ability and he's in turn played more discipline which is definitely better for his on court hoping winning place we see the deals on block sit down a little bit but not really that Discerning so what we're seeing from in is basically it's a lazy comparison but many yogic or sabonis like skill set and he's only 21 years old so  yeah he's just showing what really all the Believers in him thought he could be yeah you know the big question like you said was defensively and he has been markedly better from a principal's standpoint he's not just chasing everybody everywhere and obviously it helps to have a few guys on his team now that can actually play some defense say what you will about Dillon Brooks as a sort of a self-created heal in the NBA he's a good Defender and Freddie Van fleets a pretty good Defender you finally bring in some body there that can help teach that aren't putting shangoo and at this like everybody says save everybody type of thing which he was never going to be good at doing and so now he's been able to turn himself into sort of a serviceable Defender he's not going to be great I don't think he's ever gonna be great but he's no longer this sieve he's no longer a traffic cone but like you said yes deals and blocks they haven't changed all that much my question for you is again in addition to sort of what do we do with this are you all concerned about the weird down  tick in free throw percentage I don't I mean I figured that that would stay the same or maybe even go up as he continues to age in the NBA but it's gone the wrong way so far or is that a magic of a six weeks sample size as we talked about with shooting earlier it is early in the season however  he has such great touch that you feel like you'd be in serviceable free throw shooter right you see the touch on is floaters and on a spin moves with his little almost baby hook shots you think the free throws would come around and they haven't yet  it's definitely concerning but in Dynasty which then to be larger leaks it's much easier to kind of angle your team and build around who your top core guys are so with him it's something that you hope the free throws comes around but if it doesn't that's okay you can plan around that and build your team around that and that goes with the three-point shooting as well he's got his really tried to stress to him to shoot the three more if it's there but it's still looks a little uncomfortable to touch still looks looks alright but I'm not sure if that's can going to develop into a huge part of this game  so the skill set actually looks very comparable to boneless maybe a little bit more defensive stats all right let's keep moving who is next on the mark Board of Dynasty risers yeah we got a touch on Tyrese Maxey who's been a revelation for the Sixers and really has so hard so good oh my God and one of my favorite players to watch which is how fast he plays that and how he utilizes that speech Just To Blow by any defender on the perimeter and one of the hardest things to do in basketball is to increase your usage while maintain your efficiency if you're in usage you're probably taking a harder shot diet maybe have more defensive focus on you maybe you're saying more of the primary defensive assignments and he's just kind of smash that he's out the double check the numbers but when I last checked he's increases massively while increasing is efficiency and it says to turnovers that's all so increased as well it's gotten better which is just okay wow that's  almost not believable but it's stepped up its maintained and  and I'm a Believer in him you just see when he plays he's not making any you know crazy reads but he's just making the right read constantly has the ball in his hands that's gonna leave a lot of assists a lot of playmaking stats and he just shooting the crap out of the ball on looking great doing it so you he's been fantastic honestly so again what do we do what is it again a situation where if you got him a dynasty you just you ride it out or is there concern that Philly could bring in a another usage guy is this sort of a best case scenario or is this a start of a magical like decade long Arc for him hard to know putting on here but no it's always it's always interesting we talked about the decade longer you see managers talk about oh this players a core for my next 10 years and it's like oh I don't know if you can plan now for maybe three to five years but I mean there might be some concerns about what Philly does with all these  contracts that are expiring could they use some of the first round picks they got and package that  at the same time Maxie's also just defending he's or this usage and you know there's that phrase cream rise to the top and he's been the crime of the crime right now he's that's nice you it's not easy to refer to a person as cream so I like how you went with crime that's less that's less disturbing I appreciate that  I didn't think about that now so thank you Dad yeah I think we keep it classy here on fantasy today so was I mean towards just like hanging on and enjoying it yeah I mean that might be a lazy answer so maybe a better response would be if you can sell these guys to their Peak right I'm working through my dynasty rankings and rankings are again there are a loose guideline but if you can so where you think okay this is maybe at the top and this is the guy that's  you know this may be the top end of his range then sure but usually that's  doesn't normally always come up so  you normally can't trade away for what I'll call fair value  and so usually the answer is just be happy with what you're getting from him  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run it end up

spot with a little lightning round action who are the rest of your risers and I'm going to Simply type them into the chat room I'm not going to go hunting their their Yahoo Pages down I want to see if we can do the rest of your risers in  two and a half minutes can we do it  yes yeah we can do that okay  so first I'll kind of lump them together we'll Mark Williams and Jalen Duren I both both of them Prejudice Aaron brought a little bit more playmaking and touches game and we've frankly have seen that he's been incredible I think even in that Pistons horror show but yeah I really like him and Mark Williams has just been he looks massive on the court and he's just doing a lot of nice solid steady centers things that we like to see he's contesting shots well he's rebounding well bringing good energy and insanely efficient from the field so I really like both of them and I think they both cemented their spot so Jalen Johnson we have to talk about too he's been kind of a sports ethos guy and honestly I didn't see it and then I watched the preseason Hawks game and I was all in and he's just showing out been their Best Wings by far and has shown kind of elements of an all-around game minus a 3-point shooting but he's been great is injury is devastating on his team and I would sat myself as I had him on a lot of my redraft leaks so but we'll try on a cam Thomas who back in my pre-drafted Camp Thomas I just wrote he's a Hooper I don't really see much else and if he makes a shots he'll stick he wasn't necessarily making his shots the first couple years and now he is making a shots and he gets his spots really well he elevates really well is this percentage is still honestly pitiful yeah terribly low it's awful and it it's very evident by the eye test when you watch him play he just is not look for the past but hey there's plenty of room on fantasy rosters for efficient scoring guard and that's what he's been so far and I think he's maybe he won't stick to this level but I am more trustworthy of it and so I think he can stick as a the very least and this might be selling him short as like a six-man  bark like scoring option which that's a pretty big jump in ranking for a player of his age  and then some smaller players or not some smaller players but some smaller rise's Darren Fox I think his pull up three-point shooting game as he's really looked to their a lot more and that would actually be a really huge Outlet at an element to his Fantasy game to give them that ceiling now he's been a popular maybe more free throws but also put three sky in a way because he doesn't really doesn't have that volume from the guard position you like to see but he brings us a sis and points and if he adds threes on top of that fantasy game and that this 3-point shooting is real in this game's real then that's a really nice cherry on top this game you're cruising here man I think you only got I think you got two more if I'm reading this right  I think two more maybe one I think one more one more okay yep and Max Drew Sue Hey yes I know I was not a Believer and fellow Sports youth member Keith cork we went back and forth in DMs I think two weeks in the season and I was like why you hyping him up so much and then I started was watching him more he thoughts not a shooter I thought he was mainly just a bomber that's what he kind of showed in Miami but he's running a lot of pick and roll actually actions with mobe and Jared Allen there and it looks really good he's actually think it's a sister around 4 I want to say yeah and he's rebounding it's rebounding too I mean it's just kind of doing a lot of nice things that I didn't think was in his game and that all that really helps round out his game so I like what I seen fragmented yeah no doubt I mean you guys you know I've yammered about streusel on the show as as like a nice example of me learning from past mistakes because I he was the type of guy we're in the past I've been like that I mean I always seen this dude in Miami he's gonna hit some three-pointers the other stuff's gonna stay pretty low but then he played like 37 or 39 minutes or something like that in the first or second game of the year and I was like wait a minute I was some guys are out for this team but that is a lot of damn minutes and he had like 11 rebounds different here Old Dan would have been like no anomalous like we saw this guy but new dad was like okay this team went out and got this guy they paid him like a bunch to go be something that he wasn't in Miami and so new Dan was like I'm gonna take a shot on this dude because team is giving  him an opportunity that he didn't have before and man he is like roaring into that opportunity number 57 and 9 cat  I guess the question of course and this is one of those ones you talk about Dynasty wise we have no idea what his role is gonna look like four months from now even they don't think they bring in another Wing who supplants him somehow or if they trade Donovan Mitchell away which seems unlikely but you never know everything can get up and ended with a player who's not Superstar they're not building their team around screws but he has been good so far I you know I said I'd never I wouldn't say much on this show but everybody knows how much I love Max druce these days Mark before we get to your followers unless do we miss anybody that was the risers I think we got him right yeah and there's okay I mean plenty of other guys who have made modest improvements got the game but I think that's really the highlights for me yeah you can't talk about every player in the NBA that would be a very long show before we get to the followers I want to remind everybody if you're enjoying this dynasty show first follow Mark on

do these shows once a month or so Mark give me a couple of fallers here I think if I'm looking at the list you send me you've got four which means yeah I think we could probably do minute or two on each one who is your can you start with the ugliest follower I want to go I want to go right for the grossest one  I think it's got to be just Kitty oh good lord this one's a loaded one yeah  not getting it to the hole yeah no legal situation or even regardless of that yeah before that even came out I was I wrote about in my Dynasty by cells article about a month ago that he just his role has been marginalized in the offense and  he's someone who doesn't really have a shot yet and it got gross on the game on Wednesday I don't know if you saw clips of that game he was getting the Benson Street mid he was at the right elbow and there was no one within like five feet of him and he just he didn't shoot it he passed it out it and the Thunders that seemed to recognize that he can't shoot and he's not going to be the best primary on ball option which I mean he's a good he's a strong Pastor I do like his passing plasterers don't get me wrong there but if you're not respecting a shot he's cramping the offense it's not as you know he's like your third or fourth best on ball option there's just not really room for that type of player to make them a local point and you kind of needs to be a focal point to accumulate all these counting sets if he's not going to be shooting improvements yeah is there a is there a Planet where he goes someplace and is the like main initiator that that may be this thing Dynasty wise could turn around for him or I mean this doesn't seem like a guy that A team's gonna want to take a chance on right this moment and that is actually because of the weird legal stuff so maybe we get some sort of closure on that I don't know when I have no idea how long that process might take with that  I mean I feel like I'm grasping at straws a tiny bit here is that the reason maybe someone would want to take a chance on it because he was very much on my bus list for this year for specifically the reasons you're talking about just like she's getting better and Jalen Williams is getting better and Chet is gonna handle some of the rebounding and interior stuff and it's like now they need floor spacing and he's not that so um are there Avenues to where this could he could rebound could you buy at an extremely low point or am I reaching a little bit here  no you're not reaching but  I think we kind of saw this was Ben Simmons with the Sixers right where  the Sixers realized that we probably shouldn't be a core build around piece they look to move in and yes Ben Simmons had injury and back issues and potentially some  other issues as well and so I don't want to minimize that asked of it but he just wasn't a focal point and we saw his role get minimized so for Josh giddey it's  I don't want to say put up or shut up that seems a little too hard but you have to be people either I think that his shots going to at least be respectable enough for him to be in this on ball of role it doesn't mean he can't provide value or be useful we saw that with Ben Simmons beginning of the Season he still was useful but he wasn't this top 50 top 75 player he was more top 125 top Point 50 and the right build a little higher but  still it's not this it's the upside is definitely disappearing with him yeah that's kind of where I was sitting with it as well who is the next Faller on the board I know you've got four of them  so speaking of the Thunder which we just did I think we hear some right now it might be the pool party might be shut down right now oh  you go are we going Jordan Poole next we're going Jordan for yeah is he though the funniest player to watch in the NBA right now not that that's good for Fantasy but I watched players like that on the rockets for the past three seasons it gets depressing pretty quickly yeah really that's terrible man he was it does and like feel free to talk me through this but man I really feels like he whatever success he had was a byproduct of playing next to one of the greatest players in the history of basketball and Steph Curry because right now like you know a game here and there he's been okay but the assists have not ticked up the shootings been atrocious he like  how do we get out of this this death spiral he's in it's gross it was supposed to be like they lose a ton of games but at least he takes 25 shots a night but that's not even happening yeah I remember seeing that was kind of all over I guess we'll call basketball Twitter for the first couple of weeks of the preseason or once that trade happened was oh Jordan Poole could even we delete and scoring yeah take shots and I mean I never saw that I thought the shots would be there at least a little bit the numbers maybe could get to 2325 points per game on horrible efficiency but  the shots aren't there no it's aren't as high the assist straight to I mean he was never a great passer I don't think that was I think people who thought his assist would take up where maybe or go like six assists where I was a little too crazy because it's just straight was never great and Golden State even in that third season for him but I didn't see this poor happening is not really looking to pass he's not looking to develop that part of his game he just looks like someone who got the bag and this kind of okay I'm good piece which I mean all fair to him he had heard that contract a couple years ago but man yeah you'd think you'd want to rehabilitate value a tad after like he looked I like he looked bad he was the scapegoat and golden state it kind of felt like now look I sort of Playing devil's advocate here because I did spend the whole run up to the season saying he's not a player I would dare touch in the fourth round to because of the possibility of everything going hard South I didn't think it was gonna be this bad I don't want to give myself that much credit but the opposite side is like this did kind of feel like a Prove It season where I was like oh Jordan Poole was the reason the warrior stunk last year for stretches  shouldn't there have been a chip on his shoulder it's quite it's exactly the opposite he was just like ah thank goodness I'm away from those players who care about the result of the game now I'm free to be me which is like lounge chair Jordan Poole what do you do with a player like this  you just have to yeah we talked about with gag know with the buys you you at that point you probably not No One's Gonna buy him at the price of probably should be at just because it takes time to believe it's real or not it's kind of the opposite way here it's almost so low that it's just nothing you can do which sounds very depressing it is but if you can sell for or trade away for you know a more reliable top 100 asset or player yeah I would probably pull that trigger or maybe top 100 top 80 range but other than that you kind of just have to write it out at this point and hope that he gets a little more serious I feel like that's the right term  and yeesh  okay let's let's not talk about Jordan Poole anymore I feel like doing like the I don't know if anybody's seen The Ladies Man movie where he's like forced to try to be  the the straight man during a radio interview and he's talking to a nun and she keeps saying things that make him want to make sexual jokes and he says okay let's talk about something else let's talk about some he does with the lisp talk about that mouth I love that character all right let's Jordan Poole let's talk about somebody else um who's next on the fallers maybe they're a little bit less discussing  we'll talk about action another combo card here in jailing green oh he's kind of disgusting too but at least he's like the same level of discussing his last year right so  it's an energetic discussing yeah that's right because he sort of does what that team needs to a certain degree just doesn't really translate to Fantasy it one of the most frustrating things about him for me is that he has the speed and the first step and the acceleration to get to the rim not at Wilbert when he wants to kind of but his he just doesn't know when to slow down when to how to abuse his body to the sort of contact well his finishing at The Rim therefore has been horrible he tends to overdrive into players  many times and not making it simple kick-out pass which we saw some flashes up Improvement in that last year and it's just kind of stayed though at a very very basic level it seems like he predetermined if he's going to pass or shoot at The Rim or shoot on drives they call they call that the rui hachimura  yes that is that is a term for it but  so I'm not saying to development of his playmaking game it seems like it's kind of stuck in the muddle a little bit and without those assists I don't think we're going to see any High proficiency scoring anytime soon the points might be good the threes the 3-point shooting has been great this year  or not great it's been solid  but it's been nice but if it's just points in threes but nothing else in the fantasy football box then what what are we getting here you're getting what you're getting a points League player it yeah exactly yes yeah I mean it's pretty much what he is and it's not a bad but I think for me a lot of it is  upside cases I guess how I evaluate young players especially there's a big band of where they could be right I can see the high outside outcome or if it doesn't work out the low outside low upside outcome so actually feel a little better about his floor just because I do think he's putting a little more energy on the defensive side and he's doing he's going okay at times at some games but decision making hasn't develop the passing as in the belt as we discussed and so that brings down that low that high-end a lot for me which is going to just kind of making him fall down my rankings yeah it's funny how Clay Thompson is having the worst year of his career and everybody says he's terrible and his stats are like almost a dead heat right now yeah all right last one on the followers board and then we'll put a bow on this bad boy and I'm already letting everybody know who it is through his face up on the screen there  and I feel a little bad having him in the fallers it's his it's still early for him and I think he's being shoehorned into a role that I don't think he's ready for and I don't think this person should have him in as his main oh Jeremy so anyway for folks that are listening and not watching so yes Jimmy so yes and I mean he was recently demoted out of the starting lineup which I do think it's good for him but it's been disastrous I if you look at the splits between Trey Jones when the offensive rating when Trey Jones plays and someone who actually just knows how to dribble and pass the ball and make those basic point guard duties  it's versus when so hands on the floor it's the offense is rating is just dramatically different there are actually like somewhat respectable when Trey Jones is in that starting five and when so hands not it's and so hand is in the starting lineup it's  futured yeah they went to chitty Osman in their last ball game instead because very clearly this birds are tanking like there's no other reasonable explanation for this like this is a very very clear subtle tank they're running they're just not playing the guy that could actually get them to better plus mine is numbers and like they're doing it in a way that people can't be like oh you're taking you're trying to lose games you're not playing Victor one but Yama they're they're doing it by putting guys around him that don't make sense it's it's brilliant actually um so I would almost play a little Devil's Advocate I've been very much against Sohan and nine cat redraft but I am kind of interested in him on the dynasty side because I feel like at some point maybe they do slot into the right role I just think it might be next year or the year after that the question I guess is do you have the patience for it so Mark do you have the patience for it because it has been kind of a clunky start to the year for him playing a role where he doesn't belong yeah and so I think if you're a rebuilding team it's definitely someone that you just write out and as the Spurs are doing with tanking hey you can take a dynasty and oh I'm playing my rookies in my young guys they need experience right yeah absolutely starting lineups but I mean if you you can as a dynasty manager you can kind of design your roster to be hey it's rebuilding you my players on that good and your team will naturally be that and that's on don't have an issue with that so in that case yeah it's exhibit patience I still do you see some glimpses of upside he does he does make some interesting reads A passes don't get me wrong it's not that there's no passing Talent here but I think it's more in a secondary taking advantage of an advantage I was already created aspect more than he's in every down point guard run they can roll initiate the offense type  and so with that ship's enroll I hope we see more of those flashes it's just for now he's thinking a little bit they're not as far as he other guys we discussed previously  mark thank you very much my good man that is officially the dynasty risers and fallers debut episode excuse me as I clear my throat off are here on fantasy NBA today you can follow the mark on Twitter
