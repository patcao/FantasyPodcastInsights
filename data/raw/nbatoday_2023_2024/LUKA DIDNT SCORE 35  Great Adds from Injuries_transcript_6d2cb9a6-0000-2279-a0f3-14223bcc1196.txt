welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast it's a regular recap show today everybody keep it easy keep it Breezy  cruising on into our Tuesday show we got a few things to talk about from Monday a lot of it injury related some of it Luca related  blow out I am I think I'm facing Luca and pretty much every single Head to Head League I could possibly find myself in right now so I was  I don't know is it weird to say thrilled that he didn't have another 35 Point triple double and only had a regular size triple double  I am just going to get absolutely obliterated in one of those two leaks one of the teams  the first place team is crazy in this it's more of a points League it's my weirdo League form out we talked about this one before I don't know how this team got I think there was some trades involved but somehow he ended up with Luka doncic Jimmy Butler Damian Lillard Victor weapon Jama like I don't I don't I don't DeMar  Tyler hero that was not as important and he's her chat dude as Chet halls I don't know how this happened  we let this happen somehow it's on the rest of us  anyway that team's gonna smoke my team unless something crazy happens  but I got a shot in the other one so we'll be watching intently here um I got a busy day so I don't think we're gonna screw around too much at the beginning here welcome to the show it's fantasy NBA today I'm Dan best briefs thank you as always for watching listening liking subscribing specially here at the end of the season I'd love it if we could somehow  find some new listeners some new fans at the end of the year this is the hardest time without question this is the hardest time to find new people in the fantasy basketball space so if you're new out there and you found us because you're fighting through your playoffs or whatever it is let me know  kind of exciting for me actually  I get my get my jollies here at the end of the year on new listeners I had an idea and I want to run it by you guys it's not really a podcast idea necessarily but I thought I'd throw it in all of your faces as well I'll get some feedback I am  extremely tired of having to retype the same things over and over again and that's not it that's not about you guys that's about like you finish up a card and you know take it's an idea that hit me last night when I saw Nick Richards line in the Charlotte game that's legitimately when the idea hit my head because he had 10 points he had 13 rebounds and you know frankly I can even we can even start in on the daily card because that's the first one we're gonna talk about anyway  so  Nick Richards  I'm looking at yesterday's final numbers  and there he is he played 36 minutes you know that's good five of seven shooting missed his free throws one turnover no defensive stats very empty Double-Double and I thought to myself  do I even need to type in my recap  do I even need to say it on the podcast Nick Richards remains a low end Center stream  I thought well I get you know I need to be because if I leave him off someone's gonna be like Dan what are your you know what's your thought on Nick Richards it's like well okay so I've said the same thing about Nick Richards for I mean how long is Mark Williams been out now is it three and a half four months at this point it's an overwhelmingly long stretch and it doesn't seem like Mark Williams is gonna play at any point this year but regardless of that we've never he hasn't fully been ruled out for a while he was like day-to-day then he was weak to week and then it was month to my God worse and worse he's got this back thing going on but they've never ruled him out for it was never like oh he's gonna shut her down for two months and then we're gonna reevaluate at least at that point we could have been like all right Nick Richards is this  so every day that Charlotte plays and every morning after they play I come on this podcast right I go on social media and I say Nick Richards low end Center stream third string Center for your fantasy roster  and by the like you know whatever it is how many games has he started in a row for them now 45 something like that by like the 40th time I'm thinking am I really do I need to do this  and then I thought okay well if I don't have an alternative  then the answer is yes I do need to do this  so I started brainstorming about Alternatives last night  on how do I get over this hump but here's what I came up with and I'm curious what you guys think feel free to hit me up on Twitter at Dan best purse with thoughts or you can put them in the comments section it's all fine I want to keep kind of like and it'll probably be on Twitter because that's the easiest place to get it I want to keep kind of like a damn best briefs Master list which is not everybody in the NBA I'm not typing up everybody I don't got time for that nonsense but The Fringe ear guys so like we're looking at this first ball game Charlotte in Detroit Detroit beat the piss out of him Charlotte Detroit at least still has a few like NBA caliber players on their Club right now Charlotte doesn't really Pistons got a much needed 11th victory of the year  Nick Richards loan stream  Grant Williams is kind of fringy but in the starting lineup lately he's been a little bit better I think you know what I yesterday show or the day before whatever it was I said something like I can't like he should if he's playing 35 minutes as a starter I just like these boring and he was kind of boring this one frankly but he scored a bunch so that was worth wild so okay  and vasilia meets each  injury replacement guy there's a lot of injury replacement stuff going on here Nick Richards is an injury replacement William's is meets aches  do I really need to type that every single time or say that every single time they play a ball game  now for the podcast it doesn't it's not that hard for me to just very quickly say Grant Williams he's a filling for so and so or Nick Richards he's villain for so and so but typing it over and over again is exhausting not because it like hurts my fingers or something but because Twitter has a character limit I don't want to do a 20 tweeter of them are things that I've typed 35 times before so if I had like a Twitter Master list where just from this ball game alone you'd have mitts itch Grant Williams uh Nick Richards on one side you'd have Simone from tecchio and probably Isaiah Stewart and maybe Jaden ivy on the other side and then yeah as the game progressed and like did anything change for these guys in this ball game  maybe one thing I would say change because Mitch is the same as the day before which is  streaming while Cody Martin is out and Grant Williams is the same as the day before but with a slight tweak which is like yeah I guess I'm softening my stance on it and he's kind of your your train man fill in right now but Nick Richards is very much the same so that wouldn't need to be mentioned so Grant Williams would be the one out of those three that probably deserves a little quick bullet hey you know seems like you can start him while Trey man is out boom and people like what do you think about mitts itch and Nick Richards I mean like check the master list Simone fontecchio on the other side  we thought Oscar Thompson was going to be available to play he wasn't on injury reports until relatively late in the process here for Detroit and then he got ruled out a couple hours before the Ballgame it's illness so expecting back pretty soon  and that's why you say okay well funtech yo decent fill in here if Azure Thompson is gone  but no change for Isaiah Stewart which is I don't like his Fantasy game and Jayden Ivy no change which is yeah he started in points league but you can't start him in nine cat but I mean by boom I got two bullets on this game instead of six  I need Time Savers and if he feels like that would be a Time Saver for me because then when I type it one time I can just cut and paste it over into the master list and bingo bango I'll have a much shorter tweet storm now for you guys here on listening to the show I probably keep it somewhat similar to how it's been because it's so fast to just be like this guy's this guy's this guy's this and talking is easier than typing anyway  so we covered that first ball game while I was running the idea by I am interested in what you guys think if that's a worthwhile idea plus if you ever are sitting there in the middle of a day and you're like damn I can't figure out where Dan's last opinion was on Grant Williams you go to the master list I think it makes sense in my mind it makes sense but maybe I'm  off my rocker  Phoenix they got their big three back and they barely beat the Cavaliers which is not a great sign but it's fine they they managed to work their way through it with  offense  Beale Grayson Allen KD Booker use of Norwich those Five Guys you can start for Phoenix right now it's super easy you can drop Royce O'Neill I still get minutes off the bench but it's not gonna be enough we need him in the low to mid-30s which I don't think he's gonna get with all of the main guys available and so yeah move on even with Eric Gordon out now if Gordon shows up Rose O'Neal's minutes probably come down by one or two or three whatever it is regardless there so that just makes it even a little bit tiny bit tougher  Cleveland is a little bit more interesting at least in as much as they are missing a whole bunch of guys and we don't know exactly when they're coming back no Dean Wade personal reasons so  that actually moved Carriage Levert into the starting five I think they preferred to have him as kind of the bench punch  when we when Wade comes back either way liver you're playing with Mobley and Donovan Mitchell out so let's treat this team mostly like we're just dealing with Mobly and Donovan Mitchell being on the Shelf that's the those are the important ones and Max Drew sorry and forget strews three traditional starters out with all three of those guys out I think I would probably play niang in the next ballgame he had some foul issues early in this one he just started never got into the mix also a very tough matchup he was dealing with Kevin Durant for long stretches in that ball game  yeah not great  so for Cleveland Levert stream akoro stream  those guys they're the easier calls because even if stress comes back I'm pretty sure you could play them and then with niang I think we need all three starters out for him to be playable  and just accept the fact that this wasn't as good of a ball game and it levels off with the previous two and a half that were pretty good  Warriors beat the Spurs got their sweet revenge in this back to back against San Antonio Chris Paul was very good Brandon pajami you can stream him with Steph Curry out  Jonathan kaminga you know he's never gonna be as good as he was during that hot stretch he's not gonna be as bad as he was during the cold stretches kind of settling in the middle Clay is a start dream on is barely a start and frankly if you didn't want to I wouldn't be all that upset with you Andrew Wiggins kind of the same boat but he did get up to 30 minutes so now I think now if Wiggins getting 30 minutes he's probably playable  I don't love it but I'm okay with it and then Trace Jackson Davis feels like he's streamable while Steph is out because they're the Warriors are going to sort of more of an athletic lineup because they had to find they got to find other ways to win they can't space the floor really without Stef out there so they got to go get some dunks get some defense try some stuff  and it sounds like the Warriors are not expecting Steph back for their next ball game which is tomorrow I believe and then they're off for a bit  getting that right am I getting that right  they've got the  Mavs yeah Mavs tomorrow and then Lakers Saturday I think Steph will probably be targeting that Lakers game for his return because that's I mean that's just how the NBA Works players come back against the Lakers you know that  so you probably play Jackson Davis in that ball game so pods CP3 kaminga Jackson Davis clay  and then maybe Wiggins  but honestly probably not dream on green he's not like he's still important obviously what they do but without stuff around his job is just not it's not as significant on the offensive side he's has to do other things  but the Spurs Devon to sell and when we were back for this one they've got a back-to-back so we'll find out if they're actually gonna play in it  if they do play in it they're pretty much the only Spurs that you can trust night to night and I know Sohan had a slightly better ball game here we got some boards and assists and stuff and you know keldon Johnson wasn't awful wasn't very good either but but I don't care and then Malachi brand I'm completely fell off the face of the Earth which was kind of a surprise because he was actually putting up numbers  in the games that when B and vessel were in  so it wasn't that surprising that he had decent numbers when they were out this was the surprise in one  you know if you're Head to Head you picked up whoever on this team for the back-to-back yesterday and today after that you move on for Roto you weren't playing these guys against your games cap anyway  although with Wendy if Wendy and Michelle dough sit out the ball game tonight then you could probably use Trey Jones keldon Johnson  against the games I think that would be okay in my mind I don't think I would go as far as Sohan and Branham because I'd be super worried about percentage is tanking the whole thing Mavericks blew out the Bulls this game was over early Lucas still played 34 minutes because he's on a triple double streak and you know got to keep the triple-double streak alive and Jason Kidd actually took heat for taking him out before he got to 30 or 35 points because Luca was and we hadn't really talked about it on the show but I guess we can mention it now Lucas been on a run lately where he had six consecutive 35 Point triple doubles  yeah that's a lot that's a lot of them in a row well this streak broke that one but he did have another triple-double here despite a pretty inefficient ball game overall didn't matter though didn't matter Kyrie didn't even play all that well but the Daniel Gafford Derek Lively continued at Center was ridiculous  Daniel Gafford went 9 for 9 I don't think he's missed a shot in their last two ball games now and then Lively came in and went 11 for 12  that's absurd  Derek Lively and Daniel Gafford combined to play 42 almost 43 minutes so 42 minutes and a bunch of seconds and they missed one shot out of 21 between the two of them that's wild  you trust Daniel Gafford more at the end of the day I know Lively had the slightly better fantasy I mean it was very tight between the two of them but you trust Gafford because he's starting Lively is more of a schedule play unless this becomes the norm which I don't think that it will this will be obviously more of the good result and then  yeah you just you you go from there  it's Gafford Dodge it and Kyrie from me and then you know Dallas I think if I'm remembering right I think they had a pretty good schedule  starting yesterday and play three times in four days they got a back tomorrow Thursday so that's  again what my fantasy teams need to survive as Luca  picks them apart  wolf  Chicago you can throw it out dump the Box  they got blitzed and everybody's stunk  I guess I owe him who wasn't terrible but pretty much everybody stunk  Move Along nothing to see here Trainwreck so on so forth Toronto has gone into maximum tank  no manual quickly no Gary Trent Jr on top of the guys that are already out  Scotty Barnes yoka portal so on so forth no Chris Boucher either  who had actually just stepped into a slightly better role  Toronto is this is a tough one because what we don't really know is how significant any of these injuries  actually is  now the way they were labeled it makes me feel like Gary Trent isn't going to be back by tomorrow but I really don't know  so I'd love to come on a show today and say okay here's exactly what you need to do with Gary Trent Jr you needed you needed to drop him you need to keep him or whatever  but I think ultimately for quickly and Trent together those are the two and then honestly you could even throw Boucher in the mix because there is an opportunity for him right now and not not as much with RJ Barrett back but still some  you kind of just have to wait until tomorrow now Bushey is like likely not on roster is because  who's gonna you can't pick up a guy like that until like 15 minutes before game time because you just don't know what their roles gonna look like but Gary Trent on a bunch of my teams because he was taking a crap on a shot and then Emmanuel quickly is fairly is a heavily rostered across all of fantasy more so than Trent but because we really don't know if you know is this a thing that's going to keep them out for the week for the year for just yesterday and Toronto hasn't give us any indication  after ruling them out of whether or not they're expected back for the next ball game so I think we kind of almost and it sucks because it's a playoffs and you want to be able to do things immediately I think you kind of just have to wait until tomorrow to find out if they're playing  if they're not playing tomorrow you gotta move on because you can't take another 0 from those dudes you can take one because it popped up early in the week and you gotta save a couple of your moves make sure you can get out from underneath any zeros but that would be one  so if quickly gets ruled out tomorrow if Trent gets ruled out tomorrow I think you gotta swap them out for somebody who plays because then there's no guarantee that those guys play in their next ball game  and suddenly you're staring down the barrel of a possible two or even one game week for these guys or 0 heaven forbid when you could pick up somebody still playing three the rest of the week  tomorrow  yes you could drop them today there are two teams  yeah two teams that have four games the rest of the week today it's very few and the streaming options are pretty damn limited on those clubs and you know like if Corey kispert is out there  that's one where I'd be like okay yeah you can you can drop Gary TransUnion now go get somebody who's playing four games where you know you know best case scenario for trying to see Place three so you don't really lose out in that regard but if kiss birds not there I don't think there's anybody else on the board where I'm just like yes I definitely need four games of that guy versus the chance of getting three out of a Raptor now if the Raptor again gets ruled out and it's two versus  whatever it is at or as many as to to as the maximum versus three of one of these other guys okay then you have a lot of options there are a lot of guys playing three games starting tomorrow through the rest of the week  you guys catch it I think you guys catch my drift  as it stands right now with all of these guys out Kelly Olynyk is one of the easiest calls on planet Earth 29 minutes for him and honestly it felt like  they didn't want him in there for additional minutes because the Raptors were accidentally winning this game for a little bit so a Linux and easy call RJ Barrett you guys know I hate his percentages but if he's really gonna be out there taking 23 24 Shots again like he could take in the 20s that's probably enough even in nine cat and then you just pray that it's not like a seven for 20 shooting and a two for six free throw day because he had no defensive stats yesterday but again if he's taken 20 shots and he's out there for 40 minutes he's gonna score in the 20s he's gonna get five six seven rebounds he's gonna get five six seven assists he's gonna probably get a steal most ball games and that's enough to counterweight it's sort of like the Kyle kuzma situation then  but worse at the foul line and I think probably worse at the field  he's tough man Barrett's tough he'll kill you in a lot of formats and I know you guys want me to talk about gradey dick so I will I fall of these guys are out started  if quickly and Trent come back I don't think that I would I know he'll still play but I don't think he takes 12 shots I think he Fades back into sort of a non-usage role like the previous ball game he got a lot of minutes he just didn't really get to do anything with them  you gotta have minutes and you got to be able to touch the basketball too  Bruce Brown played 38 minutes if that happens again he's probably all so a start so again take a day by day if the Raptors are all missing again tomorrow you could probably go Olynyk gradey Dick Bruce brown maybe RJ Barrett depending on your format  and then what if Chris Boucher comes back maybe that would be the guy to drop in there  I don't know Raptors I don't take too many shots you might get other guys ruled out for the next ball game  some things never change and that is the Denver Nuggets rotations  legitimately nothing to talk about on this team the whole damn season nothing  Big Yolk game though  Big Yolk at your energy here  he has moved firmly into third place in  in fantasy  second by totals of course because Joel embiid is falling off the map add firmly behind him but it really doesn't look like anybody's catching Shay this year  pretty remarkable stuff  unless he takes the rest of the year off don't see that coming  and Nicole yokich  you are still good to have on fantasy teams even if you're not number one  we talked at Great length on yesterday's streamer show about how interesting the Celtics were because we knew they were going to rest some of their guys in Portland and some of their guys in Utah tonight and that meant that Payton Pritchard and Sam Houser both moved on to the board and I hope you guys took that advice because they each had solid fill in games and it's gonna happen again because Al Horford ain't playing in the back-to-back it sounds like Jalen Brown is questionable for this one Tatum Derek white those guys all played yesterday Drew holiday didn't so he'll probably be back for the next one and you're gonna get some smattering of real starters and some smattering of non-real starters you might even get a big Luke coordinate game tonight  which is notable because Boston is had very few fantasy notes throughout the year so we finally had one here on this back-to-back against two teams attempting to lose ball games and they're going to take advantage of that so Howser you can play him against your games cap  whatever regular starters obviously butchered you almost definitely could as well and if you want to get real nuts assuming Horford and forcing us are both out you could even go cornette try to catch some blocks lightning in a bottle it's a little Saucy I'll admit it but good to have Boston actually a fantasy discussion for once other than just a sporting goods out is somebody is one single player out then great you use Al Horford but now they're using they got multiple guys out  it's a brave new day  Portland we pretty much just have to treat like Memphis right now they're in full tank mode or tank enough  call it tanked enough they're not in not in full Memphis is full Portland at least is still playing a couple of actual legitimate NBA players Aiden Grant and Anthony Simons are all in there but the rest of the team is Julie's I guess Matisse died balls of  half click above that  and those four guys by the way are the ones that I would basically play for Portland every night I know Bible only got 22 minutes in this one but his defensive stats are nuts right now and they're you know some games he's popping up with 30 some odd minutes and in those basically when he hits a couple of three pointers he's he's a juggernaut I mean look at his last couple of games where he hid 26 minutes even  four games back 26 minutes he had 16 points 6 boards 3 assists three steals three three-pointers then he had a 19 minute game then 32 1344 with four steals a block in three threes yeah when he gets up into those I-20 low 30 specialty right now while they're actually a few shots available for him  he can post some ridiculous and the other nice thing is to have thy will on a tanking team when a game's gonna sort of get ugly that's beautiful for his fantasy numbers ugly games are great for him because he's gonna find Steals and blocks every which place because teams are just gonna throw it around against Portland  it's gonna be an unfocused unserious basketball that's great for guys who thrive on defensive stats  so I start all four of those guys in Portland I against the games cap I'm not starting anybody else no chance to money tomorrow like he's been borderline scoot is back he's gonna have some games where he puts up some numbers but he's also going to tank you in three or four different categories like this one 138 great but no steals no blocks bad shooting High turnovers  it's the learning process is still  a little bit early or along the curve than I think the Blazers would have wanted in mid-march  now for scheduling a lot of those guys were fine but that's not what they show is about that's what our second show of the day is about and Portland's had a very good schedule they finish up a five and seven on Thursday but the schedule actually stays pretty heavy almost the rest of the season they have very few they only have they have one day where they have a two-day break March 30th and March 31st yeah that's a two days they're not playing between now and the end of the year  the worst for the Blazers between now and the end of the season aside from that is one day off and then one game back on  so they got one of the better schedules meaning if you have these fringy guys you can probably sit on him if you want you don't have to because they're not putting up much in the way of numbers and you know five and seven is different than you know three and six days or something like that but just something to think about as you approach fantasy basketball from a few different directions  now remember this morning show is typically about covering sort of the big story lines the overarching stuff not as much about scheduling we will indeed have a second show coming up either right before or right after Pacific Time lunch today as we've been doing starting last week that gets you situated on schedule streams  and I also shout out to Friend of the program former star of Brandon day  Brandon Marcos who sent me a text that was like you should do a show towards the end of the week about players you can stash for the following week and that makes a lot of sense because we're now starting to come up on  the start of the playoffs in other formats although I'm thinking about Yahoo leagues right now I think there's actually believe it or not I believe there's one more regular season week even after this one  no that's not true so Yahoo League's playoffs start  on the 18th so they do Lop off the last week that's interesting  okay I thought it went all the way to the end of the regular season I guess it doesn't go quite all the way there so Yahoo publicly start their playoffs next week meaning a lot of default setting League's start their playoffs so we'll have a show later this week that won't just be about playoff streaming it all be about players to grab as you look towards the following week if folks maybe have a buy this week or have a buy next week or whatever it is we'll kind of do a little bit of a deeper look ahead as a posted just this kind of really lasering in on the individual day and also of course trying not to overuse our our weekly roster moves  questions from the chat room players I haven't talked about on day John Jerome Dijon Jerome is probably JD says is he illegal winner I doubt it I mean Memphis is gonna be rotating weirdos into and out of the lineup he seems like talking about Jerome he seems like just the kind of player who would have two or three really big games and then reality sets in hard  it's kind of like what happened with GG Jackson actually  ogn and Nobby that was some news it sounds like he may be back as soon as tonight and we just got some news out of Miami by the way nothing nothing big but notable OG and Obi likely back tonight it's an elbow injury so Tom Thibodeau will probably try to play him high 20s and minutes even in his first game back that's  that's the Thibodaux way  he what is that do to everyone else in New York yeah I don't know um we have some very good Nick's coverage here at sports ethos ethos Nicks is the Twitter feed there they do a really nice job  on Andre's is the dude that that covers it not the Andrea we talk about all the time who does all of our tools it's different Andre and he was talking about how he thought that pressure would actually take the first hit and then the next will run a little bit smaller at times I do wonder if it if it dings Josh Hart if only because heart's been playing like 43 minutes every single day he just his legs need a breather or he's going to die but yeah it's going to impact those guys I think I wouldn't predrag hang on to heart and a Chua just to kind of see how it goes and then we can make a call after that  should I drop Josh Hart for keyonte George in a points League um  yeah points League I think I would 9 cat I don't think so  is Bilal worth a stream yes because Holmes is out already and that means we allows probably gonna have to play like 35 36 minutes it could be it could be gross like he's not good at the free throw line he might just not shoot for a day but I would assume him getting mid-30s and minutes is enough to get him you know us deal a block maybe you get more than that out of coolie he's someone that I am eyeballing because the Wizards have one of the two best schedules the rest of this week  but that again these are the type of stuff I like to talk about more on the streaming show  is Evan Mobley a drop  if you're in your playoffs probably  is Vince Williams a drop  you know and honestly I don't know  Memphis is so goofy Grizzlies next ball game is tonight I think if he gets ruled out tonight you drop Vince Williams  any update on Tyler hero actually we just got one he's already been ruled out  for tomorrow because Miami doesn't play today they played tomorrow they got Denver at home Jimmy Butler also just got ruled probable for tomorrow I didn't even realize I didn't even realize he was a question mark  so that was the Miami News Tyler Heroes still out if you can stash him you stash him if he can't you can't at this point because it doesn't seem like he's very close to playing  so sorry  wish I had better news  what's your opinion on team managers who are out of the playoffs scooping up Prime waiver guys they should be locked  oh well is it are you in the playoffs  that's the question Drew is your league in the playoffs because that makes all the difference to me if it's still the regular season they can do whatever the hell they want  do whatever the hell they want in fact we had a team in one of my League's it's down in last place that up all of the injured guys  basically to make it so that the teams at the top of the board can't stash like first and second round dudes and hope that they get him back in the playoffs I think it's a little bit silly but I don't care because it was still the regular season now the playoffs are happening in those leagues anybody not in contention for money should be locked I don't care about your Yahoo rating or whatever oh I need to get third place so I don't lose Diamond status screw you you're not in the if you're not in for money if you're out of the if you're in the consolation bracket or out of all together you should be locked  sounds like Boucher has a partially torn MCL oh I didn't see that  if that's true then yeah you don't have to worry about him  we're seeing this is probably playing in Utah similar to juice see I don't know about that because he missed their game at the end of last week all so of course is actually hurt this wasn't this wasn't a traditional rest day  his KP has been out for a couple in a row now he might play yeah he could but his was not rest he was a game time call but remember he didn't play on Saturday either so this is not a traditional back-to-back rest day for him  and that game was in Phoenix on Saturday that was like a real legitimate we're playing a team trying to win game  so he's questionable but I wouldn't say that he's a guaranteed play not by a long shot because he's actually hurt right now  is taeler Hendrix playing I heard anything about it I'm assuming no unless we hear otherwise later the day  and if he is  Utah well  they're in the midst of still kind of a poor scheduling stretch they got one game and then they're off for two days but then they go into a five and seven so keep a close keep a very close watch on Utah  Delante I disagree with your take on gradey dick I think this point they may turn over more of the usage dick and see what he can do yeah it just so here's the thing Delante teams like the front office can't just turn usage over to a guy the way that they're doing that is by keeping dudes out  because of quickly and Trent are in there they're gonna take shots that's just who they are they're not gonna be like here you go Grady we're trying to lose  it's just sort of player nature yes the front office would like to see him do more but then the question becomes  how many times we rest our usage guys to allow him the opportunity to go do more  so if guys are in there if quickly is in there and Trent is in there  he's going to take a little bit of a backseat they're not going to those players are not just me like yeah we're gonna stop being ourselves because the front office wants to see if gradey dick in play they're gonna have to get held out for that to happen which very well could happen  that's why I'm saying I really think we need to see what happens tomorrow  if my playoffs start next week is it safe to hold Mobly  and you have a bye week yeah I mean you got it at that point because you got a week and a half still just more almost two weeks to figure that out do I think Jalen Johnson is back this week  you know what I honestly don't know problem with Jalen Johnson is that he's been out for two games and Yahoo's not gonna give him an injured tag until Atlanta finally has another ball game which is tomorrow  so you just kind of have to sit on it and if he's out tomorrow then you could stash him in il  otherwise you might have to dump him I mean it's brutal but Atlanta doesn't have a great schedule this week or next week and you just can't afford to take Zero's an entire week I hope he's back Lord knows I hope he's back I haven't been a billion spots because he's an it was like the sports ethos player detect to get of the season but  I don't know more than you know on that one right now  hey Dan would you say it's would you say not to carry any Grizzlies players into the playoffs  well my playoffs are going already and the answer that question is basically yeah it's like JJ's gonna skip all back-to-backs and he might miss some other ones once he hits that 65 game threshold I mean you know you could carry a few Grizzlies into the playoffs but they're scheduled stinks they go three games this week three games next week three games a week after that then they go finally back to a pair of fours before the regular season ends but like  no one on their team is good enough to play in a three game week right now  except JJ and maybe Vince Williams  but we also know that those guys probably aren't gonna play every single ball game so you're talking about Jake laravia in a three gamer nah  but they do have a back-to-back so if you're you know dealing with from that point  all right I got to get back to this care this poor singing this thing I don't know hamstring tightness sounds like to me players don't take two consecutive games off over four days when it's just rest it's just like yesterday could have been but that's the same designation they gave him on Saturday  and yes I know they do swap Horford and Kristoff porzingis yeah I like I have already acknowledged that but this wasn't just that you have to take into account the fact that he missed the previous ballgame as well  I give him a 30% chance of playing tonight  because maybe he did heal up and maybe they wanted to get him back for one of the two games in this back-to-back and so they figured I will give them the first game off because he's actually dealing with a hamstring thing but  it's definitely not a guarantee  it's definitely not it's different than the other ones even if he does end up playing  I'm not saying he won't play I'm saying this is a different situation for personas it's not just Horford plays one KP plays the other it's kp's been hurt can we get him an extra day off and get him right to play in the second half which by the way horrible travel horrible Portland to Utah with a time change late at night this is one of those ones where teams get into the airport or they get into their hotel like four or five in the morning or three three or four in the morning and then you're into mountain time is that a pacific time and then the game is actually an hour earlier because it's mountain time so you lose seemingly multiple hours in your mind and then you're also at altitude honestly I wouldn't be surprised if Boston just rested everybody because how badly do they need regular season wins right now  not much they're eight and a half games up on the bus for the best record in the East and I think there's five or six game five and a half something like that up on the Thunder for the best record overall so there's no reason to push him and is a little bit different  even if he ends up playing this is not the same as previous back-to-backs so hopefully that makes sense  all right we had a few minutes to do a couple of questions but I think we'll wrap it up now coming up in just a couple of hours we'll do our streaming show for tonight a preview of that show is it's a really bad day for finding people to add it's a
