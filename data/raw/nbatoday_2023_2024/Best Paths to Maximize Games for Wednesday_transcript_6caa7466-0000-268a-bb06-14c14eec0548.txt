welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right folks it's streamer Showtime as I get all the various volume levels adjusted  and it's Wednesday  and we have today tomorrow Friday  maybe Sunday  and then probably Monday  on these streamer shows we'll have don't worry we'll have the regular everyday show fantasy NBA today but these two first that we've been doing for the last three or four weeks in a row now  I know I didn't think I was able to do this many of them but we pulled it off for the most part and we're coming down the chute  playoffs wrapping up this is finals week and Yahoo publicly so mostly that don't go to the end of the regular season  and so we want to try to get you to the end of the line so welcome to the show just fantasy NBA today I'm Dan Bass Pros it's a sports ethos.com presentation it's our second of our two shows today  and it's time to dive in who has a bad schedule Who's got a bad schedule right now well Chicago still has not a great schedule they go one game over four days obviously was worse yesterday when they went one going one game over five including three consecutive days off  I don't know that I necessarily say Chicago is the worst schedule but it certainly up there there are only a couple of teams that have a one game in four days stretch going on here in Chicago is one of them San Antonio is another in Utah is the third and final  so basically what you've heard is that the same teams that we pointed out as having bad schedules starting on Monday or Tuesday for Chicago Monday for San Antonio and Utah they still have them today  one game over four nights  however we've talked about it already this is kind of a weird week  now the beauty of this story oh my God something fell in the other room and scared to live in but Jesus out of me right on are what was that  what was that  oh my God I got goosebumps  thought a person was in my house wow that's bad podcast  you know what we'll leave it in you guys can get it for real so the good news is these teams have  some droppable options Utah's like almost all droppable right now other than basically Colin Sexton the whole damn team is either hurt or Fringe level the Spurs have two guys that I'd argue are above Fringe Victor webinar obviously and then Trey Jones is above it but even he could probably move on from  harder now given that everybody else is hurt so his value goes up and then Chicago is the tough one because most of the guys there are guys you're gonna want to hold on to for you know the two games Friday Sunday if they're part of your lineup and then next week Chicago goes for games again so  you try you do your best and they're still kind of battling for that play in seeding situation so I don't know that they're about to you know sit anybody down unnecessarily but for Chicago you could make an argument for guys like Kobe white maybe to Sumo maybe Caruso I'd still rather hang on to those guys if I can  where it's in my opinion a little bit of an easier decision with a team like San Antonio or a team like Utah  the flip side of the equation once again comes down to the whole Friday Sunday thing because there are copious teams that still have three games left this week  only a couple that have three games over the next four days and we'll get to that in just a second but again if you're moving on from a team like a Chicago that has two games left this week like a Utah like a San Antonio these teams that have won game over four days and they also play Friday Sunday which is sort of the worst too  is there a way to take that Fringe player turn them into someone playing on Lower traffic days and maybe not cost yourself any games played so again some of this discussion comes down to how many guys you have playing on Friday and Sunday  I'm doing this show operating on the assumption that you have the exact average number of playing guys playing on those days which is 10 on Friday  and 11 on Sunday in a 13 rookie league but we did that math on Monday show you know the expectation is you have about 80% of your guys going on Friday because it's a 12 gamer 80% of 13 is 10.4  and then on Sunday when there's 13 teams going up to whatever that is 86 and change percent that gets you to 11.2 so my expectation is that you are exactly full on Friday you can start 10 guys you got 10 guys you can start them you don't have an overflow you're not under you're right on the money and on Sunday I'm operating on the assumption that unless you've already made some tweaks to it you probably have one extra guy playing that you could sacrifice  of course the problem there is that pretty much everybody plays on Sunday so if you're looking at okay you can kind of reverse engineer this thing what teams don't play on Sunday the Atlanta Hawks the Denver Nuggets the Detroit Pistons the Memphis Grizzlies don't play on Sunday  so if you do have that one extra player going on Sunday those are actually the 14 teams you should be targeting Denver being the least  enticing of them because they only have two games left yes they're both on low traffic days but again you know if you have 10 guys going on Friday there's a possibility maybe you don't have all 10 or you could get an 11th and it wouldn't be that big of a deal because someone on your teams probably gonna get ruled out at the last minute  which brings us to the other teams that are not playing on Sunday  Memphis Detroit  and Atlanta  those three teams have one thing in common  they each play three games over the next four days  there is a slight tweak in that Atlanta has a back-to-back today tomorrow  they dodged Friday and Sunday and they play on Saturday just like at the beginning of the week Atlanta has the best schedule this week and it was not closed so four game week all on non overload days  today and tomorrow well yesterday and today we're nine Gamers so again the expectation was you had probably about nine guys playing for your team no excuse me that's not right  like eight it was eight ish I think guys playing which again law of averages someone is going to probably have 10 guys going yesterday or today  but probably not without frankly having  a scheduled that sets up in kind of a weird way  the whole point of that is Atlanta had the best schedule this week and after they played on Monday and they were off yesterday their schedule is still very very good because now you're actually into the best part of it which is Wednesday Thursday Saturday if you can find a hawk to stream That Remains the advisable way to go this week  but let's assume for a moment that you do have 10 guys going on Friday and that probably because it's the second to last last week of the Season someone on your team is going to get ruled out with an hour or two to go before the Ballgame it's almost no chance at all 10 of your guys play  that just doesn't happen this time of year  so it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if you picked up a game on a Friday in a roster move you made today  and continue to try to dodge Sunday if you can because even if somebody got ruled out on Sunday you'd still have 10 guys that you could start most likely  those two teams that I just mentioned not Denver because Denver's only got two games arrested the way and it's tomorrow and it's Saturday so there's no reason to move to a nugget today anyhow because they don't play tonight  those two teams as we just mentioned are Detroit the Pistons and The Grizzlies they play today they're off tomorrow and they go Friday Saturday  so yes they do play on Friday which might be an overload day but if you're going to pick up somebody that goes on the light traffic days you might as well just pick up a team that plays on another day all so it doesn't hurt you like if you know take  comparing the Nuggets I guess to to Detroit for instance  oh you say oh well Detroit has a game on Friday I can't really use that anyway okay fine but  what if something goes wrong you might as well have a guy on a team that's playing three times over that span and just two  between today and Saturday basically you might as well get somebody who's playing three times  you can't do poorly if your team if you guys playing three out of four days  high traffic days low traffic days I don't give a flying leap  you do with it what you need to so you get to fry a with your piston that you picked up and someone else on your team gets real without you can drop that guy in and cover it  sure maybe you're the one lucky team we're all ten of your guys on Friday actually start and play and then yes that game from the Piston you picked up ends up being kind of a wash  but guess what you still got the two games you got otherwise  now again that's why I'd land is the best schedule because you don't have to worry about that late scratch stuff they play on the days where you are you have room for them in late scratches are going to happen to everybody at hopefully about an equal amount this time of year every fantasy team I mean but if you don't go hawk meaning if like Bruno Fernando and DeAndre Hunter and whatever other fringy Hawks are already on rosters  you don't  have to go just to a two gamer  you can go to a three gamer and cover your bases  the players you should consider and we've already talked about the Hawks 1000 times on these streaming shows so I don't really want to go through them again and I basically just said the two names that I would consider using  on Detroit  met to he's been very solid lately and appears to be active Jaden Ivy I don't think he's on wires all that much he's wildly over rostered considering how bad he is in nine cat but you know  okay and Cade probably sits one half of that back-to-back I would assume we don't know for sure but I think we can kind of safely assume that if Marcus Sasser comes back he would probably be playable I or waiting on Jalen Duren it sounds like he's gonna play if he sat then you go James Wiseman but it I don't think that one's gonna be relevant or necessary and then if you really want to go dumpster diving Evan Fournier would be the sort of deeply or and then on Memphis you got all these weird choices I don't know if Jordan Goodwin is gonna play in all three probably not so I don't think you can go that direction you can go Jake laravia as a streaming level guy Luke Kennard mitts out of back-to-back but he's playing pretty damn well  what else do I think would probably Gigi Jackson who I don't really like in nine cat but again three games in four days it doesn't really matter if I like them or not if they're actually involved in what's going on for a team then you look at it frickin salty aldama he's upright he's not playing well but three games in four nights  you have to at least look at it Lamar Stevens would be kind of more of a deeply Choice there and that's probably about as far as you go on the Memphis side as well but that's still a decent number of options and I'm guessing at least one of those guys is on your waiver wire he from the non Ultra deeply pile  the nice thing is well about about these particular teams is that because they don't play on Sunday you don't really have to worry about and this is for everybody you don't really have to wait to worry about making a move on Sunday so you can cash in all your move vouchers between today and Saturday  I don't know how many movies you guys have left but check out your roster see if you have anybody droppable on Utah San Antonio or Chicago and get to one of these teams that I just mentioned that has three games over that same span a interestingly and I don't want to get too far into the tomorrow part of things once you get to tomorrow Atlanta and Denver are the two teams that go twice on none high traffic days but there's actually a team that goes three times over that span  multiple actually that goes three times that include the high traffic days so you kind of have to wait and see if those guys would be useful for your team  do you is it worthwhile  do you need one more game on Friday so the next like today is still pretty clear who the drops and who the ads are between what teams you do starting tomorrow it gets real murky  and it's 100% base on how many guys you have going Friday and Sunday  today they're still a little bit of wiggle room there because the three game teams and the two game teams are all you know they've got those ones that match up all right  starting tomorrow  because again like you exclusively you're either going for somebody that's playing Thursday and Saturday if you're full on the overload days or you're going for somebody that maxes out games and they're a bunch of teams like that Dallas Golden State Houston the Clippers Miami he seems all Philadelphia Sacramento I'm scrolling and just pulling them up as I go all these teams start a really heavy scheduling run that might not help you at all because two of their three remaining games this week starting again tomorrow are on overload days  so you got to be real careful how you use your move starting tomorrow  I don't think I'd use a move on Friday Saturday you want to use all of your moves whatever you have left you got to use them on Saturday  so today you've got your clear drops tomorrow Friday  not much I wouldn't recommend a whole lot unless you have some spaces to fill and then Saturday blow the rest of it  why do I say wait until Saturday until tomorrow well because then you'll know what category is to hunt  by Saturday you're going to know exactly which player you want to get  you know have to guess at a cross the board thing you might be able to just go get a rebounder or something like that  Danno question from the chat room pick two for a points League Jaden Ivy Luke Kennard Al Horford and Clark amazing to I need at least one of them to be a center shhhhhh Beebo um you guys love I know I love Horford I mean again this comes down to scheduling stuff you know I  points like I think Jaden Ivey's got to be in there with Detroit's good schedule Clark I don't think plays in their back-to-back  if May 2 has Center eligibility I might go his direction as well to get those get those couple of low traffic days if you can use more guys on Friday Sunday  then you go Ivy and probably Horford  this is points League remember it was nine cat it would be Canard in Horford  yeah but points League's Ivy's got to be in there  the man I'm in the finals congrats but who is the best option for percentages Steeles and assist to turn over for today and Saturday my God  Max Drew's Luke Kennard Brandon Clark really hot tomorrow or Jayden Ivy Jaden Ivy is a disaster for percentages so he's off the table  hachimura isn't gonna get you any assists pretty good with percentages but not the other things you were looking for Clark probably good field goal percent and steals but not great at free-throw and assist Kennard can get you I would think free-throw assist maybe steals also  and Max Drews will probably get you  a little bit of everything so I'm probably gonna Spruce and Kennard  but that's not great for your field goal percent so if you're doubling up on the shooter types then you probably end up pretty good and free throw Steals and assists and I'm not sure you get the other thing so otherwise maybe you pair up Kennard for the free throw and assists  and pair him up with Clark maybe for Steals and field goal percent or go really who's good at both percentages and then you like you know what I'm probably just not gonna win steals so those are your kind of  two ways to roll the dice on that one  all right tomorrow I'm gonna do probably a streaming show but I don't know if it's gonna be really  have a point  we'll do it in case someone gets hurt maybe that's the rule there  thanks for watching everybody just a few of these left again I'm Dan bass first thanks as always please like And subscribe for God's sake people I mean times I must say it please do it enjoy the rest of your Wednesday let's win today do it again tomorrow
