welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast all right we're doing the shows flip a rude today it's our streaming guide first and our big weekly preview second and it's not for any sort of strategic purpose  it's entirely because my schedule dictates that I have 25 minutes right now to do one show and I'll have plenty of time in the middle of the day to do the other which is of course the longer one I gotta do the whole deal out on social media get the list put together get the anyway I am Dan bass this is fantasy NBA today well welcome to the program this is a sports ethos.com presentation and it's going to be a little bit different today pretty similar but a little bit different first we're going to break down the schedule's for today worst scheduled best schedules and then we'll get you the names of the players that fit on both sides the droppable the streamables all that good stuff  but I do want to look a little bit farther ahead because it's Friday I don't know what our I you know I couldn't possibly tell you when a weekend show might come because I don't know what my kids calendar is right now I'd like to try to get these streaming shows out over the weekend but I can't promise it  and so this is an opportunity for us to kind of look ahead to good schedules next week possible stashables maybe injured guys that are on the verge of coming back little things like that by the way there aren't that many of them so just a little extra on today's show so please do take a moment to like And subscribe this is a time of year when we actually see our subscription numbers go down which is so sad after we put in so much work but then we get it people are transitioning into the offseason they're doing something else they want to follow  whatever it is or they don't want to alerts so I need you guys that are new coming aboard here and watching during the playoffs and hopefully getting a lot out of it to be the new subscribers that help push this thing around also follow me on Twitter at Dan best press  let's take a look at some of the teams that are sitting on bad schedules today and those that are watching with us you guys can see the streaming chart I've actually opened it up a little bit wider today so you can see a little bit more you can go a couple of a couple of weeks down the line now because I do want to do more of a liquor head today lick ahead no I think you know what I meant so very quickly I'm just gonna scroll that sheet for anybody that's watching the video feed you guys can see how the different teams stack up and then we'll get into the actual discussion of worst and best  your worst schedules  today again this is laser focused on today right now  the very worst  is the Milwaukee Bucks  who are one of a number of teams that only have one game the rest of this week but the issue with Milwaukee is that one game at the is the rest of this week is Sunday so that's all ready problematic because you got to wait two days before you get them to play and then they're off for two days again after that  now there are a handful of names on Milwaukee that you just can't do anything about you know Dame Giannis like you're obviously not moving those guys and then Brooklyn Lopez finally surged back with a big ball game yesterday so you probably have no choice but to hang on to him but if you have anybody else on the blacks you got to let him go Bobbi Port is got to go Malik Beasley who was hurt yesterday obviously has to go because he put up a 0 he should have gone the minute he was ruled out and yesterday's ballgame that's a terrible schedule the good news for the box for Damon Giannis folks who continue to play next week is that they do have a back-to-back at the end of this one game over five days at least that salvages or begins to salvage a three-game week for them but it's really a it's a rough stretch  rough for Fantasy great for them because they get a whole bunch of rest but brutal for Fantasy the Bucks have a terrible schedule other teams that have bad schedules not quite as awful but still pretty bad the Lakers who I mean they've been on this list  every day really right since we started doing this show I think the Lakers have been on this list the Lakers played Sacramento two days ago they were on the list for the worst schedule yesterday with two games over eight days so you can do the math they got two games over seven days right now  the good news for the Lakers is that their two games are tomorrow and Monday so it's not the worst in a extreme short-term if you have a frenzy liqueur  you've made it this far you can actually hang on now  because you're going to get a game tomorrow you'll get a game on Monday at least they you know it's bad one game to finish this week when a lot of teams have two games the rest of this week but at least you get a game to start next week before you abandon ship because then they go three get eight three days off before their next ball game after that Oklahoma City actually has a slightly worse schedule than the Lakers they're all so two games over seven days but they have a game tomorrow and then they're off for three days after that if you want to look at it from a silver lining standpoint you could hold a thunder player and I mean again the issue with the Thunder is you have three extremely good fantasy players that you really can't abandon ship on Shea chat Jalen Williams if you were planning on streaming anybody else you get off of them on Sunday at least gives you an opportunity to maybe get to squeeze one game in at the end of this week but after tomorrow they go one game over five days just like we talked about with Milwaukee which is basically like the worst schedule you can talk about  one over five is the absolute worst that's 20%  you pretty much never see a team dip below the 20% game threshold like Leo talking about the Lakers having two games over 8 days that's awful even that's 25% over a longer span but you get it  so there isn't really you know Thunder if you like I don't know who the hell you'd be streaming on the Thunder anyway but if you are get out of the way and then we have four teams that go two games over six days those teams are Chicago Dallas Houston and the Knicks Chicago one game the rest of this week but like the Lakers they go Monday then they're off for two days after that where the Lakers are off three so it's not that horrendous for Chicago but I give you the full go ahead if you want to try to get some team that has four games over that six day stretch that would be a move that you could make to move off of them Dallas is schedule is worse because they're off for two days then they go Sunday and Tuesday so right now Dallas that puts Dallas in a one game in four days span if you're going to shrink the whole analysis up a little bit tighter so I would strongly make amend recommend getting off of your Dallas Mavericks find somebody that goes at least two games the rest of this week and preferably starts next week maybe with the game as early as Monday Houston is the next one their schedule is just the tiniest click better than Dallas but still not good because they go tomorrow instead of Sunday and then they have two games off so at least you could hold your rocket through their game tomorrow  if you then wanted to get off of said Rockets this is not a mandatory dump because you know these teams with two games off and set of three games off or three days off rather like you could probably hold through it but if you wanted to drop a rocket you could do so on Sunday because starting on Sunday they are still two games over six days but then you're beginning that stretch with a with the two off days if that makes sense and then the Knicks who I believe are the same schedule is the Lakers so you're probably not gonna make a move right away but just know that you could probably turn a two-game over six days span into a four game over six days span or you just hang on because they're going every other day starting yesterday through Monday and then move off of a Nick on Tuesday of next week when you can also go for games over six days or shorter  because when you make a move  on a team that has two off days in a row and then a game in another off day that's one over four so you're looking for those one over four is mixed in here that you could possibly turn into a three over four and really maximize games over and even shorter span that's I mean that's the ultimate in streaming is to get two extra games played over as short as possible which is basically obviously you could turn a team that's off for two days into a back-to-back but then you have to use moves way too frequently  turning a team that's playing one game over four days when she was playing three over four is in my opinion better because you get two extra games you chew up four days that allows you to kind of long stream instead of short stream so those are the bad schedules let's talk about the good schedules now good schedules coming up belong to the Utah Jazz they are way out ahead of everybody because you've sat through Utah had just an atrocious schedule remember that span starting on Tuesday of lacks last week where they had three games over 10 days I think it was  yeah that was a bone crushing Run for the Utah Jazz they had a stretch in there where they had two games over eight days also just like we talked about with the Lakers well you made it and your reward is five and seven Utah Jazz go today tomorrow Monday Wednesday and Thursday of next week it's a super heavy load you're gonna see some regulars get a day off in there you already see Jordan Clarkson being ruled out ahead of time for this ball game  which is notable because again they really haven't played very much lately and I wouldn't be surprised to see some of their other guys ruled out in there you might see Lowry marketing and come back at some point during this stretch it sounds like he's actually inching his way closer which is gonna muck up all the streams that we're talking about but  you know keep your mind to it Chris Dunn by the way is already been ruled out for one of the back-to-backs here Utah's in tank mode now so you have to be aware of that but it means that you know it's not a stream but if you have counted George he's gonna get a bazillion shots here coming out I wouldn't be blown away to see Walker Kessler get a game off I wouldn't be a blown away to see John Collins get a game off not that these guys are old old but  Kessler's been beat up and Collins is you know more of a veteran than the other guys on the team  if Taylor Hendricks comes back he'd be a very interesting stream over this five and seven Brice Sensabaugh who I don't like at all against the games cap but five games in seven days that's a playable name  there aren't many others for the Jazz  especially when you're sort of looking and seeing Oh who are all these dudes that are getting ruled out on a night tonight basis so it makes it hard to pick guys up  you might detail Norton Tucker play Big minutes in like two out of the five games but in my opinion that's not enough to make him a viable stream Lucas semantics is all so someone that might play Big minutes in like two or three out of the five games so like  squeezing up against it but for the most part it's Hendricks if he comes back and sensible because those guys would play I would say reliably 20 to 30 minutes in probably all five games so 100 is like your low end for minutes played and 150 is the high end which would be a really big win even if they're not piling up a fantasy stats they're just playing enough to be fantasy relevant ah the other teams with good schedules it's a pretty big drop off after that you taught so far ahead of everybody Detroit is the next one they're like a distant tier 2 I would argue kind of all by themselves but tier 2 and 4 here are separated it's razor thin Detroit goes three games in four days  Miami also goes three games in four days so maybe I should lump these two together all I see them differently in my mind Detroit goes three games in four days but on Sunday it actually starts to stretch of six games over nine days for the Pistons which is a really good you know 67% games played over a nine-day stretch that's really really good but if you wanted to start now you could you don't have to wait until Sunday if say some money Funk heels floating around or if I say a Stewart is floating around I don't know that I'd go any deeper than those guys with Detroit guys like Marcus Sasser they're not really playing enough Quentin Grimes is still out and I don't know if he played back to back even if he did get back in there  Evan Fournier was playing kind of okay right when he popped up but now he's completely vanished so it's really stew and funky  but they have a really nice schedule for 11 days here  seven games over 11 that's pretty good you know it's not it's not quite two thirds it's a little bit below that I think it's like 63%  so that's still pretty good though over 11 days so if you want to go megalong stream Detroit would be the way to go with that if you don't want to go mega long stream I still feel like if you pick up a piston you kind of need to hold  all the way through that 11 day span because otherwise you're gonna miss out on one of the two back-to-backs which are not that far apart  but if you were really freaking out you could make a move on Tuesday of next week I wouldn't do it but you could Miami on the other hand you probably want to make a move sooner so they have three games in four days but they don't have any other back-to-backs looking way down the schedule so if you're holding on to a heat after Monday you're getting games every other day it's not a horrible schedule you know they pivot into every other day situation going on after Monday but you could very easily make the case to make a move on to Tuesday or Thursday or Saturday of next week or whatever you know and I get a tan you don't boost a ton of ball games but you'd probably gain one still Miami again over this four-day span today Sunday Monday so you start next week with the game you can front load it a little bit and there are a couple of options there Caleb Martin Jaime is Junior those guys are very much viable streaming options Duncan Robinson is likely picked up here because Heroes been out for a while but you got two really good streamers on Miami so at this point that's an interesting way to go and then if you really need to back it up to the the tightest of the tight there are a couple of teams that go back to back today and tomorrow those two teams are poor Lind  Charlotte in New Orleans I don't know why I missed place that for a minute sorry no not Portland when back to back yesterday today it's just Charlotte in New Orleans I was reading the wrong thing get your get your head in the game Dan so Charlotte if Trey man got dropped he came back and might play in the back to back  so maybe  it's not only a midget she's likely been added since Cody Martin went down Grant Williams is streamable if someone dropped to make a richer he would be streamable so they're a handful of possibilities on the Charlotte Hornets I don't think I'd go beyond that and then New Orleans didn't really have any streamables because they're heavy on the top six for the pals and then you've got like Naji Marshall and Jose Alvarado that are gonna get probably about 20 minutes  but I would very much strongly recommend against  going back to back on those guys because 40 minutes over two games is really not all that much especially when you consider that you're then basically forced to make another move on Sunday because the pills they go two days off after that I got a four game week next week but you don't want one of those super low end streamers with two off days Blended in and Charlotte they pivot into a terrible schedule after their back to back so I really don't like going for the back-to-backs those two options are way down my board  specially when you consider the fact that if you're going to go that route and you're just basically looking for two games of this week but it doesn't help you next week at all go for any oh Atlanta by the way sorry I forgot to mention the Hawks they actually have three games in four days starting today as well I just completely jumped right over them I don't know why I did that I need to get my head on straight Hawks do have a couple of possible streamers I don't know that I'd be crunchy playing a bunch but like Bruno Fernando is streamable three games in four days but you'd have to get off of the Hawks after that because they're scheduled goes two and six afterwards  um  but when I was going to making there was if you're looking at the back-to-backs you might as well just go for any team that has two games the rest of this week  and then there are better options you know what if Gary Trent comes back that'd be a great player to use the rest of this week  doesn't help you all that much next week Toronto schedules not that good after Sunday but two big games out of a player certainly better than to super low end games just because they're back to back  you should be long streaming anyway  so I didn't put the Tweet normally I put the Tweet up on the screen at this point so you guys can like see the names of the players I'm listing I need you guys to just remember that today I need you just remember it we've got about probably call it 10 ish minutes left on this show and I want to use those 10 minutes to start to look towards what do you do if say you're on a buy this week or I don't talk about if you're on a buy next week that's almost too far Apple what if you were on a buy this week were you don't have to worry at all about what you're doing today tomorrow Sunday that kind of stuff well first thing is try to hold off on using any of your moves until Saturday or Sunday because you never know when a player on your team might get injured and that becomes the most important move for you to make is to abandon ship on a player that was about to put up a 0 I also want to mention before we get into the stashes please check out our buddies over at manscaped.com

the rest of this year and come back I mean I go shows all off season but you know I don't have to watch all of them if you don't want come on back next year got a sort of keep rolling them up all right let's get back to this discussion of what's coming up in the future so if you're looking at next week which by the way is a much heavier Games Week than this week but not in the way you'd think  first of all everybody looking at the screen right now you can see the Boston starts a five and seven on Sunday which is cool and all but for next week that means that you're only like kind of semi front-loaded that's almost better for folks that don't have a buy that want to go with like a Celtic Reserve like a Sam Houser or Payton Pritchard those guys put up really big numbers on their last back-to-back and again Boston's playing bad teams so they're definitely going to be resting half of their guys in each of these games Sunday Monday that's a really good opportunity to get big numbers in both of those  but unfortunately and look if you're if you're if you have a buy and you're stashing and you want to go sell Celtics you could do it you could go Sam Houser and hope that he has a big game on Monday and a bad game on Wednesday and then they have another back-to-back Friday Saturday next week where maybe he gets kind of loose again so maybe three out of four good ones so it's not insane but you are taking a little bit of a risk there where maybe you don't necessarily have to  we already talked about Detroit as having a good schedule starting on Sunday  what we haven't talked about is the fact that there really aren't many just a small handful of teams that have a really good schedule starting on Monday of next week because if you're stashing if you're in a buy you're looking for who can front load next week meaning basically does anybody go Monday Tuesday the answer is yes Minnesota but then they have a horrible schedule after that Minnesota like generally a pretty bad schedule these days in total they got what two games over seven days after that back to back so if you go Minnesota to start next week just know you're going to be reserving a move to use on Wednesday to get off of the Timberwolves  the nice thing is because you have a buy you can do that  you can pick up two Timberwolves over the weekend I don't know who they'd be not read probably got dropped or probably got held during their bad schedule but guys like my Conley might have gotten dropped you could pick him up for the back to back Monday Tuesday and then immediately abandon ship again tequila Alexander Walker's probably gonna be borderline in there if Kyle Anderson comes back you have an opportunity to wait until Sunday to find out if these guys are healthy they have a game Saturday maybe you get to see some of them in that one some of these guys come back from Minnesota you could start your week with two of them and then you have you still have all of your moves on Wednesday and then you make a move on Wednesday going sort of who plays in three times in four days starting on Wednesday of next week Boston who we just talked about goes three times in four days on Wednesday so you could go with the the Payton Pritchard Sam Houser thing Milwaukee has a back-to-back so you could use two moves there and still have two moves left for Friday Saturday Sunday Phoenix on Wednesday of next week Sacramento is a perfect that's your ultimate one on Wednesday of next week because that's starting a five and seven  Utah and Toronto all of those teams go three and four or better starting on Wednesday of next week if you wanted a front load your schedule with Timberwolves  if you want to get real Saucy and start your week with a three and four basically  you load up you front load your next week with teams that go three games the first four days you could do that with three players if you wanted to and then you'd basically have all of your moves left all the way through Friday unless you had to drop an injured player  those teams are Utah because we just talked about them starting a five and seven ah today Sacramento actually has a really good schedule starting next week and then rolling all the way through the beginning of the following week with Sacramento goes three games in four days to start next week  and that's it those two  Sacramento and the Utah Jazz are the two teams that go three times in four days to start next week so if you wanted to power up on jazz  you could you'd probably have to do it today because other people in your league are gonna be fighting that don't have a buy because they have those five games in seven days you taught a back-to-back you're going to be competing Sacramento is a team where because they only had one game over the last four days of this week you might be able to see you know like if Kevin heard her playing let's say he comes back healthy he actually be pretty good three games in four days  Sacramento didn't have too many guys that are getting dropped though I don't think anybody's dropping Malik monk or dear and fox or demonic sabonis or Keegan Murray if they did drop Murray then obviously he'd be the guy there but that's how you'd start next week you don't have to worry about a great schedule for the entire week you can either go Minnesota for the back to back at the front end and then use your moves on basically Wednesday and Sunday or Wednesday and Friday of next week or you can go Sacramento Utah front load for four days and then you get to power through you can go back to back on Friday for a bunch of them and then more pickups on Sunday you get a lot of games played that way I mean really getting a buy and fantasy is just such a ridiculous advantage and that's how you power boost the beginning of next week I have two minutes here to scan the chat room to see if anybody brought up something that I did not bring up on the streaming side I'm not going to give you like yes or no stuff um  there are no updates on Bagley or Rashawn Holmes that's a good question and sadly the answer is no Rashawn Holmes was questionable going into yesterday's ballgame so I assume he's gonna be questionable going into the next one Washington has a weekend back-to-back damn it would be nice if he came back for those though  Bagley got ruled out well in advance so I don't think we see him for at least another three four ball games  after you taught us five games stream is it reasonable to drop key on a Gorge or other pretty good players I don't think I would because then they just segue right into an every other day basically for the end of time and can't do George has been good enough to Warrant holding for that type of stretch because they go five and seven and then they're off one on off on off on off on there they gave a four game week both next week and the week after that so I if you have a super fringy Jazz and you wanted to move off that's okay but for the ones that are actually pretty good I think I'd probably stick with it  what about scoot Henderson I'm fine with him for this Portland hot spell but that basically just ended the Blazers go into kind of a light schedule right now it's three games over seven days it's not bad but I wouldn't pick him up for this stretch if you're going to pick him up it's got to be for a really heavy span uh would I pick up Taylor Hendricks yes if he's healthy he he's a go because Utah has this really good  playoff buy next week yeah we'll get into that at in due time you don't need to make moves right now for if you have a buy next week if you're playoffs start on March 25th you don't need to be doing anything to prepare for that today because guys are going to be in guys you're gonna be out stuff's gonna happen  I'm scared to have a buy don't be scared it's the best it gives you so much wiggle room if your players get hurt you've loaded up with five six extra games that your opponent can't get that's gonna cover you on that do you think Al Horford is a good pickup for next week that's a really good question my answer is probably not  but if he rests the game against Washington on the front end of this coming back to back you then get Horford for a big game probably on Monday and a big game potentially on Wednesday if we're singing this isn't back yet and then one out of two big games in the second back to back so in that case the answer is sort of because three good games out of Horford the first five or six days next week would be worth it  but if he plays against Washington to finish this week and sits Monday of next week then you end up basically with like a three-day or a two-day Gap and then a game and then possibly another two-day Gap and then I would say no because then it's just not heavy enough all right I gotta go  I got stuff going on with family I hope this was helpful for this week and next week maximize those games let's win let's keep this going I'm gonna try to get these streaming shows going over the weekend so I can give you some indications on Saturday Sunday I don't know at all what time of day it might be that if there's a day game are there Day games this weekend  let's do a quick check on that so I know Saturday a couple hours early but nothing crazy obviously Sunday there's an early one so Saturday I'll try to get a streaming show going before the game starts Sunday I doubt it so if we get that one out tomorrow we'll try to make it sort of like a two-day stream discussion and then remember later on today we're going to do the weekend review because a lot of folks you guys are still playing Roto some of you were not in the playoffs as you heard there are some guys out there popping up that are actually kind of rest of season type of looks and I want to make sure we cover those as well thanks for listening everybody I'll talk to you guys in a couple hours like rate subscribe that way you know in the next show is coming I'll see you then
