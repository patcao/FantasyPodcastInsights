welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  my favorite part of the Year continues when I talked to other living beings on this show this is the little things in life people don't realize I shout into the void like 200 some odd days in a row every year and it is  it is lonely man I got this draft board Separates Me from the rest of the Living World  and I mostly just talk to three and six year olds every day they're mine they're my children so it's not that weird but I don't even know how to interact with growing UPS luckily growing UPS continue to give me a chance and on this one we got a meeting of the dance dan Titus as this the first time I've had you on the show it is it is what am I doing but a long time follow-up sport ethos so like love what you've been doing and obviously pushing the fantasy basketball industry forward I think it's gonna get continued to get even more popular so it's great to talk to you about the draft that I thought that I liked you know two weeks ago and now that I'm looking at my roster I'm like maybe not as much but yeah it's going to be fun fun conversation for sure yeah so um this was this is the way that a lot of them go because the it's a slow mock which so then it takes five six days for you to even happen and then I slowly try to get everybody scheduled in after the fact and that takes another week and so you've got this like present version of Dan looking back at past version of Dan this could be from me too I was talking about you but it could also be for me trying to figure out what was like doing what the hell was I thinking at that point by the way you can follow Dan on Twitter at Dan Titus he like me has elected to make his name his Twitter handle I super easy simple nothing creative you know my name is my name yeah I like the shirt by the way shout out to the fantasy nerds shirt yes shout out to Robin marks man doing some really great content over belief fantasy basketball and also has some really dope merch so make sure you guys cop some um I wear this one around a lot it means a lot to me because I love fantasy and I'm most definitely a nerd yeah that's very well dude I agree I got the same logo I went t-shirt I see you went hoodie but you live in Los Angeles so I don't know when you're gonna break that I'm actually up North I'm in the Bay Area oh right actually sneaky cold around here although it's like 90 degrees today I don't know what's going on so I definitely blast in the AC right now yeah he just nailing yourself with a hoodie that is that's a little bit of vanilla sense but I'm a hoodie guy I don't know yeah I am also kind of a hoodie guy I don't I went to Cal so I spent a bunch of time in the bay and I feel like I never really dropped the like I'd rather just wear a hoodie and jeans every day no matter how hoodie and shorts like I have no problem with that but like I never wear a jacket no never going scarf whether I've always just scared Philly so I never understood why every time I cross the bridge I'm like why are people wearing scarves and like bubble jackets it's not that cold no hoodie that's all you need I'm right on board with you let me throw the mock-up on the screen here so up let me move our faces all so everybody can get the best look possible I do this at the beginning I apologize to everyone this is as large as I can make this thing and I even lopped off the 12th round at the bottom so if you got a squint you got to squint I did post this on Twitter right after the mock ended some week and a half ago or so she could probably zoom in a higher number of pixels on that bad boy but then you had the first pick which is dare I say an enviable position in a mock draft I'm not even gonna ask you about number one other than to say  are there any avenues that closed off for you starting with Nicole yokich um probably blocks and I think that I was pretty consistent with that throughout I realized that you know anytime you get someone that's as dynamic as Nicola yokich that you're probably gonna be very good you're probably going to compete in rebounds and assists in scoring so I kind of tried to just lean into that throughout the rest of my build  I would never consider anyone else other than yo kids at the number one pick and I know it's boring it's consensus amongst  most analysts but like hey man if it's not broke don't fix it this guy is the best player on the planet and he just happens to be all the best fantasy player on the planet so I felt great I very seldom get the first pick in the draft so once I saw I got number one I was like all right let's get let's get you it's yoki's time how do I how do I want to build off of that so I was very excited to to get it the literally the only downside to getting the number one pick is that you don't really have to do anything with your brain until 24 picks into a draft because you don't like yeah you're watching the timer countdown to get into the Moc and this was a slow mock so even that didn't really happen so like you didn't have to do anything until the end of the first day of as I'm just waiting and waiting all right what value will fall to me but you'll see like as I got to the third round things started to get a little bit questionable I'm like I see value on the board and usually when you're on these like you know beginning of the board or the end of the board sometimes you got to take some swings because the those players that you really want your guys which I always advocate for people to get like if you like a player you want them on your team go get them when you got that first pick you may not get them coming back so sometimes you got to take a home run swing here and there talking to Dan Titus over at Yahoo fantasy the the I don't know if you'd call him swings or not I actually I actually really like your second round pick I think I like him more than most was Desmond Bane at 24 and James Harden at 25 I want to remind everybody this draft happened before hardened I mean I don't know Champs told us that he's been professional and engaged but he hasn't been there so not really present not really showing up for work lately I don't know how he's been hanging with Lil Baby how do you stay in Personnel day we don't know what he's doing he's like on a WhatsApp thread with his team is that what engaged is at this point I mean I don't know man so walk me through Desmond Bane because with hard and I'm guessing you probably would have waited a little longer given what we know now versus two weeks ago but I like being a lot and I feel like people are saying now he's not gonna get to that next run but early last season before he got hurt he was right around top 25 range he was before that toe injury that was disguised as something else didn't really give much Clarity that injury but like reporting dude was dude was unconscious him and Tyrese Maxey before their respective injuries and you know just looking at the tea leaves here obviously John Moran is going to be missing 25 games and then Marcus Smart enters the fold and not think he's gonna take too much usage away from Desmond Bane like this is going to he's going to be the number one option now and that's 30% usage I think we're gonna see an uptick in those assists he was a capable Pastor last year all the stats are going up and for how was young as he is and where he has where he is at in his career in terms of the the equity in terms of the chemistry that he has with the other players I think he's going to be through the roof and I think getting him a 24 is where I expect him to go I don't expect them to get out of the third round if you get them the third round awesome but I'd be willing to take them you know midse second round because I'm that high on them I think he's going to be an outstanding category player and also be that good in points leads as well  was there anyone else that went shortly before you in the second round that you were strongly considering there  I got a zoom in on the on the camera you and everybody you and everybody else Cunningham actually was was one person that I really wanted to pair with Nicole yokich I just love the versatility that kid Cunningham can provide you know almost a triple double one of those kind of guys I think he fits very well in a yogic build the other one that's been kind of creeping up I was surprised at Mikel Bridges went where he went but I'm not mad at it you know he's a mid-second you know late second round pick and I would say Devin Booker is a guy that I think I've seen kind of fluctuate in terms of his draft Capital seen him in the early second round as far as the late second just depending on you know where people's wrist posture is but I think I was pretty happy getting Bane where I got him I was surprised that more analysts weren't in on him a little bit earlier in the second round yeah that was Bane was and I don't want to get too far side tracked here was one of those guys going into the offseason where I kept thinking like man I hope that just suspension doesn't push him too far up the board and then yeah I did push him pretty far up the board but still not bad let's um let's actually do this discussion assuming that James Harden is playing somewhere because like that's what that's where we were at when the draft happened and plus that's kind of all so what you had to be thinking as you went through the remainder of your bills so now you've got two tennis assistant guys out  of your first three picks you get to sit and wait a very long time it gets back to you at the end of the fourth beginning fifth you went Jaylen Brown and Scotty Barnes and I'm I again I'm kind of bunching your picks because you take them back to back so you can flip them in any order what was the thought process here once you got through this long wait in between picks um so being that I already got as you said I was addressing the assist pretty much at the top of the first three rounds I thought it was best to kind of build out the rest of the roster and seeing that I have Jalen Brown ranked in the top 40 I also have Scotty Barnes early top 50 I thought that was a good time to grab both of those guys you know obviously Jalen Brown's the richest NBA player on the planet right now even though he doesn't have a left hand he's still gonna be really good for the Boston Celtics he's improved every year I think we're gonna see more rebounding from him he's solid for steals I think he can also get a half a block in there so I am very bullish on Jalen Brown think he's gonna be the second highest score next to Jayson Tatum k p still gonna be solid by I think he's going to be more of an efficiency guy I don't know we'll see the numbers that we saw in Washington but I'm really high on Jalen Brown and then Scotty Barnes definitely taking a bit of a wrist not a wrist more of a flyer on him taking that next level in his third NBA season I think it kind of plateaued last year but I think it was more about the the Raptors kind of going in this weird state of Are We rebuilding are we competing and now that Fred Van vliet's gone I think that that opens up more assists for him as a point forward and clearly every other NBA team has questioned or wanted him as a part of a trade package and the Raptors that said absolutely not so reading those tea leaves I'm thinking that he's going to be in for a very impactful season this year and I said PayPal see how because I do think that the Raptors would be it would be in their best interest to do so wait let me make sure everybody can see that watching there it is Big to be in their best interest to pay if they don't want to you know I think that that's a even going to be even better for Scotty Barnes if he is eventually traded you know midseason for some for some other assets to continue that rebuild because I think that this team is really looking to build around Scottie Barnes so I think we could see his best season yet even though his rookie season was phenomenal I think there's top 50 upside here if this guy's assistant go up to the way I expect them to did you consider going a big man in this range at all or had you already kind of made up your mind you were gonna leave blocks probably on the table Yeah I think blocks are on the table or off the table now for me I felt comfortable because I already locked in Center so when as I've been approaching a lot of mock drafts this year if I've gone big man with my first pick I usually go you know guard forward Centric thereafter until the later rounds were I'm just loving all of the big men in the in the later rounds you know the Mark Williams the Jalen Darren's who ended up on my team use of narcot Zach Collins like I don't think you need to overspend for centers if you get one earlier on so and even in those mid rounds you can get the operating goons The Walker Kessler's and so forth so I felt pretty good about my Center position and I and I depending on you know I've had to reach for Jalen Duren and Mark Williams sometimes in the seventh round but I felt good about where my draft position was to be able to fill out the rest of my roster and then getting Center later yeah and you know you don't really have a choice when you're at  an end of a draft it if there's a guy you want and this is something that I know I I still struggle with mentally even after doing this on the analyst side of the the wall for the last six or seven years is coming to terms with this idea of oh am I removing value from a player by taking him in a spot I didn't want but if if it's not getting back to you for 22 23 picks  right what value is left at that point you're taking guys you didn't want so yeah and to that end I adore your picks at 72 and 73 here cam Johnson who I mean this is way later than he usually goes in drafts and then write about that I think that was a nice little fall and value and then follow that up with Jalen Durant to secure that other Center spot usually I'm playing on Yahoo but you know if there's any standard default for two centers I usually end up with one of Jalen Duren or Mark Williams and you know based on the build he could probably get me blocks you know he's had several four three block games I'm not saying that he's gonna carry me for an entire week but he will certainly contribute to it and I think some of the other players that I got Jaden McDaniels is another guy that I'm very high on from a stocks perspective yeah I mean you by the way you can you can talk about as many of these players as you like we don't we don't have to go one by one because you did you did kind of line up like cam Johnson threes free throw steals are the positive there urine who I just talked about earlier today on a show is one of my favorite players to watch in the league because of the way other people bounce off of him it's just insane he's so strong and then McDaniels who's like a 211 guy in three steals blocks you short up a few categories that I don't know that they were weak necessarily because yokich gets steals hard and gets some Jalen Brown gets some barns get some but if you're leaning into those things you want to keep powering them up on that head to head side yeah I think that's a great point and I think that was my impetus in one to get Jalen Brown because he's a three-point guy Scotty Barnes not so much but Cameron Johnson getting him where I did I was like oh man that's this is really complete in the puzzle right here and then I think I got some value almost in Derek white I think he felt kind of late considering that I think he's gonna be you know an excellent catching shoot three-point shooter now that Drew holiday is there and he was last season you know he's a 40% three-point shooter but then also he's a sneaky blocks guy like he was is only second to say gills us Alexander last year in Blacksburg game from the guard position so you know as much as I was punting blocks I think I actually did a pretty good job of trying to at least keep me competitive amongst the rest of the league I might be able to steal a couple weeks in blocks when I wasn't normally expecting to yeah that's one of the nice things about head-to-head versus Roto and you guys know everybody knows that I'm a big rodeo guy but there is something satisfying about like accidentally backing into three or four winds in a category you're like oh that's punted it but okay you know Derek White had a seven block week at it you're like okay terrific all right let me ask you follow up on Derek white actually because he was one of the guys I wanted his sort of slowed down on here have people sourd on him too much now with other folks on the team with since the addition of poor Singas and then maybe more  directly Drew holiday I think so um you know Noah Rubin I think he was team Derek white since the beginning of the off-season and I don't know like his ADP right now on Yahoo is falling he was 85th before which I thought was still a little bit low I had him originally and like that 6869 range and you know now he's going 92 so I think that the market is way too low on Derek white for what he can do across categories right like field goal percentage is definitely gonna be a little bit low but I think he can get to 4546 percent especially playing with so many Dynamic players in that starting lineup but  I think he just offered too much in the stocks categories to not value him as like a top 70 guy so if he continues to fall and drafts I'm going to scoop them because I didn't that's great value considering what he brings to the table when he doesn't really command that much usage and he'll still be effective yeah I I'm like I can't argue with you I actually want to rewind to Jaden McDaniels how does he potentially grow this year because that's what we all want to see  yeah and I think the first thing is that the Minnesota Timberwolves need to give him that extension I think it's going to be it's going to be on the horizon you know after Devin vassell just got his extension he's been prioritized as one of the Cornerstone pieces of this Minnesota Timberwolves team yeah the question I have is like how is Chris Finch going to figure out the rotation yeah and I don't know that there's gonna be a lot of usage for McDaniels to be like a 15-point score like I don't I don't think it's gonna get there yet but I think we could carve out a 12  12 5 3 assists with two and a half stocks potentially that's going to be the value in category League's points leads I'm not that high on him just because he doesn't have the volume and the  end the usage to really warrant being in a points League guy but head-to-head I think it's similar to Derek white it's like if I can get stocks cheap  I'm all in and he's an efficient player too shoots good field goal percentage good three-point shooter I think there's an opportunity for him to kind of emerge as potentially the third option in the offense you know you got Aunt cat gobert nah and my Colin's been more of a facilitator so I think we could actually see some growth in Jenny McDaniels offensive skill set this year your last three that I like to lump together as well because I mean really what's the numbers yeah they're definitely lumper once you pick one 20 you're lumping you went like kind of weirdly safe with your last three and Evita zubats at 120 Jordan Clarkson at 121 and then Bobby Portis at 1:44 in the Mr Irrelevant Robert uh oh I still haven't forgiven him for sending Nico Mirage to another country so it's career after that completely again no and for years I made jokes on Twitter about following me Heritage around in an RV to see if I could convince him to come back and because he had a really nice Fantasy game it was like Larry marketing before Larry marketing and that's right but  gone forever anyway walk me through kind of safely picks because usually it's actually an industry Mike's you see analysts going like full you know like eyes closed a Home Run hack and you kind of went the other way with established like plotting Center established scoring guard established backup big man who scores and rebounds there's like nothing fancy there you kind of know exactly what you're getting yeah I think it was more of a hedge to all right so for zubac I was like I need another big man just in case during doesn't work out and I need to plug somebody else into that Center Spot I was kind of light I only have durian you'll get and zubats that had Center eligibility so that was the impetus there but then also he also is a sneaky black guy low end Double-Double on a Cajun when they're not playing small so I thought it was a pretty low risk move there and I think he's actually going he's usually a late round pick so I think one of my general theories is is that you know when you're getting to that 11 12th round get someone with a high with a relatively safe floor so that in case one of your you know earlier picks doesn't pan out you have someone to plug in and centers are such a scarce position in terms of that this format with two centers I think it's important to grab one for insurance Jordan Clarkson is interesting because I mean field goal percentage I think I had enough guys that they should be able to compete but I think I was probably gonna be middle of the pack and field goal percentage so at that point I'm like just give me a 20-point bucket and Jordan Clarkson's going to be starting this season at the two so I think that you can pretty much in there for 20 points per game he'll help the threes get some steals in there doesn't really do much else but I was cool with getting a 20-point score in the 12th round the 11th round and then Bobby Portis I don't really have much justification for this I just wrote an article about how Bobby Porter just ends up on my team somehow someway  thought process there I'm getting a guy then give me 14 and 7 with some threes he shoots decent from the free throw line for a big man like 75% so I feel like he's not gonna hurt my team that much and while I could have taken a flyer I saw a lot of good guys going you know in that later round so you know I'm in Thompson Thompson was off the board PJ Washington was off the board Paul Reed went you know two picks before me so I was like  all right Bobby come on in man you're used to we're used to this let's keep it safe it was definitely boring and I felt like the final three to four picks were definitely on the boring side but sometimes boring works and you know for where I was and this is a couple weeks ago I think I have a couple sleepers that have emerged since the preseason action and you know rotations have kind of changed and starting lineups have kind of taking shape a little bit I could probably could have taken a different flyer but where I was you know a couple weeks ago I felt pretty good about it we're talking to Dan Titus of Yahoo fantasy at Dan Titus on Twitter this is Easter egg part of the show now where we talk about the late ones that you did not get and you actually mentioned a few during your last answer hopefully people were paying close attention you said Paul Reed you said I'm at Thompson I already forgot who the third one PJ Washington I think was the third one I'm sorry my brain yeah parents it's blaming father clock man I'm already have the kid on my clock oh my God I got two hours before things are about to go nuts around here that's I get it I don't know if you saw me disappear for just a second but it was cuz my younger one just got home with my the his grandma and the dog was freaking out to get out of my locked bathroom door I was like I'm gonna ask Dan a really good question and then bye bye yeah I learned to be efficient in weird ways when you're you know you got one so still learning but yeah I get it yeah it it's an avalanche man it's all right so tell me a little bit more about  your and these are what the the young folk like to refer to as sleepers I don't know what the right word is at this point because I feel like you know experts those of us that are I say expert is such a hoity-toity way to express it just those of us that are staring at this all exactly yes that's the proper way those of us that are just staring at fantasy basketball names we know all these names already but there are also people that come in that are novice level intermediate level so I needed they need a word and the word that out there is sleeper so we use it so uh Paul Reed PJ Washington I'm in Thompson who are some of the guys at the end and what do you think they might be able to do  yes so those are like late round I'd say like probably 11 12 13 range one guy that I think is is driving crazy up the draft boards as a star Thompson and I think it's totally justified now that he's on the verge of being a starter what he can do stocks wise I think is going to be very impressive for Fantasy I've been calling him the young Sixers Andre Iguodala he's kind of that playmaking Guru guy with extreme athleticism that I think is actually going to be very useful in fantasy League's and he's going well outside you know the top one 20 in fantasy drafts one guy I think is being slept on is Trey Murphy and that's because he tours meniscus you know month and a half ago he had a 10 to 12 week timetable so that put some around November December time frame but people might have gotten it's got the top 40 last year and I don't know that he's necessarily going to be inserted right into the starting lineup but even as a six-man with his efficiency he's a he has to be on your roster shoot he's a 80 top 80% tile in catch and shoot threes so he's gonna be a 40% guy from three-point line shoots a high percentage from the field he's very efficient and he gets steals so this is like a prototypical 3D Wing that I want on my fantasy team in category leagues and you can get him super cheap you know after a right around the 100 picnic sleepers everyone has different terminologies but I usually consider a sleeper anyone that's going Beyond top 100 so you know is that Collins falls into that territory another guy that they think is going to smash his ADP just giving the fact that he's a starting center the San Antonio Spurs are top three and Pace last year they're going to be even more Pace this year with Victor webinar and the lineup yeah just nutmegging people in the preseason you know my God like what what happening from like catching tips slams from the three-point line now he's just nutmeg and guys like bro what was Reggie book that was like  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends

like to see one of the biggest people on Earth make that face about someone being bigger than them that's how I feel when I walk into any room of average size humans so I you know I like Thomas I see you man I see you yeah we see you we regular sized humans we feel this way about everybody um are you when you when you think about someone these guys at the end of a draft like a train Murphy actually the one that I wanted to kind of follow up on here and then we'll do one or two questions from the chat room  being willing to stash a player at the beginning of the year I find is something that's very much like right on the Razors Edge  do you have to feel very comfortable with the health or predictability of the first five or six picks like what if you I mean you have James Harden so let's actually use him as a good example here would you still feel comfortable stashing a trade Murphy even with your third round pick maybe sitting out the first X number of weeks of the years that's something that would creep into your mind as you're planning things out I would because you don't win your fantasy league in the draft so by immediately being able to stash the money in il I'm like cool I got first dibs on waivers like I don't have to like go through this mental exercise of oh man who do I want to drop and am I making a mistake dropping someone too early that started off slow I actually love the fact that you can draft him and then stash him open up a roster spot and then go get that guy that you weren't anticipating that sitting on waivers or like you know what Jeremy Sohan is a guy that  you know he was being drafted but like he's not 100% rosters ship right now and now that he's been anointed to starter I'm like cool if I already drafted and I'm going right to the waivers and picking him up so I think that there's a lot of there's a lot of flexibility when you are able to draft and stash I would agree that if you miss a bunch it might hurt a little bit if you're spending too high of a Draft pick on someone that you're going to be stashing but they're actually aren't too many major injuries to players that I'd be you know concerned about doing that I think the main one would probably be Chris Middleton I've been fading him like the plague and avoiding them like the plague agreed because I just don't know what his health situation is right now he looks like he's going to be coming back until like a load management type of situation year that's that no right um so I'm just concerned like I don't have as much Clarity on him as like I can I can wait on Trey Murphy because he's not gonna cost me that much Chris Middleton's a seventh round pick like that I could use that pick and I need that pick to produce like right away from my fantasy team yeah and I hate to throw in the sort of ultimate cop-out part of the answer but you also need to know how many I also slots your league has very true you even have that if you don't have that that's something I think I'd probably be less interested in wanting to stash a guy that I'm right just gonna be holding on to and I can't use for a waiver spot but Yahoo's public prize leagues which I am a fond participant of have three which is a tan I find three I mean especially in a games cap Roto format you don't need three I like I got players coming out of my ears on those clubs and I can't use half of them because the games cap is 82 but I don't even have that many players that I think you could even stash on IL that are worth it like usually you'll throw a flyer out for like a Jonathan Isaac and one of those but like he's actually healthy right now technically yeah these healthy is healthy yeah never gonna be fully healthy you can never trust know it doesn't seem like his team likes him all that much these days so kind of a weird guy so I don't I'm not surprised right yeah what does he logged in the preseason so far like 15 minutes over three games or something like that I believe me I did look because I was like my wonder if oh you're gonna rule me back in here yeah it's fine one of these one of my old Dan best price they always real me back and it's probably gonna be Chris Paul this year they one of them always gets me he's a value man like is never finished worse than 40th and parking value I don't care whether he's not playing 30 minutes he had like he played 28 last night and had nine assists for Rebound nine assists four rebounds and like 13 points that's huge when you're getting him at like a 70 I think it's like a 70th round yeah 78 PP that's this respectful I know but he's old  that's old that's a big freedom and I feel like you can buy into that because the way that the war is going to utilize him and that Sixth Man kind of hybrid starter kind of thing I think it's gonna be better for him he's playing like 34 minutes a game last last year so it's not surprised you know he gets hurt eventually put him right under that 30 minute Mark man I think it's gonna be great for him his longevity for this season yeah plus I don't need him out there with the bunch of starters that want to shoot put him in with a bunch of bench guys and he can run and Gun I got I mean again Urban up the Jon thinking I'm all for it there you gonna be fun but I think he's what third oldest player in the NBA and that's gonna keep his price tag down so I'm okay with did Andrea Goodale if he retired now right so Braun is the oldest did he yeah he's talking on podcasts like he's retired yeah so I think I think so I think it's LeBron PJ Tucker Chris Paul these are this is the kind of thing that the Danbury I mean this is my brand I feel like I need to know these things who are the people in the NBA scores 305 yeah have you put in your time and are you still Elite playing at a high level you're on the team are you gonna get my Saturday morning cartoon references if we sat down and had a conversation yes terrific I have a bowl of Werther's Originals come hang out with me others Originals yeah that's a grandma favorite I know I actually don't like them at all a question from Kohl's he's actually the host of our fantasy football show at sports ethos thoughts on Chad Holmgren this year Dan I'll throw this one to you man the price is going up and I get it he's going to be to me the cheaper version of Victor webmin Yama you can probably get him a little bit probably a little bit of a discount you know round three versus round four I think it's gonna be spectacular as if he gets minutes at Center there isn't that many that much competition in the front court so conservatively I think we can pencil in chat for like a 15 8 with two blocks I think is 1.8 you know Roundup he's going to be a stud I worry about the turnovers a little bit and maybe somebody fishing see issues but I think we'll figure it out  this is going to be an ascending Oklahoma City Thunder team he's going to be a stud  let's do one more you were talking about Jeremy Sohan so I figured I could throw this one in there so honor Jalen Johnson who's kind of like a cult favorite right now as well he's a Jalen Johnson is definitely a cult favorite of mine I called him a sleep he definitely has that sleeper tag to him right now I don't know that he's gonna be starting right away but I think eventually the Hawks are gonna figure out how to move from DeAndre DeAndre Hunter's contract and or Clint Capella's maybe both if that happens that's going to be great news for Jalen Johnson's Outlook but I would lean so on here because he's the starter right now yeah I think that's that's the safe place especially because someone will probably get frustrated with a forget Jalen Johnson really anybody who'd like doesn't immediately produce you see so much of that ah nothing of this nonsense and off they go into the into the abyss I am going to take the board down so you guys can actually see our two somewhat nerdy but very handsome faces Dan I don't know why the hell it took me so damn long to get you on here but thank you so much for not only carving out the time but also bringing all the energy I love it you make my life so much easier yeah you're a great host man and you do great work and yeah man I think it's great to talk shop and I think you you and Lloyd do a great job of holding the industry accountable for yes guy that's that's kind of fall in here or this guy's a little bit too higher you guys are freaking nuts what are you doing so I think it's awesome man and always good great to collab I think we're gonna be in a couple weeks so it's always fun to talk shop with like-minded guys that just are obsessed with fantasy as much as I am so fantasy for having me you might call us fantasy nerds  trying to bring it all full circle here he is at you can see it on your screen if you're watching on YouTube or after the fact if you're listening on traditional podcast channels he is at Dan Titus d a n t i t u s over at Yahoo fantasy sports Dan thank you again so much for your time yes sir  Dan Titus that was fun I don't know what the hell took me so damn long to get him on the show that is fully on me I don't know how many met a couple's I've done on this show of  why does it take me so long to schedule things with people well because I'm an idiot and I can't get my schedule together and as you guys heard the middle of that one I had a kid tried to burst into the room which did happen I did a guest spot with a jet mmm over on the itl network and my three year old burst into the room so I learned my lesson I locked the door I thought hmm here we go you know guy pointing at head Meme and  but then the dog was locked in here and she started barking to get out so I'm damned if I do damned if I don't anyway long way of saying I suck at scheduling but I am eternally grateful when folks like Dan like Josh like who the hell's do we talk like Alex like Brew everybody that's come on earlier this week  that actually fit into my stupid series of schedule stuff  before we go I do have a few things that I want to remind everybody about certainly what's coming up here on the show but all so I think there's one or two questions in the chat room that I didn't think parallel what was going on with Dan in the conversation I wanted to make sure that I didn't like hit him with something wacky out of left field that's not on the first time man I'll wait we've been on the show a couple times before I nailing with something a completely absurd  Nils says your opinion on Kentavious Caldwell Pope and Malcolm are they must roster in 12 team 9 cat I think Pope probably is he's gonna be extremely boring for you but they lost Bruce Brown which means they're gonna give some more stuff to younger guys but also kcp is gonna be relied upon to just be that sort of stabilizing play he was number 95 and very durable last year he's not exciting at all in Roto games cap head-to-head he's like the guys that Dan was talking about you want that safe play at 120 just get one safe play at the end in case someone you drafted earlier stinks or gets hurt and then take some fliers around him kcp is probably that guy Clarence said reminder Dan I told you the Dodgers suck yeah that's my hat I'm wearing a Dodgers hat it's it's in morning it's in morning Clarence and I know they stunk they want a ton of ball games but they did not have any starting pitching so it's actually kind of amazing that they did with they did considering Kershaw blew out his shoulder Walker Bueller didn't make it back Dustin made blew out his arm Tony Johnson blew out his arm and Julio Urias is a dog do  human beings so that was five by the way that was pretty much an entire starting rotation that that wasn't there so I was honestly happy they got as far as they did I thought they'd put up a fight against the D-backs but they had no shot of getting much I mean even if they won the first round they had no shot going past that ah Philip says I want to get in for any Simons over Dame know you don't Philip every Simon's over Damon's not a wise call Damon is a much better fantasy player and Simon's is going to score a bunch but he's also gonna have some problems Mike Franco says how low is too low for keldon Johnson I still believe well here's the problem Mike the Kelvin Johnson's issues happened when they moved him down to small forward and he ain't going anywhere from there because they added Victor one banana to the mix so whatever Kelvin minutes this year are probably going to still be at small forward that pushes him far from the bucket if you were rebounds more distance on his shots percentages were an issue for him last year in a big way and there's gonna be less usage coming his directions so I am not a Kelvin Johnson believer I think he fits with their trying to do there because he's a scorer and he'll run they'll have a bunch of fun but from a fantasy standpoint he's someone that makes more sense in points by quite a lot  and I don't even know if it's all all the way a lot I keep forgetting  and I can't do it now I guess I could take my headphones out and go quickly grab the handyman 5.0 don't go anywhere people I can see it it's literally right over there I'm grabbing it look at that you see how fast I made it back and forth with the handyman so this is the handyman 5.0

today one last question from Kenneth is it a Bi-Lo on Harden or leave him alone I'm leaving him alone  I don't know that you can even stash him on an eel slide if he's just suspended or absent  he's gonna be a massive headache unless we get some kind of clarity in the next four days I don't think I'm doing it also coming up on fantasy NBA today and I'm really excited about this tomorrow is the Big Bopper the Dan bass were sold man squad I'll come up with a fun way to name the show so that YouTubers can actually find it but effectively it is all of my targets  I do them late in the fantasy season because I'm waiting for the last Yahoo board Shuffle which happened today Thursday morning so it's all set I can rearrange my my targets based on any last minute shuffling that Yahoo did that's gonna be a big show tomorrow I'll probably be an hour long I don't think we're gonna do questions on that because last year I had something like 40 players that were guys that I was targeting last year if you guys recall we did not get Nick Clarkston  that was the big Gainer that we missed on but we had Brooke Lopez I think I might have been the only analyst on planet Earth that was high on Brooke Lopez like last year we had Larry marketing one of the other gigantic leepers I was higher than ADP on Shea gilges Alexander not high as some other analysts but he's another one that we got a little bit of so the old man squad had by and large a pretty good year and the one name that I will continue to kick myself about until the end of time is khris Middleton because we got frickin bamboozled  anyway I don't know why you guys are still hanging out it's the end of the show thanks for watching Everybody big thank you to Dan Titus again at Dan Titus over on social media he's with Yahoo fantasy where I run almost all of my League's that's the place to be Yahoo I know fan tracks has the better commissioner tools but the Yahoo UI is still tippy top  that's fun Dan is a kindred spirit I could feel it in the way we think and talk about fantasy sports I hope he has a lovely day I hope you all have a lovely day and I will talk to you guys tomorrow morning old man squad time so long for now
