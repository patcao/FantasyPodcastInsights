welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast you're in Dan wrap-up time you're Dan wrap-up time  it's been a day man  it's been a day here's the big board and we'll scroll through it here we'll go through this big board  piece by piece let me go I want to I want to make it one page at a time we'll start with yesterday and we'll do the Dan wrap we'll go through these trades over the next five six minutes one by one and I'm going to give you guys my feeling on as many of them as he's humanly possible and then we're going to send you all off on your way before I do one last time thank you to everyone for tuning in please do take a moment to like rate and subscribe on your way out I haven't figured out or decided how I'm going to be porting this broadcast to the regular podcast channels but I'll figure something out I certainly can't post a five-hour episode or can I um I'll probably be posting the last hour or so that'll be an episode we might do the first hour as well I got to get that up on the Pod channels again I don't really know how I'm gonna do it but I'm gonna do my damn best to figure it out but in the meantime thank you again to everybody that's tuned in specially our new Subs it's really cool to have you guys around I think we got like 150 new Subs wow we were on air with this show in addition to how many of you started subscribing to our YouTube page just because we had set up this feed a couple weeks ago so all of that is incredible  YouTube is is still sort of updating on the fly but at a very quick glance nine 13  just under 16  I think we're at something like 18 to 20,000 views on this show which would be Far and Away the biggest thing we've ever done on YouTube  and honestly it's just a nice reminder that all the time and energy we've put into this thing into YouTube over the last 14 months has been worth it because there's no way we get to show this large anywhere close to this large if we don't finally put our butts in to YouTube so here we go a quickly Jazz this is yesterday Pistons get Simone fontecchio for Kevin Knox fontech he was a watch list guy right now incase all format Celtics got Xavier Tillman for Lamar Stevens that's a nothing wolves acquired Monte Morris for Troy Brown Junior and Shake Williams that is all so a nothing  today Sixers get buddy hield for Marcus Morris and fork and cork Moss healed is a roster everywhere game spent some Fab money on him if you have to  Toronto gets Kelly Olynyk and oh shy abaji for Kyra Lewis Jr excuse me for the Miss pronunciation earlier and Otto Porter Jr Kelly Olynyk is a guy that I'm adding in most formats because especially now with Spencer Dinwiddie getting waived it's just more opportunities for the Raptors to go bigger with their their bodies I think that they didn't like being small here lately so you'll see Gary Trent will get a little bump with Dinwiddie getting waived Bruce Brown will get a bumped with Dinwiddie getting waved and then the newly added Kelly Olynyk antibody frankly will probably play some minutes there as well but a Linq is just a fantasy gem I don't expect him to play 30 minutes game it's not going to be like the Rockets version where he was a second rounder but I could see a path to Olin at getting inside the top 100 and that's a guy that I'd like to be a part of usually on the Roto side Thunder get Gordon Hayward for Trey man Davis bertans and Vaseline misich  I don't want anything to do with Gordon Hayward I think he's old and slow now and coming off an injury doesn't make him seem any older or younger or less slow  Trey man is a watch list guy for me in a lot of formats more so head-to-head and certainly more so points I don't trust that his percentages are going to be good enough to get him there and nine cat but you might as well watch him pistons pistons Acquired and then immediately waved to Daniel house don't worry I have that note later on Nick's got Alec Burks and boy and McDonough both guys likely to be dropped certainly once the Knicks are healthy maybe booked on of it holds a little bit of value or Burks here in the very near term because Grimes is gone and Josh Hart as a sore knee and Jalen Brunson has a dank ankles so you know maybe you don't drop them today but they probably will be  Pistons get Quentin Grimes Malachi Flint Evelyn Evan 48 and Ryan our CDO in this trade Grimes is interesting he had a run with New York towards the end of last year when when everybody was out and he put up some colossal numbers I don't know that the Pistons are just going to turn him loose right out of the chute but considering I think they didn't even get a first rounder back in these deals I think they got seconds that feels to me like that's their way of saying we believe in Quinton Grimes  enough to take back a sorry I was gonna swear there at the end of the show a crummy haul for Burks and bogdanovich because they didn't get as much as I think people felt like they were going to get unless you consider Quinton Grimes a possible win  we haven't really seen him outside of that stretch at the end of last year play with confidence and with the ball and his hand at all and kids going to be in and out with his injury management and Jayden Ivy's going to be sort of in charge of things but the Pistons again they got rid of a lot of guys here lately and fante EOS come in as well and they have some sort of Legacy weirdos there but I would consider Quinton Grimes stackable until we see what his role looks like and I know it's like you're noting from before the deadline but maybe you're kind of stashing to see what it turns out to be so I would look into Quentin Grimes as  you know behind Heald behind a Linux but ahead of a lot of these other kind of fringy guys a Daniel Gafford went to the Mavs for rachana Holmes Holmes is a short-term stream while Marvin bagley's out one Bagley comes back and probably had him now he probably gets more than 24 minutes I don't know if he's gonna get more than 30 but if he does then Bagley turns out to be a really good one so probably somebody to look into their Bagley I would put him ahead of Grimes  behind Olynyk  so then all behind by heels so he'll  of these of the names that we talked about so far and then they're the guys that are kind of Left Behind as well bagley's one of them so heeled is my favorite of the names we've talked about here so far in this recap part  then Olynyk then Bagley and then you get to the Grimes maybe he's and then you get to the guys that are sort of below that someone was asking about Cody Martin yeah I mentioned him early in the show as kind of a maybe but the Hornets did add a lot of young dudes that they may want to try to shoehorn in here and here's this is sort of the rest of the ones that actually seemed to matter Raptors acquired Spencer Dinwiddie and waved him didn't he is obviously a drop he's gonna end up someplace but he's still a drop Nets get Dennis Schroder and that young Schroeder he's pretty heavily rostered but if he is not you should add him I think Schroeder is gonna be the starting point guard for Brooklyn I'm unfortunately a little sad because I thought Dennis Smith Jr was gonna get freed by a Dinwiddie trade but they brought in a replacement point guard was basically gonna take all those same minutes so Dennis Smith Jr I think can stay on your waiver wire unless we see him take a big minutes Leap Forward Mavs get PJ Washington who probably ends up getting downgraded a little bit but he'll have a safe role so you can probably hold there just to see what happens I'm not adding Grant Williams or Seth Curry unless something comes out that says the Hornets are planting on like using a ton of Grant William's which I'm not necessarily believe in they do  Sons got Roy so Neil and David Roddy they sent out made to Goodwin what to not be in Bates job I'm not dealing with any of these guys in any format bucks get Pat Beverley for campaign nope Pistons wave Joe Harris Killian Hayes and Daniel house clearing out potentially more room for Funk heal and Clinton Grimes which is part of why I'm thinking I might take a plunge on those dudes Pacers get Doug McDermott for Marcus Morris who is then subsequently waived by the Spurs he'll go somewhere and do some random crap on a buyout Market Doug McDermott will play sparingly in Indiana he'll get some minutes here in there but he's not a fantasy guy King's got some money and Robin Lopez they all come together oh Lopez showed up with a bag of cash and then they sent away Lopez and kept the bag of cash a Raptors as we mentioned waived Dinwiddie Celtics acquired Jaden Springer Trailblazers acquired Delano Banton and the Pacers acquired Corey Joseph and none of those moves mean squat  hoof I have to immediately clean up and go do four hours of play-by-play  my goodness I don't know how I'm gonna get through everything I want to get through I have all these thoughts that I wanted to discuss on players that are moving up players that are moving down I know you guys want the sort of condensed version of who I like and who I don't like and I'm hoping that that quick recap kind of did it for you but if you want me to just sort of say it on the way out buddy hield is a must roster guy I think Kelly Olynyk is worth the spot on rosters I think that the hell was the third one is so many names it's hard to remember and I have been able to write them all down in the right way I think Marvin Bagley belongs on rosters I think in Grimes I'm sort of leaning more towards taking a shot on him though the upside is a bit capped Rashawn Holmes has sort of your fill in until Bagley comes back and that might be it oh Gary Trent we're talking about Gary Trent earlier I forgot about Gary Trent thank you chat room as I scroll through to see what you guys are talking about Gary Trent Bruce Brown in Toronto are maybe if again if I'm going to line these names up and  I could try to do this on the fly but I don't know that it's gonna work you guys are just gonna have to listen to this part so buddy he'll number one on that board  um Olynyk Bagley kind of in that number two range and then I would put Grimes Trent and Bruce Brown all together in kind of the the number three tier on some of this oh freaking awesome oh my God I'm sorry guys total brain fart Thompson's up there with Buddy Heald at the very top of the board those are the top tier guys so author healed at the top oh my God what did what a bonehead thing to do and then you got the Olynyk Bagley Zone and then you've got the grime's Trent Bruce Brown Zone and then there's kind of everybody else and we're gonna be watching a lot of these names and it's why the Tweet storms are going to be really important so I hope you guys will certainly come follow me over on social media we'll be doing those I don't know about the end of tonight I might just fall asleep but we'll get some thoughts out on all of this stuff over on social media shout out once again to all of our incredible guests throughout the show as we now officially officially officially head into wrap up time thank you to Keith cork for two hours of his damn time
