welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast and we are rolling here on this  Thursday late morning Pacific time early afternoon on the East Coast it is fantasy NBA today I am Dan best person it is  preview day because the NBA is back the All-Star break is officially over we have a big chunky juicy delicious card of a dozen games I think tonight is it 12 my getting that right I think it's a 12 gamer  so we're just launching headlong into the good stuff I think we follow that up with a Niner  think of Tommy Boy  did I catch a Niner in there  you calling from a walkie-talkie  yeah we got a 12 and a nine back to back today and tomorrow so we are really diving in the deep end  fantasy basketball reality basketball too but nobody cares about that this is a fantasy show  you I'm Dan bastress over on Twitter the same name at Dan  it was relaxing but at the same time I missed the games and I want to talk about them so let's talk about today what do we got going on in the show today two things  they're both in the title so you shouldn't be surprised by either one that I rip off here in a moment we're gonna be previewing the short week 18 card that starts tonight we've got  four days  brain fart and then I want to take a look and we're not gonna go super deep dive on this yeah but playoff calendars because they are starting to creep up on us a little bit you've got League's that you know we've suggested starting your playoffs basically six weeks before the end of the regular season so you'll eliminate the final three weeks Yahoo obviously lauded League's that sort of default setting goes to the end of the regular season  we'll talk about those as well and then there's kind of the in between quoth the great original Kitten Mittens do your fantasy league start early late or in between so we'll go through those and just take kind of a look in a little three-week cross sections  and if there's anything you can do about it we'll probably get into that a little bit more  I don't know maybe maybe not today we'll see all right so here's what's going on today let me  flip this thing over so you guys can see the big window here this is a  for those that are watching the video this is a look at our streaming grid available to Fantasy by subscribers I zoomed in really tights you could only see basically like a 11 day window you will not be able to get the full functionality of this thing by watching today's podcast but you will be able to get the full functionality of our weekly preview which and this is interesting  because despite the fact that it's only a four game week as I just scroll through at you know medium pace here you can see how many teams actually have a big scheduling Advantage this week  I know most of the big sites treat this week as the second half of last week so by all accounts you know if you use two moves last week you should be left over with two this week so you're gonna Yahoo you sort of split them up side by side but I know I'm in a CBS League 30 deep for instance actually splits these weeks up so what do you do about this week well first and foremost you know I could come on here and I could just rant and Rave by how you got to pick up guys on the three-game weeks yeah that's probably advisable but at the same time you also need to be aware of overflow  today is a prototypical overflow day with a dozen games Friday with nine not really Saturday there's only three games Sunday it go back goes back to a potential overflow day with 11  so you might be making moves today or Sunday that don't actually add games to your Ledger  make sure and I can't tell you like I can't see your league I don't know what the makeup of your particular roster is to be able to say oh like  okay so you know lots of teams play three games Charlotte for instance they go today tomorrow Sunday  if you're picking up a fringy like real fringy player on one of these three game in fortnite teams  is that actually better than picking up say someone who goes tomorrow Saturday is you know obviously the critical one because that's a quality day there is one team  and I've hovered over them on the screen so that people can see I don't believe there's a second one yet Quick Check confirms that there is one team that goes Friday Saturday  the Minnesota Timberwolves  they don't have that many fringy guys but you know slow-mo is probably kicking around on waivers wires Nas read is probably on some to kill Alexander Walker is on some even Jaden McDaniels is like Leona bunch  so  the point I'm trying to make there is and I don't want to gloss over this week I don't want to sort of cut this week down into just this one discussion  but if you're looking at what was he what were we talking about before the Hornets Pelicans are another example of a team that goes today tomorrow Sunday if you're already in overflow mode so check your teams  lineup tonight and Sunday  I mean you could look at the ones in between but most likely you're not going to be an overflow mode tomorrow or definitely not on Saturday today and Sunday are possibilities so before you use any roster moves for this week do me Dan  a favor and just look at what your starting lineup looks like today in Sunday I will go to one of my own leaks just as an example to see how this might actually play out in real time I'm not gonna show you guys what I'm doing I'm just you're just gonna have to kind of take my word for it today for instance I have a league where it's 14 roster slots only one ill which is a huge pain in the you know what and I have 11 guys going out of those 14  so it's already overflow mode  so then the guys that are not going for my team today in this particular League those guys that are not going to today are DeAndre Aiden Jalen Johnson and Santi aldama  all right well let's look at their schedule and Johnson goes tomorrow Sunday okay  DeAndre ayton Portland goes tomorrow Sunday and Memphis just tomorrow  but what I have noticed Now by looking at this this roster and this is actually a five weekly moves one so I you know I I use three last week because I didn't get off of some guys that were horrible or injured because I'm thanks to injuries I'm very fringy in this stupid fantasy league I was in first place in that half my team got hurt such as the way of things sometimes you get bit by that bug and head to head and or any format really and then just sort of not going to be your year so I'm making moves I'm trying to make sure I get into the playoffs I don't know if the team really is going to have the legs to get through it because it's down I think this team is down its second round pick  possibly and third round pick no second and fourth something like that it's gonna be in a tight spot but anything's possible you just got to get in and see what happens so I'm mixing I'm matching I'm moving I'm grooving I've used three of my five moves for these two weeks but then I think is  I look at this roster and I'm like damn santel only has one game over the next four days he's someone that I had on yesterday show us a possible Silly Season stash for when Jerry Jackson Jr gets shut down or possibly before that if he can stop shooting you know the same percentage that I do at the free throw line  again anything's possible but I don't actually have to unload him even though he only has one game the rest of this week I don't have to use a move on all dhamma today because I have 10 guys that I feel perfectly comfortable starting in this format my 11th guy is  likely oh he's actually not playing I thought he might be back and turns out he's not so let's for example say let's just assume that my 11th guy is also a available so if one of my main 10 guys gets ruled out late I could have subbed in my 11th  if my 11th guy as is the reality here is not playing then maybe that's an opportunity to use up a roster move but right now I I don't feel like I need to I have 10 healthy guys none of them is on any injury report as of you know late morning here Pacific time so I don't need to use a move today  and I likely don't need to use a move tomorrow because the guys that I can was considering dumping  they played tomorrow  including Santi aldama  then you get to Saturday and Sunday the short cars I don't even care about Saturday right now because I know I'm only going to have a handful of guys but what does my team look like on Sunday Sunday in that particular League there are nine out of ten or nine out of 14 I guess I should say guys that are actually healthy enough to play now again I don't know what your League's are gonna be this is just again this is one example extraordinarily small sample size but my team is in overflow mode today  would not be an overflow mode on Sunday if I made no roster moves the rest of this week but now I have something to work with I have the injured player who I can unload for someone who wouldn't be putting up zeroes I have Santi aldama that I could move starting on Saturday after he plays his game tomorrow  are there any teams that play Saturday Sunday I believe the answer is no and a quick snow there is one or Lando sorry there's one team that goes Saturday Sunday it's their Lane no magic so that would be an opportunity maybe after all Thomas game on Friday move along to some fringy player on the magic Cole Anthony hasn't been very good but he's on a lot of Waiver Wires as his Mark help faults as his Jalen Suggs these guys that are not really Every Day's but certainly if you're just trying to squeeze out two games of a back-to-back and sort of build your roster out the right way so these are the things I want you guys thinking about I don't really want you now you know there's there's a couple things that could take shape here let's say you look at your roster and you are not in overflow mode today  ignore my mouse by the way folks that are watching live I don't know why it's appearing I don't have it hovering over the the document that you're looking at it's just now it's there I'll try to move it off to the side for the moment  if you are not in overflow mode today then obviously you try to grab some guys that have three games in four days the rest of the week maybe that puts you into overflow mode on Sunday maybe it puts you into possibly overflow mode tomorrow if you go from you know it's a nine game or so anything's possible you can have you know if you have a cluster of players that are all on one of the teams playing tomorrow maybe that's the day you have the Overflow but you don't really have anything to lose in that regard because the three gamers or Orlando Magic being a sort of your interesting one maybe you lean or Lando's way because they go  with that back-to-back Saturday Sunday in addition to having the game tonight in Cleveland  not the greatest place to play Cleveland very good defensively but you know if tomorrow is your overload Day by some small miracle you'd go Orlando because then you'd get the game today you'd avoid tomorrow  and then the weekend back to back-to-back would be kind of gravy even if you had an overflow mixed in there you could at least have kind of a backup guy there isn't like there's a reason to pick a team that doesn't have the good schedule  just because you'd give yourself a later overflow day like think about this mathematically the Knicks have games today and Saturday or Lando has games today Saturday Sunday there's unless you strongly prefer the streamer on New York  that's sort of the one reason if the streamer on New York is vastly superior to the one on our landlord like you know let's say that someone dropped Josh Hart or precious to chew for some ungodly reason these guys that are streaming monsters right now  yeah you probably take New York because those guys you could actually potentially slot in over guys that are already in your overload lineup  but if you know if we're talking about like Alec Burks versus  Jalen Suggs or something like that these guys that are likely to be outside the top 100 on a per game basis in the near term again I don't know that these guys are available and you can yell at me who is and who's not I can't see your league there isn't really a reason to take the Nyx over the magic even if you're a Sunday overflows like well the game on Sunday doesn't wrap really matter for me for Orlando  yet anything can happen between Thursday and Sunday you could lose two guys to injuries between now and then and then suddenly your gonna need that extra ball game  the difference in what I'm talking about with this sort of like overflow today versus Sunday is that today you now know who's gonna play you can make your moves at I don't care 345 Pacific time this afternoon  knowing who's in and who's out of your lineup  for tonight  you make your move with 345 this afternoon  today you don't know yet who's gonna be in and who's gonna be out on Sunday  so it's always good to plan to have more games in the future even if it might give you an overflow day today you have this opportunity to maybe save that move if you got 10 guys healthy 10 out of 13 or whatever it might be in your Yahoo League ready to go today and you get to 345 or you hell if like if you're not even line up lock maybe you can make your move later on in the evening for the night games what is the what's the latest game happening today I don't have that in front of me right now  uh boo boo doo doo doo doo Warriors and Kings both 7:00 Pacific time so you got some late games out there and I think you got a couple of teams that actually have okay schedules among them if you have a player that gets ruled out in one of those late scenarios Lakers have three games out of those teams I just mentioned the Warriors also have three games  Kings only two who was the last team I mentioned the Spurs I think they were at  a three yeah Spurs are all three  so that's the nice thing about having some roster moves today and why  holding on is as long as he mainly possible remains advisable  but gaining games down the line is always something you should be trying to do it what I can't do on today's podcast is tell you specifically to pick up because I don't know who's available in your league and yeah I mean we could do the thing where it's like oh this guy is 48% rostered but that doesn't mean that he's gonna be available in your league and in more competitively some of those guys might be less rostered  you just really never know  but let's do this short version now as we kind of scroll our way through and let me just give you some names of teams to be looking at from now until the end of the week the best schedule from now until the end of the week is the Orlando Magic because they dodged tomorrow's nine gamer yes they're on both of the really heavy days but they all have a game on Saturday which is the low tide today  Minnesota with the two gamer is kind of interesting because they go Friday Saturday which are technically the two not technically in reality the two lowest number of games remaining this week meaning you dodged the potential overflow days but at the same time if you're if either of those days isn't an overflow for you then getting Minnesota  over a three game or is sort of a silly move then you've got a whole truckload of teams that go today tomorrow Sunday they play on the high traffic days  I mean chicken and egg kind of thing yes obviously these are high-volume days because a lot of teams are playing on those high-volume days duh Charlotte count them out with me Charlotte I'll scroll through it for everybody that's watching with us Charlotte Cleveland Denver Golden State Houston that's five already Clippers Lakers  Pelicans Thunder Sixers that's 10 Suns Spurs Wizards 13 of the 30 teams in the league go today tomorrow Sunday  that's a ton  and then if you had Orlando in there you've got 14 out of the 32 teams that actually have three games the rest of the way so I would argue  in addition to checking your roster making sure you're not going to overload too hard and waste roster moves in the process  the more important thing to do is to make sure that you're not squatting on someone who has a terrible schedule this week when you could get a whole lot more so take Memphis for instance one game the rest of the week Miami is another team that has won game the rest of the week I feel like I'm forgetting one Club  no we get to watch me scroll in real time to make sure I didn't forget somebody those are the two teams that have won game the rest of the week and it's tomorrow  yes in my league that I just did as an example I already have 10 star double guys so I don't need to dumps on tlama or whatever Grizzly or heat stream size player you might have on your roster right now  but that doesn't mean that I can't  the reason that I would hold on to say like a Dunkin' Robinson in Miami or even an aldama Memphis or Luke Kennard if he ends up playing tomorrow would end up being kind of interesting one  is that those guys actually have an opportunity to be a lot better than like  Spencer Dinwiddie on the Lakers or Larry Nance Jr on the Pelicans or whatever Fringe level guy you might be picking up for the Clippers maybe it's you know Mason Plumlee or Norman Powell or something like that you could get a vastly superior game from Luke Kennard if he plays and plays 30 minutes then one of those Fringe guys who may not even get used today so these are the calculations you have to make but again you can wait until the very last second to make them  if you do not have overflow today or Sunday  you probably want to make that move sooner than later because the opportunity to pick up the favorite streamers on these  three game teams is going to dry up people are gonna grab the best opportunity the best guys out there today as a weighting which is what you'll probably end up doing but as I just mentioned if you're overloaded today and you're not overloaded tomorrow you probably rather get one game out of say Duncan Robinson tomorrow as a pose to one game out of whatever overload back-to-back streamer you were thinking about picking up you want to get the better individual game performance  and you say the roster but it's a double win so you might pick up using the Lakers as an example you might pick up jaxson Hayes who's got it back to back and he'll probably you know he'll play a total of like 28 minutes in those two ball games and sure that's fine if you're not an overload mode but if you are then you only be getting 14 minutes out of Jackson Hays tomorrow as opposed to again probably like 30 out of Duncan Robinson or Luke Kennard or whoever that is the better option that might already be on your team I'm not saying you go pick those guys up I'm just saying if you already had them that's an opportunity to hang on until Saturday when you definitely need to get out of the Memphis Miami business  because if you're fighting for a playoff spot now if you're not I mean if you're not fighting for a playoff spot then none of the streaming discussion even really applies to you but I'm assuming that most of you are and so then you want to start using your moves up at the end of the week if you still have two moves left and you have two guys that don't play Saturday or Sunday you want to probably switch both  to Orlando if you can that turns zero games into four if you only have one guy that doesn't play Saturday or Sunday you just try to fill in the day that they're not playing now if they play Sunday and it's an overload day you can sacrifice a game that day to get one on Saturday if they play Saturday and not Sunday obviously you just wait and you make the move on Sunday is that all make sense sure relatively straightforward also just briefly here if we're looking at guys that go Sunday Monday they do exist they do exist what commercial my quoting their the Indiana Pacers go Sunday Monday on a weekend to next week back to back and the Sacramento Kings do likewise so those are good pickups on Sunday that carry you into the beginning of next week the king's go Monday Wednesday Friday to start next week the Pacers go Monday Wednesday Friday starting next week as well so you could potentially abandon ship on Tuesday or Thursday or Sunday Saturday sorry or just hold them throughout the week because Indies got four  Sacramento  they don't play on Saturday or Sunday of next week so longest you'd want to hold a king would be until their game on Friday all right that is your look at this week let's take a few minutes to look at the playoff structure depending on how your playoffs breakdown you have different ways to look at it this by the way that folks are going to be seeing here with the we're gonna go visual aid again is the sports ethos playoff calendar I am once again going to use this mostly as a marketing tool for now because I'd love it if you guys went and got a fantasy pass that helps sort of power the locomotive here I have to move my face on the screen so I'm not covering it up and then we're also going to zoom in a little bit so that we can play a game that I'm not going to name but the game is basically let's look at groups of three  so here's what you're looking at if your playoffs start on March 4th I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say that anybody I know some of you will probably start sooner but like on this podcast I said if you have control over it you start your playoffs six weeks before the end of the regular season you cut off the last three weeks  but I don't know how many people have listened to me on that one this is a spot where Charlotte Dallas and the Lakers are the teams that have only nine games over that three weeks stretch everybody else either has 10 11 or 12 and the only team that has 12 is the Portland Trail Blazers so if your playoffs start March 4th Portland is your Golden Goose  almost everybody else has 11 or 10 and between the two of those I wouldn't worry too much about it the Knicks also have nine in addition to the Lakers what did I just say the Lakers the Hornets and the Mavs it's just that the Lakers hornets and Mavs have a two gamer mixed in there so that becomes much harder actually to get through that particular week whereas Minnesota has a two gamer but they've got four on either side of that and the Pelicans are not the Pelicans excuse me the Nicks have a three three three over that stretch which is annoying but at least there isn't a two for mixed in  the only reason I bring this up is that if you're thinking about like if you have a superstar I want one of those teams that has nine games over that stretch is probably too late to do anything about it  and I don't know that I would you build your team around that particular player like you have Anthony Davis and your playoffs start week 20 or weak 21 frankly because that's when his two game weekend is you're just gonna have to hope you can survive it's too late at this point but if you have a fringe type of guy like again like if you're looking at the Knicks and  you think someone maybe is Josh hard not going to be quite as good but at some point during those nine then yeah flipping for someone who has 12 over three weeks it's not that hard to see the 12 or beating the Niner  I can't believe I didn't I said nine or twice in the same week what if you decided to get a little bit crafty and start your playoffs on March 11th you only loped off the final two weeks of the regular season again you've got a couple of teams with two game Weeks Charlotte Dallas and the Lakers they still have the two Gamers Minnesota still has their two gamer but the difference now is that Minnesota doesn't have four on either side they go 243 Lakers go two three four Dallas goes four to four as does Charlotte so those two teams now are slightly less awful they've got 10 a lot of other teams also have 10 that don't have the two gamer in a lot of teams have 11 and believe it or not there is not a single team in the NBA that has 12 games between weeks 21 and 23 so you don't really have a great attack point or Lando slides into the three three three zone I'm not gonna spend that much time so does Milwaukee and Memphis so you have a lot of teams that have nine games that you want to maybe try to move away from if your playoffs start on week 22 which is again kind of a weird time to do it because I figure most of you are either going to the end or start on March 4th  Dallas goes back to having a really bad one two four three so they got nine games and only a two gamer in their Charlotte how has 10 games despite the two game week  the Lakers two game week is now gone Minnesota's two-game week is no longer involved you do have a couple of 12s mixed in the Philadelphia 76ers have 12 the Cleveland Cavaliers have 12 the Sacramento Kings have 12 so you have three choices there and now let's spend maybe more than 30 seconds on what probably and unfortunately the vast majority of you likely go to the end of the regular season I wish I wish it wasn't the case but again if you're playing in public prize League's at most website's the big ones at least they take you to the end  it's annoying it's dumb it's gonna put you right in the teeth of silly season  but it's the way it is  the good news is that there isn't a single team in the NBA that has only 10 games over that stretch every single team in the NBA has either 11 or 12 so there really isn't anything you need to worry about from a do I need to abandon ship on a particular player standpoint  what you will be worried about if your league goes to the end of the regular season so your playoffs then start March 25th and then continue April 1 and April 8th is Silly Season you're going to be right in the teeth of it and my best advice for you is to  on  Friday Saturday Sunday the end of week 22  save as many moves as humanly possible preferably all four  and use them to front load weak 23 unless you have a first round bye in which case do that exact same strategy for weak 24  because you know most of the NBA has four games I guess it's pretty close to an even I think it's like  65 605 percent of the the league has four games  it's gonna be really hard to get a big games Advantage just from standard streaming you have to front load that week March 25th and I mean we can scroll through I can try to see what it looks like here on a super fast standpoint  what whatever you can do to make sure and that Monday is maybe maybe not an overload day probably I think there's like 12 games that day so if you're overloaded on Monday March 25th make sure that you have somebody playing on the 26th Tuesday is not an overload day Wednesday super busy Friday super busy  it's a really really difficult week  to  megastream  basically is what you're looking at because Monday let me get the actual number here Monday has 11  Wednesday has 30  Friday has  12 on 23456 789 10 11 yeah Friday as 12  and even Sunday as 10  so a lot of teams many teams go Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday in that first playoff week which makes it extraordinarily hard to really lay into the stream but what you can do is if you can get an early start on it you can try to grab those teams that play in between  Wednesday and Friday in particular are extraordinarily heavy maybe you're not overloaded on Monday it's possible that you might be able to see that thing through but take a really long look early at who plays Tuesday and Thursday and Saturday and those teams might only have a three game week but it's a few of them a few teams have that three-game week I think we're looking at who do we have here like the pals the bucks so these are things you can look at  as early as humanly possible make sure you're maximizing your games while you know other people in your league you're like oh I'm gonna get all these four game guys but maybe they don't get any use like six or seven of the games those guys are playing  don't worry once we get into the last six weeks of the season so we're pretty close to what we're going to be doing a little bit of kind of like a daily streaming board on the podcast so I'll remind you guys of all of this stuff as we get closer to it but that's your sort of Longview attack at trying to get ahead of things at playoff schedule in my mind it's too late to make any large scale adjustments you're probably not going to be able to make a trade at this point in the year to like move some body's out but again as we mentioned already these teams that only have nine games 2021-22 those three weeks Charlotte with the two gamer Dallas with the two gamer Lakers with the two gamer Nicks go three three three those are spots where if you have somebody who's  I don't know say like you know top 100 range that you probably been playing most of the year it might not be the craziest idea in the world now the Lakers start with a four gamer there so it's a little bit different but like Charlotte Dallas three then four if you can find a 4/4  I don't think it'd be the worst idea in the world because you're not gonna be holding them through that last week  so just be a little bit less attached to those guys is probably the advice as opposed to oh my god do I like Panic drop somebody that has a two-game playoff week now because it might be the semis it might be the finals  if you're weak if your playoffs start March 4th  you know Brooklyn has a five gamer to start that  but there's nobody with it to that week  again we'll do more of this as we get closer but this is sort of your again getting a bit out in front of it look at streaming for the playoffs that's our show for today everybody tonight tonight lots of games lots to analyze can't wait to get back into the mix we'll have our nice little tweet storm late late at night because I'm
