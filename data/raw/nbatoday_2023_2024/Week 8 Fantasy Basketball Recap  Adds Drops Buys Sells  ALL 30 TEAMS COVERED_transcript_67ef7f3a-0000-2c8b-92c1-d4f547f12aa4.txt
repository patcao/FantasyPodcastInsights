welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  ladies and gentlemen it is time for our weekend review show always a crowd-pleasing favorite I am your host Dan bass and I apologize this one getting started  a little bit later than I had planned on today but it's a busy morning had some calls going on first thing today we got some very interesting stuff in the works for the sports ethos pod division massive announcement like likely coming as soon as next week we didn't want to give any of this away but we're really really excited about what the future holds with the Pod division how to get that sorted out had some other stuff to take care of on the home front had some threads of course to do on Twitter not on threads get my nomenclature right we can review  stuff I like to get that out there on social so everybody can kind of see the teaser version and they come over here I hope watch the show get the the full  description the full battery of analysis that goes with it  please do take a moment to find me over on social at Danvers if you're new to the proceedings it's at d a n b e s b r i s this is a sports ethos presentation Sports ETA OS is the website the news feed is ethos fantasy BK and of course come hang with us in our Sports ethos Discord link for that is in the show description  you know basically how these Friday shows go it's become  kind of a repeating event over the last couple of Seasons this is I think the best way to kind of go through and try to hit on everything that's been going on in the NBA there's no perfect way to do it admittedly and it's still not clear exactly how I want to fit my face and the names on the board I changed it around week to week  because I do all of this stuff on stream yard and I'm not  skilled enough to do all the actual like real encoder work that this should actually take but we're gonna work our way through ads drops holds watches players the injury replacement board is just astronomical right now we'll have a couple buys a couple cells some of them will harken back to our buy and sell shows from early in the week I am likely to  eliminate the full weekend preview part of the show Mostly because I find I'm just repeating the names that I already mentioned during this first much longer much more in-depth segment  and I mean we pretty much cover every single player that we're going to be looking at so you know what team they play on  and if you don't you can Google it and then you'll know what we're watching for when that particular team plays so  fantasy basketball we can review thread we're gonna cover the stories basically the past seven days it's really more if you wanted to isolate it more like the last four five days because things typically have changed from the weekend as we get into now this midweek and we'll start with the ads because dammit that's everyone's favorite place to start anyway biggest dad I actually put these in a in not a specific order but I did move one name to the top and that name is tari Eason  who might turn out to be a complete flop  in the next game or two it's unclear but I went out and I put in pretty big bids on him anywhere that I could meaning any place that had a Fab situation so the Yahoo public prize leagues I went out and I dropped a few clams on him  and it might not pan out I know we're only talking about two good ball games in a row but they were too  spectacular games good shooting threes missed his free throws you want two for five of the foul line that's frustrating  but 28 rebounds in those two games 43 points three steals in a block he is an outstanding rebounder very good at getting steals we saw some of this stuff last year where again he didn't play that many minutes but he was actually a 1.8 defensive stats in 21 minutes a game last year  and so far this season he was sort of dinking and dunking around the 17 and a half 18 minute Mark until these last two ball games or he exploded for 26 and then 27 minutes and then we really finally got a chance to see his fantasy profile in action  because we hadn't really seen it to this point he had had one maybe two games you could call fantasy serviceable but he also hadn't cleared 22 minutes prior to these last two ball games can we necessarily extrapolate directly from what he did last year in 21 and a half minutes per game know because there's sort of a stat acquisition Arc that players typically hit which is like okay you know if they're in a game for 10 minutes they're gonna go nutso for 10 minutes but it's not gonna be enough and you know 20 minutes they probably still have the adrenaline and energy to go full bore once guys start getting into the high 20s low 30s then they have to sort of throttle back every now and again learn how to budget their time on a basketball court  but again first of all second year player  so some of that like can't budget myself stuff that typically hits rookies a little harder maybe that won't be quite as big of a deal and secondarily  we saw last year when there were games where Ethan got 25 26 minutes he was inside the top 100 so we've seen him do it  and yes the Steals and blocks they do tend to level off a little bit the rebounds don't really you know if you're on a basketball court and you're a good rebounder you're going to get rebounds that's what he does  seven rebounds a game this year in 19 and a half minutes last year was it six rebounds in 21 again this could be sort of a balancing of that but if he gets to 25 26 27 minutes you're looking at a guy that could very reasonably get to eight rebounds of ball game that's big number  steals are going to be good would not be at all surprised to see that as a number that's well over one actually weirdly this season is blocks have been better than steals that probably levels off shot 75% of the free throw line last year so it's 59% this season also feels like a number that probably gets better as the sample size gets bigger  I see no real downside to this if it doesn't pan out we can move on but if it does you're talking about a guy that you know if he starts to take Dillon Brooks is minutes at any point seems less likely than maybe taking Jalen greens minutes or just being sort of like the primary bench dude on a team that frankly doesn't use their bench very much  there's a lot there's a big Avenue there's a nice open road if he wants to try to get to 25 or more minutes a game  it's very doable  now as Reid is the next name on the ads list I think he was on the ads board last week or if he wasn't on the ads board he was on the injury replacement board I had to upgrade him to  what is effectively like a heater ads board I don't have that  subdivision here on my remedial Microsoft Word presentation  he's a heater add he's on a serious heater right now Anthony Edwards came back so did Jaden McDaniels didn't matter Nas just kept draining buckets he just going buckets right now  there were buckets for him to get one Anthony Edwards was out  Edwards came back he just went and he took somebody else's buckets instead  so  this one's a simple analysis we love nasri Fantasy game when he's confident and he's getting minutes and when he's confident he gets minutes  when he gets minutes he's more confident  it does sort of create this positive and then eventually a negative feedback loop or if he gets less confident it's go down and then so on and so forth until you hit this sort of again this up and down this way of value for Nas who  probably you could just start every game the rest of the year and you probably get a guy that's in that like one 20 some odd range when everything comes settling in but he's been so good lately he's pushed himself back up to the edge of the top 100 it'll go through a down spell where he falls back to one 30 and I'll come back up to 95 or 100 and so on and so forth and again that's a guy that you can play nightly  but it also feels like sort of the modern way that we play Fantasy NBA that's feels more like a guy that you  play when he's hot and you don't when he's not  I'm gonna go out of order from what folks are reading on their screen but those listening won't care Jonathan coming is the next day on the board he's also a I would call him kind of a priority add again we don't have the the you know rest of season mapped out for kaminga and he has free throw issues and he doesn't get as many steals and blocks as we want  but it seems like the Warriors are finally saying we gotta try something because our old guys are getting  just smoked  particularly Andrew Wiggins mostly Klay Thompson 2 until he had his sort of big ball game yesterday and now Draymond Green is suspended indefinitely coming was already getting more minutes even before the Draymond suspension now he's going to have those they almost have no choice even if he has a you know a poor decision-making stretch where in the past you probably would have gotten yanked and I don't really have much of a choice  My Hope with kaminga is that  we will get better defensive stats than we've gotten in sort of the smaller sample size that this season has brought  because he's played pretty good minutes is last call it three ball games in row he had a good second half of the one before that but we're talking about like maybe three and change ball games he had foul trouble in a few of them that's seemingly going to be a small issue for him he's not a big Steals and blocks guy but last year he was at 1.1 combined in 21 minutes which again  not that good but the hope is that if his minutes now Trend up into the 28 range which he's been at two of the last three ball games  could that then increase his Steals and blocks by 2030 some odd percent so could one point one from last year he's at 0.9 this season by the way the same number of minutes we could probably just round it up to one or rounded down to one if you talk about last year could one become you know 1.2 or 1.3 consistently complained combined could it be you know point eight Steals and point five blocks could it be point nine Steals and 0.4 blocks point nine steel point five blocks or 0.6 like is there a way for him to get that combined number from the one to  more like the 1.3 to 1.5 ranked  that would be colossal for his fantasy value because unfortunately he is a guy that gets to the foul line and he is a guy that sucks there  that's the big downside with comingo I still think he's a priority at but if you're trying to win free throw percent he's gonna hurt you and that's going to make it hard for him to be inside the top 100 when you have that sort of one medium-sized negative stat  you need to have a few medium sized positives to counter weight it and I don't know that I see the actual category where he can be that medium sized positive maybe rebounds but again not much defensively it's gonna score a little but they're not going to be relying on him to score they still have Steph and hopefully Clay's coming back around and CP3 will be orchestrating some stuff and blah blah you know different guys will be rotating in 15 16 points that would be pretty good for him but that's still not a big positive that's a small positive  so I like coming I think he's an ad to see how this thing plays out but I also want to start a temporary expectations because from a nine cat perspective his Fantasy game is not that great  if feels like it should be because you watch him play and you're like  isn't this guy gonna get Steals and blocks look at him flying around no not really  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game  it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last-second drink run and end up missing the game-winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you

that's dri z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations  couple of stashes that I want to go over here in the ads Department one of them is an active stash that scoot Henderson we talked about him with the first two months of the Season we're almost two months in now as someone that you knew was going to be bad for a while he's showing signs of starting to figure out the NBA game now obviously one good ball game yesterday he said like one and a half one and three quarters ish pretty good ball games it's still gonna be very up and down for school this is not like the beginning of a new era he's going to have some games where he's absolutely terrible and they'll probably be sooner than later  so don't pick him up and be like I'm ready to scoot the rest of the year understand you're picking them up on Roto if he was on the wire you probably sitting on him like an injured player  but now that we're seeing some signs of him beginning to understand tempo  sort of speed the activity level of an NBA game  then you can see kind of the next steps to follow it's getting that consistently it's being able to do that against teams that are not dog do on the defensive side there's all these mini steps along the way  he's hit the first  and to me that feels like someone with his  frankly kind of infinite potential like we all  I don't think anybody's moving off of their Scots could be a really damn good basketball player evaluation from preseason he's just getting knocked around by the NBA for the first you know almost two months of the year like all rookies that have responsibility do now it feels like we're close enough to say all right you know head-to-head side I'm gonna take the good with the bad because the good is Gonna Come I'm Gonna Keep My Team afloat even if he has some really bad ball games because we're you know two months out from our fantasy playoffs and I think it's gonna be really good by then so let's do it Roto pick them up treat him like an injured guy you sit on him for a week two weeks three weeks four whatever hopefully he starts to get close enough to where you're not just that's not on the roadside you're sort of eating zeros at that point but you guys catch my meaning and then the other stash is and injured stash and that's Marcus Smart who  frankly I probably should have dropped in early have him on one team which feels like a bullet dodged there  but he ended up being out and I said three to five weeks I think originally and I thought maybe we'll maybe we'll sneak away with three nah  it's already been four and a little bit  I think he's about to step up to five on five so he's close  maybe that means back next week which would basically be the five week Mark  frustrating if you've been sitting on him this whole time you just you know you deal with it because now you're close enough to to ride it out he did get dropped in a lot of spots not everywhere a lot he's still 80% roster in Yahoo leaks but I mean he might as well go check your wire to see if he's floating around because then you go grab up and a decent follow-up question is what does Marcus Smart's role look like with John Moran healthy  I'm not sure it's worse  because you know Marcus was taking 11 shots of ballgame earlier this year  but when he takes a lot of shots it actually does hurt his I mean he's a big field goal percent negative guy is turnovers were at 3.4 which is just a number you cannot accept when is assists we're only at 5 I don't think that is this changed that much when he's playing alongside jaw and Desmond Bane I think the steals are going to be really high I think the assists are going to be fine probably in this you know four and a half to five range the turnover should come way down  yeah he probably doesn't take as many shots but also the three-point percentage probably ticks back up again he was under 30% for the first time since 2016 this year  and there's a very real path for him to get to that sort of 90 to 100 range and that's said all systems go kind of dude so thank you scuba up  if you was dropped again not in all that many spots and roll from there  here's some hole to players not that many on the holds board just four names first one is Alex Caruso who I put on the holds board because it's I think it could be pretty reasonably argued that Alex Caruso is moving up into the most annoying player to roster on the day-to-day  because he's heard every day in ball game  he served every damn ball game  played like what four and a half minutes in a couple of three-pointers in the last one and then just left  such as the Caruso  Cross to Bear right now  um I'm gonna hold on I still have this fleeting hope that at some point he's gonna get more upright  may never happen but  I'm willing to take the shot a little bit longer Malcolm Brogden is a hold he didn't play that many minutes in his last one most of the time I think Portland will let him take the reins but I think they like scoot was playing a good ball game so they wanted to give him that opportunity  and there a team that's not super worried about wins but you're holding Brogden just because he's gonna be a steadying influence there I'm holding Kelli Bray Junior while we wait to see what his role actually looks like when he said full ramp up we haven't even really seen that yet they haven't needed him because the sixes of generally been playing teams that can't guard anyone and so Joel and beat is just putting up 40 burgers in the first half and the game's over by then I'd like to see a competitive ballgame and see what Kelly oubre gets to do and then herb Jones and someone on Twitter was kind enough to say you gotta tell people to hold herb Jones  yeah yeah because he's been really bad for the last two ball games and people freaked out when low scoring types have bad games because they're like oh God I can't take zeros yeah I mean you know you can because the overall body of work has been good enough  I know we moved through the whole pretty quickly let's go to the next one these are the I'm scared or nervous or drop players there are four and they each probably require some sort of explanation first name on the board is Andrew Wiggins who finally was demoted to the bench by the Golden State Warriors He's been just absolutely terrible all season long  Warriors played what 22 23 24 ball game something like that and he's been good in two of them  you cannot be good 10% of the time and expect to keep your job full time  so we get to the bench Brandon pajam ski into the starting lineup or if you want to say comingo in the starting lineup whatever they both came in Wiggins went out dream on got suspended doesn't matter who you're replacing with who in your mind I was holding Wiggins in some spots I dropped him I actually didn't Okay I lied I bent the truth I did not draft him anywhere I picked him up in one League where he got dropped and I have now subsequently dropped him in that league so I'd say I can say I dropped him everywhere but I only had him in one place and it was only because he was on the way for wire  the he's off the bench now so the minutes are no longer secure and he was bad even with the minutes he's not a roster will player right now  Killian Hayes I have a probable drop he's not one that you absolutely must drop immediately but he's playing big minutes and he's still outside the top one 60 and I get it guys are all real clustered together out there but 9 points and six assists is not enough and that's with him shooting the ball relatively well so it could actually be worse  I don't see that other than you know steals spiking I don't see that many ways for killing and Hayes to raise his fantasy profile unless you know the whole team gets hurt all at the same time so probably a drop I know it's good to have a guard  kind of even a point guard playing starters minutes at the NBA level  that's something that you want to at least give a shot but we kind of giving him a shot and we give him a shot for a few years and he just he just doesn't have Fantasy game  it's okay we just doesn't have Fantasy game  here's one that I'm probably gonna get pulled apart for I think Jordan Poole is drawable  and you guys know this is a change of pace for me I didn't draft him in any nine categories I want to preface this discussion with he was a guy that I specifically said I was way too afraid to draft you guys remember you probably don't way back in August  that's four months ago man memory still go back that far what the hell I mean what do you think this is like the 1970s  we got we got smartphones I remember crap that happened four months ago you guys remember back in August the very first draft board came out at Yahoo  and Jordan Poole was preached in the 60s and I thought oh that's intriguing I think I may even said those words that's interesting you know if you're going in the 60s now you're talking about sixth rounder  that has  big time upside and Big Time downside  but you guys know the Dan bachelor's way we don't take what I consider to be  like eyes closed home run hacks until you get past the third or fourth round we just don't do it  and I almost feel like I need to go on a tangent here let's see if I remember to come back to that that tangential thought  so when Jordan Poole got pushed up into the early 40s by mid-october when we were doing our drafts there was no freaking chance I was touching him there that's a fourth rounder that could yeah I mean maybe if everything broke perfectly he could have probably been a third rounder nine cat meaning  you look at what he's doing right now 14 and a half shots per game make that 20 instead of 14 and a half shots  give him five and changes assistance of three and a half  and make the field goal percent like 44 instead of 40  so now you're talking about a guy that would have been scoring more like you know 25 26 points per game hitting three three-pointers with five assists big time free throw number  there's your upside  but we saw the downside with golden state last season he was playing basically full minutes off the bench  on a team that was getting him really good looks and he still wasn't inside the top 100 in nine cat  we always knew there was a big downside to him so when he was going in the 40s that's why I stopped even looking at it there was no chance  60s I would have taken a shot  40s no way  not when the other guys that were on the board were like guaranteed 60 or better floor type of dudes and those are the guys that were going around where he was yeah they probably didn't have the oh my God if this hits they could be number 25 kind of appeal  that perhaps he did  for some of those guys who was like oh if this hits they'll be like  seven slots ahead of where I drafted them but that's okay because remember and this is the tangential thought I wanted to come back to because someone I put a thread out on Twitter or a post out on Twitter yesterday I wanted people to remind me of some of my biggest misses over the years I'm sure I've had some big ones and again like I'm not gonna write all of this stuff down but someone came back and was just like here's all the players you were too low on this season like that's not really what I asked for but it jogged my memory because they were like you were too low on Scotty Barnes yeah they're right about that by the way you were too low on LeBron James so far yes he's having an efficiency season for the ages even though he's used to just actually much lower than in Seasons passed and typically usages value  see the whole season goes so far LeBron has been insane I mean expecting him to make a massive efficiency jump in his age 39 season  okay he's obviously a sideboard but whatever and they were like Dan you're making me miss out on all of the League winners this year like wait just a second okay  I'll take the criticism on being too low on Scotty Barnes I'll take the criticism on being for now at least two low on LeBron James what I'm not gonna take the criticism for is missing out on League winners that's baloney  because where was LeBron going LeBron was going at 25  to 30  and he's a mid-second rounder meaning he's jumped  a half around to a round  that's not a League winner  and you know who I was taking around that same spot  Kawhi Leonard  who's actually ranked ahead of LeBrons so far this year and has played in more I know knock on every piece of wood you can find and it's actually played in more games by one LeBron's been pretty healthy as well  Mickey missed what missed their last ball game did he miss one early or like half of a game early in the year they both in oddly healthy  so like take it easy there yeah the Dan best birth method  sometimes misses out on the big swing type of guys that's true because if I'm afraid they have significant downside I'm not going to tell you to take them in the first three or four rounds I think that's a way that you could blow up your team on draft night you can't win your draft I mean you can't win your league on draft night if you're in a competitively you just can't unless you're perfect and that generally means me guys that hit or don't fail in the early part of the draft and then hits in the free swinging middle and late part of the draft that's how that's like the only way you win your league on draft night you know when your league by taking a shot in the third round  you can get a small boost  because you taking a third rounder that you know like LeBron let's say you took him at like 28 and he's number 16  that's good but he's not winning your league  but what if it went the other way like a Jordan Poole what if you took him at 39 and now he's a drop  where you could have taken to take an example of somebody who was like a plotting type that's been totally fine but not great like a Freddy Van Vleet  you took him in call at the early fourth and he's been and early 5th round player instead or something like that  you know you took him at you took him at 37 he's number 408  that doesn't blow up your team  and that's again now sometimes the Dan best Bruce method is going to find you some of these gems like Kauai so far this year like a Brook Lopez a little bit later not a good example because he's not in those first few rounds we are trying not to lose our league in the first two to three rounds it's why I only took lamelo ball in one spot he didn't make sense  as the number 11 pick if you were trying to win field goal percent  it's why I didn't take Jordan Poole in the third or fourth round  there was way too much risk there  if you drafted Jordan Poole with your third or fourth round pick your team could still be in pretty good shape like if you followed him up with Tyrese Maxey or Scotty Barnes or something like that that's the way that you could sort of like trade effectively you covered for a massive error but if you didn't get one of those big leapers right behind him  if you drafted Jordan Poole relatively early your team is probably in kind of rough shape or middling maybe say middling  I'm guessing those of you that that drafted Jordan Poole that are still near the top of the board probably took like maybe Chet right behind him or Maxi right behind him or Barnes pretty close behind  because now you turned A fifth or sixth round guy into a first  that's the way you make up for a big hole now if you took those guys and you didn't take that big swing beforehand I mean  that's how you end up with a Powerhouse fantasy team but all that to say I'm going in We're looping in vast erratic circles on today's show all of that to say  if you want a show where I'm gonna tell you to take massive hacks in the third and fourth round it's the wrong show it's just not the way that I win fantasy fantasy leagues  I win fantasy leagues and I hope that I can teach you guys how to win fantasy leagues by being relatively cautious early unless there is an absurd absurd  value on the board which typically happens when older more boring guys fall a little bit farther than they should  and that's happening a bunch of spots James Harden fell way farther than he should because there was confusion over whether he'd get traded but come on there was no way Philly was gonna let that hang over their season if Harden was still there just gumming up the works  making everything a circus that's how you lose mb2  they had to get him out quick  they did they got him out quick  Kawaii another example of someone that was going near 30 because everybody's like oh he's not gonna play in 50 55 games it doesn't matter it's per game but it's per game performance is ridiculous  it doesn't always result in a guide blowing past their number those are a couple of examples of where it did but a lot of guys  in this method end up pretty close to where they're drafted and that's okay in the first 30 to 40 picks that's okay  take your hacks from 48 on basically or maybe a little before that  all right we went way off the rails there on Jordan Poole Zach Collins is the next name on the I'm scared to drop or nervous board I don't know that I would drop him just yet Spurs have been  sort of goofing around with their starting lineup and Colin's is not in it right now and Wendy's going completely insane at Center which makes me think they might just see how it goes for a little bit I know maybe they run into a Nicola yokich and they'll throw Zac Collins at him instead  but right now I suppose her love and when be at the five and if that continues for I'm honestly even one or two more games I think we move on from Collins at that point because even when he was starting Etc he was sitting just outside the top 100 so it wasn't like he was exploding draft or exploring fantasy boards he was just decent and I like to decent but if anything went away which it has then he falls out hey we passed the 30-minute Mark opportunity to remind all of you guys to check out our buddies at manscaped.com you know what I should do on these shows I have the ability to and I always forget to do it I should

room  oh no  absolutely terrible all right well we got to do Cleveland now because the news is just bad  poor Cavaliers fans Darius Garland is expected to miss several weeks with a fractured jaw that was the news from like a half an hour ago when I was able to then update the board for this show to say that Darius Garland is now upgraded from the watch list guy to an injury replacement player and then four minutes ago news broke that Evan Mobley will be undergoing knee surgery and is likely to miss six to eight weeks yikes  so who does this help by the way well for one careless Levert obviously on the Darius Garland news max strus this helps him a lot he got more usage the last time Garland was out and Mobley's been out for a little bit Dean Wade's been playing but he hasn't been doing anything  basically this means the Cavs are gonna have to change everything that they do when they operate  and I also worried that this might be a thing that says yes maybe this just isn't our year maybe we should go try to get a whole bunch of stuff for Donovan Mitchell but perhaps I'm getting out in front of my skis  I don't think I'm gonna be the only one to get out in front of his skis today on that though if this if this news if the Cavs over the next call it three weeks when we assume Garland is out for two to three weeks if they lose a bunch of ball games and then Garland comes back and they keep losing games without Mobley that might be the time to go get something for their prize to asset in Donovan Mitchell  but we'll see I don't think you have to make any moves yet with that in mind the nice thing is Caris LeVert is the move regardless so if Mitchell gets traded and he stays in the money so go get Carousel over wherever you can this could extend beyond the Darius Garland injury and then as far as Mobly goes it probably helps Jared Allen I know he hasn't been all that great lately but like they're gonna have to play him as many minutes at Center as his body can handle hopefully he doesn't break down in the process but just absolutely brutal brutal news for the Cavaliers who lost two of their three best players and their season is in real trouble right now yikes that's sucks  that's sucks so sorry sorry Cleveland fans IO soon though is on the watch list he has a good ball game or had a good ball game in his last time out I don't think that's something that's going to stick Kelly Olynyk  almost put him on the ads board I just have no idea what the Jazz are doing with their starting five every ball game so I just don't really feel comfortable telling you all to add on Olynyk if we could blink twice  and then he's just not in the starting five anymore if he's in the starting five I think we can start a Linux I know he's been sort of like doing a Ben Simmons impersonation since he's moved into the starting five I just realized I have a misspelling in  Kula blee I'm gonna fix that while we're on air because it's actually really upsetting to me and it means I probably also have that misspelling on Twitter man that's that's really that's crummy you I hate you hate to see it cooler please on my watch list I just I really don't think that he's all the way there in redraft I think that he may be gets there when guys start get shutting down Jordan Poole is questionable for the Wizards next ball game honestly it's with an injury but he should be questionable for sucking  Jordan Poole has been so bad and watching him play in that last ball game was like a reason to turn off basket ball  and it wasn't just that he like didn't look good at basketball he just like he wasn't paying attention to anything  he was floating he was treating it like a practice drill and teams were just ramming it down his throat anyway so you might get a little run of Kula believe here if Jordan Poole is hurt or if they just don't want him to play  but he needs somebody out in front of him to get enough shots Malachi branham's on the watch list I don't think he's gonna do enough also his percentages stink but keep an eye on it Spurs are trying a bunch of crap and then Josh Hart because I cannot for the life of me figure out what he's gonna do on a night tonight basis he's been barely good enough to start for about the last month so if you wanted to you probably could  but the whole Josh Hart thing continues to confuse me and so I'm just leaving him on the watch list for now  oh my goodness here is the injury replacement board its a dolly womper here we go I'm just gonna read them off and I will okay so let's do it this way I'm gonna say the name of the player and who's out  and then I'm gonna let you know if they're a head-to-head wrote All or all formats player okay that'll move us through this thing at a pretty good clip  Isaiah hartenstein filling in for Mitchell Robinson all formats  Duncan Robinson filling in for Tyler hero all formats Kyle Lowry filling in also for Tyler hero all formats I met jacquez Junior kind of also filling in for Tyler hero but also probably a little bit Haywood Highsmith he was all formats and then he was sort of not like in between and then he went back I'd say head-to-head is the really safe play there  teetering coin flip on all formats for jacquez  Kayla Barton filling in for Highsmith and out of Bio he's an all formats guy right now Kobe White's and obvious ones Zach Levine since exactly went down Kobe White Front went from top one to top 50 as a big that's an Al Horford size jump all formats Patrick Willie's Levine and Caruso out I'm gonna go ahead to head only on him right now  Brandon Miller with mellow out all formats saddiq Bey with Jalen Johnson out all formats Nick Richards with Mark Williams out all formats Dante eggs with Kyrie and Josh Green out I probably lean head only on that one Tim Hardaway Jr same guys out for the Mavericks I think you can go all formats there certainly better head to head than Road I just think he probably hits enough three-pointers on the road oh side to cover up the ugly  so all formats Collin Sexton with Jordan Clarkson and keyonte George out mmm we'll go all four mats for him  Brandon podemski with Draymond out and Wiggins benched  I'm gonna go ahead to head only on Brandon although teetering on all formats  head-to-head yes Roto coin flip  Norman Powell with Paul George out although I don't think they expect PG to miss much time but Powell is I go ahead to head only on that one us our Thompson with Jane Lin Duran and Marvin Bagley out he is an all formats guy well those two were down  that's a lot of them wasn't it that was a lot  here's some buys and sells  some of these are repeat names and we're not going to go into huge detail on it because I talk about these guys you know five six minutes at a time on the Buy Low and sell High shows that we're doing every week  but some Bilo names DeMar DeRozan because again like at some point here the free throw percent is going to get back where it needs field goal percent is gonna get back in the right direction his value right now is only where it is because his percentages are not where they've been throughout his career  so you kind of have to just assume that that's going to fix itself Keegan Murray is a Bi-Lo also percentages but also just sort of like settling into health  cam Johnson still I think just folks expect him to I mean he's a little bit boring I get it but like he's hovering in the 80s and 90s for the year even though he's been more like a 50 to 80 type of guy the last you know three weeks before weeks so it's again you're small margins on that one  okongwu on Yoko he's starting to play alongside Clint capela that's colossal  go get him  Damian Lillard who I still think that his field goal percentage in particular is going to tick back up I also think it's some point here you're going to see Giannis miss a game or two or just sort of throttle back for a game or two and will come on a tad bucks are still kind of figuring out how the pieces fit as Chris Middleton plays a little bit more  so highs I've had on every single cell High boards in the first week of the year and that is Kyle kuzma and you're running out of time because he's now down to number 86 remember he was in the 50s he was in the 40s actually after the first week and then he was in the 50s for a little bit it's just that the percentages are headed toward where we always knew they'd be he's good at points 3 assists from the power forward spot rebounds are fine I guess but he's a negative in a lot of stuff and that's hard to overcome he's going to become a larger negative in those things field goal free throw in particular as the season goes  get out before it happens you can still get a lot for him because he's scoring a ton  CJ McCollum that's a pretty obvious one I mean he's having good ball games but 2.3 combined defensive stats is very high free throw percent is high maybe it's coming back also the 1.3 turnovers is exceptionally low he's just been playing damn near perfect basketball when he's been on the court but we're all still only 12 games into his season so things are about to Pivot a little bit  we probably missed our window on the shade and sharp sell I've had him on the last two cell boards but now guys are coming back for Portland and he had a bad ball game yesterday so we probably missed that window but you know maybe somebody still  thinking he's going to  overcome the efficiency stuff which he was able to when everybody was hurt and he was playing 42 minutes and taking 20 shots a game that's just not gonna happen as guys come back  and finally Terry Rozier and we talked about him at Great length on our cell hi show he's number 23 on the season right now and a lot of that because lamelo balls out he said 7.66 and he's shooting 40% from the field these are just things that aren't going to stick usage just gonna I don't want to say drop off a cliff but it is going to take a pretty significant hit when lamelo ball comes back  Rozier has had plenty of seasons in Charlotte where he's been in that 40/50 range that's not out of the question and right now I think you could probably get someone back for him in that range I would probably do it because there is still the fear that it gets worse than that for rows here  the other you know dice you roll here is hope that he has one or two more gigantic ball games and you might be able to sell for a tiny bit more but if we get any new news about coming back and you're a competitive league someone's gonna see that and go yeah sorry dude you know I'm not gonna buy terrorism if I'm not getting all of this extra stuff out of him so  see you later kind of thing and that  is your week in review and as I mentioned I don't think that there's a massive reason for us to look at what's upcoming if only because like for example  if we were gonna do the weekend preview just as a point of reference you know throw that on the board here like Detroit Philly we already talked about Kelly oubre we already talked about us our Thompson we talked about Killian Hayes  what else like what else could I possibly tell you I'm watching in these ball games we've talked about all the relevant players  Indie we know we're not we're not going to take the power forward Plunge  pfps baseball that's a pitchers Fielding their position in for Indiana  it's a power forward plunge  Washington we already talked about like we've covered all of these angles and then I'm just repeating myself so instead what I'd like to do here at the tail end of the show while I once again welcome the fact that we did now Crest over the 100's really its incredibly flattering to me that we've only really been putting out actual video content on YouTube for one year and we've already gotten to this point  and obviously I owe some of that to the fact that we built up a really big following elsewhere in the traditional pod Twitter Etc and so a lot of you have been pretty willing to just kind of come over and hang out with us here on the YouTube side but it's awesome I'm like I'm blown away I don't know that this happened at all last year other than the trade deadline show which I mean that one's always a ridiculous blast one time we got up near a thousand and that was like I know big big YouTube Pages they do this stuff with their eyes closed but this is still cool for me especially considering that my backdrop is a 2020 sticker covered draft board and a bedroom behind that  someday I'll get a professional backdrop but it won't be while we're paying rent in Los Angeles  what else we got going on I mostly just want to thank everybody  for hanging out  amazing work by all of you guys for helping each other in the chat room that's really cool to see while I'm talking I can just see the this chat room flying along thank you to everybody that's been liking and raiding and subscribing on the show thank you to those that have gone and Hunted Me Down on social at Dan best person thank you to those that have come to hang out with us in Discord we did get a question yesterday  how to get access to the pros over on Discord basically you get a premium

podcast I've been trying to make this point lately and I keep forgetting to do it I get email alerts when people post comments not chat room  comments on the YouTube shows meaning after the show is done live when I sign off today it'll get logged into the books YouTube will finish you know doing whatever processing it needs to do and then you can just leave a comment so if you have a question in the chat room that maybe didn't get answered by other Chatters or you want Dan to take a look at it me I'm speaking in the third person now  I don't do it fast I'm not gonna see the comment and then it's just jump in there because I've got 1000 other things going on but at some point in the following 24 hours I do typically get to those as ask anybody in the chat rooms or in the comments section I get to them so as you're watching this over the weekend please take a moment to subscribe and then if you have a question use the comments box I promise you I will see it eventually  and with that
