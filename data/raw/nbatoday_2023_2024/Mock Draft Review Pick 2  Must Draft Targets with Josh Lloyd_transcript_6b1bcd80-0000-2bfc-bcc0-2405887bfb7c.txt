welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  man what's happening everybody back to back shows here on this lovely Wednesday afternoon  it's fantasy NBA today I'm your host Dan Vespers and very excited today because not only did we have a sweet back-to-back but here on the second half of our twin Bill we'll be talking to the wonderful Josh Lloyd about his nine cat mock results he's also got a few late targets up his sleeve and we'll get to that in about 20 seconds first  welcome you can find me on social at Danbury please do take a moment to like right subscribe you guys know the Spiel at this point every little bit you do helps for our young blossoming flower of a sports ethos YouTube account  I know  I get weird with these things Josh good day to you sir was that a little too weird  it sounds like you need to be in a registry to be on August I like him afford to move right now it's too expensive here in Los Angeles Josh I doing man I'm good I'm good you better before I heard that yeah you guys you don't like my flower metaphor for our Sports eat those you know I might I'm not throw whatever out there I'm I'm pretty I'm pretty reflective I can take it along yeah you know I mean we've you you're they can I call you an avid show host you've done quite a few of them yeah quite I'm closing it on 4000 total shows in that I've hosted in on my show my career so yeah I would say that it is something that I don't detest yeah you're sort of into it a little bit so you know what I'm about to say which is  this is a two-part thing the run-up to the season is equal parts delightful and wonderful because we've been suffering through an off-season where we are providing content that at times is like oh my God what am I going to talk about today and at the same time there's so much to talk about right now that I'll admit I'm a little bit sleepy so  fair yeah like it's it also part of the thing in this portion of the year is that we've been  you know building up to it and working to get stuff out and so many angles to cover and then you just start overthinking things and you know but what if this isn't right and what if this isn't here and this happens differently and we still have so many questions that we don't know and I mean sometimes you have to be like and I've sort of taking more of that attitude on this season it's like hey starts going to change its going to change a lot and sometimes even if something changes a very small amount it's gonna throw so many different things that everything's a domino if someone then averages point to steals fewer than you thought they would then that guy might move down 10 spots and then that changes the value of five other guys and then you go oh you had this guy 20 spots okay this is what happens and if you sit there and overthink and over analyze and it's why I've been really big on this season in talking about drafts and it's like you know your draft is not the end of anything it's not even it might be 50% of what you do like there is so many ways to change recover adjust your team as the season goes on so don't be disheartened or be posted for that you've got the best team in the world you've got the  shittest team in the world because yeah stuff changes real quickly Josh you can find of course on social at Red Rock underscore b-ball host of almost fourth house in episode's that's crazy man the lockdown fantasy basketball podcast so you said something in there before we get to your your mock team because that is what's coming up here in a moment but you mentioned about like the concept of overthinking and I found that I am a constant victim of that and some of it is because there's  you know part of our job as as show hosts is to talk to other people I've struggled sometimes with  just sort of this like Cooks in my kitchen like I want to make sure that I'm talking to all the people that are very smart and doing these things a lot but you almost have to like at the end of some shows flip your brain switch and go okay now wait a minute like what do I actually how do you  want to say have you ever run into this kind of thing but how do you combat that if there is a lot of different pieces of information out there like how do you figure out the ones that you really agree with  I think the way that I do it and I'm always adjusting the way that I approach things is is that when I am doing something I do everything that I think in a relative vacuum right so I'll go through and do all my thoughts and projections and all that sort of stuff in a relative vacuum and sit back and think about it and look at it and then when I talk to others I'll hear their arguments and most of the time because of the way I work I have already heard that argument or I have dismissed it or I've brought it on or whatever in my process so I'm if this happens or if this happens or if this happens and someone might come in and I've said it on like path a and someone else might have said it on path better yeah I did think about that but I've got this way so I my exhaustive initial process usually puts me through all the different paths that are projection or thought can take on a player and so when I do hear somebody else's thing I have it's generally not something that is new information so I have already thought about it considered it and you know not dismissed but also thought like to me that wasn't how I the direction I wanted to go so not that I'm not swayed because I'm always taking on new information but the new information I'm taking on is usually something the materially changes through words that are coach has said or an injury or a trade or a free agent signing then I can make my choice on that but I'd like to I don't ever just go in and go well this guy was this and therefore he is this and that's what I'm thinking because I look at what about all these different scenarios what's most likely sit on that and then I can hear other arguments and be always open to the fact that there's many paths for every player to take really  let's take a look at the draft board as we dive on in I and apologies in advance I know that everything is very small I maximize space here to the best of my ability I mean I thought I did okay by all accounts those that are listening I'll make sure that I read off every name on the board Josh has the number two pick you we've done this before Josh I think we've done this the last four four some odd years in a row leading up to the season so you guys know or you know what's coming to anybody that is listening to this for the first time we're just gonna take a journey through Josh's team from point one to point I eliminated the 12th neuron to actually because I think half of the teams Auto picked in that one so I went round one through round 11 on the board right now and then we'll get anybody else that you were perhaps looking at in those last two or three rounds that didn't get to your team that either got scooped up too early or just kind of ran out of slots to place them so I don't want to call it controversial but an interesting pick right out of the Chute at number two you did not go don chich or MB and jumped straight to Tyreese Halliburton who I'm high on Indy I went on a betting podcast this morning or betting show this morning I said I think he's gonna have a really good year and halliburton's sort of at the center of it is this a less controversial call then people might think  it is Halliburton it too  that's a good way of phrasing it because people will think that that is silly to take you and I do want to stand that right I mainly wanted to do something to mix it up a little bit but just to change because my thought process he's he's joking sheets there at number one he might not finish number one I don't care right it doesn't matter you take him at number one but to me the next three guys are pretty much equivalent and understanding the way that assists are quite a tough category to get I can get a league leader in assists there yeah the points aren't going to be particularly strong for Halliburton there but also when I get back around to my second round pick a lot of those 2627 Point scores are gone anyway so I'm okay with being a little bit weaker in that area but I just do I feel more confident in in bead being healthy or with turmoil and Philadelphia no not really like and I just I just wanted to do it like honestly like I think that  we can have these set top six or top seven or whatever you want to say and there are certain sections we can just mix and match and  it doesn't as long as you make the correct decisions on your team later on  and I think you get actually hurts you to do something a little bit different in that spot I don't know that there's a whole lot to add there we'll have probably longer discussions on a few of the players in the middle I don't know that there's gonna be a long discussion on your second rounder either because he's a little bit of a Dan Vespers favorite and that's Jimmy Butler at 23 older player not super exciting but a team that as we saw last year needed every ounce of Butler late in the season to get even into the damn playoffs before they made their improbable finals run Emoji at 23 anything people need to know about this pick or is it just kind of like a look this dude is a top 12 per game guy and you don't expect him to have any massive injury concerns beyond the usual nagging stuff I had a feeling whatever cracks I'm leaving open there yeah that's the only thing with him he's he's starkly he has worn down through March didn't happen last season but it's happened before five times in his career  but I'm okay with him they look like wouldn't have if Lilith had a rhymed in Miami wouldn't have been looking at him in that position but as a team used by the same as they were actually worse than they were last season so I'm okay I'm okay with getting there I don't love it look it's not doing in every single situation there are the guys that I would take in that Spotlight for example like Jimmy Harden goes a couple of pics later but I just don't know what's happened like on you did he was settled in Philadelphia then I'll definitely have taken him as I assume many other people would have but it's not the case so Jimmy was okay there and it's not an egregious like  reach or in there is still a little bit of upside in it I think it just works with my halibut and pick earlier on  bam Edibles at 26 in the third round and other player that benefited from Dame not going to Miami tell me about the the fit here was this a situation where he was your favorite player on the board where he was a player that was both very good and kind of fit some of the things that were missing  obviously very durable which is helpful after Butler who maybe isn't what went into the band pick here at 26 I wish I could remember exactly Dan but now I'm trying to go back and because we did this one yes  I'll tell you what  current Josh thinks about what past Josh did I picked Tara's halibut and so all right I'm probably not gonna lean into getting blocks in in this draft but when you lean into  you know avoiding blocks or disregarding blocks it's really tough to make sure that you also like keep your rebounds and field goal percentage high they are the Holy Trinity of stats that combined together right so getting a big man in these early rounds despite the punting blocks is key bam doesn't get Blocks he's values in eroded by me disregarding that category field goal percentage a bit of rebounding now I was probably a little bit higher on band when I did this and why I am now because I thought that they wouldn't be starting Kyle Lowry which meant that there would be more of an opportunity for bams assist numbers to rise it does appear that Larry is going to start now so we've seen the impact of Larry and that's starting lineup and it just does reduce all of Bam's assist opportunities so I'm not sure I would have necessarily gone that Direction with him if I knew now if I need then what I do now but in terms of that fit of a big man that makes a little bit of sense and again is it egregiously high know is it a Super Value that slid not particularly I think it's just sort of what it is  yeah I'm taking us off course here for a second I just had a conversation earlier today with Brew on an episode about draft strategy or I was asking for folks that were more novice level maybe novice to even sort of like low intermediate is it do you think in like an easier way to build a team generally leaning towards these safer more durable guys  is it easier to do it um or just like a way that maybe you'd suggest someone break into playing fantasy if they were doing it for a first time kind of thing  yeah that's that is interesting the I don't know what I don't know what the right answer is on that either it's attributing things interesting Dan because I tried to look at this stuff every single year and games played do not correlate year on year right so we could say bambet to years ago didn't miss like 30 games with a thumb injury so he might be durable but stuff happens right there's always random things that happen so it's an okay Baseline in a lot of situations my my general rule and that sort of stuff is if you've got a repetitive lower body issue then I will put an element of risk on that player but if it's like something that  was sort of out of control like Bam's thumb issue I'm not really going to consider it but it also doesn't guarantee that he's going to be there and healthy in terms of what a novice player does it is really really hard to  to get it to get into that I don't know like yeah sometimes it's hard for me and like I'm sure you have this problem is that you absorb this stuff 12 hours a day 365 days in the year and then you're like the question is oh someone who just dropped in now two days before the season starts what should they know I don't know yeah I'm struggling actually I actually don't really know how to provide that best basic  which are probably need to get better at so yes to answer your question in a terrible way I would say yes those guys that  you have it well probably doesn't give you the best chance of winning it gives you the best chance of not being terrible yeah you are a novice in there being not terrible playing out the season being competitive learning as you go along is probably a benefit rather than I'm going to swing for the fences on these guys and if it doesn't work out you well this game shit I'm terrible at how can I do it I never come back right so you yes is your answer yeah I think that's kind of the way I'm leaning too and then the last thing you said kind of put the cherry on it was like play out of season you give yourself an opportunity to learn all the different nuances of the game the way you change strategy at different parts of the year maybe you slip into your playoffs if it's head to head and you start to get to learn that process it does I think take a year for folks to kind of figure out the game a little bit if you're just breaking in so hanging in there is probably maybe that's the the answer that question and the fourth you want Jordan Poole and he is is he one of the most polarizing players in fantasy drafts right now  give me the give me the Josh Jordan Poole pitch  folks picture this nightmare scenario  your hosting friends for the big game it's neck and neck in the fourth quarter and suddenly you realize  you're out of drinks  boo say all of your friends you start to sweat  your friends turn on you you're forced to go on a last second drink run and end up missing the game-winning touchdown while in line oh no  terrifying isn't it  luckily you can avoid the drama with drizzly the go-to app for drink delivery with drizzly you can shop a huge selection of

quarterbacking from you guessed it  your armchair  download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com that's d r i z l y.com today must be 21 plus not available in all locations um is he polarizing probably a little bit I'll tell you and I think you know why Dennis people just think he's a terrible player people just go man this guy sucks the worries just gave him aways okay that's cool but it doesn't actually mean anything he's not terrible that was a terrible it's a weird season he's still was solid enough you also had a 30% usage in 30 minutes and is an 85 Plus percent free throw shooter absolute minimum who can run as a point guard and handle the ball and getting someone who might average let's say 25 a game minimum who might hit three threes a game who might get five and a half to six assists who might get to the Line 6 at times and hit 88% it's a pretty good player right and I don't think any of those things are an outrageous thing to suggest especially if he starts alongside low usage tires low usage Bilal Colby and low usage Danford right he's going to have a lot of opportunities to do that I would think that getting him at 407 here in a lot of the draft so he goes in  early to mid round three and I wouldn't have any issue of someone wanted to look at him not any issue I think it's takes away valuable if you look at the end of round two he could return that very like the could he be Trey young with fewer assists maybe and that's like Trey young goes at the end of round one so trade market Tennessee is Paul Michael six but otherwise what what is the difference in their overall game is does pool so I'll admit he's a player that I'm struggling with and when I struggle to handicap a player I end up not drafting them because I just like well I don't know what I'm getting out of this do you feel like the the field goal percent is going to be a small issue a medium issue or a big issue that's what I mean for me that's where I'm sort of sitting as I don't know it could be it could be anyone of the three  I think it's going to be a sizeable issue really but we're talking head to head here and I can deal with that on a weekly basis especially Jimmy is not a bad field goal guy Bam's a good field goal guy you'll see some of my lighter Peaks have some decent field goal but also if I lose it I lose it I think when I'm looking at these things if he's providing me a sizeable boost in points in threes and free throw percentage with a significantly above average assist likely good as well I can sacrifice that one category there so I'm not gonna be turned off by a what's the same thing like yeah we've seen Fred vanvleet go in round 2 for many many years is Jordan Poole going to shoot 39% from the field I doubt it so if you're able to withstand friend of ample bad field goal percentage in round two for years and years and years and are then I'm pretty happy getting pulled at 47 by the way and the reason that I ground in hard on that is because your nest pit next pick 3 picks later is the exact opposite on the field goal percent spectrum and that's Zion at pick 50 so was that a consideration you're like well I just took pool I might as well get the guy that balance is that or is this I just like Zion here  I'm just trying to think back and I'm just looking at how my team yeah remember what he's Josh was thinking yeah I'm just trying to say how my team ended up projecting in those stats and with the way that I built the team I was actually  sitting at like 82% from the from the line so having Butler big free throws big attempts Halliburton big free throws medium attempts cool big free throws big attempts and you'll see later on I got a few other big free throw guys as well and  it's a swing but you talk about novice players taking risk like taking Zion on it 51 or something it's a risk it might not work out but we also saw yesterday hear about five Steals and two blocks in 22 minutes or something which is something that he flashed when he was in college and has it in the MBA but if he does that and then scores 29 Points on 63% shooting and gets you 1.5 Steals and a block with seven rebounds when then while he beats his by 30 spots I think comfortable but he probably doesn't right probably doesn't but he also and I didn't actually realize this Danny's two years ago I think it was he played 61 out of 72 games yeah that was crazy injured every year and I'm not telling you that he's  a beacon of health or he's going to stay healthy but we have the impression and I had it as well did he's never had a healthy season but he did he did have a healthy season he had won just two years ago and so that to me says that well it is possible is it likely no but it's possible it is possible yeah I had that same realization when I was looking at the the year by year I went oh look at that he did it one time yeah that's right wow and this same thing happened to me not with lamelo ball because everyone's like screaming yeah he did one time deals guy he played 75 games a year ago and people got mad he's always he played 75 games what 10 blocks of played 75 games last year and again this is not to say that he will play 75 games or that he didn't have an ankle problem but we see what happened in the last season and just go well that's it that's everything he's ever done and everything that he will do moving forward and it's just not true if between those two guys I feel like we have to be a little more confident that the smaller one who's not built like a Mack truck can withstand the durability stuff a little better right  orcas depends doesn't it because you might you could I could argue the Opposites back to earlier point about taking other people's opinions on down I could say well LaBella balls more frail so he's more like true knocked over and land on his wrist and break his arm because he doesn't have the ability for guys to bounce off him which one of those is the more accurate assessment I've got no idea but yeah like you can you can make those I don't think that remember having these argument with someone and I've lost the argument about Zion before he came into the man I don't know look he's he's waiting a problem is going to be so much issue with his body and I said  to them okay that's cool but we've also never seen anybody at this size be as explosive and athletic as him maybe there's just a bunch of stuff that's different with him because honestly you've never seen someone do this before so that might mean that all these other things of all of someone is a little bit more overweight this extra stress on their needs and it's gonna blow out all the time maybe that doesn't apply not the designs had persistent knee problems because that hasn't been easy it's been other stuff and it's been more I think with Zion not the his size causing the injury it's his lack of motivation getting back here it's been more of the problem because a hamstring he could have been back in three or four weeks but I every report would suggest that the reason he didn't he's because he didn't want to because he just didn't like he ate himself out of shape he was depressed at the injury and so much other stuff going on in his life lack of commitment not that he just constantly was getting hurt on caucus cars get hurt all the time on the court and they come back he's probably he doesn't come back  that is brutal do you think that any of that mental stuff has improved year over year hard for us to know  it is hard for us to know there has  there has been an overwhelming volume of comments that suggest that is at least marginally different and I have heard that a little bit behind the scenes as well but  I don't know is it people blowing smoke up your ass I don't know but when you try and compare the volume of what you hear  Now versus what you might have heard last offseason it is very different all right the tenor and the tone of what the players and the coaches and the GMS and assistant GMS are saying it's part of that motivational I don't know but it is a very different level that you're hearing I think I like it honestly I could spend the next 15 to 20 just talking about Zion but I guess we should probably keep going probably Simon's at the end of the sixth in I can almost lump the next two together a little bit Tyler Hero at the start of the seventh if you wanted to talk about one two or both of them Simon's obviously stepping into a much larger role with Damian Lillard not there anymore Tyler Hero on the other side of that same discussion Dame didn't go to Miami and so like Tyler hero gets to keep the role that he had in Prior years do you think any let me try to ask this question in a fresh new fun way do you think anything changes for Tyler Heroes season overseas and then for Simon means how does he how does his role evolved over the course of this year as the Blazers work scoot into things more and more  the reason I took these guys is they relatively equivalent right in terms of players hero had a really strong start in rebounding last season came back to Earth but he's going to have to be relied upon a little bit more they lose Vincent and they lose stress and they replace them with Richardson so that's not like a one-to-one replacement it's obviously two to one so he's going to be relied upon a little bit more but when I took you know Halliburton or to let us know how about but mainly pool getting these guys to help offset Zions free throws but like okay let's let up let's get a let's get threes it's get points let's get free throw percentage let's make them a real big strength of this team knowing that it's going to be harder to get some of these categories later on and I think both of those players  are in situations where they can outstrip that position as for Simon's I let me put it this way I have a small worry about Simon's I think that for the start of the Season he will smash this number and yeah I was someone was like man watching top 10 scorer in the NBA they're going to put everything through him like okay that's that's interesting right that's useful but long-term my understanding and it might have changed my understanding with the Blazers is that the back court is sharpened it is not Simons so do they sell off at the deadline does he get moved somewhere I would put that as a 0.5% chance but if sharp is like now where you're too good to be playing forth offensive fiddle or playing Off the Bench and some team wants Simons to be there 28 minute a night Lou Williams Jordan Clarkson on a good team I  this is I wouldn't be shocked if Simon's place for a different team into the season wow okay  man that's for sure but I know that this I haven't checked on this super recently but it was always like Scoot and sharp and Simon's is sort of sitting there will give you a little bit of stuff to do this season but ideally he we probably move on he's what I was understanding of this team yeah a little while ago so is this a play where you're actually like consciously working on trying to move him from your fan a team partway through the year or now look again if if I hear a little bit more than yes I'm just putting it out there are certain situations where I go to his Halliburton is not getting moved right that is not happening it's almost there's no almost no chance to Bam at a bio is getting moved there's probably no chance at Austin Reeves is getting moved which is my next pick up that but  if I'm going to put likelihoods on things I'm not gonna like if it did come out the time it was never makes sense I would not be making moves based on that I'm not sitting in a situation where I know this is going to happen or it is actively happening but it would not Shock Me in the slightest  arson Reeves by the way you got at 95 here in this one he's been an interesting fantasy season Journey because I think he was getting drafted in the 70s when everything opened up in August two months ago and now he's falling back into the mid to late 90s  what what's the story there like for someone who had as much hype with the FIBA stuff as Reeves and and is it just like putting distance between the last time people saw him or have has there been a lot of negative press that I haven't seen about him why did he fall 20 slots in fantasy drafts because I I rather like him here in the mid-90s let me tell you my thought process on not on why I picked him but what I think has happened to Reeves is that  I don't know why would it opened up at that spot but what I do know that happened is that as soon as the World Cup was on and then the US got eliminated and this was more apparent on ESPN but I do a weekly check-in on rankings and adps and when the US got eliminated the top three Falls in ADP where Anthony Edwards Jaron Jackson and Austin Reeves because they struggled in that third place game right and Jackson there was so much publicity about his rebound numbers and Reeves had like seven points or whatever in that final game and they fell like six five spots in a week in ADP all right so we're seeing that and then there's the Lakers pushback why is this Freud on Team USA it's only because he plays with Lakers blah blah the second thing I think is is that I've never really seen this happening a huge amount until this season and it probably has happened I just never seen it but I'm seeing more and more people  go into drafts or talk to me and exclusively just use the numbers from last season and that doesn't capture Reeves as seasoning yes he played 28 minutes a night for the year but if you're just looking at his total season numbers from last season they don't give a a realistic view of it was playing as a bench guy behind Russell Westbrook when he was clearly their third best player he second half of the Season he started getting to the line of tan the usage went up the ball was in his hands we saw what he did in the playoffs I think he's pretty clearly that third guy on this team now but so many people default back to looking at past season numbers and just fully extrapolating them to this year without understanding that 70% of that season probably doesn't mean anything and his role drastically changed towards into the season now there's certain things about what he did end of season I'm not sure continues he shot like what 64% from two or something insane number and got to the line a crazy amount as well and some of that was without LeBron I understand all that but there is a default way that some people more than I expected look at things that go well I'm just using last year's numbers and I think that's what pushing back  do you I mean I you took him here so I assume you like him at this spot because I certainly do yeah look at and it's all about getting value down like he can get some assists yes he's not going to be a steals or blocks guy but you'll notice in some of the pics or one thing to the next pick after this where I grabbed a guy that might get a lot of steals but his ability to get some scoring some assists to influence my free throw percentage category to make it still strong while I've got Zion and what round of my own bloody round nine or something it was around yeah round eight if it doesn't if it doesn't work out he drops around it doesn't matter if you completely bust it also matters very little but if he actually even works out or improves their I'm very happy with that result is he kind of the last significant positive impact free throw guy that doesn't have a massive hole in their game  so good question I think  I think one most guys well it's when you talk holes in their game like maybe Jordan Clarkson but he's got a whole but I would also say the blog that I grabbed in round 10 has a real chance to be a massive free throw a good point yeah matheran now he had gigantic holes in his game he didn't really do anything else he shot really poorly from the field and he didn't do much else but easy to that can improve but getting what five attempts from the line or six attempts is a rookie and shooting big free throw percentage if he actually tightens up a few of those things like if I'm looking at the board here he's probably that big volume free throw guy across the last five rounds I would say I'm trying to survive if there's anyone else that's sort of in that mix it's slim though it's really him isn't it yeah yeah it's him and probably clocks and other two in those last four rounds and I quickly is a good free throw should be doesn't really get to the line and Roger is tuber he also doesn't get to the line amount so I think I probably snagged the best two of those in the forecast for round you really did that's amazing because we always get in these discussions about what what's really hard to find late in drafts and it feels like it's positive impact field goal or a free throw guys is that I don't know maybe I'm getting too caught up in it it no it is like I think a lot of the time and I'm guilty of this as well Dan as we look at these things we have the ability to say what categories golf the board when and what becomes rare and it is true but  there are always like one to two of those guys like we can say  hey you can't get high scoring players in the draft but I could get killed in Johnson in round 12 who might score 20 points big game right you could  that's one needle in a haystack guard there so it is available it's just not readily available right very easy to miss on that guy someone else could take him exactly so it's not that is I could you find a guy that averages seven assists late in the draft it's really really hard but maybe Trey Jones is there at 110 and maybe he is that guy but if you don't get him then you cook like there's not that many of those guys around so while as a general rule we just look at averages of guys there that does become hard to get but there is the one or two guys that sort of say that with points all the time but in each round as you go through this probably a 20-point score there is you know Clay in around 8 or 7 or whatever it is and then there's Simons in round six or seven there's always just one guy but if you don't get him then you're left with a bunch of blog scoring 13 points yeah good point well you were you didn't say the name of your next pick in the 9th round which would have been fine you could have said I think you could have I think you like hinted at it maybe you said it Yusef nurkic early nine  does it feel like he gets a new lease on life here after the trade that I mean it right he feels like he could be as fresh start kind of guy because I know he's at a number of Seasons where and I think you even came on this show maybe two years ago and you were like look here's the word out of port Linda that he's out of shape he's not really focused and sure enough I think what he played by half the season then got hurt and didn't really play anymore after that do we have better words Vibes the report on nerc a little better here after the trade I I don't know because I I as you might be able to tell I get information from Portland not necessarily from Phoenix so I don't have that one on Earth but I also know that that injury was in a real injury so that's a that's okay gnocchi has a really really good fantasy game right it's something happened when Chauncey Billups took over that changed their defensive scheme completely and he just never blocked shots whether that comes back on I've got no idea but on a team that doesn't have a distinct number one passing option  he can pass he is a good person and he can score and he can rebound and again it's a free money at this spot probably  is he could he get hurt yeah but I don't really think that there is  yeah I think Lisa life is a great way of putting it down I think that he is  you got again I don't know how you like to look at it but when we get to these last rounds I want to couple of guys who like if things break right I don't have to squint super hard to see them pushing 40 spots up and if nurkic goes let's say 14 10 3 and a half 1.4 blocks shoots 55 and 75 which is a big it's a step to get there but it's not impossible it's not like me saying well Anthony Simon's gonna average seven rebounds okay that's never gonna happen but no could do those things it's a Longshot but I'd rather take the long shot on that versus say I'm gonna see who picked this guy's so I don't call them out too much I was dancing called him out like if it's a zubats  all right so that's a solid but doesn't have he doesn't have he doesn't have the upside of it right like he doesn't he's okay he looking for rebounds in that spot at works and that's how like there's so many different ways you're going to approach every pick but I wouldn't say that there's a chance at zubats goes I got 34 minutes 16 and 10 two blocks and you know starts Edition assists like that's just  it's I don't believe that's gonna happen but no I can see a big improvement from here yeah I mean he's done it that's at least for my eyes that's like the easiest way to say could you see this thing happening it's like well yeah I mean if it happened already becomes a very easy thing like he's not going to shoot 90% at the line like he did well was that right yeah six games whatever was it yeah so you know that but like again you said you're getting him here in the basically a pick 100 he has you like you said you don't have to squint that hard to see him kind of blasting past that again I didn't put the 12th round on the board but I do like to kind of lump sum of these late ones together just because you start to get into this this is where I take a shot type of Zone your 10th late 10th 19 I think would be the pick number on that bennedict mathurin who you did mention earlier on and then it's so small like I can't read it which Thompson is that I saw Sr Tom that's Detroit yeah it's my bad I should have made this bigger on my own screen sorry everybody I know it's very small especially if I can't see what team they're on so I guess just talk me through those two picks towards the end of this mock  math ruins really simple I said it before like can he scored 20 points a game and get to the line six times and shoot 85% yes has he flashed a few little extra things increases and yeah I'm a little bit interested but what I do know is that the 28 minutes at night that he played last season is almost certainly going to increase his moved into the starting lineup I had a buddy hield this five extra minutes there he was a pretty empty play last season but it is it was first year right like stuff can change but getting that free throw volume he's really important plus there's more room to grow Assad Thompson it appears he's going to start I was on the fence with whether he was going to start or not it was sort of leaning towards that way at this point I think you know a lot of drives you won't see him around 11 he'll go in 10 to be a rebounds assist Steals and blocks players is a weird combination there's not many blows he do that right but he could if he played 30 minutes a night there's no reason he couldn't be five rebounds four assists 1.5 Steals and a block that's not a combination that really exists yeah he might shoot 39% and 65 from the line that is true but I also think that the volume and usage won't be super super high and it's just a guy that I like to bet on because I think is really good I think he's got amazing fear and I think you just figure shit out when he plays and I wanted some Steals and I think it brings them and I don't know who else like herb Jones is there but again herb Jones is there Dan and who took him Jonas like that that's great herb will give you those deals I don't know how much scope herb has to jump up this board  ASAP might jump down it but I think he's got more scope to jump up and that's sort of what I'm targeting  and I know I don't have our 12th on here but just looking back at your team as a whole what were your thoughts even now maybe current Josh looking back at past Josh what did you like what didn't you like is you kind of move through this thing  well and that you were going to be coming asking me like what do you think is a late round pick and one of the guys I'll do like to Target and I'd forgotten what I didn't distract so look at it so the 12th isn't here Bongos for everyone I did take Kobe white in round 12 because this was around the time when I was getting that word that he would be the starter and I would say that that is as close to locked in as you can get something happening right so he's Kobe white going to blow us away I don't know but people also I don't think paid a little much attention to Kobe last season I thought he was really really strong down the stretch of in particular three played quite well I thought that some of his like the what he was able to do if efficiency scoring even his passing is improved was intriguing I was surprised that no one paid him more than they did in the offices but what you did see and I don't know how related this is Dan so don't like hold me to this but you know that I've spoken to you about the last two months of the season when the ball started to improve and they reduced vouchers minutes and they also reduced demanded rosen's usage in that time and coincidentally or not Kobe White's production in that time went up  so did they just change the distribution of the offense a little bit to get white more involved I don't know but a starting point guard in those last rounds who you know has got scoring free throws assists threes upside is what I'll take and that's the way I built my team and  like again could I have taken Mike Conley there maybe I don't know if he went or not sure but I think there's more upside in white could take one of the Jazz guys yeah but who out of the sixth do I take that's just so many options there like white locked in  is it going to burn me I honestly don't care okay if it doesn't work out at pick whatever the bloody hell this is 100 and so I'm working out for me I whatever it doesn't matter but starting point guard light rounds let's try it out  you know I hate the term but I'm going to use it here because it's the easiest one for folks to to grab onto sleeper Zone this is this is sort of the sleeper Zone were there any other players that went in these last few rounds that you were hoping would get to your team or somebody maybe that popped up another team went oh damn that was a that was a good one who are the Josh Lloyd late Targets in addition to perhaps matheran Thompson and Kobe White  well if you want to sleep with it nobody's talking about yeah on a rope but Tim might be someone to think about you can't just say noises Josh that's not this that he's the most random player in the league and I you gonna play a single second night anyway is anyone he's a two-way go for the Bulls but in terms of the guys that I do look at in those later rounds white is always someone gonna look at Paul radius someone that I'm gonna take a look at  Assad Thompson he's one of those guys that I'll take a look at the other one that will bring up he's he's Derek Lively full these very particular reason Dan we talk about  the scarcity in the white categories and disappear once you hating to round 12 finding really anybody who has got block upside  who has a role that you think might occur it's there's nobody like out of the Flies they're all like these wingy gaudy sort of a player who's like ah maybe we'll see this guy score a little bit or get a bit of a boost or its I might take my Quentin Grimes here and see what he does the centers who have that upside they don't exist I don't and unless I'm missing some I don't know who the hell that you can get that might average 1.9 blocks in 20 minutes  that Lively can and if he actually succeeds in that role in place 26 minutes well he beats his number pretty consistently towards the end but this is just nobody else who feels that role at the end of a draft I don't look at maybe I'm missing someone I don't know who else it is I used that guy I don't think you're missing I mean just looking back at this draft alone and people can squint and see it on their screen the last shot blocker was he took Mitchell Robinson in the 11th pick of the 9th round  thank you usually goes here around that area is like Steve Adams but he's not a big shop blocker right but after he goes off the board is nobody the centers are all weird there's like this third fourth round group of centers there's the seventh eighth round group of centers and Williams and drones and Zach Collins and those guys and then you hit round 11 and they go on there's nobody there's nobody to projected for roles at all like maybe it's a Rob Williams but who knows how much he's gonna play and then where are the young upside sort of centers they're not there and again scarcity and different versus the other players that are there that is what I think draws me to getting Lively in one of those later rounds because it might not hit but if it does there's no other white person I think around someone might appear due to injuries like maybe Horford and porzingis go down and Amy is cater is starting and playing 27 minutes in Boston and he would be good but Lively's got the spot now like we see what it does but he's got the opportunity  so you take it  yeah I think the only other note there is there's literally one Center eligible player not two two who went in the last two rounds they're both listed as like forward slash center it's Paul Reed who you mentioned and Bobby Portis who was the very last pick of this Fantasy Draft Mr elephant of this draft box he never blocks a shot anyway know who doesn't block a shot so yeah I mean you but that's another funny thing and then I know I said I'd have you in and out of here and I'm running a little long with with follow-up questions it's such a weird draft because like you said that we talk about this abundance of centers but they dry up like at that there's a snap and then they're just all gone and then you're also seeing I think on the front end of drafts teams are sort of guard hunting so they get pushed all together in like the middle five rounds of a draft and if you don't make your move there you can get caught kind of with your fantasy pants down a little bit this is by the way me harkening back to me describing this YouTube page as a blossoming flower so I really tied it all together what do you do with a board that's built the way this one is I can't remember this happening in like the last decade where all the centers were just smooshed into the middle rounds like this yeah it is very distinct and you can either grab those guys or you can this is why when you know I don't know you push back on it to the term of sleepers or bus or must drafts or any sort of stuff because you know when you get into 40s and 50s and 60s the difference between a blanket 45 and 70 is so marginal and if you just want to do something different strategically and be like well I know that there's going to be four centers and often you see in round four there's like four or five centers go in a row you go all right they're all they're all gone all I do here and you know that in round seven The Gafford and Williams and Duran and someone else is gonna go okay they're all gonna go what if I don't get him so why maybe I just take Gap at 660 I get ahead of the curve and then sometimes if you do that you didn't trigger others go oh man now I've grabbed my sentence and then someone else falls down back later to you so we love sitting ourselves I think that's Ted these two one another show with these rank numbers and the ordinality of them like well this guy's 57 so therefore he is one spot better than 58 who's one spot better than 59 is one spot better than 60 that's just not real like it's just not what it is and when we look at values in an auction draft as well like the top last 30-40 blogs go for a dollar but in a head-to-head League their ranked from 110 to 150 yeah they're the same but the exact same player and the difference between the guy 10 and 20 is not the same as the guy between 10 and 30 but we obsess about these rank numbers sometimes strategically if you just move things around and mix it up and go well they're gonna all go here I know they're all gonna go here let's do a 10 spots early 20 spots early and see what happens and let's see what that leads to and then While others think of shit I need to grabs then maybe you get that guard who slid down because there's a bunch of five of them that you maybe you now two of them were pushed down to and that spot that's yeah just that's some deeper thinking or is it thinking I don't know I'm sitting here talking about fake basketball stats but it's also  a different way of looking at strategy just break the break the Mind idea that 50 is better than 60 by 10 spots because they're not  yes especially for a particular teams maybe that's the most important thing to take away from that is like and this is actually something that I struggle with and I was just talking about this on a on the show earlier today where when I'm caught on the turn this is the thing that my brain resets to its like well I didn't want to take this guy until 45 I'm not gonna have a pick for 23 damn slots after this I got no choice oh crap but my pricing him out and I get so caught up in that got off a negative feedback loop thinking that I forget like this is a guy that my team needs right now so okay fine like maybe he was gonna be a nine Slots of value and now he's not anymore but if I don't get that guy my team is in a bad way so team fit sometimes kind of Trumps the whole like can I get around a value out of a guy now it's different because you were talking about some of these guys towards the end if you're getting three four rounds of push you know the number 60 guy is better than the number 110 guy there's a there's a difference there that's 15 guy is better than the number 405 guy but you know if you're talking about someone that you have at 40 and you really  want to draft them at 50 to get that little squeeze of value but is it 41  that's okay that's an okay decision to make  fine you got like what I I used a lot of baseball analogies on this show that's just like a clean single to the opposite field you got a nice pick you move along don't stress about it it's not a home run but it's okay and Josh I took way more of your time than I intended to but I think you do have a final thought there I didn't mean to cut you off I don't know what I was gonna say it was something probably your name I'm sure know it was gonna be deep it was more just along the lines of yeah like we have to break our idea that while the draft is the most fun part of the Season like is super hard unless you just butcher six peaks in a row  you can recover from it like things change really quickly rankings for his important as they might or might not be they change really fast as well like things can adjust in the you know one extra steal a week changes to the guys valuation  immensely over the course of the year so don't just bury yourself into what an 80P is what a rankings or  someone telling you that it was a ship or a fantastic pick because young look back at it in two months and it's going to be wildly different based on someone shooting 47% of 49% and that is like such a small change in these we are dealing with my new numbers most of the time here and small changes impact stuff a lot you just got to be flexible and have the ability to actually know what you're seeing and how to how to how to fix it that was

the fact hopefully this remains fairly useful for you coming up here on fantasy NBA today tomorrow I believe we're going to be talking to Dan Titus in the afternoon he actually had the number one pick in this mock draft Titus over with Yahoo fantasy sports and I know I'm forgetting something and so with apologies if I'm forgetting an actual person that I'm talking to tomorrow if there is not a person in the morning tomorrow we might get into the most fun team show that's one that I've actually been looking forward to and I've been kind of pushing it back and back and back but that's not something that I do very often um it's kind of the anti Dan Vespers team but we'll do a most fun team we've got the Danvers old man squad coming up that'll either be a weekend episode or right before the season starts next week most of you guys already know the players that I'm targeting based on all the shows we've done but it'll be fun to sort of put them all into one gigantic pocket and we still haven't talked about the first two round combination it's not pairing it's combinations and what that sets you up with there are so many of them because it's 12 or 24 pick two basically so combinations permutations are not going to work there's a millions of ways you could actually draft those two rounds but obviously certain players are more of available to you in certain areas of those two rounds  and we'll focus on those and and kind of how do you build your teams from that we will also have a show coming up I believe it's over the weekend with Matt Smith also over at basketball monster forgot to mention that is where Josh is the lead analyst and  we'll talk to brew again before the season starts  we're getting something and I'm gonna feel bad about it as soon as I hit off air but that's where we're at now thanks again everybody see you soon
