welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I did this one a little bit different today you guys normally that watch this show you know I start with like 30 seconds of Silence everybody just looking at a thumbnail while I'm trying to catch my breath over here but not today  not today today is a very special episode of fantasy NBA today it's Legends fantasy basketball day on the show I am joined by Hall of Famer fswa Hall of Famers Steve Alexander Dr a the great Aaron Bruce is well but Steve doc I got to start the show with just a huge congratulations man that is absolutely awesome well deserved and you know I I've seen brew has stories to tell I'm on the other side of things which is  I grew up reading your stuff like you guys worked together but I read your guys's stuff and this is like the two of you are probably the two largest reasons that I ended up playing fantasy basketball and then winning it fantasy basketball and now hosting a podcast what kind of a life is this about fantasy basketball so congratulations and also thank you from those of us that that grew up on you man an honor well deserved well thank you it's pretty cool the the announcement came out last Thursday right when kamla and I were in the middle of  doing a podcast and  if there's one fantasy basketball Pioneer that I think should be in the Hall of Fame it's it's Rick Cameron I mean he had a  he had an NBA basketball fantasy show that was live  five nights of week on NBA TV  at 1:00 in the morning after the games are over 30 years ago before  Matthew Berry happened we've before ESPN ever uttered the word fantasy before anyone did and so I've always I always felt like he and I if I was going to get in I wanted to go in and same time with him or felt like he should be in front of me so um so the fact that the news came out you know I got an email from Andy Barrens he's like dude you're in the Hall of Fame when I was like oh my God and I wanted to like start talking about it hey guys I'm in Hall Fame but I didn't want to like I didn't want to like disrespect camera or hurt his feelings or anything so I'm just I didn't say a word about it I just moved on and wait until it's over and then kind of just sent a tweet you know retweeted and tweet they sent but it's been cool because I've done a couple podcasts since then and it's cool having people um congratulate me giving props and I mean it's like you say any any Hall of Fame  you get put into as long as it's not like for being a world-famous  poop your pants guy or something it is a that's reference of the day he's he's alluding to my personal life over the last two and a half weeks over here  bro I mean like Brew for you this is watching your Mentor go into the Hall of Fame that's gotta be kind of a cool thing to watch happen it was great because obviously Steve deserves it you know as much as anybody out there and to see him get his props is exactly what I would want to see it's a really exclusive Hall of Fame too you know I don't know the names off the top of my head but every time I see the names for that Hall of Fame it's heavy in the industry who have moved the needle massive you know massively and so you know to see Steve get this it's it's well deserved and I think it's kind of overdue I mean it's special when you consider what Steve just said about Rick Camilla fantasy basketball is a huge sport and you know back in the day that wasn't the case you know I remember we would get those emails Steve that they're like hey guys you guys are just crushing it in in new ways and that was always awesome because it used to be kind of a two-horse race with football and baseball and then basketball just kind of surged and overtook baseball a little bit don't know how that's doing and you know the competition between the sports but it's been great to just see Steve get his props and you know back in the day there was  I was it was a lot different but  there was this commitment to Excellence that I picked up on immediately as I was told sort of early on you know hey man you got a really pick up the pace here or you might not make it those guys at Rotoworld were just flat out studs and Steve was one of the core group that that created that so to see Steve get his props to Me Not only was a great for Steve but I thought it was great for just sort of this like throwback era of super studs that would be up all night blurring like trying to find the blurb faster than anybody else and just trying to make sure that the writing was better than anybody else bro what was it bro what was it like coming in and being taught by the likes of doctor a oh man um first of all I was humbling I  I mean I did great and writing in school and you know like I thought I could write and then I got in there and I was like oh my God I can't write like I might not make it and you know there was speed requirements There Was You know the the word count needed to be way less than I was always cranking out these long sentences and so um it was very humbling and then I realized quickly that yeah I did need to improve quite a bit and then at that point it was just really about hard work and and we would kind of like fighting each other to see who could do  what which games to blurb and things like that  and I was just a great to be in that environment where you know everybody was super excited to do the work and we were and we were young and we were we were like animals like I look back at some of the stuff you did and some of the stuff I did and you more so than me I mean I think you probably blew out both your wrists really doses alone uh-huh which we was right in the middle of the night you know and they had to be ready for the morning  and I it was in it was an insane insane Endeavor and you're right man the the weird thing about trying to write blurbs like we wrote him back then and it's it's still true in a lot of places today is  yeah you know how to write and yeah  you're kind of a good typist and and whatever but you can find this Marathon you know right in 90 blurbs and one night as fast as you freaking can literally without making any mistakes and keeping them short and sweet but from you know conveying a message it's one of the hardest things there is to do yeah you know on the on the reader's side of of that end of things I would and Rhode Island I don't know if they still do this on the site but it would Auto refresh every 90 seconds the feed on Rotoworld so I had just had a browser window open and it would refresh every 90 seconds whatever you Maniacs were doing over there they'd be like two or three more blurbs that would pop up so for those that are not aware that are maybe watching or newer to the game the blurb is just the news bite where something happens in fantasy and then analysis of what that means for folks that were playing I found this before anybody else in my league did these were the days where there could be like one guy in a fantasy league who knew that wrote a world existed and I just could clean the board nobody wanted to play with me nobody everybody refused to trade with me it was this whole thing other I had cousins that were bringing me in to help run their team and they're like how are you doing this I'm like I I can't tell you because that's the also the idiot side of this is when one person finds a source that they  trust they don't want to tell anybody else about it because then they lose their advantage but Steve I want to turn this thing around what was it like for you watching Brew come in as a young buck who probably thought he had everything figured out and then get into crush him for a few months well he figured out I don't I don't enjoy crushing people so but he I mean I remember I remember even as Brew  figured it out and got really good he still could not help but write a 7,000 word daily dose and he fought with me and and the others powers to be until the until he went down with the ship like he's collecting emails and data about how people like longer daily doses all right I thought that for a while too because  if you sit down and write  what you used to be a daily dose they don't exist anymore but it was a recap  of the night in a column form and the idea was something that someone can go  in here here we go with the theme of the day again somebody can take this into the stall at work and read it in five four or five minutes and get all the info they need to know and then move on with their life you're dramatically unique how much time we get emails of people said yeah I would take Bruce daily dose into the bathroom for a half hour that's what I'm saying you guys are dramatically under  take full sick days I can tell you definitively brew you were there in like 08 right yeah yeah so I worked for a minor league baseball team in Visalia that year and my colleagues knew that when I took my laptop and I left the front office I was going to read a fancy article on the toilet and it was probably this guy's damn thing because then I was gone for like 45 minutes like I got I mean I'm sure he's fine there's only like one bathroom in a minor league baseball stadium but that I think that's Brewers I would eventually became the brewski breakdown yeah we had I guess rebranded because it was two goddamn long  and you know we fought all the time with that and I I really struggled with this like I'd have people like yeah man more you know hey 10,000 is not enough I need 15 and then you know there's actually there's a market for both there's like you know and and I just couldn't do it the other way they tried and I tried I think I tried and I am out of mail that one in  Matthew original question like Bruce he came in and he was he was he was young he was eager he really wanted to work with us and you could tell it right away you can tell he was good you can tell he knew his stuff and he was a good writer and he was a good blurb writer but like anybody you're training how to do that it's just it takes a little bit of time to figure it out and to to hone it down and you know the first blurb I ever wrote for Rotoworld probably like right like the year 2000 on a Tuesday night it was a Dirk Nowitzki blurb and dirt you know I hadn't spoken to anyone on the phone or anyone in person  that wrote a world for those you who don't know I started I was employed like number nine and wrote a world  it was a very tiny independent website in the year 2000 and I started working for grew over time it got bought by NBC I was there for 20 years now I'm with RotoWire which was actually around before real world and yes PN and a few other things so we're talking about something that happened a long time ago but back to my point Matthew Poole I emailed me and I we were emailing and I said I want to work I want to write blurbs for Rotoworld he's okay and after a few weeks of this he's like okay Tuesday night you can write right up to Dallas game  as like okay what do I do he's like here's a link here's a password good luck you know okay you know that was it that was my training and so I Dirk Nowitzki had like 25 points eight rebounds six assists  a couple threes  nothing fancy so I get in there I just Dirk Nowitzki Blair saying just that and I  was like he emails me back the next day he's going through all my blurbs emails like why did you write up Dirhams you what made you decide what made you think that was a good idea like he's dirty I mean people want to read about him he's on my fancy I want to read about it he's like what he's anyone getting out a blurb that wasn't in the box score  and I was like nothing he's like what stands out about that game from Nowitzki I go nothing he did exactly what he does every single night he goes don't blurb those guys and so you know I mean it's just and I'm sure I said the same thing to bruski like why did you blurb Josh Smith well you crazy so like my first I think my first blog was a Kevin Love blurb and then I chose to put comedy into it and so that he had love handles and that was like kind of met with like a grown like hey yeah I don't know about that one okay but then the next one was like a CJ Watson at Golden State in their Heyday of being the first Pace team out there and I think I made CJ Watson third string and second string in my blurb  and Dot got like 50 emails or something like what you know what what what's going on here and that's what I was like oh my God the power  of this place like you make one little mistake in a blurb and 50 emails get generated you know everybody's concerned about the backup point guard at Golden State you know for their 12 slot in the roster that was that was wild to me it was like man you know I really need to be on my game and then in my first couple months anytime I felt if I made a mistake that Rick kamla was gonna weigh in somehow and you know that I was gonna get some feedback from Rick camo somehow and then the people you know we mentioned like the first nine employees or whatever at Rotoworld back then those guys were super engaged so if and they were never you know bleeps you know assholes about or whatever you know like everybody was super cool about everything that I'll just described here but like if something wasn't right within about two minutes you would hear about it  from whoever was Steve or even just like Gregg Rosenthal or you know whoever up the chain was sort of on watching the whole website you would hear about it and this it was just this commitment to Quality that it made such a difference in my career like when when I started doing journalistic stuff the fact that I could piece together writing so quickly and right like articles full of mini blurbs when I got to journalism and stuff like that like writing became the easy part it was because all those students um but yeah I know blurbs early on I didn't think I was going to make it I really didn't  see me around  Steve question because I I  don't know that it's a fair question necessarily to ask but do you look at your career and and and and feel certain things knowing that you really did help kind of create the fantasy basketball universe that we all live in now I mean is this something that you're like aware of because we can all say it to you but for you I feel like you're probably just like yeah this is my life  yeah there's certain there's certain things that happening in your life where you feel like at the time  man I got it I got in too late I didn't get in on the ground floor I mean like I missed the first pavement record for me is a big one I I didn't get into pavement until like right at the end of the slanted Enchanted run and I feel like I was super late but in the same with the Pixies like I missed the first Pixies record but then I found them  on the second Pixies record looking back on that now even though I was late I was still one of the first people there and I felt like when I found Rotoworld which I wanted to go back to that real quick because nobody like when you found Rotoworld you did not want to tell anybody know about it because no one knew about it it was like this underground little tiny website that was doing something nobody else was doing and just cranking out all this info and you just had non-stop access to  information that you didn't really know how to go find Because the Internet was so new  so my buddy John dishinger actually who I played with in the first  basketball fantasy league which is probably in 1992  it's like dude you gotta check out this site called Rotoworld I was like why he's got he's got check it out I take it out it was like oh you know this is insane I'm in and so I just started going there in like  maybe the site refreshed on its own every 90 seconds but a lot of us would just sit there and hit refresh you know Papa  all the time and I don't even know how Matthew Cooper I was doing that but by himself but um so yeah I didn't want to tell anybody about it so the fact that John Dishner even told me about it so I knew it was there blew me away and then you know Matthew Berry was on the site at that time  he was The Talented Mr rodeo and he was he was riding stuff and he was a good writer and he was doing it a column every week and I was like man I want to be I want to be like that guy so I needed I needed a cool nickname  so me and my buddy came up with Dr a instead of Dr Jay which I don't know how cool that is but it's certainly and everybody in my town I live in right now nobody calls me Steve everybody calls me Doc yeah and and  just build from there and but yeah once I found one I found that website I did not tell anyone about it I was like no  this is mine these are my guys but even like guys are telling me to draft Eddie you know whatever but it was just a cool time and you know I don't know that I'm  I'm that great of a writer I don't know that I'm that great of a fantasy analyst man I think I I was pretty good back in the day and I'm still I'm still I'm still good enough but it helps me first you know it helps being the guy you know on the ground floor because  I was able to take basketball all the time like Bruce was talking about  well guys there's football and then there's baseball  and they're kind of they're the big two you know you're just a basketball guy  and in basketball always got disrespected back then and to some extent it's still does today you know most fifth year old white guys like couldn't pay me to watch that garbage they don't play defense get me Larry Bird and Michael Jordan death yeah and that's sort of the attitude out there today still but it's such an international game  and it was cool and I kind of took that personally like oh it's just basketball humble  be better than the baseball blurbs nice job taking the the Michael Jordan meme there and applying it to Fantasy Basketball my first personally  tailor this thing to the average fantasy basketball players out there and I'm going to write blurbs  that tell him what happened who to pick up what the impacts are like every pertinent tip I mean there's nothing worse than reading the fantasy blurb  and having it not  tell you what to do by the end of it yeah the actionable side was that the so I I didn't really I got a fantasy basketball I think in like 2000 or 2001 and so I don't really I didn't really know a time where I was like on a website that was giving me information that didn't have something actionable my my introduction to Fantasy Basketball info on the internet was you and your team and that and having that actionable element was that you feel the thing that took fantasy basketball on-line it to where it is now to like everybody's got their Source it feels like I'm sure there's still novice is out there they're not they're probably not watching a fantasy basketball podcast and mid-January but they're out there someplace but it feels like everybody has a source now and back then not everybody had a source yeah and I'm the best basketball players weren't that different from the baseball blurbs or the football blurbs that I was reading  but at times they were and I was like I want to make them  perfect every single time and I think that's that Bruce he was talking about the drive that we had to just crank out these perfect blurbs was overwhelming and to answer your your actual question there  wrote a world will sort of my first experience reading blurbs on them and internet too so I mean that was what I do as well because we got in about the same time  there you go um yeah it was I mean kind of the same experience when I found wrote a world I remember kind of just like driving a long drive so Random trip and and realizing that in my hand in the phone or not even the phone I think it was on a laptop at the time  it was this instant information that you could almost guarantee to get the pickup on a first come first served basis League or something like that it was it was just wild and drafting players you know that would be kind of first second third round values in the 12th round or something because they were the only ones that knew about it was just great and then on this on this blurb stuff I think there's so much to the blurbs being what they were and I don't know you know you mentioned there's a lot of different sources for this stuff out there  that competitive drive that that Core group had and then we're talking guys like Gregg Rosenthal Adam Levitan who does established around Evans Silva my God that guy was a beast  every point he just wanted to be the best in a way that I just I don't know that I've seen it since those days I know we try to emulate it here  but it's such a different world right now with Twitter kind of being what it is you know there's just a lot of noise out there and competing with the noise I'm always kind of asking myself or the blurbs  the central unit of information anymore or is it literally just what you're seeing on Twitter these days are people just going to Twitter  to get that information but I prefer the old days I really think that the blurbs you know when you get a well-written blurb that's happening in game time in real time you know and that thing hits hard and it gets all the angles right like I don't see that online on Twitter well and at the beginning of Twitter you know my line was always like I think I even had it as my bio on Twitter you know I follow 500 people on Twitter and manage getting through all that crap so you don't have to yeah you can find it all in one feed  you know where I'm riding it because it what I mean I was that became  the hardest chore of blurb land was keeping up with Twitter  yeah I mean it was hard enough to keep up with the RSS feed  which for those of you who don't know is like a program that would bring in all of the newspaper articles into one spot what I said newspaper room I it's this thing that you used to exist but like that was that I imagine was was harder than going to all the different newspaper websites because that's what you was happening right when I got there and then I think it's switched to RSS feed and then when I switched to Twitter  I mean I think it was easier back then to follow the 500 people  at least you knew that the 500 people would pop up in your feet  now there's just all this complication on Twitter to try to figure out what's what and there's maybe instead of 500 boys as there's 5,000 voices to follow and it's a total mess to try to keep up with  I still respect the blurb feed as like the most basic  you know important unit of information out there  but it's it's just the industry is Shifting so much I don't know if everything takes place online now or if that's still an opportunity for blurb seats to stand out  stuff Banks that's awesome funny thing about x / Twitter is yeah he's elon's gonna be very happy you called it X on Today's Show by the way I said I need a full-time job bro but it's funny because I feel like the Tweet was modeled after the blur because the blurb  so it's supposed to be that long and just here's what happened here's what you do about it and the Tweet is sort of like mirrored after a blur but the blur the blurbs the fancy Sports blurbs were first I don't know well you can't you can't really in a tweet be like this player got you know X points on this shooting and you know kind of lay out the stat line and to me that's really important stuff that's just being overlooked by guys like I do want to know if a guy's shooting 5 or 13 every night you know against whatever competition and  you see what the only way you can get seen now is to do these Dan best press style you know trademark  threads that are you know these kind of monstrosities of tweets threaded together and but you in a 25 you're doing 25 tweets now to cover a night  and and Dan before you get to the next topic why we're talking about Twitter I mentioned you guys before this before we came on there that you know my favorite thing about impressing my children's friends was when NBC like Auto automatically verified me on Twitter so one day  Groove were you verified yeah yeah no same phenomenon that was what I went through I wake up one day and I'm verified on Twitter I got a blue check mark right back when you couldn't buy that you couldn't ask for it it just happened  and so you know when we have to dinner and my she had teenage kids they're their friends will be there and somebody maybe me maybe maybe not I don't know be like did you know I'm verified on Twitter and they're like no you're not no way let me look and they get their phone out and then they're I'm following you dude this is incredible you're the only verified person I've ever met there's amazing this is a college town and like the college kids and find out I'm verified on Twitter like who's that old guy at Johnny B's he's verified on Twitter he was such a big thing and when when Elon took that away took away my blue check mark and gave it to everybody who wanted it that was  you know in a funny dumb sort of way kind of kind of sad moment for me because I was like that was my that was my big claim to fame but now I'm like oh I'm in the Hall of Fame bitch that's right that's right in your eyes please sell the company Elon oh I was talking to my my children's friend oh yeah they deserve that that's what  you know but even like to kind of go on that that note like my wife got a new job once and so she found out within like three weeks of one of her co-workers was this big fantasy basketball guy  and so she kept her last name and it's completely the brewski and in her last name were completely different sides of the universe so she had this guy had no idea what he was working with and so she just kind of needling him and he's like oh you like fantasy basketball oh you think you're pretty good okay well who do you read and he's like I read Aaron bruske and role and then she just kind of like Waits and then she finally died yeah that's my husband  and it was just pretty wild because like she doesn't care about any of this stuff you know and the universe is both so big and so small that a random co-worker of hers  literally reads this stuff and wrote a world was so popular back in the day and yeah you're getting a blue check mark and I have the same thing it was the you know at the time you know friends and relatives they would be like yeah he's got a blue check mark and that's it was it was just a weird little you know D level celebrity you know piece of Fame thing that came with the whole experience it that you know it's really not normal you know and I know a lot of Articles have been written about you Steve you know and they it's just a like a Forrest Gump type of life you know especially when you consider in your shoes Steve how many the people in the sports University have met in general but like the like the bands you know the the music connections that you've been able to make and the connections in general  that you've been able to make and same over here sometimes it's just really really the world gets really super shrunk and small and next thing you know you're talking to like a celebrity about their like you know 13th player on their roster you know via email and your pen pals now you know and  it's an experience that you know when you think about it it's like I don't know what drove you to do it Steve but like one day I was reading your stuff and I just sent an email in  and then whoop life just went and took a hard right and everything I thought I was doing was not going to be what I was going to be doing anymore  and here we are  yeah I mean I had a regular job I was in a cube I was managing people and I was like please let me write for you for free at 3:00 in the morning every day for the rest of my life I don't care if you've ever paid me you don't have to pay me for like two years I'll just do it and I mean I literally worked for free for over a over a year easily and then you know I wasn't even on the road to World Books like I don't even know how I was employed nine or ten or whatever it was because  after my first season  they an email went out and I wasn't even included on it for the plan for basketball the next year and I was like heard about it I was like oh you kidding me I wrote the draft guy last year what are we doing here oh I didn't realize you were  part of the team I'm like are you serious right now like that's how much they cared about basketball that I barely even made it back after my first year even though I was the only guy who I was only two guys riding about Bass Hall Brew I feel like you told me a story that you were told you were being added to the the payroll and then you didn't see anything for two years but you didn't say anything because you were still worried about getting here I didn't want to mess anything up I was like you know what screw it and that's you know and you know it's like everybody I've seen in this industry a lot of so many people work for free it's a kind of get where they they went it didn't seem weird to me it felt like you know look it's there's a very small amount of these gigs around and you know if they were growing on trees and if it you know if everybody could be a sports writer you know maybe it would be a little bit different but I just didn't say I was like the glitch in the payroll system I just didn't want to get to work itself out I just want to stay and it's funny because at the end of the first year too those kind of a similar experience it was like Steve's like so you want to do it again  like oh yeah I wanted to do it again I'm glad I checked with you of course I want to do it again and you know way we went for the for the next year but yeah they didn't they didn't  I mean it is a classic growth story it felt like they didn't know who was where and you know a lot of times you know things would be going on I mean I was writing Kings relocation articles on Rotoworld for like three months six months before they even notice and they're like hey could you do that on our other web property you know it's probably more appropriate place I was like yeah you guys do make a good point I should probably do that and so it was just a really Loosely around organization with lots of lots of cool small company stuff going on of course being bought by NBC that all changed  and they were super corporate eventually but it was good early on I probably I probably should have mentioned at some point in the last half hour we are talking to the Legends this is a Legends show a fantasy basketball doctor Aaron bruske where we've gone back we've taken the you know Mr Peabody time machine here thing going on quite you I do want to know a little bit about the evolution of the game oh wait a minute Dr A's got something  the Indiana Pacers are finalized in a trade to acquire All Star oh yes I'll see you know that will send Bruce Brown Jordan Aurora and three first round picks to Toronto  New York now I'm seeing the the woj says New Orleans will be a third team in Deal sending Keira Lewis to the Raptors okay well we got something to I promise people that we were gonna talk about fantasy basketball and I think we probably have to now okay first along to just says three first so far because that's quite a bit for the right to pay Mr siakam that is a lot that's a lot of pics  um okay well initial I guess it's good that we're on are so we can talk about it it is a lot of pics but Pascal siakam is  he's a he's a baller dude like the cases are going for it right now what do you think the difference between him now versus like the bubble when he was just kind of getting teams were loading up on a knew he was going to do the spin movie did the spin move every time  what do you think now because I see differences but I'm curious what you think well I think getting OG and Obey away from him was probably a good thing and now I think getting him out of Toronto and giving him a new start in Indiana's good thing I think he's gonna absolutely love  these Sacramento gift that keeps giving know I read  careful Brew careful Brew who does not want to play with Tyrese Halliburton know you can't play with Tyrese Halliburton like if you can't play with Tyrese Halliburton like what you just not like basketball or something your name is your name is probably Jordan Poole up just your pool is the single most hilarious player in the NBA right now he's bringing siakam to Indiana manner they are straight up legit now  it all  well they were pretty good with Adam  I and it's kind of curious they got a  you know somebody power forward options now did Jackson get freed but yeah no there's no other names in this this might this might be another deal coming Bruce Brown Bruce Brown Jordan Noah  and then from a third team Kira Lewis the players going back Toronto  which right can get rid of Jordan wore his favorite player they are loaded up at power forward though I mean and small for they've got tons of all of them like  jarrus the trade him he trade Jackson Smith there's lots of guys buddy hield still a Pacer but he healed is still a Pacer that is that is my you know I have in my deeply haven't been able to cut and you know I think I cut him once in a super stack team  but he's been dealing with injuries and he's just sort of in Roto like an auto you know top 75 100 guy when he's going and I think in Toronto that's probably a good landing spot for him do you think he do you guys think Bruce Brown picks up most of what Pascal leaves behind not usage wise but minutes wise  and yakka Turtles out too it's  you know that team is so Scotty born Centric now that  it's  I mean this does ease the ease the  usage equation you know manual quickly has been cut loose yeah now doubly now doubly so  yeah I don't think he can handle anymore everybody can't you know what's really funny by the way this is the perfect time for this I've got I've got dried I've got Brew on the show and we're talking about how blurbs in 2002 like the revolution of it was having them tell you what to do and so thank you to Carter in the chat room who says who we have  isn't that nicely that brings a full circle that yeah Bruce Brown I I think you gotta write like he's getting paid enough money to matter in that context as long as he's not hurt you know what you're getting and usually what you're getting is top 75 in a Rowling now sometimes that doesn't play depending on the format  this one has to be don't have this one has to be for Doctor a Biggs now  yeah not one Toronto doesn't have any bigs and injured yeah  this is well I don't know if you guys can you guys see the note on this screen that I put up there I know that note I feel like  the note by the way says approach Nick nurse for people that are listening after the fact I should read it out loud it's a it's a user asking is it Boucher season for the  30 35 100th time in Toronto we all asked this question very similar to what the Toronto Raptors war room looks like right now well quickly and bear it and Scotty Barnes and then a bunch of stuff like I don't even know like like kids Gotti play the four let's put him there they got Gary Trent floating around out there too  dude I I made a mistake of saying it might be Boucher season yeah I was with Twitter when y'all went down the other day oh recently yeah that didn't work out  well he got broke his Spirit like he's he's not Chris Boucher anymore he's like some other guy that doesn't shoot the ball every time it gets it in his hands which is probably a good thing for his basketball play but for fantasy you know you're not you know that one year where he was really truly Cut Loose you know that was fun many moons he's kind of old now he's like 30  yeah that crazy the old rookie we've been asking the same question about Chris Boucher for a decade now  that's how lucky  all right here's another question is it jaunty Porter season  I mean until Turtle gets back I guess it kind of could be Dre what do you think is it John Tay season  well I mean it's jaunty Boucher or fatty is Young the answer usually about attitude here Gotta Have you I think he like that I like that it's not a terrible idea I mean Bruce Brown probably picks up a lot of the Pascal minutes but at the same time like they got to have somebody who's not  can Scotty Scotty Barnes would be the five if they ran exclusively small I don't think they want to do that to him unless I missed the situation I don't think either team is done trading yet I think both of them are gonna make another deal yeah Gary Trent you've got to think is on the Block because I think they said it like four months ago that's why you would think that I mean but he healed all the pace buddy hield yeah anybody they can get rid of really I don't think they're looking at  pearls deal and thinking oh that's great you know we're good there I think everybody's on the Block Brew what about the Indiana side I'll just come right back to you on this one doesn't this basically just blow up anything that was going on with guys like Nesmith their topping or Jackson or whatever at least as long as they're still in Indy yeah my top level thought here is what is this dude at Tyreese Halliburton when he gets back like he is  by far the guy you want the ball  in his hands like it's not even close I wouldn't want siakam to have the ball you know really much on initial action  so I mean and to kind of touch base on a little bit we were talking about before I do think I'm improved quite a bit over the last two three years him playing with a Tyreese Halliburton  is a great thing for him because it can really get him in the ball in a lot of just easy positions and this inefficiency question that has he's improved on but it's dogged him since those playoff losses and really the kind of characterize the Toronto why are we trading people why do we not think this core can work well it's because siakam and annuity both wanted the ball you know and Scotty Barnes one of the ball and you know back in the day Fred Van Vleet one of the blog Gary Trent wanted the ball but none of them could really figure out who the number one was  he can come in and get a lot of nice easy efficient play playing next to Halliburton but does that happen do they say all right you guys are more equals and you see Halliburton go from really nuclear you know this is one of the better versions we're going to see how Herbert and Through the Years  so something a little bit less than that that that's a bummer if that happens but that's my first thought and then after that I do think that it's good that you got guys like buddy hield these kind of like a cockroach that'll just never ever you know get destroyed is he gets 20 minutes he's going to hit three threes and you know have some rebounds and assists and somehow pulled together a fantasy line  but the other guy's Downstream yeah they're they're really gonna struggle I'm kind of curious about Myles Turner as well  you know if he can  tap into any of that upside that really you know folks have been chasing for the last five years with this kind of a move because I can clearly at minimum the number two you know on that Squad and then you got guys like math and just hanging out  Downstream they're going to struggle they got to make another trade I think at least to get rid of heel  curious what their plans are for Math and if he's a core guy they're interesting team I think the Pacers could you know get out of the first round in the East and surprise a few people  doc what do you thinking on this as we sort of settle down now and and try to figure out what the heck this all means  well I'm anxious to see what your question was going to be when I interrupted you if I actually forgot what it was doesn't matter anymore but I mean by Jaylin Smith bye bye Obi top and bye-bye jars Walker  the core of Halliburton seacom and Turner it's pretty awesome Bruce Brown out of the way freeze up buddy hield  to maybe move back in the starting lineup it's going to be him or math and I think I like I like math and a lot I like see them continue to develop him but develop developing young guys  is not going to be in these priority and they've got Rick Carlisle who is suddenly  now fund Rick Carlisle right because yeah the Pacers have been running and scoring and running a scoring as many points as I can all year  and he's playing the same guys the same minutes every night like I've really enjoyed the Rick Carlisle experience experience this year much more than in the past and  you know I they asked us for bold predictions  I don't know which which website it was that I worked for I think it was ESPN my old prediction was  Paces are going to win the East it's not that insane they were like they were my biggest over season win total bet this year which I lost and when my computer exploded in mid-august but I like you knew that were going for it this season right before this so something about I mean the Celtics are better than the Box Sixers yada yada yada but I mean the Pacers the places are not not that far off and they're funny as hell the interesting part in why Rick's probably so happy over there is because Halliburton went from you know I watched them super close in Sacramento he did everything the right way and you could throw like a Jalen brown or Jayson Tatum or whoever kind of super athletic ranging defender on it would really shut him down like he didn't have the strength and he didn't have the quicks to get around those kinds of guys and this year it's kind of like he does he has the length to kind of get around with a scoop shot if you want to go all the way to the cup and then he has his side steps three which is really his his kind of secret weapon and he can fire that off at a high high efficiency so he has really left to right north south he has all the directions covered now with the same IQ that's just expanding as he goes so the idea that those guys could put it together and you add a pascal sciatic to the mix yeah I think you know I don't put them up against those guys and say they're going to win but yeah that's a good bold prediction I didn't know you made that one that takes some some kohanes after what I mean like 34 wins or whatever the year before yes they asked for bold that makes me think of that old Doritos campaign where it asks do you remember you guys remember that commercial where it asked if you were bold and daring I think this is like an early 2000s thing let me okay follow up for both of you guys doc I'll start with you on this one  you said you don't think they're done I think we probably all agree on that because Toronto is is mid tear down at this point um Pacers still have all these young guys that you already mentioned guys like math and Jerry's Walker they still have contracts they can move  is there any way for us to game plan on the fantasy side for someone else that might get moved like is there someone that's close in the pecking order in Toronto more so than Indiana because Indies gonna this they're gonna be a sort of thin the herd trade pieces to get bigger names kind of team Toronto feels like the one where look if more guys keep getting moved out of the way at some point someone besides Emmanuel quickly RJ Barrett and Scotty Barnes will probably have to do something is there any way for us to know who that could be I mean I think Jalen McDaniels and Jonathan Porter are the two guys  that stick out to me that like hey we need you guys to step up right now and start start playing  what's interesting about that is I think this Toronto team is going to start winning  like they've been waiting for these trades all year and I thought it would be actually a lot worse than it was because it's just stale you know like the stars are on their way out and you know everybody's just waiting for that stench you know of inevitability to sort of Leave the Room insert IQ who has really I mean the next just screwed that up every which way they could Tom pivotto screws it up almost all the time he and RJ Barrett are getting cut loose they're going to play free and happy and you got Scotty Barnes is that a great year and he can kind of get some shine now and a lot of the questions of who's getting the ball there kind of now land right on his lap so the roles are all nice and fit and the coach man he really won me over with that speech the other day oh my gosh that's one of my favorite things I've ever seen I was like I need to play this every morning when I wake up why do we play the game it's so awesome it was amazing and then Mike Brown Falls it up with the laptop at the the press or the next night and drinking that was it that was a pat Beverley movie you got to get a prop involved or it doesn't count  I mean that was such a perfect meme that it's too perfect it's like you know it's it's so perfect you can't even use it but I think that whoever so if they're winning to kind of tie that point back up like Jalen McDaniels I had them on the radar as you know like a 30 DB League you know kind of guy that he'd shown well and and Charlotte and has a good enough stats where it's like hey this guy he's good he's good stat set Landing in a new place maybe they could have used him more in Philly this guy could get cut loose but if they're winning I wonder if they play those guys because they didn't really play them this year I mean mcdan has been getting six minutes and it's been kind of questioning like why you know he's much better than a six minute player  so they might just start clicking and a Bruce Brown to kind of really tie it in  this guy is perfect for any situation you dropping them into any situation and he'll just be a connector and he'll get his stats they'll be sporadically you know thrown around the box score from night to night um they might be complete minus the fact that they are waiting on Pirtle you know to be the size underneath so they might sit that out and just sit with this squad and see what they can get going forward I think Indie for sure though like I mean Jirachi Walker  I haven't had since seen too much of him but he's never not made me think hey this guy could be something  you know and so you're sitting on that behind Pascal siakam who you just grab three first round draft picks and toss them you know the other direction for that guy's not needed anymore so are they going to do what they did with Isaiah Jackson which is kind of like ruin his value and sit on him  or they gonna get rid of two of those guys I mean minimum actually I don't know that the one that Walker would be an item for Sacramento there are a lot of teams that need shot blocking right now so those two guys if you're Indy if you're not going to do something with them like actually play them trade those guys and and both of them are fantasy machines so hopefully they land somewhere nice  like so Brew it's  one of the 24 first round picks is in these  one of the 20th a first round pick is in these and then the other 24  so that 20 there's a 24 and 26 that are the Pacers  and the Pacers are pretty good so there's are not going to be great pics and then the other one is a 2024 the worst of Utah Houston Clippers  and  Utah Houston Clippers and Thunder will Thunder and Clippers are probably not great no you didn't could be good Houston's one or two injuries away from things really turning South  and he's got a rolling right now right yeah I got Hardy on Coach of the Year in the beginning of the Season it was not that great of a number already Susan  party season yeah well I'm thinking at some point you could have gotten that for 30,000 to one or something you know  and now he's rolling but they don't have players so Utah  I mean  relatively speaking they don't have players but that tick could be valuable  but if let's say they're all mid to late round first round picks this kind of reflects to me that might even speak to rental though I think if he's going to stick around you would have heard about it from Shams or woj that this is not a rental siakam yeah yeah we already heard it he's excited he's excited to go to Indies he's excited to work out a new contract he wants he wants to play with Tyrese that's and that's the guard man  yeah I've gotten a few texts from Kingsland since this is going on there they're in that  we didn't want him anyway posture right now but three first that are that kind of late mid to late first that's the value he had because you have to pay siakam it's like one thing to get him that's a that's a big thing I don't know give me wrong but now they got a pay him  market value  so the return is three mid to late round first round draft picks which everybody over values yeah you might hit and get a jail and William's or you know somebody in that range  that's you know super valuable but most of those picks are like gorgeous poppy on us or something like that you know they don't stick around and the league well I had all these delightful Legends of fantasy type questions to go through but we are approaching an hour and I want to make sure that you guys actually get to enjoy your day  so I am going to take us towards wrap up so I'm
