welcome to the fantasy NBA Today podcast very last in season show  is a Bittersweet moment here on fantasy NBA today  the offseason comes for us all ladies and gentlemen comes for us all and the offseason  is coming  but luckily  you have nothing to fear because we do shows all off season long here on fantasy NBA today I'm Dan Bass by the way it's a sports ethos.com presentation we will have shows every Monday through Friday all off season long now I'm sure they'll be a day I miss hearing there but you the hell's Counting  so before we dive into today's very last weekend review episode of the show I would ask all of you please navigate over either to YouTube or to a traditional podcast Channel podcast app on your mobile device iTunes Spotify whatever it happens to be And subscribe to Fantasy NBA today because your boy Dano here has got to pay some bills and now but more than that  it really sucks to do shows in the off-season when there's only a handful of you that are watching I mean it's part of why I gravitate away I think from doing the live video in the offseason because nobody's watching fantasy NBA stuff between mid-april and like mid-july Late July something like that it's really or August honestly so not every show is going to be live video some of the shows I'm gonna have my kids home on summer break I'm just gonna try to jam in here I might have to record it in three little seven minute chunks and edit it together those shows are gonna go on traditional channels only  so please do find a way to subscribe I'd love to have you guys along with me for the offseason it just feels so much better to have a nice chunk of our listenership our viewership whatever throughout the downtown times because  we all missed fantasy NBA when it's gone and it's a little bit easier we miss it just a little bit less  if we're missing it together  fine sentimentality  with that out of the way your very last week in review show what do we got here  so okay yeah technical difficulties let's get into the actual meat of this thing it's the final week in review episode we're gonna cover stories from this week of play  and I got a couple new little wrinkles part way through if you guys follow on Twitter at Dan bash but you guys have already seen the wrinkles but maybe it's better if you get surprised so let's dive in please like rate review follow subscribe whatever you got to do let's talk fantasy basketball  injury Replacements yes we're starting with injury Replacements today  like we've been doing the last few episodes of our weekly shows because frankly it gets the most names out of the way and also  it answers the question before you ask it which is why isn't so and so on so and so list  that comes up all the time so now we knock those names out on the injury replacement board you guys understand where I'm coming from  I'll give a little more explanation to these names now because they do come at the front end and some of the more obviously just you know they've been rest of season ads for three four five weeks whatever it is but again yes I get a little bit caught up in the minutiae of this stuff but you know what you've come along this far this apparently doesn't drive you all that baddie  will continue on that front so a couple of the sort of you know started in all formats out for the season situations I'm in Thompson in Houston with alpine out that's been a pretty easy one he's dominating Nas read with cat out in Minnesota although it does sound like cat might squeeze back into the mix here before the regular season's over I still don't think that I would pull nasri from your lineup he's been too good and there's almost no way that they roll cat at 35 minutes here these final couple of ball games even if he does play and then Josh Hart who has been a freaking Revelation with Julius Randle out and I am so so fortunate that I picked him up in the vast majority of my Rodeo League's thank goodness for that he's been amazing funny thing he's still under top one 25 on the year despite what he's done with Randall and some of that because the field goal percent has been bad in the free throw percent is fluctuated a bit  but he's averaging a double-double with six assists over the last month and a steal that's been fun shout out Josh Hart for your continued fantasy service and for playing like 46 minutes a game for a while in there but those are the those are the out for the season ones here are some of the other names on the board I'm still playing Kelly oubre Jr in Philly until they give me a reason not to it seems like he can coexist with and bead  we haven't seen a whole lot of uber with them being an maxi  lately at least they've been kind of alternating which star plays but I'm playing Uber until again they give me a reason not to and  he's been able to fill in here for D Anthony Melton so the role is open and it just comes down to how many shots he's gonna get  but we're so close to the end of the MC season  I don't know that anything massive is going to change right now other than okay what if to buy his hair is and Maxie and embed all healthy at the same time are there enough shots for Uber left at that point maybe but I think I'm willing to give it a shot  if you names out of Boston Al Horford obviously if any of the other centers or frankly if any player is out for the Celtics but they've been resting guys in groups  so it's Horford  Plus  Sam Houser or Horford plus Payton Pritchard or if Hartford is also resting then you've got a possible Pritchard plus Houser situation and unfortunately we just can't know until Boston drops their final injury report before the ballgame  sadly  that's as much as we can do uh on this show like I'd love to be able to like I give you all the combinations and permutations you like but until we actually know who's in and who's out  you just kind of have to sit on it so like let's say porzingis and Horford her out great you can play Hauser that's an easy one or let's say if poor Singas and Derek white are out  then you go Horford  plus Pritchard probably  what if Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are out but then the other guys I mean all honesty like likely hood here is that we're singing is gonna sick so they think he played yesterday if I'm remembering right so for Singas and then Tatum or something like that okay go Horford you go Hauser so there's this mix and match thing that has to happen there and we won't know for a couple more hours today and or Sunday you can use this for your Sunday matchups as well  she made me to out in Detroit has been a very nice feeling option his last ball game was only kind of okay and he was still pretty good  that's what fontecchio out and of course Oscar Thompson who's been out for a while as well seems like those guys are just out for the year at this point Delano Banton in Portland I put again same as last week I put just put the word all in parentheses because everybody for the Blazers is out except DeAndre Aiden and bands been getting enough usage to be good enough  even to kind of conquer the fact that his percentages suck  Corey kispert with kuzma out in Washington  that's a pretty easy one we've talked about that for like six seven weeks in a row who's been bouncing in and out of the lineup Javonte green with IO in out in Chicago and now of course with Andre Drummond out as well just does get a little bit easier for green to find those minutes because the Bulls are gonna have no choice but to go a little bit bigger he's not gonna be amazing for you but he's gonna be a low end power forward type line which is a few points some rebounds probably get you a little bit on the defensive side percentages are not going to be like a center but they're not gonna be like a guard and you roll with it  if Wendy misses any more ballgames here this last weekend Zach Collins is the fill in there that's a pretty easy and obvious one Julian champagne with Devin vassell and Kelvin Johnson and Jeremy Sohan out I mean you can put whatever laundry list of names on the Spurs out sounds like Kyrie or Luka or possibly both for the Mavs might miss a game this weekend Tim Hardaway Jr has been the fill-in when that has happened in the past  I didn't really know where to file know a Clowney on this board so I put him in the injury replacement list because his last couple of ball games have come  and they've been better make no mistake they've been a lot better he had a seven block ballgame his last time out and it's come with Dorian Finney Smith on the Shelf  he's played 35 and then 38 minutes he didn't block any shots in the first of those two games but he appears to be a pretty good rebounder and again we're kind of going with this whole like well what the hell did we know so far a situation with him the answer is not much he's averaging 0.7 blocks in 14 minutes of ball game which is a heavily influenced by his seven block ball game The Last Time Out  and he had a four block game  on April 6th this is just three games back prior to that he had one two three four blocks on the season  and he has 11  in his last  well let's see I guess we got to add all three of those ball games together 50 859 minutes 89 about 90.7 ish  minutes he has 11 blocks and 97 minutes and he had four and his previous it's not that much less than not that much more than 97 pretty close actually to 97 probably like 115 120 something like that actually we can figure this out I did the first part of the math let's look at how many minutes he's played total this year  301 okay so he has 11 blocks in his last 100 minutes and he had four in his first 200 minutes so  probably not gonna block seven shots of ball game  but one thing we are seeing is that I think it probably get you seven  ish rebounds if he gets starter ish type of minutes so that's not terrible feel goal percent I'm going to assume you're gonna be above 50 because he's gonna be near the Rim Power Forward Center type Fantasy game done shoot that many threes he has you know half a three-pointer I guess he could crawl up just under one maybe in starter's minutes but the free throws gonna be bad these are going to be non-existent we don't really know about the steals yet I'm not there  for starting Noah Clowney yet  I'm not that far off mind you but the problem of course is that we only have two games to make this final decision and so I'm gonna take at least one game to figure out what the hell he could do and then maybe I consider for the last one but even that feels  Bobby Portis is an easy one he's heavily rostered so I don't know that he needed to be on this list he's always been a stream while Hawkeye when the Bucks are healthy but when are the bucks even really healthy and then he's been a monster when Giannis is out and honest is out for the rest of this regular season  so Port us away  and then jaxson Hayes while we wait on Anthony Davis status  Kyle Anderson popped him in the grill and he's missed the last couple of ball games or this most of one and then all of another and Hazel get you that typical compliment and very reliable big man types he's not gonna blow the roof off the building he's not a block of boatload of shots or anything but they do  memory serves here make sure I have the schedule in front of me I'm pretty sure the Lakers have kind of a throwaway game today yeah they're in Memphis favored by 1580 might sit this ball game because they could win it without him which would stink for our fantasy teams but you know Lakers want to make sure he's fully healthy for what could be a very important game on Sunday we'll see I guess in any event if Jackson is starting you can play them and you can figure you're probably get you know four dunks against a bad defense as I whack the table by accident  and against Memphis this this this Memphis team he probably gets you a block maybe two and probably eight nine rebounds I'm like that so I think it'd be a pretty useful game of 86  here your ads Grizzlies they're heavy on the Grizzlies specially against the Lakers team that without Anthony Davis if he says doesn't play any defense at all Brandon Clarke who is the thumbnail picture for this show he'll he'll go crazy against Anthony Davis Lakers he'll probably shoot five out of seven six eighty eight or something like that from the field I would assume he'll get more than one rebound now it's kind of weird he's more of like a six rebound kind of guy he'll usually get a steal and a block pretty good at both of those great field goal percent dude so I think Brandon Clark and I put games cap in parentheses but at this point the Grizzlies are playing today and Sunday because everybody is so this kind of no reason to sit him but I guess you never know Jordan Goodwin also on the Grizzlies Who We Believe used up his last non-playing day so now he should be able to get into these last two ball games he's been a really interesting across the board kind of guy doesn't shoot the three ball very much you know there's there's a path for him to get you about one 3-pointer a game in starters minutes and that's fine field goal percentage has been bad that's sort of depressed his numbers a tad but over the last two weeks despite shooting 41% from the field he's having 12 points 11 boards and five assists so we're talking about like a Josh hearty in  type of fantasy game with some upside and steals kind of similar to what Josh Hart's doing and maybe he shoots a little bit more here as the Grizzlies continue to get thinner and thinner and thinner  I do love me some Jordan Goodwin and Scotty Pippen Jr is the other one all so on the Grizzlies he will also probably not help you  from the field goal percent standpoint but he's top 90 over the last couple of weeks 44 and a half percent from the field 12 3 and 5 with two steals a game and one three-pointer that's actually been trending up over the last week as minutes are in the 30s he's at the top 50 fantasy play over that stretch because the field goal percent is bounced up a little bit he's shooting 48% over those last three or four ball games 18 4 and 6 with a ridiculous and unsustainable three steals the ballgame  but we don't need to find sustainability the last two games of the year anything can happen in a two-game sample size and right now Scotty Pippen Jr is posting some serious numbers so you should have them on your team Grant Williams is the next one on the ads board because Nick Richards is back and Grant Williams is still starting he is questionable for this game however  so this is an if he plays situation unfortunately so I called him an ad and then noted that he's  may or may not actually be in the lineup if he plays he's a goal  he may or may not play so don't add until the last second on Grant Williams if you haven't already and then Patrick Beverley who know Giannis and no Dame for this ball game this is gonna be like get wild Pat  and for Fantasy that's usually pretty good he might not shoot a great field goal percent  that's fine you just swallowed that down he's a guard he's a point guard who gets shot who blocks shots gets rebounds hits 3's he's gonna try to do as much as he can provide he doesn't get hurt which does happen from time to time there in Oklahoma City should be a fun ball game and Patrick Beverley should be doing a whole bunch of stuff a quick reminder mid-show again please  subscribe going into our offseason  I mean honestly even if you don't listen to every single show just subscribe so that you know when they're dropping  I beg of you however you take in these podcasts specifically if you're watching them live on social media these days and I've tried to do that the second half of this season just to kind of see what it would mean kind of run an experiment there were some shows where we had like a 1000 people watching live on Twitter which was pretty crazy for those of you that are still doing so please go find a way to subscribe on one of the traditional channels because not every show is going to be live on Twitter in the offseason and I just don't want you guys to miss it plus it's just a nice way to you know make sure that we're getting into your homes and you're you're balls  you're not going to be on Twitter all the time anyway because basketball news isn't going to be happening all the time  some strong holds this is a quick one this is this is sort of you know remember in the middle of the season the injury replacement board was sort of the the  list we could go through fast that's this one now the strong holds are the list we can go through quickly because they really don't need much in the way of explanation couple of these guys do but not many Denny avvia Roland Kelly Olynyk when he plays Roland TJ McConnell Roland trayce Jackson Davis rolling rui hachimura if add sits another ballgame Jalen Suggs is rolling Max druce could deserve a tiny explanation here I just really like the way he's moved since coming back from his injury he looks like a far healthier player now then when he went down  he's number one oh six in nine cats since coming back because he's not doing a ton of stuff but he's at 13 points five boards for assists and a steal on decent percentages and honestly he's being weighed down by having more turnovers than your typical 3D guy over that stretch  but I mean really how bad is two turnovers a game anyway so I just like the way Spruce is moving right now I think he'll have okay numbers here these last couple of ball games yes he's a little bit more of a category Hunter type I'm giving away my last board for threes and some boards some assists on you know percentages that are not gonna hurt you maybe even could help a little bit so he's like a quiet across the board producer and maybe that's not what you need right now but it's useful and I think he belongs on rosters  Isaiah hartenstein isn't the strong holds board then he just got ruled out like five minutes ago as we were going on are thank you Universe okay it was like a half hour ago but whatever  so yeah obviously you can't play him if he's out  sad trombone  but I still think you should hold on to him assuming he plays in their last ball game of the year because he's just been incredible lately I don't Banton get in this one he should have been on the injury replacement board fix that Dan  oh don't worry we'll fix it there you go fixed it live Gary Trent Jr because without a back-to-back here I'm hoping he plays in the Raptors last couple of ball games just like a Linux and then Andrew Wiggins is playing pretty well for the Warrior's right now  but let's get to the fun little new tweak on today's show and that is the category Hunters board  these are players  that I deemed to be good enough in the non category hunting categories saying this word a lot you know row probably should have thought that sentence through  but are good enough in the categories that they're strong at to where you can get away with playing them meaning  these are largely guys that are going to sit somewhere between 100 and 200 in rank  they're not so good  most of them one or two names in here maybe clears the bar for just start wherever  meaning like if somebody's you know top 85 or better you pretty much just play them unless you totally don't need what they're bringing to the board  because there have been you know final week of the year there have been leagues where I benched superstars in favor of a specialist like I  I always tell this story right around this time of the year on every podcast there was a season I honestly can't remember what year was anymore it was before covid so you know BC effectively  I benched Damian Lillard the final weekend in favor of Patrick Beverley  Stampy so long ago that these guys didn't exist like the same guys are still in the NBA  but I was nowhere near this is a roto League because head you know bleep head-to-head final week of the year so wrote only and I was looking at the numbers and there was no one on either side of me within like 15 or 20 threes and no one was within like 200 points of me on either side so like playing Dame on the last day of the Season where frankly that was a Wednesday at that point it was before the play-in tournament  uh it all likelihood he probably wasn't gonna play the entire ball game anyway and yeah obviously even part of a game of Damian Lillard was going to be a better Fantasy game than Patrick Beverley because he was gonna score a ton he was gonna need some threes he was gonna be a big free throw bump but I looked at the stats on my rotal league and I was like I'm not moving up or down in free throws points or threes  or turnovers frankly  the only categories I had any shot of moving in on that last day or rebounds and blocks  and I think maybe a cyst was not totally set in stone but then I looked at my roster I was like okay I'm gonna do something totally nuts right now  and I'm yanking Damian Lillard in favor of Patrick Beverley I took out a top 10 fantasy player for a guy who was ranked like I don't remember what Bev was at that point that year he's probably around the edge of the top 100  idiotic  thing to do in January and one of the most brilliant things I've ever done in my fantasy life in mid-april because over those last two or three ball games I think it was like the last week of this season I did this Dame I'm sure Dame scored like 150 point I don't remember what it was exactly but Beverly averaged 8 or 9 rebounds over that week  and the reason this is a big deal because I'm sure some of you were like Dan why didn't you just like start four centers two centers in your Center slots and two centers in your utility slot I did I did but it was also really important for me to get rebounds out of other positions as well so I had like a power forward Center in the power forward spot two centers and utility two centers in the center spots I had the biggest mall forward I could find but then the real key was starting guards that had a chance to get me seven rebounds six seven eight rebounds  instead of a guard that was gonna get four  I think Dame probably got I think he probably averaged like four and a half rebounds a game over that stretch because he's not a terrible rebounding point guard during his Portland time he's just like  out there on the floor long enough to get his four End changed to five rebounds but the difference between Dame getting four and a half rebounds versus Pat Bev getting like seven and a half that ended up as a dozen rebounds over that last week on the very last day of the regular season the teams that I was chasing didn't see me coming and I jumped two teams in Rhode Island on the very last day in rebounds I gained two Roto points and playing Pat Beverley over Damian Lillard was one of the big reasons that I did it  it got me first place in that League I think I jumped from third to first place over that last week also and I wouldn't have gotten all the way there without those rebounding Roto points so this is a week There's a long story to just say this is a week where you guys need to be attacking categories  even if from a rank standpoint it doesn't make any sense  the guys that I like right now as really interesting one or mono or duo or whatever category guys are Dennis Schroder who is a pretty good assists play with a smattering of points and if the Nets continue to  pull the plug on some guys after half a ball game he could actually be better than that Trey man in Charlotte for I he's  so Schroeder's like you almost have to do do like a heat map for these dudes Dentistry is a heat map so he's a he's a  he better than warm  maybe we should do it in rank like a one two or three he's like a three  assists stream and like a one points play but not a whole lot else Trey man is like a one in boards assists and steals but not much more than that Jabari Walker is a solid two to three in rebounding and very little else like a one in points probably scoot Anderson is a three in assists better I would say the dentist Rooter frankly in that one so maybe Dennis we should bump down to a two  scoot is also a one in points he's also a negative in percentages so you really have to weigh that in Malachi Branham I think he actually just got ruled out for this season so we should probably get him off the board that happened what right before we went on air  what was the deal with Branham  concussion yeah he's probably out so sorry Malachi gonna take you off the list  no there's sad trombone here right in the middle of the podcast GG Jackson all right so you can't get Malachi Brandon I'm just get the the almost the guy with the same profile points in threes he's a two  out of he's a two rank on those  obviously a negative and some other stuff DeAndre Hunter is probably a two in points maybe a  that's about it  making you give him like a one in rebound now you know he's good enough to be a rebound yeah just go with points maybe give them like a one in percentages Omar Yurts event is a two in rebounds he's a one in field goal percent so you get a little bit of those key on Ellis is a toon steals  um and as a guard you kind of have to give them a one in blocks and possibly boards also and vasilia emit Stitch is a two and a cysts and that's about it  but you can play this game with yourself you can look at and there's other names that probably get close to being category Hunters these are just the ones where I thought were legitimately good enough in any one or two things to say okay these guys could actually help my team in those categories a positive not a baby positive something significant where it makes sense to play them  and also with the exception I guess of maybe scoot Henderson are not so horrible in other categories to where they're going to obliterate your team  but again the you know these last two weeks it's not something you have to worry about quite as much now for me in rotol leaks I'm always hunting percentages so I have a lot of trouble playing a guy like scoot even if he is the most helpful in assists of anybody we just talked about I'd probably rather go meet such or if I'm looking for a cyst on this board just because I don't think they're gonna hurt me as much in some of the other stuff scoot helps more he helps more assists but he hurts more than the others by the way Dennis Schroder just got listed as questionable with a SORA Achilles that was also news from the morning I know there's like a 1000 things that have broken already today  and that of course is the last thing that we need to talk about here no matter what you're doing with the information I just brought you on Today Show  you need to be checking the injury reports constantly whether that's Underdog or ethos fantasy BK because ours at ethos is going to have analysis that goes with it okay this guy's out here's what you should do with that information  you got to be glued to that stuff  and you know sometimes if I walk away from my computer I'll check the underdog feed just to see how many things have happened and already this morning  what do we got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen still going 15 16 17 18 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 26 pieces of injury news guys that not all of them are out but guys being listed as questionable guys at shoot around all that kind of stuff 26 today already and I didn't even launch time on the west coast yet  whoo boy  yeah so you think you want to pay attention to that stuff I do  click check in the chat room Omar Yurts have been trade Jones Payton Pritchard Bruno Fernando which two to stream today looking for field goal percent rebounds and points well I already told you rebounds and field goal present over your Yates event is going to be a solid one for that I don't know that anything you guys you posted are going to be that great at scoring your best bet there is probably Pritchard  Trey Jones would get you some rebounds and probably you know neutral field goal percent but if you look for a positive field goal percent and rebounds Yurts event is your guy and then  Richard actually probably hurts you in those but he's your positive and points Trey Jones is probably the other one  if I'm picking here because he'll get you some points some field goal percent some rebounds doesn't hurt you much oh by the way he added Trey Jamison to the mix yeah I mean obviously you go with the two centers you could although I don't know the trade Jameson is going to beat Jones and field goal percent beat him in rebounds I think I go Yurts of it and Jones  and that's my play Patrick says I'm gonna miss these daily Recaps during the off-season but I'm on the verge of inning winning my first fantasy Championship so huge thank you for all your hard work and entertaining content All Season Patrick you are most welcome I would ask you and anybody that's watching this show that has enjoyed it or
