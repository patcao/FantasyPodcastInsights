welcome to the fantasy NVA Today podcast  I actually have no idea if the the song in my ears is playing at the exact same time as the one you guys are hearing so you guys see me like doing this drum riffs over here and it probably looks way the hell off but I promise you  I actually  nobody ever believes this about me I actually do have a pretty good rhythm  it's like the secret thing for the secret Danbury sauce is I am actually  musically inclined can't sing all that well not since puberty and I stopped taking guitar lessons when I was 14 so that's deep in the darkest grossest recesses of my adolescent brain but my brain is still an adolescent brain  does making fart jokes not count  counts for something well welcome to buy low week 13 here on fantasy NBA today I'm Dan bass press at Dan best person on Twitter been forgetting to give my Twitter handle on the last couple of shows I've been so overwhelmed by the fun we had  the show earlier this morning where I got Wild and Woolly talking about our upcoming trade deadline show and then the one before that was our Legends show with Dr a and Brew this one is normal the normal Bi-Lo show although I do I definitely do still want you guys to go give a thumbs up in advance to our trade deadline live show that link I will once again put in the chat room and in the show description I'll throw it up on the screen here while I'm doing my show intro  big deal I want pretty likes I want that loaded up we're going earlier than anybody it's dumb frankly how early we're going on Thursday February 8th it's three weeks from today the day we're recording this by low show and we're going on at 7:30 in the morning Pacific time I'm sending my kids off to school with the wife she's doing double drop off and nobody's bothering me for half a day and then I have to take a break and then call a college basketball Dublin double header so God help my voice on that Thursday February 8th but damn it we're gonna have a blast and I need you guys to drop a thumbs up on that link on your screen a quick question that just popped up in the chat room before I even get started any stash worthy players before the deadline great question my hope is that I can do a stashes show on Saturday of this week so that'll be two days from today the they rarely pan out but there are a few names that I've had kicking around kind of in the back of my head that I think would be kind of fun to get on a Stash's episode so we'll do that this of course is a sports ethos.com presentation Fantasy Baseball draft season here is right around the corner of the amazing team at ethos fantasy BB how helmed by the great Joe Oracle host of our fantasy MLB Today podcast are going to be putting together a hell of a hell of a damn draft guide so definitely check that out and we'll be promoting that in the not too distant future as well  all right so look  this week's Bi-Lo episode is a little different mostly because there aren't that many names  so first things first before we even get into the this week's names I do want to give a recent a plug to what we talked about last week so I think we did it on Thursday last week as well I was hoping I could do it earlier this week but my younger kid was off school Monday and Tuesday for the holiday I mean with the Tuesday thing was about and then so yesterday we had the big Legends show today sort of like the ketchup day last week we had D'Angelo Russell Austin Reeves and Zach LaVine as the three bylaws on the board I'll be honest with you guys I don't even know if Zach Levine is doing better this week than he was last week I know he's been working his way back into game shape I know he's number 67 per game overall I think he's been pretty good I think he's been like in the top 50 range 17 six and six pretty good percentages so that's fine Austin Reeves has seen no discernible change  but D'Angelo Russell was a massive hit we knew it was going to be a massive hit too because there was just no way the Lakers were gonna screw around with their rotations long enough and leave him on the bench forever and the worst case scenario for D Lowe was that he was gonna get traded and then someone was going to give him minutes there  did I think it was going to turn overnight  no we got a little bit lucky and a little bit right on that one  because you knew somebody was going to be like hey this guy can play ball why is he getting 16 bench minutes that doesn't make any sense this guy's better at basketball that almost all the guys that are playing in front of him well not surprisingly delos Gunn nuts LeBron missed a game that helped a lot because he put up with 39 there last week delos top 30 since our Bi-Lo Rec  they don't all work out like that but sometimes they do and when they do we feel pretty good about ourselves  a couple of other Buy Low notes we have all those like we've banked a lot of wins DeMar DeRozan was a win Jalen Williams is a win we got a lot of wins that we've banked but I wanted to focus on a couple of the names that are not wins right now  because I know if I just focus on the winds and people are gonna be like oh damn all you do is you know wank on air and  I don't want that to be the thing you guys take away we have a lot of wins and anybody that's been watching these by low shows since week one or week two or whenever we started doing them  is fully aware that you've cashed in on a crap ton of really really easy calls  but there's a few names out there that haven't quite stuck yet most notably members of the Brooklyn Nets cam Johnson and mikal bridges neither one of them has taken this step forward that we thought they would  and it might take until the trade deadline for them to realize that they got a blow something up or maybe it just turns out that the Nets are horrible all year that's a possibility although right now I feel like you could get most of the Brooklyn Nets for about as cheap as you could get them at any point all year  Mikhail Bridges is number 89 which is mind you a tiny bit higher than he was a week and a half ago so to that end it has been better and there's been some gains on that but cam Johnson is still outside the top 100 Nick klaxon has been trending down lately Spencer Dinwiddie has been awful but I'm not a fan of his fantasy nine cat game anyway cam Thomas remember when we called him a cell high slash a flip guy he's just been bad for like the last three four weeks in a row it's a mess out there  maybe Ben Simmons shows up and that helps the situation maybe not  what really matters is how cheaply you could acquire these guys now and camp Camp Johnson you might be able to get off the waiver wire because at the moment he can't hit a free throw which is super weird otherwise this stuff is not all that far off from where we needed to be field goal percent three steals I think I'd like to see climb up a little bit higher but the teams just been generally bad The Vibes are bad and everybody's playing poorly as a result  so if you can go get Cam Johnson not the waiver why are you certainly do it if it's gonna cost you like a top one 20 guy you probably do it and then from mikal Bridges if you can get him now I mean someone might part with him for like a 75 to 90 range dude I don't know that I would go out a whole lot higher than 60 at the moment uh but there are guys in that range that would almost definitely get it done  so uh  I wanted to mention the DLow one because that's actually one of my favorite calls of all time in terms of a Bi-Lo because I do watch Laker games closely and I saw all the stuff that was going on with Darvin ham just yanking him around how d low is getting annoyed with being yanked around he was sort of driving angry on the basketball court and they finally we're just like okay dude like go play and it freaking worked and then Jimmy Butler was one of our bylaws and then he immediately got her but now he's back and he's already up to number 41 from number 49 so a good return for Jimmy  I still think he gets into the early 20s he's only a 1.1 steals per game the assists are still a little bit low the field goal percent is still a little bit lower than we would have expected a lot of the other stuff is basically where you'd want  but the heat need him to be attacking if they're going to keep this going because you can see some of the others are starting to run out of gas and the heat of kind of played some weird games over the last little bit so Jimmy Butler harder to buy low on now since he just came back from injury making him I don't think someone you could really put on this board again but this is why sometimes you double down on guys you know he was a Bi-Lo right before the injury so hell yeah he was a little while he was hurt because the price got even lower but let's get into the main I mean this is going to be a shorter show today because there's really one name that I want to talk about on today's program and that is Steph Curry  Steph Curry is your Bi-Lo  like maybe of the century  there are few players that I would trust more than Steph  to get this thing turned around  the beautiful reason why this call is so easy  is that Steph Curry over the last month and it depends on what website you're looking at but over the last two weeks he's outside the top 40 over the last month he's outside the top 30 again you know Yahoo hasn't won plays the basketball monster ranking side has him a couple slots lower it's all  you know it either way it's lower than you'd expect he's number 20 one overall on the season  Steph Curry over the last two weeks is shooting 38% from the field  38% over the last month he's at 41.8 otherwise things are pretty close to where we need them over that month  he's a 24 points but again a lot of that has to do with the fact that he's not hitting his shots he's at four three-pointers why isn't it five you ask well because he's not hitting his shots  three boards six assists 1.1 steals half a block those are actually  believe it or not better than I think what we were expecting going into this year  and for me one of The Telltale markers is as soon as someone on Twitter hits me with this dude is washed which I think is just silly expression but this dude is washed people don't get the irony of it I think that's how I know it's time to buy low on a guy  because when you look at what Steph's done outside of the covid year that he basically just sat out with an injury if you want to call it that  Steph Curry  threw out his prime has been a 48 to 50 percentage dude right now he's missing his twos believe it or not because there's three-point percent is not that far off this year he's at 40 instead of 43 although uh career Mark is 42 and a half so I guess you could kind of note that both of those are down 3-point percent is down two point percent is down free throws fine rebounds are down this year but they were up last year I don't think you ever could have really expected him to stay at six boards per game but I mean climbing back towards five is conceivable assists are down because no one on his team can hit a damn bucket some of that was because Chris Paul was there but then dream on spin out  steals over the last month they're actually better than what they were for the rest of the year and turnovers are almost exactly the same  so when you look at staff there's really only one thing to think about and that's that his usage is basically the same and his field goal percent is anywhere from three to five percentage points too low  and that matters  because 5% if that's where you end up putting this marker at if you're going to call it you know  whatever is he say three percent on everything that he's done the scoring goes from 27 back up a point the three-point percent comes back up all the sudden he's back near five three pointers a game instead of four  you know last year you shot 42 and a half percent from three on the exact same number of three pointers per game  and he was at 4.9 this year he's at 4.5 last year the percentage of shots he was taking  uh  from two-point land was actually a higher  part of why is field goal percent was a little bit higher overall but again a lot of it's just because  he's not making shots  but it's easy to forget that at the beginning of this season he was  it wasn't like he just magically got bad  that doesn't make any sense that's not sensical lunacy this is Steph Curry were talking about  over the first month of the year he shot 48% which is still lower than his career Mark but he was number 13 over that strike on 48% this is the difference  by the way he steals and blocks were low during that stretch as well so he could have been higher than number 13 if the defense of stats were even at the where they were last year  is it 29 and change points 5 boards five boards and four and some odd assists again mostly because his teammates can't shoot to save their lives this is Steph freaking Curry we're talking about now he didn't just like in the middle of December forget how to play basketball  you guys may remember some things plural that happened in the middle to late December  that happened to not coincidentally coincide with Steph Curry forgetting how to play basketball  those things are Draymond Green indefinite suspension Chris Paul out for a month with a hand injury  those are not coincidental  Steph plays his best ball when he is off ball more  when he is running pick and roll with Draymond Green  who's an outstanding short roll passer the Warriors offense as a whole is just better when Draymond is in there in their usual roles  I don't want to say that I bet my life that like the second to Dream On is back around at a normal number of minutes that Steph just again we're gonna call it magic for today's show because  you know science is too complicated Steph isn't just gonna magically be a whole lot better the moment that draymond's playing starters minutes but he actually kind of might be because in the very last ball game The Warriors most recent game which is on Monday although I think they're back at it tonight the Warriors most recent game on Monday a loss at Memphis Yeah gross throw up Steph went 11 for 20  over 50% from the field 26 points 8 assists  two steals in a block only three three-pointers and five turnovers so not good there  but in a game they lost by nine he was a -2  Draymond was a plus one in the 24th he was on the court  draymonds has Draymond has so many problems and maybe this time off helped him address some of them I don't know we'll find out soon enough one of his one of the things with Dre that's not a problem is chemistry with the Warriors old crew  him being out there makes Steph better make clay better makes an Wiggins doesn't matter but makes Wiggins better that's just how this team is built they are bad  one of the gambling principles and this is not a show about dream on green this is a show about Steph Curry but one of the gambling principles that I've always liked to sort of back up against was there are certain guys in the NBA when they're out the line over adjusts when a superstar is out the line typically adjust by a lot of points and then people keep betting it into a farther Direction Draymond is the opposite of that when he's out the lines like act Draymond he's worth a half a point he's worth so much more than that to the Warriors  that's the best player on that team  but he and Draymond are probably equally important to what they're doing because of what Dre does for Steph  I would expect sturdy Steph steury has anyone ever called him sturry Steph Curry combined in one word oh story  I would expect Steph Curry to get back up from where he's been which is 30s 40s this very weird awful shooting stretch  into the top 15  possibly overnight like you might legitimately have an hour or two to pull off this Buy Low but you should try to do it find someone on your team that's between 15 and 25 and offer them up for Steph Curry  I'm not talking about over the last month I'm talking about for the season you're gonna have to part with somebody of pretty good name recognition Tyrese Maxey Chet Holmgren Scotty Barnes these guys have all been kind of trending down a little bit they're not awful ideas James Harden who's been amazing but probably doesn't get inside the top 12 LeBron's been going the wrong way he'd be an interesting one to try to give up for Steph Devin Booker he's been sort of slowly going the wrong way not a lot but enough to say I think this guy can get in front I just I think Steph is on his way from the early 20s back up into the very early teens and maybe if things break right he can get as high as the top 12  it's hard right now top 12 is is  oh that's a that's a monster to get into but  Steph Curry heater a two week heater for him where he shoots like 53.54%  is well within reach  if or when it happens he rocket boost himself up the board and you're gonna want him on your fantasy team when it happens  I had one other name that I thought would be kind of interesting here and maybe this one  I'm not going to talk about it quite as long as I talked about Steph but that name is Deonte Murray who's number 42 for the year in nine Capitol over the last two weeks he's number 91 and I feel pretty strongly that the trade rumors are at the core of why did John Dee's not himself lately I think he probably gets back into the 35 to 40 range which is generally where he was prior to this little bit of a cold snap mostly because his defensive stats have been low and I think you could probably get him for someone in the 50 range because people are afraid of where he might end up like if he gets traded to the Lakers does that ruin his fantasy value I don't actually think that it would he might not be a 21 points but I would assume the four and change assists work their way back up a little bit if you're not alongside Trey young yeah that helps a little who would I give up for him I mean the other guys in that range you're gonna have to find somebody with some name recognition tomorrow would be interesting I like tomorrow you guys know we did a by law on him when he was in the 60s and he's in the 40s now  did you  could get him for vouch I would do it if you could get him for Miles Bridges maybe plus someone in the 80s I would do it  I'll put in shengwen that's kind of an even swap I don't know that I would go that direction Jaylin Willie Williams is kind of an even swap so I don't know that you're actually getting a whole lot of bonus value there  if you if Tyler hero plus someone that might get it done like hero plus Devon vessel or a hero plus I don't know looking down the board here uh d low D lows on the rise  you know I guess that not that many names match up perfectly here for Deontay and so that does make him a little bit of a tougher Bi-Lo to buy Tobias Harris plus someone in the 70s would probably get it done  Myles Turner straight up might get it done these are names that I would consider for dejounte Murray and honestly I'm just not that  I'm not that scared I don't think that a team trading for Murray is going to marginalize him I think I frankly I like what he was when he was San Antonio Murray and I don't expect him to be the primary ball-handler on any team he goes to but I do expect that wherever he goes he'd be used better than how he's being used alongside Trae young because it's just so hard to play alongside tray you're not gonna be the guy with the basketball in your hands  as often as you'd like to be  and I know what you're thinking about the Lakers but if you've watched LeBron this year he's been very comfortable playing off ball a lot more I just and I know there's other teams you know Sixers are involved the heater involved  almost any place he goes  his job is easier to do than his job in Atlanta right now I'm not as high on this one I don't think there's as much margin for gain I just think you might be able to bundle your way into a manager who's afraid of what dejounte Murray might become and they're looking at it they're like oh it's already trending down this is gonna be a rough rough trade deadline for my guy and maybe you could peel him away for you know that 50 to 70 range type of thing like one of the names that I just threw out there and I want to double down on a name from last week this is just a quick reminder at the end of last show on last Thursday I had Darius Garland on the Bible I said I thought he'd be back in two to three weeks last week now I think he's back in one to two weeks so somewhere between seven and 15 days basically we still haven't gotten an update on him which is why I was able to leave him on the board and I think you could probably get him for somebody in the 80 range and when Garland comes back I think he'll probably be in the 50 to 60 territory so  an opportunity here if you're willing to sit on a really interesting player for I'd say maximum 15 days you might be able to get a top 50 range dude for someone on your team who's more in that you know like a Devon vessel type absolutely I would give him up for Darius Garland absolutely unquestionably who else is down in that zone that might get it done Kobe white because nobody pays attention to defensive stats or percentages by the way I don't want to get accused of being down on Kobe white but he's outside the top one for you over the last month it's happened again regardless like  you a whole show on on how everybody yells at me everybody hates Dan when I talk about Kobe white he's just not as good and nine cat as he is in other formats he went on a crazy shooting run and it's leveled off  anyway it's not about that go see if you can get Darius Garland I think your time is running short on this one I think he's coming back pretty damn soon I think 15 days is the absolute longest I might get that wrong but that's where I'm sitting on it and so I think you could probably make that happen in  and I think the person that has him was probably getting irritated unless they're watching this show and they're thinking don't you try to steal my Darius Garland but go look at your board  go look at guys that have named power in the 75 range and offer him up for Garland Devin vassell is the one that I really like next big game he posts for the Spurs go try to get Garland for him  but if I don't have Devin vassell you ask um  ogna nobe might get it done  uh looking at other guys with name power like I said Kobe white on a heater might make it happen  I don't think my Conley has enough scoring to make it go through if you could pair Conley up with someone like a Jabari Smith Jr Anthony Simons might get it done people might not realize he's like top 100 range because he hits a lot of 3-pointers that could be an interesting one to flip out there see what happens  D-Lo we just talked about a minute ago probably would need a little bit more but you never know set a couple good games in a row  all right friends that's your boy here for this lovely Thursday January the 18th hopefully that'll take us through a little bit here but again like you might have a Steph Curry Mondo game coming up in the blink of an eye actually they don't play tonight or is that a Warriors or off a long time this week where the hell did they play again where are you oh right yes their game got postponed that's what happened I forgot yesterday's game got postponed tomorrow's game got postponed that's my bet everybody I forgot where they're scheduled went so you do have a little bit of time here to to make the move on Steph Curry  to me this one's uh you know I had a handful on here that I've called no-brainer by Lowe's and Steph is a no-brainer by low for me because he's so attached to what Draymond Green brings to that team and that's your opportunity to do it  follow me if you're watching this show on Twitter just click the follow button that's really easy if you're watching it on YouTube at Dan best you can see
