welcome to the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast attempt number two James to record the Western Conference over under wind total picks some uni do every year we did the Eastern Conference last week for those of you just listening to this as a podcast you're probably wondering what we're talking about for those of you who were on the stream whether it was on YouTube or on Twitter we went hard for about five minutes James and then just had a out of nowhere Halestorm descend on Madison Wisconsin  yeah it was pretty wild I do the recording looking out my front window and yeah I haven't seen hail that big in Madison before and it was in October so  pretty random all right well we think the storm has passed so we're back at it about 10 minutes after the the initial recording we're going to run through all 15 win total over under for the Western Conference again we did the East this time last week you could check that out in the podcast feed on Spotify Apple podcast wherever you get that you could also find the video version archived on Twitter as well as the RotoWire fantasy basketball YouTube channel we're closing in on 1,000 subscribers James that we just launched this a couple of weeks ago so we have floor you to please go like our videos subscribe to that channel we'll continue to bring you a ton of content throughout the fantasy basketball season and of course that begins tomorrow night with opening night two games we got the Lakers and the nuggets the Suns and the Warriors James I want to stick to the wind totals though I don't want to start you know veering off track here this is gonna end up being a two-hour pod so let's get right into the Western Conference we'll do alphabetically as we always do so that means we are starting with the Dallas Mavericks a 30-8 win team a year ago the number is 43  and a half and we're in agreement off the bat we're both going under on the Mavericks  yeah I just don't think you know I think this is an incredibly top-heavy roster and I don't really think Kyrie Irving matters that much in it like whether or not you get 60 games or 40 games yeah I just think that isn't quite at that Nicole yokich the compo level you know he's not the two-way guy that yanis is he doesn't you know keep the ball moving and make everyone better on offense the way yokich did does its very heliocentric and I think his game travels really well into postseason play because they're just aren't many teams that can stop him from getting where he wants in half court in the postseason but I think regular season you're looking at probably Josh green or Grant Williams is the third best player on this entire team which is just a real kind of Testament to their lack of of quality players I mean death there's one thing but they don't even have like a good third and fourth player on this roster yeah and that's what ultimately pushed me to the under because I think there is there's a case to be made that Luca is so good Lucas specifically and that's without even bringing Kyrie into the equation that if you just put the right type of players around him they don't have to be stars but just the right type of players that you know he alone can get you to to 40 wins he's basically done close to that through the first few years of his career but I I'm just really down on these role players you could make a case that Grant Williams is their third best player or I don't know Josh Green Tim Hardaway Jr take your pick I mean they're gonna be relying you know very heavily on a rookie and Derek Lively we'll see what he looks like you know he's showing some flashes but I think they're gonna be asking a lot of him right away I just feel like more can go wrong it could go right with this Maps team I will ask you like how much did you consider the way that they ended last season you know Dallas was on was on like a 4344 win Pace but of course you know they they kind of went into the tank they benched Luca and Kai read they went to a nine in their last 11 games so like that 38 wins a year ago do you look at that as like someone of a false final  uh you know on the one hand they  giving up guys like a guy like Dorian Finney Smith  in that Kyrie deal like that's exact type of player this team needs and this player this team lacks I mean don't finish Smith with clearly be the third best player on this team so I I just kind of think they they gave up sort of a more well-rounded roster to go super offense heavy down the stretch they obviously sort of Tanked a little bit I'm just not weighing it that much I just I just don't think this is a  quality enough to even for me to bet on them going over 500 in a western conference where there's going to be 11 teams really doing their best to get into the mid-40s that was the other thing for me is there's just not gonna be that many easy wins out there for a team like Dallas you know I think you could take you basically look at like the top seven or eight teams and those are 50/50 games at Best for the Mavs and you know unless they're playing San Antonio  Portland you know maybe Utah will talk about them in a bit there's just not there's not a free wins on the schedule and I think even if you know Luca stays healthy even if Kyrie has a best case season in terms of games played it's the team that is probably you know it's way to 40142 wins so 43 and a half just a little bit too high for me you know again I think you're asking a lot of Kyrie and Luca in terms of games played in terms of chemistry in terms of shouldering a massive offensive burden for a team that I just don't think it's all that we're going under on the Dallas Mavericks the Denver Nuggets James defending Champion 53 wins a year ago the number is placed at 52 and a half you like the over I landed under here yeah I mean I I think they get into the low 50s I'm not sold they get to 53 necessarily but  this is just going to be  whenever yoke which is out there it's basically the best offense in the league and they've got so much continuity in the key spots on this roster probably the best starting five in the league  you know I think they've shown a really solid ability to find contributors in the draft  a lot of Buzz about like Julian strawther this year similarly to Christian Braun last year  so I you know I think yokich is the MVP I think he probably should be a three-time defending MVP at this point and he's one of the Best Bets to say healthy I think Jamal Murray has his best season as a pro this year and makes the All-Star team so I think they just kind of get to like 54 or 53 not a slam dunk over but they're too good for me to go under here  yeah I think you know if they just kind of flip it out cruise control they're they're kind of an automatic 50 win team so this was not a lock for me by any means but I also think there's something that you know when you when you kind of get into that title contention mode and we talked about this last week with teams like Boston and Milwaukee you know that the regular season gotta becomes less and less valuable like there's no real sense in like pushing to win 62 games even if that's what your roster is capable of I don't see Denver really doing that you know after playing all the way into June this past year you know they had some guys playing in FIBA and whatnot I think they probably pulled back a little bit and make sure they make it through this regular season a healthy as possible I mean Jim already had a quote earlier today I saw it on Twitter where he was I think it was a little bit tongue and cheek but even he was saying like yeah I don't know that we're gonna be like fire at all soldiers right away you know like we have some important pieces to replace we're relying on some young players to step into larger roles and this is not an overly deep team like I think they're confident you know in guys like you know Reggie Jackson giving him came in as backup point guard you know Christian Braun stepping into a larger role you know Julian Struthers look really good as a young player Peyton Watson somebody that they mentioned you know to kind of step into that Bruce Brown role for them but ultimately I think there's going to be a learning curve for a lot of those players and I think you know this is a team that I don't see like running away with the Western Conference and ultimately I don't know if they really care what their seat is the other thing that pushed me toward the under here James is Denver was you know remarkably healthy last season by current NBA standards right you know they they only have like one one starter get to 70 games which is kcp who was like 75 games every year but you know Aaron Gordon Murray Bruce Brown played 80 games like their their core guys for the most part were healthier than just about every core in the NBA and that's a testament to the type of players that they have like they don't have a bunch of Anthony Davis's on this roster but I do think there's a decent chance that at least one of those guys you know comes to an injury at some point and you know for a team that doesn't have a ton of death as far as you know  returning Champions go I think that could hurt that  yeah I think all the points you made are are solid points at  I don't feel that strongly about the over they do have one of the best home court advantages in the league if not the best factor in the elevation and everything so that'll work in their favor and I mean I do think if it you know if the number one seed is kind of on the line like I don't think they're just gonna completely keep it on cruise control the whole way I think they'd rather have game seven at home then in Phoenix or in Golden State so I don't feel that strongly in it it's just kind of you know how many teams have this much continuity and this good of a lead player so  okay fair enough last thing on the nuggets and this this kind of ties into the team that we might be talking about next year but do you feel like based on where we were at the end of last season when you know Denver for the most part Cruise its way through the Western Conference playoffs and and obviously to the NBA title do you feel like there's still you know a gap between nuggets as the clear best team and then everybody else is that Gap narrowed at all to you  in the west or the holy in the West  I think there should be a small Gap there in just the way that they're all discussed you know I think there's theoretical version of these other teams that are in their class but I think giving that we saw them just go on a dominant run through the Western Conference playoffs you know their young core like yokich Murray those guys are absolutely in the middle of their primes they're not aging out of their primes so I think they have to be considered in a small class of their own in the West yeah I feel more comfortable like giving this team the benefit of the doubt then that just about any other just you know for yokich alone you know with the the floor that he presents and you know that's a something that obviously translates to Fantasy as well let's go to the Warriors 44 wins a year ago the number is 47 and a half for Golden State that is third among Western Conference teams behind only Denver and the Phoenix Suns we are both going over on Golden State yeah I think with the Warriors at this point James like it is it is fair to question you know the age of Steph Curry of Klay Thompson of Chris Paul Draymond Green who has already been ruled out for opening night he's been dealing with an ankle injury for these last couple of weeks you know I very interested to see how they end up using Chris Paul you know what his role you know what that transitions at some point throughout the season I even though all these guys are your older that I just mentioned like I feel like they'll have a little bit better health luck this year went through a lot of injuries last season you know they're kind of like a 500 team for for half of the year  I think getting rid of Jordan Poole even though you're you're annexing a potential 2025 Point per game scorer I think that could be a net positive for them you know the way that that relationship seemed to sour by the end of the year and nothing else we're kind of falling back on the Warriors infrastructure yeah and you know no Jordan Poole know James Wiseman I think that's  two major additions by subtraction just in terms of their their defense  Draymond Green was one of the best defenders in the League last year but the team defense was very mediocre All Things Considered I think they got those weak links out of there  I think it just kind of comes down to health I think of this team has just sort of  okay Health they get this over pretty comfortably I think they could get to 50 wins but if Steph Curry misses like 30 games  with something that it's in big time Jeopardy we saw how important Andrew Wiggins was to them when he wasn't around for a good chunk of last year so  injuries could sink this but I think just looking at the town on paper there's no more of this kind of pulling in two different directions with the young guys and the old guys they still have some of the young guys but they brought up the old guy  I think I think everyone kind of knows which direction the everyone should be pulling so yeah I think it's an over yeah you know we can we can kind of joke about Chris Paul at this point in his career he's still winning player especially if he's giving you like 27 good minutes a night whether that's starting or coming off the bench I actually like that as a regular season move for the Warriors I think he's going to be in a great spot to kind of limit his workload pick a spot to think he's going to help them as long as he stays healthy you're totally right about Curry I mean it's I I almost feel like we don't talk enough about how much time he's missed you know these last few years he's in that basket of some of those older stars you know Durant LeBron play 56 64 635 69 51 over the last six seasons like there's not a lot of evidence to suggest that he's gonna suddenly play 74 games here like I think you got a baked in at least probably 15 this game for him but I also think he plays more than 56 which is where he was at last year and you mentioned the wicked thing he kind of forget about that with how much time he missed like that was that was kind of a one-off you know he's never really been injured he was kind of an 8082 game guy early in his career like I think just getting you know even if you get a 80% season from Andrew Wiggins like they really really missed him down the stretch last year and getting him back in the mix I think is a huge deal kind of Baseline booster for the warrior so we both like the over on 47 and a half for Golden State let's go to the Houston Rockets James this is a really fun one 22 wins last year the numbers all the way up at 31 and a half you can argue that no team made more sweeping changes than the Houston Rockets that starts you know at head coach with email you don't come in they have this weird this weird balance now but between young and old and I you know bringing in Dillon Brooks bringing in Fred Van Fleet you know that raises your floor it certainly does but I do worry about the push and pull here kind of what you mentioned with the Warriors I mean you're trying to develop I'm in Thompson Jalen Greene cam Whitmore it's already synchronized Smith goon like how does that contrast with with bringing in Van Fleet and Dillon Brooks specifically  I think Ben Lee compliments everything perfectly because he can play he can play on ball he can play off ball  you know he's gonna bomb threes and space the floor he's not gonna insist on trying to go one on one or anything like that he's a good team Defender my one sort of a hole back here I am going over but I am worried that Dillon Brooks might  view himself as kind of like the wing scorer on this team or something so I I don't know I have yet to see what Dillon Brooks is shot by it's gonna look like this year  as long as he just can somehow kind of stay within the team concept I think email dock is a huge part of the over here I think you're going from  arguably the worst Coast coach in the league to a guy who not that long ago had a case is like a top five coach in the league and I just I think it's really great to have this specific coach for this specific roster because I don't think you do is going to have any problems telling Jalen green or telling Amin Thompson or Jabari Smith some some hard truths about actually worries me for their fantasy value  right so like I I think he can legitimately tell those guys you know if you keep doing this yeah I'm not gonna play you as much like you know that type of thing so and this team also just has so much size and athleticism especially on the wing you know I'm in Toms and probably not going to win Rookie of the Year anything like that this year just because of how loaded the Rookie of your classes at the top but like I think he's just gonna really make a name for himself as a rookie and you know I don't expect them to play guys like cam Whitmore very much especially early in the season I think they are going to try to win games they're not gonna really get in that play in tournament mix but I don't think they're going to wave the white flag on that until it's it's pretty clear the writing's on the wall towards the end of the season  I'm gonna go under 31 and a half I think they'll be better if you bring an invented and bringing in Brooks like you know we can kind of quibble about the efficiency with family we could quibble about the personality with Dillon Brooks but those guys are gonna help you win games I just I still think in the hierarchy of the West they're probably a bottom three maybe about a 14 for me and that's gonna be tough to get to at least 32 I think it'll be really close I would not be surprised with this one goes over it you're totally right about you don't like I love the fit here you know I think obviously for a coach who you know as been to the NBA finals has had success early in his career it's kind of a weird you know step down you know what what happened to him last year but I love the fit like I think this is exactly the type of Coach kind of the anti Stephen Silas in a lot of ways that's gonna get these guys in line I don't know if you've watched the Rockets watch during the preseason the Jalen green shot selection has been alarming he's making a lot of them but like he's I don't know if he's just been like grinding Nick Young tape I mean it's been it's been wild it's been wild they're gonna be really fun to watch I think this could be a top three if you're just taking wins losses out of the equation like this is going to be an extremely fun League past team and that's a big difference to me at least from last year like I you know how much I couldn't stand watching Kevin Porter Jr play basketball that getting ready to him you know circumstances aside that is a plus yeah it just it's really gonna make a huge difference for their watchability just knowing that he's not going to be the guy chucking the ball at the end of The Shack or anything like that so yeah I think they're one of the teams I'm most excited to watch Dillon Brooks could assume that mantle that Kevin Porter Jr mantle maybe not as much sort of on Ball but you know halfway through the shot clock you know that that could be an issue but  I mean I really hope this is here for Jalen green you know Jabari Smith looked as as good as anyone in summer league and I'm in Thompson's look as good as anyone in the preseason so really excited about that young core let's go to the LA Clippers 44 wins a year ago their number is at 45 and a half James this is the this is the lowest Clippers win total of the Paul George Kawhi Leonard era and I think that makes sense yeah I almost feel like we are we're in like the Zion Williamson territory now with the Clippers where you know the last couple years there's always somebody who was willing to buy in and be like man if they're healthy they still might be that team and it feels like most people have kind of jumped off of that island now  yeah why would this be why would they be getting healthier as they get older I don't know so that you know that's kind of  I'm just not gonna be the sucker that expects Kawaii and Paul George to play 60 games of peace  throw out 65 or 70 but like if Kawhi Leonard played 60 games this year I think they would go over this but I just don't think you should be betting on that and I think the fact that the Clippers have been unwilling to kind of mortgage more their future around these guys is a sign that you know maybe they're not sold on really having these massive names as a part of this team entering that new building I know everyone always cites the new Arenas like well they're not gonna get rid of these guys they need them for the new Arena  I mean if this is just an old ass team that is going to win 40 games people aren't gonna show up to the arena just because they recognize the name so I don't think they're just gonna keep digging themselves a hole here if it becomes really obvious they're not true title contenders with this group  yeah I mean well acknowledging that if health does break their way and that we're speaking relatively there I think you make a good point that like you know a good health season for quiet Paul George is like 62 games a piece and by the way George is like Steely missed more time than Kauai yeah over the last four years like it's not like it's just quiet I think we talked about him like he's he's been like 50 to 55 games and I expect that to be the case again this year it'll look great early on it'll something will pop up and he'll be in and out the rest of the year that's just kind of what it is at this point in his career but yeah George is the guy that's actually had you know these kind of like you know several weeks several months type of injuries that have really killed them and I also don't love The Supporting Cast here I just the Terrence Mann thing is so bizarre to me he played like 20 minutes a game off the bench last year he's 27 years old like why why are we why are we propping up Jared's band as if he's just Untouchable asset like I was joking with Alex at the pot a couple weeks ago it's like it's like they had a meeting and we're just like what can we try to convince everybody that Tears band is awesome like I know I know you were a fan of him like earlier in his career but like why is out you really that high around the league or is this just the flippers trying to try to pump him up  I just think if you're  the Sixers or whatever team is thinking about trading with the Clippers you don't want any of the other guys it's not even that you're like oh man we really got to get our hands on Terence man but I think every team would take Terrence Mann and plug them into their rotation whereas I think you know maybe you don't want Norman Powell or Robert Covington on their current deals as much it's more kind of dead salary whereas man fits into other teams rotations I I think it's it the funniest thing about it is it's not even like Tyler loves Terrence Mann Tyler plays him like 28 minutes of game so that's that yeah less than that so 20 23 minutes game last year it's dark half of his appearances it's not a good Supporting Cast I think that's really important to point out because even just a year ago people would tell you this was the deepest team in the league and I think everyone kind of realizes all these guys are pretty much over the hill except for Hawaiian Paul George the shooting  is really pretty bad like if they start Westbrook zubac and man that's Terrence Mann is your third best shooter just yeah it's it's kind of shaky even if those guys do stay healthy  there's been a alarming Reliance on Nic Batum the last couple of years for the Clippers who is like basically watched up by the time he left Charlotte and you know credit to him for for kind of salvaging the final years of his career but man like that guy should not be giving you 20 minutes a night that's just that's just not the recipe to win 45 plus games last thing on the Clippers it was there any thought to okay what if a James Harden trade happens a week from now does that it does that give them a significant boost do you really feel any differently about the steam  I don't really  because I assumed they would have they would have Westbrook and Harden back together on the same team  hardened would make their defense worse  it would really compromise the amount of lineups they could actually play Westbrook in and get away with it I think it would just really  you know at this stage of their careers I think he'd rather just have quite Leonard initiating offense and said to James Harden so whenever hards initiating it Leonard is just kind of sitting there with his hands on his knees and whenever Leonard's initiating it hardens hanging out at half court so I don't love it that much from a basketball fit standpoint either and they'd be giving up a rotation player at least to get hard let's go to the Lakers 43 wins a year ago the number is 46 and a half  I always approach this team with caution I think a lot of the same things that we said about the Clippers and a lot of the same things we said about the Warriors also apply to the LA Lakers you got to estimate 20 Miss games for LeBron at this point we've been doing that for Anthony Davis for a long time but  I do think with some limited flexibility the Lakers had about as close to a home run off season as they could have had they still have some flexibility as far as what they could do with the DeAngelo Russell contract at some point this season I think the expectation remains that they probably try to catch that in for an upgrade at some point I've heard a lot of a lot of rhetoric around the Lakers James that you know oh if LeBron and Davis they missed 1520 games like they could survive without them like that I don't quite know that The Supporting Cast is that good like I don't think let's say LeBron and Davis missed 10 games you know together they're both out for those 10 games like I don't think the Lakers are going seven and three and that's bad like you take those guys away this is still not a very good roster but the emergence of austere gives them a pretty high-end third option you know Russell for all of his okay if he's your fourth or fifth guy in the starting lineup so I'm okay with that but I still do worry about the the health of LeBron and Davis nonetheless I'm going over here I think last year that like it really couldn't have been any worse for the Acres Health Wise so even if you even if you're 10 to 15% healthier this year I think that's probably enough to get to 47  yeah this is  one of my favorite bets in the west the over on the Lakers here  at 46 and a half  I  the only way they go under to me is just  you know Big Time injuries to add more so than LeBron like I think they I think they can go 500 and games LeBron doesn't play as long as ads out there but if you take add away their defense just completely crumbles  I kind of like ad for defense player of the year I think you know I think it's all just you have to kind of look at this team as just sort of from when they traded for us last year on as just that was a different team than the team they had before they traded Russ not only did you get him out of there and he was a huge net negative by the time they traded him but Austin Reeves fully ascends after you get rid of rust so you know I love I love the role that Reeves is going to be in this year I think we had Chmura is in a really good place you know he's not going to be asked to do too much on this team might give them a bit more defensively than we've seen in the past from him I am I don't like the way Russell plays but I think he's a fine caretaker as sort of like a second ball handler or even a first ball him there when when LeBron and raise the court so I just I think this is a really really strong roster minus the Christian Wood Edition I  even at the minimum I think you just kind of keep him away from from your team but apart from that I just I think they killed it yeah I don't understand the Christian Wood thing I get you just want to bring in the talent but I don't know how many times we need to go through this with him I mean My Hope Is he's not really in the rotation I don't think they need him to be you know so I think that's it's one thing to bring him into Dallas be like all right you're a third option like we're gonna need to play you 28 minutes at night like with the Lakers I think he's gonna be getting a decent amount of dnp so from that perspective I think it's okay but yeah I didn't love that either I don't know why camera reddish not sure why he's on this roster either I don't think he's gonna make much of an impact but this is this is the rare Lebron team that I think is to succeed in the regular season and then you know kind of against that rotation and hopefully make some upgrades prior to the postseason but yeah if LeBron gives you 65 games and Davis gives you around 65 games I think this is a pretty easy over for the Lakers all right let's do the Grizzlies 51 wins a year ago 46 and a half is the number four Memphis Jews is that juice pretty heavily to the under James I just want 508 to the other we are both going on there I I always approach the Grizzlies with caution because they're well-coached they found ways to win games without John Moran the last couple of years we know all about that but you know now they're without Stephen Adams for the entire season which was kind of a big deal you know I obviously I got Jared Jackson there defensively but that puts a lot now on Santi aldama Xavier Tillman David Roddy some of these guys who've been up and down the last couple of years not a lot of experience there you know I love Desmond Bane for Fantasy I actually kind of like this landing spot for Marcus Smart I think he kind of fits what they want to do but you take away John Moran for basically a third of the Season you take away another starter and Stephen Adams for the entire season and it's it's hard for me to see this as a team that's you know kind of anywhere in the ballpark of 50 wins and if you're going over here you're talking you know 4748 wins I don't think that happens I just don't think they have quite enough talent and you know part of the supply is to kind of what we said about Dallas where it's not it's like I'm off Memphis I'm just kind of on you know some of the other teams in the west getting better and making some of those wins more difficult to come by  yeah I don't think they changed the actual line after the Steven Adams injury so that's why the juice is so insane like they just kind of changed the juice they didn't change the 46 and a half I'm I think I was gonna go over on 46 and a half before the atoms injury but  it just feels like they've lost one too many guys here you know they're really kind of digging  you know they save your Tillman's he's a fine backup option it's it's nice that they have him but it's just going to be way too much Xavier Tillman at the end of the day and Jaron Jackson really needs that center next to him to really kind of flourish defensively I it's kind of a bummer because I do like some of the players on like I think Zyer Williams is poised for kind of a mini breakout year I think he has looked really good in the preseason you know I like the idea of Kenneth Lofton Junior getting like 15 minutes off the bench I think that would be awesome TV but now that atoms is injured you might be seeing Loftin like need to play 20 minutes off the bench which I don't think he really want to be in that position so I like some of the players it's just they've lost too many guys here I think to keep the number here at 46 and a half okay before we move on to the Minnesota Timberwolves got some messages to pass along from our wonderful sponsors that begins with Underdog Underdog

match  all right let's get back to it James the Minnesota Timberwolves 42 wins a year ago the number is sitting at 44 and a half you're going under I think I'm getting stuck back in here James I'm taking the over  yeah I'm I feel very scorned and I just I have no  I have no loyalty to this tuber wolves team after how disappointed I've been in them and actually kind of two iterations of the Karl Anthony towns Timberwolves I remember I was super high on them back when they Jimmy Butler and that obviously did not work out and  I was super high on them last year before they got Rudy gobert  but  you know I think getting rid of Angela Russell for Mike Conley I think that was a huge way of maybe giving this a chance because I just don't think it was going to work with Russell there  but they also just haven't sold the biggest issue here and that's the lack of space France the Edwards  I you know everyone keeps talking about him  possibly ascending to you know being kind of like a true Superstar  I think he might be ready to do that in the right situation I just don't know why this is the right situation even though Jane McDaniels karthi towns can stretch the floor it's still just too much size it's going to be clogging things up too much specially when go Bears out there with a couple other bigs and like five of their eight best players are bigs so you know I know they have to trade somebody sooner than later just to kind of make all the contracts fit long term  I would think that towns are gobert would be that guy probably towns just because you're not going to get anything back for gobert but  I just the way things are right now I just think it's gonna be too crowded I don't think they really solve their biggest issue last year which is just a lack of spacing and  I know they're going to try to win as many games as possible so I think it's going to be right in the middle here right kind of low 40s to mid 40s but I just can't trust this team after what they did last year totally fairly the point of just stockpiling big men and you know signing nazri to an extension to basically be your like third Center I don't didn't really totally get that but you know he's been good for them off the bench the last couple of years I don't like the guard depth and I have questions about the wing depth as well like you know Kyle Anderson can kind of float between both of those spots which is nice and I actually like bringing in Shake Milton but like Nakia Alexander Walker that not really doing it for me I don't love a lot of the options they have a point guard and George McLaughlin's been fine the last couple of years but I think they I think they could have used some upgrades you know around this roster like Troy Brown is somebody they're gonna bring in and he's probably gonna play real midgets for them hasn't really found an NBA home yet didn't love what he gave the Lakers last year I part of the reason I'm going over and I don't think it's by much but there's been no reason to think that Anthony Edwards isn't going to play like somebody five games if not more like he's been you know it's close to like an 80 game player As It Gets in the modern NBA and like if your best player who you think could take a big step forward in year four if he's out there for you every night I think that gives you an advantage over a lot of teams where we're talking about their Stars playing 55 to 60 games so I do think that the Timberwolves care about the regular season more than other teams I think they'll be healthier than other teams and I also look at last year last season as kind of a worst case scenario for towns and I know he's had a couple of these Seasons so it's not like you know 29 games a year ago is a total one off you played 35 in 2019 20 like 50 the year after after being this like complete Iron Man the first four years of his career it kind of feels like it could go either way now but I also think he probably plays 6 plus games like he's not played 29 again and that would be big for Minnesota are you totally out on gobert like I've actually been stupid him up in Savannah Tennessee League's because the price is just so low I mean you could get them you can get them in the late 60s and the 70s in subways and that's essentially where he finished last year he was right around like 65 overall in Rhode Island's I I feel like the shop blocking has to come around like he's just no evidence to suggest that he's ever been like a 1.4 blocks per game guy like he was a season ago  but are you just completely avoiding him in fantasy  I'm not completely avoiding him but I  I think this team is just better when only one of those guys is out there and so I think like you know the whole car with the town's going to be healthier well that just tells me that they're going to be ineffective in those minutes where they have to play those guys together  it's just it's too clunky you know on offense there's nowhere to put ready to go bare other than the paint or use them in the pick and roll but like I think Edwards would much rather just create and beat his man but then go Bears man sitting there waiting for him in the paint and then on defense Carlton towns asking him to guard asking one of those two to guard  you know the the four on the other team if they can dribble it all it's just a total mess so I just I would like this team more if they sold cat or go bare for 60 cents on the dollar just to kind of free things up  the New Orleans Pelicans 42 wins a season to go 44 and a half is the number for New Orleans  we're both going under here James I really like this team I like a lot of the pieces I like it last year you know part of it is the inherent lack of trust in Zion Williamson staying healthy but I there's I don't know there's something kind of Mystic with this team and again maybe Zion you know covers up for a lot of that if he's out there for 55 plus games but I don't know if we can count on that what's the weather I think CJ mccollum's best years are behind him for the most part I like Brandon Ingram but this is also a roster that to be is like devoid of a true you know perennial no doubt or type of All Star like they have a couple guys that are borderline each year and Zion is is likely that guy if he plays enough games but I also come back to the fact that like we do we know for sure that Zion is like a no doubt weaning player like there's there's been a lot of positives as far as like the county stats for fantasy and you know started to show a little bit more as a passer before he got hurt to seasons ago but I still think a lot of the numbers that he's put up I wouldn't say they're empty numbers but I don't know that he's been in an overwhelmingly winning player even when he's been on the court  I think I think he is a winning player when he's out there I think that they showed that last year I mean they were  one of the best teams in the conference whenever he was healthy  and I might have been able to talk myself into the over here if Trey Murphy was fully healthy but he's such a huge piece for them because this is just not a good shooting team you have McCollum Ingram is you know he's a good scorer but I don't think he's  you know he's not at his best when he's just stretching in the corner or something like that nobody's gonna respect herb Jones you want Valentine's shooting you want Zion shooting so not having that that other shooter out there with McCollum I think is a big issue early in the season and  you know again I even went all the guys are healthy I don't think Zion and Ingram are good fits together I don't think I on and bounce you know they're good fits together so it's not like all the pieces here just make the whole roster you know sing I think there's some really talented players on this roster they've had some good picks over the years but yeah I think it's just it's such a crowded West  you're kind of looking for reasons to go under with some of these teams and I think there's plenty of reasons but the Pelicans yeah that's a good way to put it you know a lot of the pieces that you ran through again like we like these guys I like herb gels like even you know someone like Naji Marshall is given them decent minutes and you know that they still have Larry Nance to give you 18 good minutes off the bench like I I like with the team is I just we saw two sides of them through the kind of the first half of last season right I mean they were number one in the west around Christmas right there were 18 and 8 to begin the year and then you fast forward a month and a half in their 26 to 27 you know like I those are just two completely different phases of this team like I don't I don't think good teams you know have a random like 11 game losing streak in the middle of January and February like that just doesn't happen like there's still there's still something missing with this team and you know again I'll say it like the four times like maybe maybe it's a healthy that here's all evils for this team and look I think if he if he plays 65 games that they're going over I think that's going to be the case but I I don't really know how you can have any level of confidence that that's iron Williamson is going to make it through this season like let alone even give you 50 games right I mean what would you set the over under at for  games played for Zion this season with the context that he has played 2461 zero and 29 over 4 Seasons  I would set it at 41 and a half that's fair and I would say that betting the under on the Zion Pelicans has been extremely profitable since he got into the  okay well we got a comment in the Stream that says let's stop talking about the Pelicans their mid team unless their Stars available and he never is which sums it up pretty good so I think we will move on the OKC Thunder Jane this will be a fun one 40 wins last year 44 and a half is the win total  everybody's going over on the Thunder is there any any reason here that that we would fade the public because I'm taking the bait and going over  yeah I mean I do feel a little bit like a sucker for just jumping aboard you know everyone is going over here like you said so often that's kind of a red flag that  you know Vegas is really going to clean up on the under but  man I just  I love this roster so much  you know they are very very young like you rarely see teams that are this young when mid 40s games  but I mean the players are just so good very few teams this Young have  a legitimate first team on NBA caliber player like Shea salads and her and then you know having Jalen Williams a check complimenting him and you know guy like Lou Dort who just he has a role he's not gonna try to take more shots this year or anything like that it's just it's such a nice collection of young talent and I think we haven't seen sga's best year we haven't seen any of these guys best year except maybe Dort so  I'm I'm really excited  I don't think there's any reason for this team to pump the brakes at all in terms of you know resting guys they were still doing a little bit of that last year  just kind of being more conservative than the average team it felt like but I think they can get a top six seed and I don't think they're ever going to be out of touch from that area of the playoff bracket so I don't see that why they wouldn't try I mean they were 500 team with about 10 games to go and stumbled a little bit at the end to finish right at 40 so they essentially we're in the ballpark of this number a season ago and you bringing back basically everybody you're expecting anything from a mild to a significant step forward from all of the key young players on this team and we haven't even mentioned at home grade who looks like he's going to be a plus right away now I I do have some concerns about the depth behind Holmgren and I think he could be an injury liability in his own right but it's still just a huge upgrade from what they've been rolling out at like they ignored the center position for the last three or four years and even if Chad Holmgren gets pushed around even if he misses some time even if he is you know not playing 35 minutes at night like it's still a just massive upgrade over the essential like Julie talent that you were starting at the five for the last couple of years so I think he's gonna make a huge difference right away I would like them to bring in like some sort of Veteran behind him who weighs more than like 185 pounds like that that's to be still worries me it's like who who won the Steve Garfield I don't know  I guess it's all going to start the year and look you know playing the Sixers specifically this is not going to you know sink your your over under win total but I do think they're still some parts of this roster that need to be short up but it's hard to poke holes in the core of SGA giddy Dort jet homegrown and Jayla Williams who I know is one of both yours and mine you know favorite young players in the NBA like he's he's so good he's so good I think of all of all like the second year guys who were excited to watch the season like he is he's number one on my list and I  it's awesome to see him play and grow with this young core but there's part of it is also like is he gonna be the fourth option on a lot of nights like I almost rather see him in a bigger role but he's I mean he's already feels like overqualified to fill that spot yeah I thought it was very challenging in fantasy dress this year because I just had to separate how much I love Jalen Williams the player versus his role on this team right it's just it's hard to see there being enough meat on the bone for all these guys to be worth the fantasy price tag they had this year but yeah I mean Jalen Williams like he's just such a lock to be  you know at least kind of like a fringe All-Star level player for about a decade here you just does everything well  just love the length love the defensive versatility and I love the fact that they're going with chat at the five I mean not like you said they don't have a ton of options really but I just love that they're going with their five best guys and yeah not really messing around I think this would be my number one League past team yeah this will be up there but this is this is a pretty clear number one and I think that'll be the case for a lot of people all right we got five more James let's go to the Phoenix Suns 45 wins a year ago 51 and a half is the number for Phoenix we're both going over here I I'm just kind of falling back on the talent you know I think when you when you have three all NBA players on the same team you could have a decent amount of upside that goes without saying now of course Kevin Durant is one of those guys who could miss anywhere from like 20 to 50 games you know book or missed some time last year Brad Beale as Mr big chunks of time the last two years I the deal thing I'm like I'm not that worried about like I think part of it was just the situation and just kind of flukey stuff with him but but Durant is the one who really worries me I I lean over here but but I also can see this number being a couple wins lower just because like it's Phoenix going to push to win games in the regular season like or is this one of those teams that we have to say all right they're so focused on the title that you know that they don't really  care if they win 48 games 52 games 56 games  you know the line was originally 52 and a half on FanDuel and it went down to 51 and a half and I actually switched from an under on 52 and a half to an over on 51 and a half so that's kind of how close I think it is with this line you know maybe just if they were kind of cruising to like the third seed or the fourth seed or something maybe they wouldn't care that much if they won 50 games or 53 games but  I just think in the west it's going to be there's going to be something for them to play for  I don't think Matt ishbia has any interest in just kind of coasting into the playoffs with like the four seed and  missing out on that that second round home court advantage so I  think they'll just try to win as many games as they can while being smart with those three players from a usage standpoint and  if they just  I think you can project Booker I know Booker and Beale both you know they're not like 82 game guys but  I feel comfortable projecting those guys for 65 games or so book or maybe even like 70 games  you know it could be worse luck than that but I just think he's in his physical prime right now  I don't want to be too overreaction area and say that these guys are only only going to play 60 games to rant I think is the bigger risk there but even if you just kind of get to sort of 55 games out of Duran and the other two are relatively healthy I just think they have too much Firepower they're going to blow a lot of teams out when they're fully healthy and not have to play these guys on the fourth quarter so you know I I like them more than the regular season than the postseason I think like Warriors Lakers Suns  it's gonna be really interesting to see which of those teams looks the best heading into the postseason but regular season wise I just think it's too much Firepower  I like the depth that they added with Grayson Allen and even Eric Gordon it was just like this is like the perfect time in his career for him to just kind of chill out be like the seventh band and you know give you a couple 20 points every now and then the big concern for me is Center and I I'm willing to I'm willing to meet in the middle on this with some people and say that like you know nurture and eight and like someone of a wash just because the Vibes were so bad with DeAndre eight in that even though I think he's a better player and certainly a healthier and like better bet night tonight that they just needed to get him out of there like that was pretty clear like he was just not coming back no matter what I don't think Kevin Booker was was ever interested in playing another game with DeAndre eight and so in some ways the sun's hand was forced but I mean nor could just missed a ton of time he's kind of a wild card on both ends he was watching their preseason game the other night I forget I was against the Lakers yeah so the LeBron KD game he won one of 11 from the field it's the preseason but still not ideal from a big man like center to me is a big big question mark for this team because you know behind your kitchen it's what like Beto Drew Eubanks bol bol like that that's a pretty glaring hole for this team  yeah it'll be a it'll be a good test case to sort of see how much that matters in in a regular season setting  obviously I have concerns about how they would hold up going against any quality big man in the playoffs but  I just think they're going to space everyone out as much as they possibly can and the mismatches on their defensive end of the court maybe in the front Court I think you're going to see just as bad a mismatches on the opposite end because how many teams can even hope to guard two of these guys with Ron ball Defenders you know it's just going to be such a challenge the Portland Trail Blazers 33 wins a year ago the number is down to 27 and a half for obvious reasons Damian Lillard now in Milwaukee still technically on this team I think at some point they'll cache that asset in but we're looking at a likely starting five of scoot Henderson Anfernee Simons Batiste steibel slash shaded sharp Jeremy Grant DeAndre ayton I like a lot of these names I love this as kind of a you know like Reclamation spot for DeAndre ayton to to kind of you know be able to get away from that Phoenix situation and try to grow it as a player that the son thought he could become as the number one overall pick even if he kind of stays the same I think he's still above average center right now and should you know continue to improve incrementally over these next couple of years you got Robert Williams is just kind of a bonus player now coming over from Boston you know some other young players that were keeping an eye on but once you get beyond that that top six or so I'm going under on 27  and a half for Portland like I think this would be a really fun team I could not wait to watch scoot night tonight I don't know that there are a ton of winning players on this roster I think there are a lot of guys that are gonna put up numbers they're a lot of guys who could grow into becoming winning players as their careers go along but like even if Scott hits the ground running and like wins Rookie of the Year it's like how many rookie guards you know end up being like you know really impactful in terms of wins and losses like even the best rookie cards typically don't help you a ton there so I think this is going to be a fun team I think we're gonna feel good about the direction that they're moving but I kind of view them like in the same vein as like last year's Rockets but you know minus minus some of the troubles  yeah I I just I agree with everything you said I think they're going to lose the most games in the West  you know even guys like Jeremy Grant aren't sort of established winning players and right I think they will trade Jeremy Grant this season before the deadline as long as they can get off his contract with that up into attach something it seemed kind of obvious that their front office was  kind of upset about Damian Lillard's timing on that one might not give him Jeremy Grant that same contract if they'd know what was going to happen there so Malcolm Brogden kind of same thing I just assumed he won't be on this team after the trade deadline just yeah I think they're gonna lose a ton of games it's like a great roster to take over as a general manager because of all the assets and young pieces and stuff but winning games is not a priority for this team now that'll be a very fun 2K team no question about that I'm looking forward to some like 40.9 from Anfernee Simons But ultimately this is the it's the lowest number in the Western Conference at 27 and a half and as we talked about in the eastbound like it's not it's not a firm rule but usually every year you have you know two three sometimes four teams that are in that like 22 and under Zone in terms of wins and I think if you if you got to pick a team out of the West Portland has to be one of the the top two or three contenders another team that could be in that mix James we're going to head on this one the San Antonio Spurs 22 wins a year ago 28 and a half is the number you're going over I'm going under on 28 1/2 ways  yeah it's just it's such a low number to me for how good of a rookie season I think when benyam is going to have  you know he could have this could be one of the best defensive rookie Seasons we've ever seen and like I think he could be like top five Defensive Player of the Year as a rookie  just be just changes the geometry on that end of the court so much  I think that  you know I I just don't think there's going to be any motivation here to worry about draft picks they're going to pick high in the draft I think it's more like webinars really competitive  and I think they would benefit more from just kind of showing some signs this year and showing the guys like Jeremy Sohan and Devin Bissell and  Kelvin Johnson like our players that they can build around so I just I don't really see the motivation for them to really tank there's gonna end up with a with a high pick regardless and I think they're just gonna  be careful with women yeah I'm like I don't think he's gonna play 75 games but I do think he'll play 605 plus games because getting rookie of the years presumably important to him and the team I I think you're right about women Jama and I mean I continue to be more and more impressed with each passing pre-season game like coming out of Summer League it was like all right you totally understand it you get why he's decided as he is but like he's looked like he's looked like a completely different player in the preseason he looks bigger to me he looks more confident he looks better on the defensive end he looks like a little bit more athletic you know not you know not kind of as many plays where he's getting pushed around so I'm I'm very high on what he could bring them I think he's a clear winning player right away I just don't know that they have a ton of others you know like Kelvin Johnson to me like he'll get his numbers I don't know that he's a great asset at this point I  I am you know curious to see how the the Jeremy so Hand point guard experiment works that doesn't exactly scream to me like team that's winning 35 games is starting JB Sohan at the point and again I don't love the depth Theory either and that's that's just gonna be inherently the case when you're talking about a team that might win 25 games but I mean beyond that that top five of Sohan the cell Johnson weapon Yamaha Zach Collins and you can even throw trade zones in there he's solid but after that I mean you got a bunch of guys who you know are kind of borderline roster players in a lot of ways so I you know if women have a plays 65 to 70 games which I that's on the high end for sure I think they'll push for this but if he could start at any point if they are a little bit more aggressive than we're expecting in terms of the rest with women Yama like I think everybody including women Yama knows that there are no expectations for this season sometimes that could be good for a young team and they'll exceed whatever those that expectations are as low as they may be but I also think there's this kind of this like organizational understanding that like oh it's okay if we're bad this season and I don't I think that could kind of seep into the roster  I mean you're you're doing a pretty good job at convincing me I  it's a tough line  I mean man woman just looks so good it's but yeah there's there's only so many wins to go around and there's really only one team that is in my mind clearly worse than them in the west so it's a tough one  I think I might actually switch I think you've oh it's me I'm okay my mind here all right we got our first switch of the podcast so we are now both on the under for the Spurs at 28 and a half all right two more the Sacramento Kings then we will finish out with the Jazz 48 wins a year ago for Sacramento interesting number here 44 and a half that is the same number as the Timberwolves and as the Pelicans as the Oklahoma City Thunder so that's that's kind of the zone that we're looking at for the Kings  I feel like I'm walking into a trap here James but I'm going over  I mean you took the words out of my mouth I feel like this might be an even more sucker over than the Thunder one  everyone knows how historically healthy this team was last year  so I mean it it's obvious you know it makes sense in that sense that it would be a lower over under than what they won last year despite the Youth of the core of this roster but I just think the pieces fit really well I they might not be the number one offense in the league like they were last year but I don't see why they wouldn't be top five and I mean Keegan Murray there's a chance he takes a step and and kind of join Fox and sabonis to make this kind of a real good young big three where the piece is just really fit I like that they  didn't really do anything to sacrifice offense for defense this off season I think that they're they're kind of who they are as a team is just this running gun team so I like that they didn't really change that up and I got good coaching so I just think there's enough here that they go over but it doesn't it's not one of them that happy about no I mean I don't feel great about it just because the number of strikes me is so low but you know I think for a team that 148 you do still feel like you're getting a discount so it goes both ways the health thing is number one for me and you said they were historically healthy last year that is absolutely true to put that in context like their top eight minute gitters last year this 30 total games  total among eight players I mean that is that is wild so it's not like just Fox it's a bonus we're healthy it's like pretty much everybody that was contributing on a night-to-night basis played almost the entire season for the king so they're not gonna have that kind of luck this time around you know if Fox plays 50 games and so bonus plays 60 they're probably gonna go under but I also think you know those are guys that don't have like super concerning injury history I think you have some bonus is dealt with like kind of random like a hand injury like it's not like he's a guy who came into the league with severe foot and ankle issues so I don't I think the argument against them you know playing or fewer than 70 games is just saying that the luck will come around and you know I buy into that to sub degree but I also think this is a team that you know census that it builds a real momentum last year I mean we talked about Denver having a great home court advantage Sacramento's right there I mean in terms of like how that was a college atmosphere for most of last season I think they're gonna be fired up to do the same thing this year and I don't think they want to fall off yeah I almost look at I look at Sacramento like the same way we looked at methods a couple of years ago when they had a better than expected season in your life all right you know are they gonna fall back down and be a 40 win team this year and then they've just did it again you know despite John Moran missing a bunch of time now I don't know that Sacramento has that same level of depth you know Memphis was getting contributions all over the place you know there's no real no real major additions this off season like you're bringing in Sasha doesn't cough from from Europe you know a guy who's had a ton of success in the Euro league I think in theory should be kind of a plug-and-play guy off the bench I'm excited to see what he looks like that they kind of bought low on crystal Arte somebody that they're GM and their owners have had their eye on reportedly so you know to me that's kind of a wash but you know I I think if they have even like  B level Health this season you know you're not gonna get 30 missed games from your top eight but as long as there's not a complete catastrophe in terms of injuries I feel pretty good about them going over yeah and they might do something at the deadline too to upgrade the Harrison Barnes spots so yeah I like that cop too to Memphis actually that makes a lot of sense to me just coaching and effort like they're gonna out hustle a lot of teams and outrun a lot of teams during the regular season to easy wins they're also going to outcare a lot of Team yeah right like they're like if you just care about every game that's an edge and the regular season because that is a massive Edge what you're talking about with totals like they're gonna outcare the the nuggets the sun's the Clippers the Warriors the Lakers possibly the Pelicans on some nights maybe even the Mavericks like that's that's a big that's a big bump  all right let's finish out with the Utah Jazz this one this might be the single toughest one so I'm glad we're doing it last 37 wins a year ago 35 and a half is the number for Utah  I am very very very very cautiously going under James but give me your case for why you're going over  it's a big bet on how good Lori marking in and Walker Kessler are  the John Collins piece  like I like him as a Reclamation project in the right scenario and I'm just worried that this may be isn't the right scenario I don't like that it  like I think you want to have Laurie playing the four as much as possible and so anytime that Collins and Kessler are out there he's playing the three  but I just I like like a Linux are really nice backup big he allows them to do some some cool stuff on offense I like keyonte George I like oh Chad bhaji Colin Sexton Jordan Clarkson you know there's there's decent amount of overlap with these guys they do a lot of the same things so not exactly sure what the hierarchies gonna look like two months from now I assume it's gonna be kind of the veterans first but I even don't mind telling Horton Tucker just giving his length and I thought he showed some flashes down the stretch last year so  I think it's it's a deep team I think marketing  is like him and Kessler as you know you're defensive and offensive anchors I think it's good enough to get to high 30s and I think the will Hardy's one of the best coaches in the league so  I I don't love the way the Jack Collins piece fits I do have some questions about the amount of passing in the back court but I think markings just really good and Castle is one of the best defense Bankers in the league be muted  yeah college is not been good in the preseason at all James and that's concerning to me I actually kind of like the move at first as just a get him out of Atlanta type of thing where we've been asking for that for a while for Fantasy but it I don't know he might just be a different player at this point you know three four years ago he was like you know borderline second third round value and it just kind of seems like you know whatever upward momentum there was these kind of lost that I'm with you on like a lot of these pieces you know even if they even if they were to you know make some sort of move to to kind of move back you know whether that's like trading account sex didn't trading Jordan Clarkson like they're there's a tree can young talents of guys that I hope they get a look at as a year goes along I just think like  coming into last year I don't think they they certainly didn't expect to be as good as they were I don't know if they wanted to be as good as they were early on you know they started 12 and six and it's like if you don't start 12 and 6 this year which I don't think happens you know the rest of the season you know they played it you know they basically played at what like a borderline 30 Winn Pace yeah you know so it's like if you don't have that hot start do we view this team differently you know at one point they were 31 and 31 which 20 games to go and and then what six more games the rest of the way I mean they so they kind of offset at the end and they did kind of I mean they did sort of I mean they did flip the tank so switch yes and they did you know they traded some guys um do they do you see them kind of really leaning into that again this year is is there going to be even  a motivation for it if you've got because I feel like you're going to have like four or five teams  kind of around you know upper 20s lower mid-20s up for 20s they might just be kind of in that that range with  teams like the magic teams like the Nets sure and I just don't know how much those teams are gonna go out of their way to kind of push to get like six best lottery apps or something like that I will say that there is some motivation here for Utah because they owe their first round pick to OKC and its top 10 protected so I don't you know I you know the teams that we're talking about it's like yeah maybe if you're sitting with like the six best odds or the 8th best odds like you feel pretty good about holding out of that pick but I think they want to make sure that they were training that pick and you know 10 is kind of right on the borderline there where you gotta you know you obviously you don't want to surrender the 11th pick in the draft so I I think there will be some motivation there I think it's a total Blank Slate type of season for them like if they win 28 games and get the the fourth pick of the draft I think they're totally fine with that if they you know come out of the gates hot again and and could push for a play inspired I think they're fine with that I just I think the the former is more like they to me I think they you know them struggling them taking a little bit of a step back I still love marketing for Fantasy I think he's gonna be a monster I love Walker Kessler but I don't I don't know that this team like if you stack up you know what do you think of the best teams in the Western Conference like they're they're  still you know below the play and so for me  yeah I think they're similar to the rockets for me in that I just I really like their coat and but then you have to like with the Rockets they have that protected pick too but there's a chance that if they could be incentivized over the last like eight games to really push to try to get the bottom so it's tough man it's when you have like a good coach and good pieces but it's not a team that's in that Top Eleven in the west maybe the smart move was to go under there they do play the Rockets twice in their last 15 games three times in fact in their last 15 games so yeah that could actually go a long way those three games towards deciding the the over under for both of these teams all right James that finishes it out if you have not listened to the Eastern Conference make sure you scroll back at the feet you can find that from last week Monday October 16th but this concludes all 30 win total over under James I did just see we've had a rash of like random role player like young player extensions today  four years 62 mil for  oh I like it he's great he's yeah he's the best one-on-one Gianna stopper in the league but yes yeah it's in the damn yeah I've been I've been holding him like forever in our staff keeper league and we'll continue to do so I could assure you that hopefully this is a year he gets a little more tick but again check out the the Easter Conference if you have not yet please like subscribe to the RotoWire fantasy basketball YouTube channel we'll
