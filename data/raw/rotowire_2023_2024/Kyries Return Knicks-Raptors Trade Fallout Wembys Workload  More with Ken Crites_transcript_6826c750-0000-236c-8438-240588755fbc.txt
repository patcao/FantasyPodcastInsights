hey everybody  it's Dr Dre that is the catering can cranks  Albert  it's Tuesday January 2nd this is the award-winning RotoWire fancy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy it's 2024 baby let's do it  hello catering how are your headphones they are great I was just explained to Doc I stepped and crushed my go-to headphones luckily I had these backups in the closet  which I left open  but happy to be here in 2024 thanks for having me Steve  are you sad about the headphones that are now destroyed those are your go-to they were my go-to I am sad I'm looking up on the floor and two parts I mean they're plastic  they used to be my other pod Partners to call those my boy band headphones did I see you got a Golden Tee for Christmas I'm getting us off topic already but my birthday my birthday present came home from playing Golden Tee at the bar yeah my front door and there's a golden team machine in my house that is fantastic is this the wife thing stop drinking  right or what yeah maybe I don't need to have a full-time job anymore you got all you need yeah I've got everything I need right here  but it's cool man people like like I'm known in my town is the Golden Tee guy because I'm always I'm play every day okay in this same bar and so when I told when people found out I got that my wife got me a machine like genuinely so excited for me like oh that's great man and there's like jealousy don't even people are happy for me it's like they can just see the tears of my eyes the joy I was like you have a wife who knows you well yeah so I got I got very lucky there so yeah that's cool um let's talk about  let's hit some news Ken and then we'll hit the Panic meter  maybe some hot players maybe some get off my lawn I've got one lined up for next week  maybe some bets and maybe a quick story Dr a brush greatness story ah fantastic perfect  and as usual you want to talk about you cannot get away from the maps  yeah right well I mean it is timely Kyrie Irving okay last night wasn't really a 21 game absence  did you know I relish him not playing I'm I'm a Kyrie hater so I enjoyed the know Kyrie and the news  and look surprise surprise comes back plays poor defense puts up a minus 15.54 by lowly Utah  well that's what I was gonna ask you are you surprised and any of that no no I think Kyrie is probably you know Kyrie's one of those addition by subtraction guys you know I am surprised by I can't believe how badly Grant Williams is playing for Dallas they give him that nice contract I thought he translated well in that line up hit a bunch of corner catching shoot threes rebound better than this it just goes to show Brad Stevens knows what he's doing man well and Grant Williams was supposed to be good that the thing I can't believe is the Dallas is as good as they are when it's literally just in the Lucas show right Jones had exam in their in their starting lineup you know retreads base I mean Lively's been a great draft pick right he's a legit Center  um they're right here is having a career here yeah Tim Hardaway is a  solid basketball player he'll be like for hot for four weeks then get cold for three but yeah yeah he's doing his usual thing but then you got all these guys just kind of filling in the blanks and I I don't know man they got a lot of Band-Aid guys  I I do I'm with you in the but I'm with you in the in the Kyrie Arena like I'm not a Kyrie guy never have been but I did kind of like I have kind of like seen him rooting on the bench for his teammates and I feel he's invested I feel like you know Anthony Davis is hell bent on playing as many games as he can Kyrie Irving all these guys that were used to kind of be Chumps are trying to play every game now and I feel like if Kyrie didn't have an actual real injury he would be out there trying to help his team so I still have a little bit of fade as a Mavs fan that this is all going to work out well yeah we'll see they love what are they gonna do they're not gonna trade Kyrie at the deadlines or anything so they gotta make it yeah they they are their hands are tied  so the South and Tech yoga guy catch up  yeah for you talk I have been screaming from the rafters Hamlin and I both and and probably you too like  you got to trade Lori marking and off your fantasy team before the next injury and before he gets shut down feel like this whole Utah team is going to get shut down Plantation focus on getting the pick yeah  24.6 more is to assist two steals a block and three triples last night is this a guy we should all be sitting on I'm I'm gonna say unfortunately no I wish I shared your enthusiasm you're right Utah's gonna realize they need to tank for a draft spot but fun techie oh is a one night beautiful evening Forum that's a crowded front with Collins Kelly the clinic Kessler marketing and Simone ranks 221 per game value over the last 14 days in eight categories for the RotoWire ranking so I think it's a great one time game he certainly will gobble up the minutes when they realize that John Collins failure is just that but I don't know why they're not giving Kessler more minutes  but to me it's a Buy Low on marketing if you can though maybe the name is just too big to get them on the low his stats per year aren't that bad in fact his turnovers are actually improving he's down two and a half points per game um  but you're right Utah needs to focus on getting a lottery pick  you know it's funny when when Cameron and I were on last Thursday he's like dude I just got a trade offer this morning you know we and I said let me guess what I said Laurie marking and he goes yeah I'm like I got that one too bro the person who has Laurie Mark and on the roster in our our league that we've played oh is this the kid like keeper lick know this is this  this is a  there's my trophy from the camel like April this is a different League here in with Rick yeah well no now I'm confused I don't know but anyway oh no it was another guy in that League that oh I got a from a marketing in the desk that I it wasn't camera um it's the Rock and Rollin I mean but nonetheless people are trying to move him I don't think it's a bios situation a market and I think he's a ticking Time Bomb he certainly had health a thick medical file before coming to Utah what about Jordan Clarkson I know you're fired up about him hey it's triple double right I just think it's nice for Utah that had a triple double almost 16 years about that and kudos to Clarkson doesn't come off the bench last night so yeah kudos to Jordan and those Jazz fans  and I owe the Jazz and apology wasn't crazy about those black and gold you know forms but they definitely grown on me huh  differently same league that I was talking about different  person  once Dante even shenzo who I just picked up off waivers when he blew up the other night yeah yeah what do you have like 48 38 points and yeah something because he was just draining threes he just was feeling at that night yeah so I picked him up and I'm like he's already been starting from the next for three weeks they're they're gonna start starting him RJ Barrett and all of those shops are gone I mean yeah like yeah how can this fail for Dante she was like well do you want Zach Lavine  for Dante even since I feel like I should do that but oh you're on the you're on the demon Chen so side of that I didn't read the notes the show notes right yeah I could stick with Dante here's what scares me about Levine right the Bulls are playing a heck of a lot better without them they're 10 and 5 since Levine's been out on this current injury he does hope to return later this week but if you're Chicago what is the rush and man I feel like he's tanked his own or the Bulls success has really tanked Levine's trade value No One's Gonna want that contract I bring Levine Off the Bench while they're playing well but I'm glad you stuck with Dante I think that's the move  well I think once  Levine is traded which he's going to be he's not untradeable  and he's not playing I don't he's playing in our game for the Bulls once he's traded I made look back on that and realize what a mistake I made right now I mean I haven't seen Zach LaVine I haven't seen him picture of him or heard his name and two months so yeah well the picture I remember is him with terrible body language is last few Bulls game where not getting back on defense and yeah you know he didn't win in Minnesota he's not winning in Chicago I don't want them I don't want to I wouldn't want him on my my team um  did you happen to hear about the big trade that went down heck yes heck yes what was your immediate reaction was it really Josh Hart being done for the season that I need reaction was  this is so cool like no one is going to call me and tell me to get on my computer and record a video right now  breaking down the trade in 25 seconds or less inspiring It Off  to a studio in Connecticut all over the Internet like I just I just I just kept scrolling why don't want to you know bad mouth a competitor where you used to work at but uh yeah you know good for you not having to have the corporate man crush on a holiday I'll say this I actually think it's a good trade for both teams I think Derek needs Barrett needs to be somewhere where the fast motion offense too many times like I'm not an RJ Barrett fan I wasn't coming out of Duke I'm not now but that poor guy got stuck with a lot of like bailout Julius Randle shots you know shot clocks down to 22 they've doubled Randall he just flings some bad pass to Barrett who's supposed to bail him out when he's inconsistently shooting from three he deserves like plays called for him where he can focus on better being a better three-point player and who knows maybe a little home cooking in Toronto will be with Barrett needs is this a Barrett Trader is it a quickly trade or is it just torn saying give me younger guys more contract control knowing that they're probably gonna lose on an obf after you know either this summer or next depending on that player option well I don't know nobody didn't look right this year yeah his stats are bad the more usage Barnes got  the that almost came all directly away from I don't know be and I don't know he's agent he's the son or the nephew of Leon Rose the president of the next so there's clearly some insight info the next field good about resigning them I think it's so funny that the Knicks are suing the Raptors for allegedly stealing Insider info and yet they somehow consummated trade I don't that's so weird to me that is weird  it's very weird yeah and look I don't know be  I think he he's much more comfortable fit in that NYX he wasn't getting high usage offensively with the Raptors  and the Knicks are a defensive first team which a guy like I don't know B loves really plays to his skills and you know tips is gonna play them those knees bleed he'll be getting 72 minutes a night or whatever so I actually think both players value goes up quickly they started quickly can you believe they started quickly day one they're just like short or hit the pine shorter still got decent minutes but I was shocked  day one quickly was the starting point guard I'll see if that lasts or not I feel like all yeah  um how come I don't know be played for the next but a chew it didn't  a chewed he was looking for minutes on that I mean they obviously hartenstein needs some help there um I only caught the fourth quarter of that game Pakistan still got 39 minutes though tips yeah I don't know what you would get nine minutes I'm sorry we quick over to I mean I'll ramp him up a little but a little I don't I'm not expecting anything big but I think quickly is a good fit in Toronto I think quickly  and OG or quickly and and rjb kind of both needed to get out of New York and I feel like oh gee to get out of Toronto right for everybody I think you have your good Josh Hart came off the bench 8 points  I'm worried about Josh Hardy he's been such a solid fantasy guy but still 29 minutes he's you know if he's getting 29 minutes off the bench you're happy still got 11 you know you kind of get him for his rebounds and he got 11 of those last night actually hit two of three he might be better coming off the bench facing worst defenses Here's To Me the sneaky move on the straight Jacob Pirtle whose name I will mispronounce for the entire duration of his NBA career but I think hurdles values actually going to tick up achua right or wrong was stealing minutes from Portal as they kept experimenting in Toronto and now he's their only legit Center  North of the border so I actually think Turtles minutes so that means more rebounds more blocks more tippens you don't want to take a more free throw shots but there's my sneaky little under the radar move from this trade yeah I don't know I feel like turtles visiting nor it all year you don't hear his name he's not doing any much maybe it gives him a boost I mean it's hot  I think he's worth hanging on to but he's certainly not done anything exciting that no I'm hoping just for a little more consistency and getting a double-double and but he does get the blocks he does get to the blocks  you know I'm not one that can really sit and and judge people on how they mispronounce NBA players names because I do it all the time  when you this  week with Jacob Pirtle and said and the doctor there we go sick yeah buddy my buddy Brian last week with Jaime jaquez I was so focused on getting the Pearl part right that I screwed up the yakka part that is terrible hurdle rhymes with Wordle he's got a Wordle type of game otherwise I like that that's good Underdog fantasy is the number one platform for NBA

scaring you right now Doc  well Jimmy Butler  he's scared me three years ago two years ago last year the gameplay is the games played is gradually becoming a bigger problem each season  for Jimmy yeah  and primary not for Jaime not for JJ dude sorting came to me last night he's like yeah I dropped how many hockey as to pick up shade on Sharp and I was like you did what unacceptable know  get on your phone right now and go back  he's like he's not that excited about how many Hawkins like I am doesn't like fundamental basketball apparently it's just watch the slam dunk highlight reels you know  well  there's that you know that's how these kids watch all of their NBA that's exactly they just watching the top 10 plays like yeah exactly that's it anyway Butler's got a right foot injury now after he missed all of last week I think  he's over he was ruled out last night early I don't know I don't know if he'll play this week but it just it just gives that much more Credence to Jaime Hopkins and how  much of a leader he's become on that team and how important he is to that team and how you should not be dropping him anywhere anytime anyhow  really can play two three or four is clearly more of a three  but it's funny how everyone predicted the heat would draft him  it happens everyone says always going to be a perfect fit and he is like he is such he's like he cultured day one there's nothing flashy about his game the footwork the fundamental footwork is delicious it reminds me of old school old school Hoops Kevin McHale ish  but yeah great passer not selfish you know he just plays great D switches well  love looks like he just looks like he belongs out there like yeah playing in the NBA for eight years you would not look at him and think rookie the way he because this is not he hasn't had a rookie moment yet you know like where he's panicked or things have been a shaky form like when I just had to read that promo start that promo over again that was a rookie moment  Jaime has not had one of those yet no not going to  and I gotta believe that  you know that he coaching staff is not the most forgiving there's kind of a Belichick vibe  and yet he's handled it fine you know they're not like the biggest ra ra patent guys on the back their expectations are high and  they don't mind yelling at guys in Miami and they really have a need to get to you know to yell at all this season  all right my guy Victor woman's missed three games now I think here it comes I told you know I was scared of this the beginning of the Season they're three players away from being legit contenders why would you play this clearly fragile 19 year old  and demoralized him  for multiple losses none of that is happening he's not demoralized he's completely fine Ingrid he's played great people are paying money to go see him play the killer was when he sat one of the this first had a two-game week and he sat one of them that was that killed me well hey what's happening is the Spurs are still terrible I mean they're 11 games out of the playing tournament  that's what's happening and that's my I'm sorry that really is my main point this team is terrible  they have nothing to play for and pop loves to rest his guys  my hope is this because pop is already said for now he's not going to play in back-to-back games so it's ankles fully healed which I'm fine with that Spurs have three games this week they have no back-to-backs so we're getting a pass this week totally plays in all three games for me and I win My Hope Is that maybe he sits the second or first of a back-to-back for the rest of the season but plays the rest of the time I think that is the best case scenario yeah and you know I was really negative on Wendy and homegrown I've been wrong so far I still think there's plenty of season for them to be hurt I scared more about when being just how bad the Spurs are you know the Thunder have something to play for right you feel like the league Mandate of you're not just gonna sit your guys to sit your guys anymore he's working order  it maybe that gives us some Hope on wimpy ah maybe you know be nice for Wimpy get him a real point guard could you get him a true point guard  would you start Trey Jones on the same the so on experiment seems to have faild and yet they're still not starting zones a point guard I don't understand what is going on I have no idea  like I am sure your point guard of the future I mean clearly they're drafted a point guard next draft but I don't understand the refusal to put Trey Jones back in the starting lineup I don't either  it doesn't make sense that's been  you know Tony Parker was such a foundation for 20 years  and now you've got a small forward run the point I don't get it  bennedict mathurin to back-to-back 20-point games  super inconsistent  every time I get fired up about him and want to pick him up then he disappears again it's gonna happen all year Yes Rick this team is mediocre people are hung up on how well they did on the n Season tournament and kudos to the pace is for that that was cute that was nice hello there's one in Milwaukee last night bro  yeah there's there 18 and 14 Rick Carlisle as he did last night is gonna experiment  with lineups throughout the season and that's what Squire you're going to be driven mad about  very nice win in Milwaukee last night absolutely and Halliburton legit NBA star I love how often you see he's got 15 or more assists with only two or fewer turnovers that's gorgeous but they can't decide on buddy hield well you know maybe here's your best scenario does buddy hield get sent to the Sixers at the trade deadline and they finally commit to mathura and as a starter  that'd be cool  I mean heeled is not on their timeline with those Stars it's not like they're playing lights out ball where you'd want to keep them  you know where you wouldn't want to upset the magic they're 18 and 14 highs and lows and heals 30 one well just healed  well  Neymar got hurt last night hers back and did not play in second half and but heals started second half for him  how do you like how do you like to jail on Smith and Aaron nice Smith in the starting lineup and moving top into the bench  I don't love it  I want to see Robin play he doesn't rebound he's six nine and doesn't rebound sounds like Zion he's a better shape than I believe he looks he looks like he should but you know topping 29 minutes three rebounds last night that's what's benching them I'd imagine I'd be yelling at them all day and night if I was on the Patriot Coast Pacers coaching that he's getting out man by Aaron Nesmith who's really a shooting guard and they'd rather have Nesmith get minutes at the four spent starting but like he's playing 12 15 minutes you know but they'd rather have Nesmith at the four who's like six six and 2:30 or something or two 15 but me Smith hustles like hustle niece Smith is a guy that fantasy managers should be looking at too because he's getting minutes yeah he's scoring he's scoring he doesn't do a whole lot of others stuff but  he gets steals you know and five stocks last night which is obviously unusual but he hustles on Dean gets steals yeah shot was horrible last night but he's still got 10 attempts hoisted three from The Arc but yeah nice Smith is a great no cost pickup one Pacers are on a four game week because he loved his defense um where are we at with saddiq Bey Jalen Johnson's back back to back double doubles a huge game on Sunday I'm kind of fired up about Jalen Johnson again yep I'm with you I you know bay is always scared me from a field goal percentage like it's not worth the threes if he's gonna tank your field goals now granted he's shooting a career high 45 just a hair under 45% this season but I think they prefer Jalen Johnson for they've been married to Hunter for years now but hey you're the Hawks expert are you saying this is it for Beck  I just think from a fantasy perspective I don't want him I don't want the third wheel in a three-ring  small forward mess yeah on my team I want the first guy and that's the only one I want that's Jalen Johnson so I just think he is going to kind of go away quietly here in the second half  are they showering on Hunter after years of always letting him start regardless of his health  I mean I don't know he's gonna miss him he's gonna miss more weeks he's not close to return I don't think and not wrapping on earlier and he  he was excited about Hunter this season he thought this was gonna be a year we finally see the guy we drafted but you know your note here says ask my buddies in the bar what they think about the other day yeah he played for the dog I mean  the dogs got robbed out of that oh tournament  so I don't really care about anything else till next year when the dog's play again  are you the only one watching basketball that bar where you're not the Golden Tee dude when I turned basketball on in that bar I get some pretty people look  I watch these boys don't stand up for the flags so  I got I because I turned the NBA basketball game  oh you're talking to her monster we don't have that problem up here have sports bars everyone's out actually skiing and doing stuff yeah he got up and actually left because I turned the game on I'm like sorry dude it's my job I need to watch this he's like well I know sit here and watch this he got up okay yeah they still Levert  let's go on with him he's either injured in not playing or he's going nuts and yeah and why are they just turn their back on Craig Porter after he had five or six great solid games as a starter they demote him suddenly with you know they need his rebounding Mobley has gone for another month right like  I don't understand the bailing on Porter and the roller coaster I feel like I picked up and then dropped Levert in 10 legs last week as a holiday blur I don't know what day was what but I was so excited to get Levert and then I want to drop him because the Cavs game Count was bad these weeks well and Brian asked me last week he's like what about Harrison Liberty picking him up I'm like no because I don't know when he's going to play I still have interest injury issues I don't but I just don't get yeah trying to predict  and they lost like I don't you they battle lost a Toronto  Porter gets six minutes to me  Porter was the head scratcher you've uncovered this gem this undrafted rookie he was awesome as a starter and they're really turn their back on this fast I that didn't make any sense to me the Greg Porter it was all time the Donovan Mitchell right like when Mitchell was out no it's a Garland's you know absence is also you know open the door wide open for him he was I thought we're gonna move through to move streus to the three why are you giving a Coro and Dean Wade minutes  then how badly did occur have to play last season look at him last night minus 18 point deferential for a crow wasn't the entire last season of failure at small forward led by a core for the Cavs they finally go out and get stress to fix that and then they show up a curl back in the lineup I I feel like was just playing shooting guard why why  while Mitchell was gone because and and also Rebels but he know he had some six or seven game assists in there I thought like my goodness you found this great another gem from Wichita State this is fantastic maybe it's the one game blip but we'll see I thought when Mitchell came back Porter would still be playing some point guard  exactly as soon as he came back Porter was poor disappears so yeah I don't four starts he had a these are his assist lines in those four starts seven eight eleven and six those are point guard numbers not shooting guard numbers and Mitchell is really natural position shooting guard let Porter run the show Porter is going to defer to Mitchell I don't it just and that's why I thought I thought when Mitchell came back well Darius Garland still out for another however many weeks of the broken jaw Porter should be fine and then important yeah and they won three of those four starts with Porter in there it doesn't make any sense to me that's that's my get off my lawn moment for me to this week as it bring back  I have a I have a get off my lawn that's related to something you said a minute ago about not knowing what day it is from December 20th to January 4th dude I have no idea ditto ditto not and it's funny because I was sitting here on Christmas day last week  right yeah my Christmas  time with my life it's like 1:00 Christmas night and I'm like getting ready to walk into my bedroom and go to bed I'm I figured out that it was Monday right NFL 60 NFL blurbs that had to be written up for the next morning  then I normally do it like two in the afternoon on Mondays so my whole plan just went out the window the dark side of the freelancing work there Doc is yeah the schedules a little more erratic and you did have stuff do on a Monday so I wrote from one to five a.m. and then I had to get up at 6:30 and go do this other thing it was it was terrible so I'm tired and not knowing what day it is  that's fair you know there's a part of me  luckily you know we have the luxury of no longer having corporate jobs and it's a lot easier to go back to a job that's fantasy sports versus driving to some got off full I steal Tower of endless cubes you got a crank out meeting some spreadsheets and feel Thatcher  DPS form so they call nowadays like thank God that's behind us but yeah I like I like I'm an old man who likes the standard regular week and yeah when we go to the holidays I'm wildly lost I have no idea what day it is I don't know when they're playing trash out yeah  we're we are the same old men one brain two bodies  leave out my trash can my driveway is about an angle like  you don't have ice on yours though you're down there and happy 80 degrees Atlanta every day I'm slide on my ass  trash flying everywhere there have been there have been times and I'm not kidding where I've had to put on my golf spikes  to get my trash can at my driveway in the snow so yeah we have these things called Grandpa's here though they're like rubber Souls with spikes you shovel over your shoes I need some crayons oh  another thing another little old man's bother me he's like who made the NBA schedule this year first of all we get no Sunday games in three out of four weeks which that took me off I yeah I like football as much as the next guy but I need some NBA on Sundays and now next week there's a bunch of teams Everybody Plays three or four games right yeah except for the Nets and calves only have one game yeah you're in a head-to-head matchup and you've got Donovan Mitchell and you've got Malik Lily Beasley or yeah Millie's just Bridges I mean Cal bridge is yeah you got rich Mitchell you got a bitch you're toast  well I think it's a bigger issue if you got if you're a Claxton owner right because having a valuable third Center is really hard to do and you can't have Clacks and just play one game yeah those three blocks he might get her super valuable but  one game that's brutal that's why I kind of well you know similarly that's why I didn't go after drumming because Bulls only had three this week in a week when most teams had four  and to me you're up or something aligner is that what geez I don't know I didn't look at that I wonder if you're all right so on RotoWire on the NBA section underscores there's a section called there's a link called upcoming games and you can enter the dates and you know most leagues are on Monday but if you're a different days and it shows you in a very nice simple table that you can sort by games played  it's the easiest place to find how many games your teams are playing next week and to me that you know when you're streaming games played next week's huge part of which free agents to pick up  they are they oh it's funny because in my  column I put on write a wire I think it was my my weekend update we can recap calm a guy commented because I'm like you know if you play in a head-to-head Lee  this one game week thing is a big deal if you playing a roto League where games played don't matter it's not a big deal and he's like well you know a lot of fantasy sights nowadays  have it set up so the game played really don't matter so you don't have to worry about that anymore but a lot of us are old you know my long guys that are still playing on a CBS League where you can always set your lineup once a week so right right I think that guy was saying you know you get you can do daily links  I have a life I don't daily I don't know I'm not crazy about like I feel like yeah I prefer my  set it on Monday we're all gonna have some injury risks sometimes you win out sometimes you lose  even if you have a daily League that just means okay I need a good bench now you can't it's harder to just hold a guy that's out for a month because you actually need to be rotating guys again really to max out games played right and yeah like I get it I know other folks are used daily games guy well my daily my daily League's I just set my lineup for Monday through Sunday on Sunday and let it rip and then try to check in on it occasionally make sure it's easier for us people with real jobs though I feel like daily leaks are not fair I had one job that blocked gaming sites you couldn't you know now you can do it on your phone back in the day there's another old goodness another old person story but like real jobs I couldn't even I'd wait till I get home that's not what the wife wanted me doing after I worked 11 hours at some corporate slog yeah um all right guys I'm fired up about here we go Malik Monk  always gonna score always gonna score  six times in in December  he's really he's their backup at both guard spots really red velvet has really cooled off which are even more minutes for Monk  sure love them they rely on them they need them and they're fast-paced team right so people get hung up on him not starting but  they they got to be top three in possessions let me look this up possessions per game  they were number one last year well they're down this year team positions per game  but there's their 12th but still fast paced well they'll improve that records Charlotte playing Center we don't know when Mark Williams is coming back what is going on Mark Williams is too young to be this have this many health issues yeah I don't know  I mean I don't know when he's coming back but Richards every time I look up the guy's got one to four blocks  yeah legit back up Mark Williams we've got hoping he comes back tonight I don't know why we haven't listed this game time Charlotte's one of those teams that does not help out with useful injury info back issue for Williams and he's missed it looks like roughly a dozen games  and we'll see if you returns original has been awesome filling in uh Danny mdja back-to-back double doubles double doubles in three of his last six some of those little Halo of I don't know I'm going down any shit man all right  he hit like one of those logo 3s right before the end of the quarter last game or something that was the Wizards each  he had some logos 3 that is giving like so you know love me symbol to the crowd I'm like yes the five people forced to go see the Wizards over the holidays are very happy for you Daddy nice nice job I can I give a little love to my favorite Celtic D white baby  ninth  in per game value nine category League's over the last 14 days and 15th per game for all season stats for the RotoWire ratings page and why not he's averaging two and a half stocks five point three assists which is more than alleged starting point guard Drew holiday I'm telling you it's Derek way to bring the ball up more often than holiday for the Celtic offense plus he's averaging 2.7 threes per game last year Derek white LED all guards in Block shots and this year is the first time in his career which I was shocked but I've been preaching this since the office season  this is the first year in his career he's going to see 30 plus minutes a game he's at 32.6 right now  anyway love me some D white probably too late to try to trade for him on the cheap but everyone thought I'd be buried with these stars but he's exactly the Steady Hand they need well we all thought Derek white was gonna do exactly this  and then the Celtics got Drew holiday right and then we were like rest in peace Derek white I don't think we took into consideration that Marcus Smart is gone that's right good Derek white is  yeah they're actually Finn in the back court with smart and gone it's him and Drew hey  Sam some people think houses are shooting guard because he's a 3D guy but he's really a forward Pritchard is an offensive spark but can't but they can't rely on him for long stretches on the defensive end uh and honestly watch yourself Celtics games you will see Derek white bring the ball up more often than Drew holiday they love Drew holiday but because he's a defensive master and you know bucks are the RotoWire office is in Wisconsin and they're getting mad at some holidays offensive decisions special in the playoff run and the Celtics have said we have Derek white we trust him or on the offense holiday you do what you do  well you've been there why and his rebounding and defense next to Drew holiday so leave that's why I think Celtics are the best team only Amen brother amen I agree 100% all right who else was on your house or let's discuss we already we kind of went into the Hawks forward so situation you're a jail and Johnson guy and I trust you there you talked about that but let's talk yes Center position in Chicago sir  oh Andre Drummond yeah  yeah how about that I did not see 15 points in 21.3 rebounds coming  yeah feels the two blocks  old school he beat up some nonsense some donuts squads you know hole in the middle but still he used to be a stock machine back in the day right so those Pistons days but my goodness not I did as I said earlier I didn't go all in because one role to wires got boots coming back Friday  I think is that the fifth yeah now we'll see if that actually happens or not it's it looks like you saw something where you think he's coming back next week  I mean I would not be surprised if drumming plays all three games this week and Boots sits out um but it was a three-game week for the Bulls on a week when most teams had four so I did not drive into the drum and free agency because I thought it's a one week rental to vouch comes back because it's weird  when food just played they just don't get drumming any minutes he just go you know he's back to single digit that was a hell of a one week he had her at least two more games this week you got drum and you just hang on and and get ready to jump off when Once yeah a great daily moves League pick up and enjoy the ride while you can maybe Hooch maybe they don't rush food back  I mean it's a groin injury I would I don't think they're going to rush him back but I don't know like you know all right sidebar here you remember the Cheers episode where Ted Danson did the was the temporary sportscaster in Boston and did the rap song about groin injuries right no no okay that I won't do it here my younger pod mates don't know but I was hoping my fellow old man here with no I was a clip I was a cheers casual bystander like if it was on I'd watch it I didn't have to see it all right I was all in all right sorry um I'm gonna bring up a big name like he could do much about it but Scotty  Scotty Barnes Raptors I'm never one that believes in point forwards the whole Grant Hill mythology but look Barn says prove me wrong this year last 14 days he ranks 8th and eighth category per game value he ranks 10th for the season per game value I think it's going to be interesting to see how the addition of quickly and Barrett maybe change Scotty Barnes value but like we said I think this is the rare trade that actually helps both themes in Barrett's going to enjoy a lot of catch and shoot threes from Scotty Barnes uh  and maybe a true point guard and quickly I don't know we'll see I'm not sure how this shakes out for Barnes is clear Barnes and Squad the only concern I have is Barnes is having a his career here and they're still not winning  the concern I have is Barnes is having a career year and then they get rid of OG and bring these two guys in  and now the chemistry is all changed I just don't want Scotty Barnes  to fall off a little bit because of this deal he was playing so well blocking shots doing so much  I'm just a little worried about that but not even the first round first round pick value which I don't think anybody who owns who manages him took him in the first round  no they did not  I what are your best for tonight doc  oh speaking to Derek white that I threw together before we got on the air I've got Derek white over 16 and a half points love it you want for a chat big block night that's always hit or miss man this will be the one that either wins it or lose it for me  I can't wait for this game I just think this game Celtics under ah this is gonna be awesome porzingis against hologram  I can't wait to watch this I'm so excited for tonight's game it's really fun and then Josh Getty just coming off a 20-point game seems like it's scoring is getting back on track he's going against the defensive-minded Celtics but I don't care I'm gonna over 10 and a half points  Drew over four and a half assists  I don't think  that should be a problem tonight and then porzingis over eight and a half boards against chat you clearly just be you see it sound like you should be on the over it's too forty two forty and a half  you think this is going to be a faster scoring game than Vegas has right now  um maybe  that's gonna be its I don't know I don't know but it's just bucks were supposed to score 180 or whatever and it was right under it was way underwear was supposed  yeah all right we'll see we'll see I am excited I love these like you know the rare Eastern Western Conference stuff for the teams don't know each other that well I believe this Thunder starting five hasn't played together long enough to get to know them that well I'm a classic East Coast bias I've been excited for this game for a while yeah I'm gonna watch  it what might be Blanton's worthy bourbon wise for for this game I've got I'm sticking to advice from the RotoWire new pics and Pops feature where it suggests Underdog fantasy picks as well as player props I'm taking the under I'm going negative Chris Paul is not going to get nine and a half assists tonight at home versus the magic look Paul might be starting but pods Baby Brandon podzilla I probably butchered that he's playing great and deserves more minutes  CP3 with only 4.3 dimes averaged over last three contests which are all losses for the Warriors look the future for golden state is coming up pods and Trace Jackson Davis play the kids Steve come on  and Trace Jackson Davis fall of 57 to the draft you know we're both Big Ten guys yeah I know you love your Hoosiers I don't know I don't I'm kind of pissed I'm kind of angry to Celtics didn't grab him second round they kept trading back they settled on Jordan Walsh's hasn't left the G League yet I I don't know I don't understand it did you think people viewed him as maybe too much of a traditional can't hit the corner three Center I don't know what it was I mean I watched him play all year are you last year and he was he was really really good he was dominant it's not like you could maybe it's a little age bias right because he's 23 he played you know he played the four years that the Hoosiers maybe size he's kind of undersized but today's NBA I don't know it's not an issue he I think it's the lack of three-point shooting he didn't hit a three pointer is entire college career  I think that's what they shot off about him he hasn't hit one for the Warriors yet  I think they really wanted to be because of the smaller size they're like we want stretch for us he's a traditional four well the guy named clay and another guy named Steph right they don't need their big man to be out there bombing threes yeah exactly well said I'm with you on Jim's you by the way man I love that kid his Motors at 110% all game I love it and frankly he's a great guy to watch at a bar because he's got that funky hairdo with the headband it's hard to miss him love it all right do you want to hear a quick Herb Williams story you know I do let me give the quick RotoWire plug uh folks for a free free free free try trial of

right so Herb Williams used to play for the Indiana Pacers big Center big old school Center loved him he played with Clark Kellogg they both went to Ohio State together  and you know I was local so I I kind of knew her herb knew who I was  see each other all over the place and  it was my turn there were like five of us kids  shoe kids and it was my turn to get a pair of her Williams shoes so that's happened so many times the game ends I'm staying outside the locker room and herb is nowhere to be found  and you know some of these other stories I've told the same mailman did the same thing and other guys have done that to me yeah well I'm like  start asking around the other Pacers who were just coming out of locker room I'm like you guys know where herb is and  oh yeah thank you said he's going up to the bar  you know I'm like 15 years old there's a bar at the top of Mark's Square Arena  I go up there in the bars players would go to the bar in the arena post game yeah  was it just players or their fans in there no the bars closed it was just herbs and some dude yeah so it's all right Samberg story I have a Ryan Sandberg bar story in Chicago when you're done I could call the Eagles Nest is like a rotating restaurant up there with with a bar and apparently I think it was another player might have been like Kelly trucha seriously I don't I don't know that easily yeah but I think it was another I think it was a player we were playing against anyway I get out there I go all the way up there it's like you know 11:00 at night 11:30 and a girl was cleaning up and I said hey it's her Williams in there and she's like  I don't know is that her Williams I said yeah how many six eleven gentlemen are in this part right  probably a walking stick  he's like okay yeah you know and talk to him so I can walk Waltz it over there I'm like hey Herbie's like  hey buddy what are you doing I'm like he said I could have your shoes tonight he goes oh yeah man I'm sorry I forgot he goes here you go and he hands me his set of car keys  my Blazer's down there on the third floor it's black shoes are in the back just popped the thing get the shoes days before the remote key right you've got to actually in the hole to find the right Blazer no key fob in 1984 and  so uh so I went down there found the truck open the back pulled the shoes out shut it  went back inside climbed all the way back up to the top of Mark's clearing went in there and he signed both of them and  I gave him his keys back and I mean I don't know I just thought I'd better hurry up had a few better a few Bourbons in between you run and down to the parking lot trying to find which car is his getting his shoes out right back up to the bar you're not allowed to get into I shouldn't even been in that in

was waiting for me come down you must have had a lovable mug as a 15 year old for all the free stuff you got from these players  would you like could you muster to like a tear or something to get the
