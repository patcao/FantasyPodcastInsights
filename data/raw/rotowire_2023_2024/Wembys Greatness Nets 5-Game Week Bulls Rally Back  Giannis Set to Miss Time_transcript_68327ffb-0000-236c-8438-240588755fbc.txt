hey everybody it's Steve Alexander Dr a and it is Tuesday March 5th that is Ken Crites the K train  all about  and we're gonna cover everything you need to know  in fancy Hoops the Nets are off to a five-game week  some interesting things there last night some interesting games on Monday night covered all the time games the only five game team I oh this week for sure yeah so let's do this  Ken welcome back good to see you  thank you Doctor sorry I butchered the open there was favorite thing about our Thursday shows is my cold opens because they're so  bad and unscripted and I just sort of start talking without knowing where I'm going I find them esoteric I find them to like their mind at opening  yeah yeah so  um interesting things going on right now in the NBA and I know a lot of times this season we've been like man the guys are playing through injuries and injuries aren't as bad as they have been  but right now it doesn't really feel that way and  you know the 30 deep lead that I'm in I'm playing against Andre snowing of ESPN right former RotoWire former RotoWire scribe yes and he's got Giannis sitting out last night  I have Wendy who's if he for tonight and I'm terrified and then there's a bunch of other guys that we just don't know about your guy cam Thomas has missed several games this spring angle all of last week who knows when he's going to play this week for the regular season Scotty Barnes we got your legs and Junior missed the last three I think we got DeAndre ayton who we haven't seen I haven't seen him since I've seen Ben Simmons so that's not good you never ever want to be compared to Ben Simmons and any capacity know you don't are these guys shutting down is are we in the midst of witnessing the Jaron Jackson and the DeAndre ayton shut down we are they just hurt we've been waiting for the Jaren Jackson shut down and frankly I've admired Memphis for playing him as long as they did similarly they going to bring back Desmond Bane  to prove he's healthy or not I mean they're not complain for anything  but yeah it's scary and probably too late to trade JJJ so yeah I we've been saying for weeks on Friday don't know why Memphis would keep pushing JJ On A Lost season 8  Portland's got to figure out do they want to keep spending big on 8 or not so I'm kind of surprised they're not forcing him back I don't know they don't have a reason to treat him with kid gloves right no I mean he's got a Max contract so it doesn't really matter at this point I feel like Portland would rather just watch the kids play and figure out what they've got  and you know wreath and some of these other guys in Portland's roster and Memphis roster there there are guys on there that you know some of us have never heard of like why are you a Blazers not pushing Moses Brown back I need more Moses Brown minutes we are deep into the Julie core of those teams and we're seeing it every night I think Luke Kennard had like a lesbian of the year for the Grizzlies last night yeah it was on fire for the Trailblazers been playing well for Portland Vince Vince Williams is playing pretty well for Memphis GG Jackson is making noise every now and I do not my old well we'll get to that one we get off get to the get off my lawn segment but I'm really kind of mad at it I don't know if I'm mad at Memphis or FanDuel or myself and one of them so is JJ is you're in Jackson Jr going to play again what what's your thoughts  I think he plays a handful of games but he plays more than three or four I'd be shocked  sort of where I am I these I I don't think this is the end but I think the end is nigh it is coming yeah I think the more interesting or up totally up in the air is the one by Honest situation you know he's showing up I thought he'd be on injury reports all season I thought they'd kid gloves them is he at the 65 games already yet he's got to be darn close to be lucky he's either I think he's at 50 five so I'm sure we're gonna see 10 more women by Rihanna games they're not gonna blow his rookie the year but boy  is he gonna play anything fantasy playoffs is legit concern  but people annoying people like you and Rick kamla have been saying that since day one of the NBA season and I've been wrongly right here he's gonna be a c's gonna miss two games a week blah blah blah and you know he has carried all of my teams it really has he's been the you know he's a Fantasy MVP if he's on your squad for two championship contention in all everything you know I love I love the percentages for the rookie 82% from the free throw line 47 from the field when he's like getting any help around him love the percentages and the game's played I mean everything everything about it I love the consistency you know that's 28 minutes a game and the and he does the same thing every game I'm trying to see the game log he hasn't had a single digit scoring game  since December 21st he played 22 minutes he had a seven five and five game December 21st otherwise he's been frankly above or near 20  every week since he scored at least 21 points and seven of his last nine games yeah he's blocked at least three shots in eight straight but 10 block game along with six of them six of those games he had at least five blocks last 10 games last eight games he's averaging 5.4 blocks a game delicious he scored in double figures in every game since the 26th  he scored at least 15 points in 30 straight games  he's doubled doubled in six straight  he has at least one Steel in eight straight into including two games with five steals  he's at least five assists in three straight games  and in six of his last eight games  he's in at least one three point or in 12 straight games  like so what was good yeah it's just unbelievable I wrote all that I wrote all that for the weekend recap column for Roto yeah that was pretty good the top of your head I had that all cute up but those back to back five steel five block games February 22nd 2013  well let's get into some other injuries Devin Booker out seven ten days this unsquad  not played together I don't know how they just turn it on for the playoffs they've when they're quote unquote big three of played together so few games yeah it is Royce O'Neill time right O'Neill time exactly he was my yeah he's one of our free agent picks on Friday show  yeah I had him in my life last week he was great yeah yeah is Trey young coming back this season Mr Atlanta  um  I don't think so  they might have something you know they gonna be desperate for the plan they're only two and a half up on Brooklyn the brooklands a mess  yeah by the time  by the time this is all said and done Brooklyn should be in front of Atlanta like I don't know that Atlantic can keep winning without Trey but  I you know what Brooklyn should be ahead of it Atlanta and yet they lose at home to Memphis last night that is on forgivable Unforgivable  really bad ratchet all right Westbrook dumper Brothers season they are saying hope he's back with the playoffs Scotty Barnes out for the season that is just such a bummer he was 10th and total stats value in nine category League's he was one in some people some championships  and he break his hand on Friday or something yeah he's not coming back there and obviously Raptors they're only three and a half games on the plane but they're not you know they're not playing for anything did sign Kelly Olynyk to your extension you can breathe a sigh of relief doctor you know if Pearl  I a limit could be sneaky for the end of the season I could I mean there yeah Barnes is out they're definitely minutes in that back and front Court I have a linen few weeks he is a crafty and they're committed to him yeah absolutely crafty and then he's also crappie  but she was in New York though right there are minutes in that backboard he will hit you some threes he will get you stocks he's never gonna light it up for 20 points but there are days in a little help you in their days at a clinic will make you want to stab your  eyeball with a pencil when he was drafted by the Celtics they were briefly selling a Linux the clinic flip-flops and I always regret that they didn't buy those  the clinic with all wise like the Olympic name but yeah  um I don't think I don't think we're gonna see Trey Young play in a regular season game against why didn't they move Murray  were they offers that terrible I don't yeah I just don't think that offers were there and you know now it sounds like they're more open the movie trade than it is Murray then they are Murray you know if they were playing well they're better recently yeah that would sound great but Murray is not exactly grabbing the leadership role of young out so far is he  their do they have unwatchable like yeah the Hawks are and  they get the Knicks tonight in New York that's that's not gonna be good three and a half on your tickets so that yours are we jumping ahead to your bet is that you're you're taking next three and a half  no I was gonna go I was gonna talk about the Bulls last night for a second okay yeah please please talk about how much I love Kobe White  what a free Kobe what agree me and he is um I was like that last night I mean what do you shoot like did he miss a Shot 14 of 19 he didn't score in the first quarter you know 39 talk about teams that really should be chastised for doing nothing at the trade deadline how do the Bulls not move Andre Drummond how do they not you know people like Caruso's contract how do you not match Caruso to some contracts you want off the books and admit you're going to rebuild mode that Bulls team is going absolutely nowhere it is fun that they shocked the kings in Sacramento but the Kings have their own problems but Kobe White  they should just give him all the millions minutes he can't he's one of the few people that you know few players with a future there right  yeah and 37 points crew High 37 on 19 shots seven times two he wasn't just talking on the ball  no he was playing hard and you know I've got I've got him on that 30 Team league along with the Aaron Fox and those two  I need those too and wimpy to carry that team and when we can win it all if they keep  they keep playing well so  I and you went into a little bit of a slump last week that was difficult but he's a he's back you just love the hair it's really about the hair for you isn't it with well it's usually about the hair with most NBA with Bobby Portis is all about the eyes crazy it was the point guard for the he was the dude for the magic that had the crazy hair the point guard oh the flopped in front of his face yeah lottery pick two oh drive me crazy because I'm like he was shooting like 39% from the field and he had that hair in his eyes like  mine only one that sees how bad a shooter I cannot remember that's gonna kill I'll think of it 2 a.m. how do we not know what his name is I know exactly he was speaking of he had the floppy hair and you look that up we'll move on to the Panic meter I know his name oh go ahead oh no when you say I'm sorry but I'll go panic meter if you want to look it up  I want to beat up the Nets more for losing to Memphis at home that is just  inexcusable you got Vince Williams leading the way from how do you lose to a team  prevent Vince Williams is their best player unless you want to say Santee  dad Jemison at Center  banged up conchar plan 30 minutes Luke Kennard is your star shooting guard for the Grizzlies lineup  Lamar Stevens getting 24 minutes  since he'll come out there just dominating Brooklyn just clearly I don't think the head coach was the problem in Brooklyn it's a deeper issue what is going on Alfred Payton by the way Alfred Payton yes remember and he kind of taught was like a front ponytail it kind of tied it into a bob but it would it would literally get in front of his face yeah yeah I'll pay lottery pick two he was a lottery pick wasn't I think so desperately needed a point guard  yeah Brooklyn beat the Hawks in back-to-back games at least  I had schroders my picked a click last night over on 14 and a half points and he took 13 shots  he missed two of three free throws and anyway shot five of 13 hit the under broke my seven game bets streak  Shredder's automatic right now like he's playing well he's 37 minutes I mean cams out Kim Johnson Kim Johnson played very well last night finally finally how many teams dropped cam Johnson this fantasy season but Johnson's finally turned tool too late is it is it maybe the cam Camp play When the games are meaningful  Maybe  but I think I hopefully a lot of people picked him up and Andrew and everybody else who plays for them this week because the five games yeah yeah exactly no cam Thomas yeah  I played cam in some leaks even though I knew he wasn't gonna play last night because he had five rather take us four games hopefully and some other gays three you've got Brunson listed on your Panic meter not his game time decision tonight that ankle injury looked worrisome  before we go there also Dorian Finney Smith and yes DFS is worth having for the rest of this week for four games on Bronson yes he scared me to death I'm I'm in a battle  I got beat by my buddy Brian from Guster last week five to four in a battle with Yuri he was also hosted this show with me and I need Bronson to play so I never miss about the week  yeah now maybe they're eyeing at Atlanta and think we can take Atlanta without the Knicks I'm sorry without Bronson but  the next I mean there they are game and a half out of falling into the play and they're lucky and Beads out for the Sixers  I don't know if anyone believes in the magic but a little bit of panic meter they've three and seven over their last 10  so the one hand you can see them forcing Bronson back early  I mean it is Tom Thibodeau right maybe like oh you can't walk we'll just put some dirt on it and get out there how are we about Giannis is Achilles the word Achilles always freaks me out he was stretching and then decided not to play last night and they still won by the way it is a word that will freak people out  um it freaks me out I don't think honest is in serious danger right now but I'm always a little worried about his knee  he seems like he's always a little gimpy  but I think I think yeah tonight off yeah it's exhausting a team that started work really is and any other Panic guys before we get on the players or folks are excited about I don't think we really finished on Wendy we got into his greatness but um but yeah I'm are you now to the point where you know he's got sore left shoulder he's questionable for tonight are you thinking they're gonna stop him right at 65 games and be done with it well I mean  if you're a Wemba on a manager what are your options right I mean you're going to have to you got to play them  so yeah I can be worried about it but like on your whim be teams you got a good backup center you're going to play instead even if he plays one less game  no right when you plays one game I'm playing wimpy right you get you might get five blocks and five steals  you know yeah and one at 11 yeah yeah like okay I'll take one week I think he he's definitely gonna play 65 he's at 55 now  they're going to get him Rookie of the Year on hers  who knows about the shoulder but like back to backs maybe not I don't know it's too late no one's trading went no trade deadlines were passed all the trade deadline so hopefully there's not yeah there's not too many back-to-backs in  San Antonio schedule but I haven't really looked at I'm scared to look at it honestly I'm just I'm just setting my 30 D lineup one week at a time and rolling with it hoping for a miracle but three games three yeah three more games after he's already missed two boy and it's knee ah that is scary the giving them plasma injections that's never a good sign  and Cleveland is sitting pretty  I could quarrel and Sam Merrill right like those are the guys yeah well I could Coral can't shoot to save his life I'd rather go Merrill on the crazy upside that he drains 6 threes but Cleveland has you know they're four they're sorry five games out of the plane rest Mitchell you don't go anywhere in the playoffs without Mitchell so  he's gonna get a ton of rest  unfortunately  you know going back to the Knicks for a second  what what a crazy year they've had to survive losing Julius Randle trading for only he immediately goes down  and they have quickly and he didn't immediately go down because he looked great for them for about five or six games right what a perfect trade and then he gets her yeah it was pretty quick it was pretty quick yeah and then heart of them to get a chew in that you know in that deal because they they were thin in the back court now they're throwing a gazillion minutes and I'm deeply precious that she was a fine pickup in a deeply yeah and and they've had heart and Stein out for a while and a now they got Bronson banged up but yet they're still  putting a good product on the floor every night and people people are dating it so right the old here's my only qualm with the Nexus how everyone was like oh the Knicks won the trade deadline because they got locked Donovan Burke's oh yeah those guys were lighting it up for Detroit they were really scary let's go excited about these awesome former Pistons didn't the Knicks pay to get rid of Berks to Detroit a couple of years ago I mean like I there were fine trades they gave up nothing but like the classic New York overhype all the Nicks are amazing they're gonna win the finals they just got back Donovan's please spare me New York media me what I thought the guy on your Panic meter here Daniel Gafford was one of the keys to trade that line I thought Gafford and PJ Washington going to play with Luca was gonna be huge but  they haven't they haven't they're not really using Gafford like I thought they would well they're torn right they want to give Lively a bunch of minutes to develop him  and gaffer man he's had some totals for them and he had some sweet games even coming off the bench I don't I don't know if it's a I don't know what the problem was with gaffer does he never gonna be a quality 65 game guy a year I mean he's been a fantasy darling forever  I don't understand you think he'd be ecstatic to be on a winning team get out of Washington  but the last few Duds he had for the maps are so frustrating but they're not and they're not playing they're playing they're playing Lively yeah he had a few good bench games though for the Lively starting and then he just fell apart I don't know we'll see he'll when he's out there in reality I mean he's still protecting the rim and getting rebounds and playing defense he's not doing he's not putting up numbers and no he's not so he's unfortunate I had him as a starting center on a lot of squads and I'm putting Andre Drummond and who's also was a dead last night even though they won you know Romans all match up heavy whether they're playing a big team or not  you know how when you look at a team and their schedule and it shows the leader  in point three mountains in assists yeah yeah off to the side it's all nonsense it's all good right every game every time you never know there was anybody else on that team not just 41 nonsense 33 nonsense 45 down 30 30 10 9 8 7 0 that's why guessing on the others like Derek Jones and Josh Green is so darn frustrating right because there is no consistent other on that darn team  let's get happy though who are guys you're excited about Steve you already mentioned one  well I was very excited about keyonte George  last night and he played six minutes and illness took over and he didn't play the rest of the night so I had  I had a really rough night in FanDuel and all Society George and Jalen Brunson on that Yahoo team so I need Jalen to played in that I don't know if it's gonna happen but you know Dorian Finney Smith I've been kind of excited about just five game week this week counting George I feel like he's gonna blow up the rest away for Utah  your guy Dennis Schroder  probably gonna go off rest away because yeah Ben Simmons  and it's another scary injury Tomah you talk Kessler out again with a foot they're playing Collins at Center he got six blocks last night digging the John Collins minutes Center  but boy is Kessler been frustrating all year I dumped I I traded him on a few teams I was a big fan of the preseason  and I got out about the All-Star break on the shares I had  I would say he's probably the the biggest bust in fantasy this year  and fantasy I thought you're gonna say it's Center but wowing fan okay I mean he was like third round value last year right about him coming in this year and they're playing like 17 minutes and I some stretches and  he's not really a part of the offense I was he does his block shots  I don't understand what they're doing with him  and he's one of many big as a can't hit free throws which is frustrating too all right but on the pot you want to talk miles McBride  well I just I miles Bryant's gonna be the guy of brunson's time so yeah if Ronson is out this week and you picked up miles from bride  I think you're going to win and if Brunson plays all week miles would Pride can be tossed back into the ocean for  whatever you can find  one player that's passing the eyeball test for me I think he's finally healthy is Trey Murphy in New Orleans three straight really good games I was nagging Alex writer Editor to improve his rest of season projection on RotoWire I will say Alex came back to me with a bunch of reasons why he doesn't think that should be but I think Murphy is finally healthy off of that knee injury they have no scoring Off the Bench in New Orleans I think Trey Murphy it's on the upswing he's rostered about 2/3 of team so it's not like he's wildly available but in Daily stuff I like Trey Murphy rest of season he's got a lot of confidence right now too I like to think he's saying I like the way he looks on the court my son was like me and Trey Murphy's been going off lately and he has and  that New Orleans team is kind of sneaky and it it really is it something you're always wonder like why aren't they doing better the Macomb gets hurt or Ingram gets dinged up but if we go back to the standing Pelicans you know they're out of the plan they're only a game and a half out of the plan but they are 5th right now and with the banged up Sons team they could be looking at the plan and doing some damage we'll see I'd like to see them on a big stage for once yeah herb Jones had some really really great games and Brandon Ingram is actually State healthy this season  herb Jones is that guy you hate when you're facing them but you'd love to have them on your team you know Grindr he should be on Memphis  yeah he's okay he's like a nice a nice path of yeah a Kinder gentler path all right well you know The Statler and Waldorf of RotoWire podcasts  it's time for the get off our lawn segments Stadler Waldorf of course being the two balcony Muppets the old guys in the balcony complaining Steve what is your complaint  I was kind of slacking on watching the news  yesterday before I set my  before I sent my lineups and didn't handle the wired daily lineups page did not check the daily did not check the daily page like I should have and FanDuel told me that Jordan Goodwin was good to go and he was gonna have like 29 Points  I looked at his game log he's been balling out he's like 31 301 30 or something and I'm like well I'm playing Jordan Goodwin tonight I threw him in there  checked I kept checking FanDuel like other bearings Scottie Pippen and some weird two-way contract thing even though they desperately need his minutes yeah Goodwin's been a guy a point I kept checking it you know checking to make sure his name didn't turn yellow or red before lineup locked he was good  then I get in there it's like he's not playing  and then I look finally I look at the RotoWire news feed and it's like Jordan Goodwin is not active for the Grizzlies tonight after starting last three games and here's his word we almost never write this we just have him as inactive we didn't have a reason there was no public reasons it active  and I don't I don't get it I get it I don't get it so I had a zero it might be another same thing they got with Pippin it might be another two-way contract juggling game counts  I you know that they're doing that to Pippin but just no reason unless it just inactive but they didn't send him to the jelly like he was no but inactive but if you don't I thought it only counts if you actually see the court your game count if you're just sitting yeah I don't know bench I yeah anywho you were right to plan I mean 30 plus minutes each of the last three games eight assists and two of those contests see his FanDuel points were 31 31 and a half and 30 and a half the last three games you were onto something well and another guy in another guy in our league had him and I'm guessing a lot of people on FanDuel probably had him in their lineup last night so that was check the RotoWire daily lineups page before locking in your lineups it is the most popular page on rotowire.com  well I will be doing that this evening  for my get off our lawn segment I'm just gonna promote the old man rant I did on Friday they got posted today on the on this the RotoWire fantasy basketball  I dared to question if Kobe really needs three statues stock oh Jordan has won Bill Russell has won does Kobe really need three classic La over dramatic wow one Statue is fine bring on the bring on the Kobe worshipers well I'm gonna kill me it's fine yeah you you might want to yeah Dominic only has one Statue all right right that's pretty good yeah one statues fine  huh  Kobe sensitive and now I don't like talking about Kobe like like Michael Scott in the dinner party episode when when Jan tells the story about how he runs through the glass Chasing Ice Cream Truck he's like  he's like I don't like that story baby  to Victor Vasquez who called Alfred Payton right away in the fan notes we probably should answer some questions but Victor had Alfred Payton right away and we missed it because you and I were looking at our notes and stuff and that do we want to do fan questions or should we do our bets for tonight first let's see bets and we don't have any ads dream today so that's right time I'll start because I picked mine early this morning you were wise to wait for for lineups and stuff but I've got the over on Josh Hart for 26 and a half points plus rebounds versus your Atlanta Hawks Steve again Bronson questionable for tonight clearly they'll need scoring elsewhere if there's no Bronson last six games though for Josh Hart a 16 and a half points 12 and a half rebounds that's 29 total  and maybe more importantly classic Thibodaux he's played 40 or more minutes in each of those last six games the Knicks again three of seven their last 10 they're a bit of a panic mode so I think Josh Hart will once again get crazy minutes and we'll hit the over on 26 and a half points plus rebounds  doc what is your bet for tonight sir well I like what you did there because I was at the Atlanta Hawks game when Luka doncic scored 74  points against them I think  yeah no defense the Hawks have been giving it up all year the only thing I worry about is hearts a better rebounder these a score but you got rebounds in there so you should be you should be good to go with that heart does have the occasional terrible shoes you're absolutely sure about that you life I thought you liked uh just you had some win loss pics you wanted to make right well I'm going with I'm going with Luke and Don's against the Pacers tonight okay all the Luca because the Pacers could be a Wilt Chamberlain like the only team that plays worst defense in Atlanta is the Pacers and Luke is going to be fired up to go out there and just run all over them hopefully he plays he's kind of if he is a game time decision they've been doing that a lot right where they call him yeah where is that game that's kind of in Dallas in Dallas so it's it's at home so he's not like trying to  make sure he plays the one time he's in the Indiana yeah they've already been in the Indiana so that's that makes me a little nervous but 53.5  points three rounds in the assist  give me all the Lucas you're literally placing your BET right now you're putting it I just locked it in yeah fabulous all right my heart pet in before the call all right that's nice well shall we go to fan questions sir I'll pick a few  I think we kind of covered this early Doc is a time to panic on JJ and heart and Stein  short answer for me yes  hardest times heard again right well I was gonna say I think he's no he's paying attention to him  he he's played the last two games he has no injury designation now he's only played the bigger problem last five he's only averaged 21 minutes with only five points and six boards One stock over the last five games so he's  uh is that because they love they love Precious and chewing that much they don't love them that much they don't have enough  that  I don't know they don't the bigger problem has been an Achilles issue there's that word again and so I think they've been nursing him but I think heart and sign is certainly droppable you can't just outright cut JJ he's just too good when he plays but it is getting a little scary  it is panic time I think the only thing we can hope with Triple J is that when he gets shut down they tell us that they're actually shutting him down  which they probably won't do that right they probably could have done that three games ago and we would  but he's still listed his day today I mean he just have to  I mean I've been telling people to trade Triple J two three months so there's nothing you can really do about it at this point other than hang in there and hope his Achilles works better than my voice does or no he's gonna hit or something or an elbow know he's just Achilles hartenstein hardest times Achilles but what about JJJ oh yes sorry he's got something else  like this is a hit or something in it  this is a terrible losing season quadricep Quadra slide  so yeah that's I always predicted it was going to be a sore back yeah they can't say losing record that's sounds terrible all right let's move on Paul has a trade he wants us to he's offered Cunningham and even chenzo or he's been offered Cunningham and Steven chenzo for his Simon's and Kobe White  ants had a very nice game against the Timberwolves the last night  has any kind of extended issue you really want to even chenzo  are we worried about Cunningham finishing up season for the Pistons  no I think after last year's injuries they want to play him as much as possible but  he says he's punting field goal and turnovers but I feel like these guys are all Phil Gould wrists I don't know who you know I I think I like the Simon's Kobe side of this a little better  yeah Simon says a lot to play the rest of the season if he's healthy Kobe white should be getting insane minutes  Cunningham's  counting stats are fine but is overall fantasy value  ranking is always weird it's always low percentage of CEOs he says nine category yeah and I don't like no you stay he's planning percentage in teos so I guess that works for guys who shoot the ball four guys you kind of do the same thing I don't really know right what the point of this trade is It's seems like yeah you'd be throwing in a big in a point guard  yeah I don't get it all right let's move on thoughts on the max Drew injury so  is he a hold or should I drop him for Reef uh finding mistake in the playoff race trying trying to guess trying to guess the first read yeah we kind of Desperately find out more about this Mac Street injury sometimes he has the radar he hasn't missed a game in the last this A's dealing with a knee strain and he is out for tonight tonight's game against the Celtics he had played 20 plus straight games so this is certainly a new situation it's the first of a back-to-back this could just be a maintenance as you I think I hold on to screws  Reef trying to like I wish I could tell you when that when they're going to force 8 in the play again or stick with wreath has no value of eating his playing 30 minutes a game  and I mean if you can drive through some pickup guy pick up a net that's still has four games left the week  there I don't think that's a bad idea  there you go I mean Max streams is nice but if there's other guys on her way for that do the same stuff and have rather have a healthy one and then Max truce amen all right let's see sessions wait here we go one more is drumming a drop in a 12 team head-to-head look here's the thing with Drummond it all depends with their plan their plan a big Squad he gets monster minutes and monster stats when he's playing a team that goes small he doesn't see the court  it all depends on your other options do you have any more thoughts on Drummond doc I feel like every time I think about playing drum and  don't he goes bananas  and if I do something with him he does nothing if the other team has a legit Center and a legit Power Forward by legit I mean six nine plus was skills  then he's playing and getting stats but when they're going small like last night's game he did nothing absolutely nothing I forgot who they who they Clippers Clippers don't have a real power forward so they don't play  but that was the game a couple games ago where he just went absolutely nuts and it was 26 rebound game yeah yeah he was at again because they started I think it was the Bulls  no he's the boys yeah I'm trying to remember that game that here I give me a second yeah it was but it was a team that had a real Center and a real power played a big and they move much power forward which I kind of like frankly but his Orlando uh Cleveland know it's Cleveland Mobley and out  you know too legit big so they went big and German put up 17 points and 26 boards  but when they wanted Sacramento Sacramento doesn't have a legit power forward so they went small to match it I don't know who they play next but just check the Bulls schedule I see bigs are not yeah we got Utah on Wednesday  Hendricks Center and Kessler they're going Kessler  um marketing but they're not playing yeah so he's gonna have and then it's golden state but he'll be on the pine for that too they don't have a legit and it's  next three he's not gonna get big minutes now Monday March 11th against Dallas  Mike you might get something there they've got enough big guys that he might he might play against them I don't know yeah all right  all right well I I think that might be it for today's show sir should we do one last one last question let's do one last question one last question oh and then oh wait we didn't mention you've got a fabulous brush with greatness we're entering with oh all right yeah two questions and we'll get them a new bowls  um I'm planning field goals the air teams planning free throws I give up Giannis Shang Yoon in France Wagner  getting Katie hardened and Bam out of Bio dude this makes my head hurts I need to spreadsheet it's really hard on the fly to evaluate a 16 trade  honest you know what if you got us Achilles is a they're trying to balance his minutes and games this might make sense it's not like Katie's been a Cal Ripken this season but  no Katie hardening Ada or playing every day  we don't know about Yana's  but  that's a lot man I mean that's a big trade  I would I would need like an hour to full  my tendency is to take the hardened Katie side of this uh just because I'm worried about Janice's Achilles  and I I like that I mean I know those guys are going to play every night like Katie Hardin I had a bios I'm probably probably with you on on that one okay so Ken wants to hear my Manute Bol story  so in like  1980 something very early my brother and I were down at the hotel in Indianapolis  ahead of the Washington Bullets game and  Manute Bol came a Waltzing through the  lobby of the hotel my brother had his camera with him  and I said Manute can I get my picture taken with you  because he's so tall and I was  not very tall at the time as Ken said when he saw the picture he's like oh my God is this really you you look so young and the new waved me off and said no no pictures  I don't like cameras mind he said something like  it'll steal part of my soul or something but I don't think he's  I don't know what the Sudanese culture is for photos I don't know like there's there's there's stuff out there about like flash bulbs and cameras and he did not want his picture taken so I'm standing there next to my brother's like out in front of us and I'm over there going  take it  my brother's like goes off and and can also said when he saw the picture boy Manute doesn't look very happy in that picture  and it was not happy in fact he was so unhappy that he took off running after my brother my brother my brother ran up the escalator stairs he's like running behind him  going up the escalator after him and I'm just like oh crap I gotta get out of here and I like I like slip out the back door and we reunited later and of course had to wait like a week to find out of the picture came out you know that's what you did I feel cameras with actual film back that yeah the photo mat yeah things turned out and I'll tell you what it it's it's one of my favorites it's right up there with the with the Dion picture I think you got a frame you got a frame the picture of you a minute even though it's a little dark it's not I can't find the original so I have is like pictures of the picture yeah is that what you sent me a picture of the picture okay yeah I don't know where the actual photo is you know I don't have the negatives where they used to give you negatives when you got  never organized enough to keep track of my negative Manute catch her brother  no  never did he got away he was he's just he like really what is he doing if he catches your brother he's gonna smash the camera I think he was gonna take the camera  take the film  or just tell him that was not cool why did you take my picture I told you not to oh I didn't understand you Mr ball I'm sorry you look you look good in this photo though you look pretty happy oh dude I was I
