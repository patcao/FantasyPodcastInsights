a new year to look forward to we've got for me a concert to look forward to Doc I don't know what you're doing on New Year's Eve but you know how was Christmas for you saw the you got the the golf video game I know you're psyched about that I know your Vibe and right now dude I worried well I'll tell you what Rick I took I took yesterday off yesterday was my birthday I said a fan to a lineup  wrote some stuff and then just pack it in I didn't watch any Hoops last night I did catch up on all of it today and it looks like I didn't miss a whole lot it was a dud night in the NBA so I'm kind of glad I took the night off and and I was out celebrating my birthday and playing Golden Tee in the bar with my boys Golden Tee Golf and then we get home from dinner and I walk into my family room and there's a Golden Tee machine sitting in my house that I did not know was coming so pretty cool birthday surprise I mean stay that may have stayed up a little bit too late last night playing yeah I'm pretty psyched about it the people that have been watching me for a while know that I'm kind of obsessed with a golden teeth so pretty cool birthday well hanging out with you and living with you for a minute in Atlanta I knew that you were big with that game I like playing Golden Tee as well um although you are you're you're a Golden Tee sicko I'm just a Golden Tee casual so happy belated birthday dude and shout out to Casey for getting you that amazing  gift so let's press on here and talk some reality and some fantasy basketball and some Dynasty basketball in a moment here for the people with the ogs on the road of wire fantasy basketball podcast doc I want to start talking MVP because it was a dog night in the NBA and I don't feel like complaining about Donovan Mitchell missing three and a half weeks with an illness okay I don't want to go down that road what are you doing playback I got it off my chest okay I got it off my chest um doc who's your MVP right now and I want to give you and the people the odds here and I'll certainly Alpine Joel embed right now is plus 225 on DraftKings Nicolas yolk gets plus 275 Luka doncic's plus 450 Shane guilds and Alexander plus 550 Giannis antetokounmpo plus 1200 Tatum is plus 2500 fox plus 3500 Hallie is a plus 4,000 with Kevin Durant book is it 4,500 and bronze is it 7000 and I stopped counting but I think I remember Anthony Davis being disparaged at a plus 8,000 who's your MVP right now Doc and who would you bet on  well  it's a loaded question it's a tough question the sick the Boston Celtics are in first place right in the east  to me I think if I'm betting right now and giving those numbers I think I'm going Jayson Tatum to climb between now and the end of the year Boston keeps winning the Boston wins the East  it's going to be hard to not  vote for Tatum and as MVP the MVP right now as far as I can tell just from how he's played this season it's probably Joe Allen bead that's probably why he's the favorite if I personally had a vote right now I think I would vote for my guy Luca because he's doing you know a sixth place job for the Mavericks with himself and four guys you would pick up off the street basically Kyrie has not been there he's playing with the rookie Center that nobody has ever heard of until you know well they've heard of him but Derek live with he's not a household name he was not a big fan of the guy and you know they pull Dante Exum  you know off the off the wiring Europe and he's he's a huge part of what they're doing they're doing Junior having a career here because he's playing with Luca I think the fact that the Mavericks are 18 and 13 I kind of thought they'd be 13 and 18 at this point so I feel like Luca is a one-man wrecking Crews probably the best player in fantasy if you just look at the county stats  your music pardon me I love that answer because it's completely different from mine so why I shouldn't say completely different because you did give Joel and beat some love I would bet on three and a half or four guys here the bets from your Joel embiid plus 225 to me he is the MVP right now and I'll go into some of the rationales in a minute um Luca and a plus 450 I think it's a great BET right now the way he's playing you laid it out very very well um I thought that his odds would be a little bit tighter with impulse when I went to look at it today and it was a nice separation there and I think that's a look the voters want to vote for him there's been all this Buzz about him winning the award in the media for like three years now usually he enters the season at the top of the betting books with the best stats to win or it's him and Janice like one in two and now yolk at you of course um and so there's already been a movement which has not been paid off it's been a tease for Luca but if you can actually have a substantial uh you know MVP resume here where the Luca lovers can't be like delusional and like no he's actually got a case this year so um in the media votes on this okay so that is very much in uh Luke's favorite here I really like Luca at a plus 450 again and beat a plus 225 and then SGA to plus 550 I definitely think he's top five in the MVP race right now but this is the first time he's been in this race that's usually a problem with the voters he they're gonna have to win 60 games he's going to have to you know maintain these averages maybe take them up a little bit choose past the Lucas and pass the beats in The Usual Suspects so that's not a play for me Janice at a plus 1200  is the best value on the entire board right now the best value on the board um we're getting value I think a little bit within bead who won it last year leading league and scoring is going 35 12 and 6 for the love of God um and we you know we talked about these guys be honest it's right there and these odds don't speak to him being right there Janice gets tons of Oats always everybody loves him everybody understands how great he is and how valuable he is to his team and I don't really think that the Damian Lillard thing is going to create a dragon on the voting I haven't heard that narrative all I can't vote for honest cuz he's got Damian Lillard now I have not heard that okay um I haven't heard it for any of these guys you know sort of that who he's playing with thing when you get to Booker and Durant I think they dragging each other a little bit LeBron and Davis I think they drag on each other a little bit for the MVP but not honest so ioannis at a plus 1200 and then LeBron had a plus 7,000 if you just want to throw ten bucks 20 bucks on it and hope um because it is a whole bet but I don't think he's dead in the MVP race  he's in his 21st season he's gonna turn 39 like today or tomorrow um and so the age narrative will be strong and if he can somehow get the Lakers on a heater to go to the top of the standing he'll be right back in the MVP race these houses go from plus 7,000 like plus 1500 okay so I think now is a really good time to get in on LeBron but impeach my guy right now Doc just just check this out for a second these numbers and what's going on with indeed are are really really fun again 35 12 and 6  I would like you all his statues when's the last time a center did that okay I'd like to see that yoke and hasn't done that I believe it's Wilt okay it's always will but indeed is 3512 and 6 with two blocks doc 1.2 steals 54.35 89 splits and check this out man this is probably the coolest in bead of all by the way Phillies 21 and 930 in the East hanging in there nicely um Joelle and bead has more points 874 then minutes played 854 this season the only guy to do that is Wilt back in his famous 6162 season Doc is I look at it right now Joel and Beads got a clear lead over the rest of the pack and they're going to have to go get him and I'm not sure they're going to be able to  yeah I mean that's why the odds are are the way they are I mean if you if you bet on him beat the payouts not going to be  that huge because everybody thinks he's going to win the MVP speaking of Dame Lillard what a what a disaster yesterday you did not see Dame go for 12 and 4 when he was with Portland it never happened but it seems like it happens once a week in Milwaukee the other thing I find very interesting about these odds  is where are your Minnesota Timberwolves where is Anthony Edwards where's where's cat I mean that teams 22 and 7 in first place in the west no one saw it coming No One Believes it's happening apparently because their guys are not even in the running for MVP this point but Anthony Edwards name is gonna be there at the end if Minnesota keeps going well it's it's a really good question Doc and I don't like I do an MVP top 10 and Ant-Man let me see here is he in my time I think he's like eight or something like that where do I have Ant-Man I've got him right now at 7 okay um my my MVP top 10 goes and bead honest SGA Luca yokich Tatum in a virtual time but I got yoka should five Tatum at 6 7:00 so Edwards is there the problem is Doc he doesn't have an MVP stat line all of these other guys have an MVP stat line SGA Luca and bead um Giannis yokich and that's the reason why I've Tatum it's six right now or five and a half is because his numbers have come down with porzingis there and the numbers are great okay these numbers have won MVPs before but we're in a very stacked crazy era of the NBA I mean a beach on 30 Frick 5 Points a game okay this is hard and stuff Kobe stuff Jordan stuff okay um and Edwards is a 25  so it's a great question doc but that's why Edwards is going to have to hit a heater and get that scoring average up to 28 or 29 or he doesn't even really have my attention for MVP the only reason I've got him on here a doctor it's because of the record and and to win every P you've got to have the balance between the record and the stats and his is imbalance right now he's got the record but he does not have the stats  okay yeah I like it and you know don't discount Luke is scoring he's right there behind him beat and and Luca is hitting four triples a game he hit 12 free throws here not I haven't I haven't heard people ripping  you know usually when you hear all the good things Luca does it's following up immediately by he can't hit free throws he's always hurt and he turns the ball over but you never really heard too much of any of that what you've heard is oh he had 50 points 15 dimes six assists four steals three blocks and eight triples on Christmas day so you you forgot you guys like me complaining about all the slapping of his thighs after raping every Miss shot and all the complaining to the rest which is it's one of the it's one of the worst looks in the NBA man you're such a phenomenal player I and I get lobbying the rest LeBron does it all the time but it's just it's so childish yeah all the whiny faces in the hands out and it's it's gross I mean  like like he's been better with it this year though I have but like it but he still does it I mean but it's just a bad look man you're bad look um so and speaking about looks you know who you want to blame for the game last night is Jack Bond no pardon me it's not even a jackpot thing I take it back so I like JV it's then that's medical team because you saw what was happening last night they showed  all of these main dudes okay Jalen Wilson the Kansas kid had a decent game and all that kind of stuff so I they literally forfeited a game that was a scrimmage or a scrimmage for the Milwaukee Bucks last night Doc and so I I wouldn't trip on that Dame had 30 plus on Christmas that was Adrian Griffin was like yo we literally tonight can put on a jockstrap in tennis shoes and we're gonna win this basketball game and so let's do that no they don't wear jockstraps anymore um Dynasty question Doc and you go first on this one man it is Rick kamla it is Steve Alexander he's doctor a I'm the freak worthy were the ogs here and so blessed to be on the road a while platform here um Dynasty question for you DOC for the president in the future who would you rather have is an asset on your team Jaime Hawkins junior or Brandon Paul jenske  boom wow oh yeah I hate you in the store like Draymond Green to Steven Adams Kickin it between the uprights you know I had a I had Brian from Guster on Tuesday  and I said I'm a hockey as he goes Oh I thought his name was Jaime jaquez and that's good that's right it's funny like that it was it was pretty good and then he of course he tried to say pageant after that and it was a disaster so what do you say pod zemsky is that what he said God damn ski  dude it's a great question I I think just from the eye test I love both of those guys and me too it took me a minute to come around on hog heads just because I was worried about Jimmy Butler coming back I was worried about Tyler hero coming back I was worried about the minutes but man I feel like coach SPO loves how many Hawkins and I feel like all the Heat players love I mean because I feel like that dude is the leader of this team right now as a rookie they need him out there for 30 minutes a night you know they need me on that wall you that old lady like they need him out there um and I think just because the heat are so solid and we know what they do and we they were but they were in the finals last year and this kid is coming along and taking it such a leadership role so quickly I'm gonna go with Hawk has but the Warriors are kind of  a mess right they kind of are looking for an identity right now they really don't know what's happening but Jem ski is become a leader on that team hustle points Tommy points he does it all I love that kid but I'm gonna go with hocus  you just hit me with a Tommy Point reference which I absolutely love it's a shout out to the lake great Tommy Hodson on the Boston Celtics broadcast remember and and I remember doc the time he used to love given Delonte West Tommy point he would get Tommy points all the time the long day you  get time used to  oh I love you walked up for Walter McCarty yeah Tommy Hines and like literally like the best remember him crushing the rest you've got to be kidding me that was the worst call and get some glasses for this rep right like in the game broadcast it was so freaking good man he was the most Homer of the Homer  played by play guy you'd ever asked for but he was he was awesome even if you didn't like to sell Celtics  it was so fun listening I mean he was just like he just passed out I mean he just absolutely melted down it was hilarious man phenomenal in the league office probably like oh my god Tommy shut off your banging on her reps all the time they don't like it when broadcasters do that it's like a total No-No okay you don't hear anybody banging on wrestling that nobody Tommy Hansen um and by the way Hall of Fame coach Hall of Fame player and so he's got that Grace um all right let me answer this question here doc with a with a shout out to Tommy up above um my answer was hockey as well  and it does create a game of tennis in my brain I'm not like 100% hot kids here but I am on August my man Jaime Hawkins Junior popped for 31 and 10 on Christmas Day it made 11  shots okay like hello if you hadn't been noticing what I've been doing and listening to Rick kamla scream my Praises all year long because doctor I just wasn't quite listening I'm kidding um now is your time to feast and behold the greatest of Jaime Hawkins Junior on the season the stat line does not wow you but the stat line involves a lot of bench games and a lot of games early in the year when he was playing 18 15 right he's been a 30 minute guy for like a long time now so this is the season stat line 14 for and two one steal one three 50 to 38 86 that's what's to be excited about right there the efficiency as a rookie 5238 86 my man is flirting with 5490 as a rook okay um and here's the big difference for me long-term with hot guys versus gemski  Hawkins might morph from role player to Star level player when Jimmy Butler age is out because Bam's going to be there for a long time Jimmy's approaching his mid-30s and he can't play forever as you mentioned the heat absolutely love Jaime hockey as Junior it's documented okay he's already there fourth most important player deal with that okay behind of course they're big three fourth most important player is a rookie by the way in his second month on the job and so I feel like Hawk has that ability to go from role player to Star level player doc I feel like Austin reads has that ability as well out in La I think when LeBron age is out and that's a long long time from now um that Austin Reeves is a 25 and 5 guy and he gives you those lines from time to time but he doesn't live there okay because he's got LeBron there but I think Reeves will be a 25 guy and maybe even more than that one LeBron Lee's put Jim ski is a curved guy and and hand picked by Steve Kerr and please don't get a twisted and give Mike the only Junior all the credit for this so okay her has the loudest voice in that world I promise um and he handpicked poach and that's why he's playing him okay uh you know over Wiggins oh he's coming off the bench remember play Thompson had a couple of games were came and took some of his minutes look mad current loves this dude but doc I wonder if poage always stays in the role player glue guy dream on we found a role in a lane for you and you're not going to deviate from that link and we're gonna we're gonna you you need to be your role player for us and you're not gonna pop as a star level player for us and so when the Splash Brothers age out I just fear that they're going to go big game hunting get a bigger dude in there and pose will still be this like gritty Plucky fan favorite glue guy you know what I'm saying I think hockey says more long term upside then then your guy poach man um so let's move on here doc let's talk about the Detroit Pistons  for a minute how are you processing 27 straight losses for the D12 estonians well you can go ahead and Mark it up as 28 bro they are at Boston tonight Boston's Gonna Roll Out The Ghost of Tommy playing Larry Birds gonna suit up the night Jayson Tatum will probably be getting some rest Jaylen Brown's probably gonna get some rest I mean  27 now it's going to be 28 it should be what are we doing what are we doing with j and Ivy what are we doing with us Sarah Thompson why are these kids not getting 35 minutes a night and balling out uh Jalen Duran Duran  why am I saying his name wrong turn he needs to be playing 35 and he's been hurt he's back why I didn't saying this for months I just sound like an angry old man standing out in the front yard yelling at bohem box zdanowicz what are you doing messing up my my kids playground like getting him out of there let the kids play if you're going to lose 20 in a row at least make it fun  look doc there's so much to chew on right there I feel your pain with all of it okay um so me and Antonio Daniels really got to the core of this yesterday on NBA radio and it came from our conversation Tom Gore's conversation he's the governor of the Pistons with media last Friday Gore said that he wants Troy Weaver his shot caller to go get veterans before the trade deadline I know it makes no sense at all it's actually crazy all right um they have veterans on their team right now but my man wants more okay you've got Burks you've got Joe Harris you've got Monte Morris and William buck nanevicz  you don't need vets you need to send those vets on to a more prosperous home in the NBA and you need to his doc said run these young guys until their tongues are hanging out and then it only then do they come out of the game um so here's the problem doc Tom Gore's wants instant gratification with his team and it's wrong it's dumb but that's what he wants um and so he goes and hires Monty Williams a win today coach for a win tomorrow team that's why the minutes for Killian Hayes and Jayden and Ivy um and and during and now Stuart are all getting messed with okay and awesome because this is what the owner wants he wants to coach the highest paid coach and NBA history at the time of the signing to win now and to win now they all think that they need to play vets so so it we've all been banging on to once this rotation saw the worst in the NBA and all of this is true but the root of it is the owner of the team okay if the owner of the team wanted him to play the young guys I believe Monty would be playing the young guys if the owner of the team was like I literally don't care about losses right now I'm fine with it okay it's growing pains we just gotta do the OKC thing in organically grow this and they have the OKC thing in place stock Kate is your one Jaden is your two author is your three Stewart is your four and during your five you've got it Killian is a six-man um and you got Sasser and you got wise men and you got badly here you go now man rotation let it rip um so that's why though doc it goes back to the owner we've been banging on Monty Williams all year and really we need to combine the banging here on with Tom Gore's now let's get let's give you some fantasy spin on this guys well quick betting thing Boston's minus 16 and a half tonight and I'm literally I it's sending me into like psychedelic psychedelic flashbacks doc okay like I don't know I can't brain does not compute okay because I don't know if Tatum and brown are going to play I kind of sort of think they're not going to play Brown is questionable with a little back confusion remember LeBron need him in the back on Christmas Day and then Jayson Tatum left ankle left ankle sprain management okay when you whenever you say that word management or maintenance the guy ain't playing okay I don't think Tatum's playing tonight I kind of doubt Brown is going to play tonight so I can't lay 16 and a half even against crummy Detroit  without brown potato I can't do that so that's that that point spread to me right there that's speaks to me to a Tatum and brown included points spread so if Taylor announced out do we go down to 11 and a half so I don't know maybe maybe you just grab that bag right now and take the points with the Pistons um who will tie the all-time record for consecutive losses with a loss tonight but doc I really I want to hit you with a quick fantasy spin here I do believe that this  is like ironically good news for Cade Cunningham because in watching these games Doc the 40 the other night I think it was against Atlanta I can't remember and then the other night he had 4137 in the second half I am seeing it I have the tiger I am seeing a determination I am seeing an aggression and Cade Cunningham that is born of this losing streak and wanting to get out of it that he needs to copy and paste to the rest of his career because he's been to resigned to losses he's been two uncompetitive he's been too just going through the motions and playing as minutes and getting his stats he is learning through this doc I believe that there is another layer of mfer that I have to get to frost to get out of this losing streak and for you know and then hopefully he can extrapolate that going forward okay you've got to be in a hole to win in the NBA and I don't think Cade fully has understood that and now that the league is banging on him and crushing him and laughing at him and humiliating him I think now he's like oh and he's like I need to go Hulk Smash on this thing and I like it okay these are the best outlines the cape coding have its ever put up in the NBA as they try to end this losing streak so I do think this is ironically got good news for Cade Cunningham and Cade Cunningham managers whether it's a redraft or a dynasty League  uh yeah he's playing well and he's healthy for once so you put those two things together and it's kind of exciting you still not very efficient is fantasy ranking is not gonna blow your socks off but man he can score he can run the court he can manage his team but I I'm not really worried about Kate I'm worried about us there all right I'll say Thompson this month these are the points he scored in his game starting with Tuesday two seven seven two seven eight and 20 254 those are all single digit non-fantasy worldly crap he's been dropped in almost all the leaves that I play in he's been picked up again he's been dropped he picked up so far he's that guy the bounces on and off the waiver wire all year long you know Whimsical mistress when the when the when the Pistons losing streak started way back on October 30th  he had 15 and 10 then he went 16 and 7 16 and 7 14 and nine 16 and 7 and then he had about three more games where he was good and then it all went away right around the time that the in season tournament started so I guess my question for you is are you  are you picking him up he's dropped in your league and just a 12 team redraft League are you picking him up and sitting on him  to wait for the second half breakout or and also this win now thing it's too late dude you lost 28 in a row  what good is when ten games I don't in January in February do you I don't see it nothing it's it's dumbassery Doc it's it's owner medaling at the worst possible to greet okay like this is what owner meddling looks like this is what the most dysfunctional team in the NBA looks like um they're and so you made a bunch of great points right there I am not holding off our Thompson in a 12 team redraft I'm not and here's why in Dynasty I mean if you drop off certain Gonna Fly to Your Home and slap you in the face okay that's what I'm going to do in a redraft go ahead and send them out to waivers because I don't see this changing doc I don't see this changing This Is How They want to operate okay it's dumb it's insane but this is what they're doing okay so we're saying over here we're reasonable over here we're trying to actually win the right way so no you can't do business with us R Thompson right now um what and and so I think Jaden and Ivy doc with this whole edict by Tom Gore's to Troy Weaver to make changes and get us better with veterans right Jaden Ivy is going to be the trade piece here because I don't think the league is like oh God I gotta give myself into some killing in Hays know um and I started I think he's too fresh of a draft pick I think the Pistons are gonna want to hang in there with him Jay and IVs been there a couple of years now and he's at odds with Monty Williams and I think he's the guy to go will that be good news or bad news I don't know it depends on where he's traded but but it's not it's usually not good doc when you're in the smallest of a miniature crunch with your coach and you're on the trade block we don't know if you're going to go to a contender and your minutes will drop we don't know if you're going to go to a bad team in your minutes  or going to go up he isn't Purgatory right now um are I would hold him in a redraft I would because the statue is putting up our are like I mean starting like they're they're better right um but where you at with Jade and ivory are you holding on to him in a redraft yeah I like the way his minutes are going I feel like he was not getting respect for money at the beginning or the ownership or whoever he wasn't getting it the beginning of season was a disaster for him but I feel like Ivy is at least getting enough minutes that he has the potential to do what we expect him to do so I'm good with holding it Ivy Thompson I don't know what to do with I got him I got him on a roster I picked him up last week I'm like oh I just got I just got the kid and then I looked at his game on and I was like well good Lord no wonder he was available in my league hey Rick I'm gonna read this this thing real quick and then we're gonna do a viewer question just

forget to say it's sponsored by Underdog I also forgot to say that it's Tuesday December 28th so I'll throw that out there let me see if I can find this this question because it's it is awesome  swag Chad Powers wants to know Rick would you accept Andre Drummond  and City Bay  for your guy Tyrese Maxey in attending points League  no why would I do that  some uh some present tense goodies okay boots is going to miss a period of time here with the groin strain he ain't out two months they have a reported at like that I saw seven to 10 days okay Drummond is the hottest guy in the waiver wire right now there's no question about that go get him put him in your lineup what's 24 25 the other night with stocks okay I'm a big Andre Drummond guy I always have been um he is a cuddly teddy bear of a dude um and and I think a very very underrated player who would be a doc I said this yesterday on NBA Radio I'm willing to die on this hill I guarantee I don't do guarantee we don't usually do that in sports we're not Joe frickin name it okay but I will hear I guarantee Andre Drummond would average a double-double in 24 minutes with any team in the NBA starting coming along if you just give him 24 minutes on any of the 30 teams he's giving you at least 10 and 10 I'm willing to die on that Hill okay he's still that good of a player but the NBA despises rebounds and they are in love with three balls Okay and like I was say you dummies a rebound equals a possession as in you have the rock what's more important than that okay so reeling it back in here um to this to that no okay doc please tell swag Chad Powers Chad thank you so much for being a part of the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy um please tell him that you need to get the best player in the trade not the two guys you always should be looking to get the best guy in the trade this is the this is the type of trade that will send your league into a frenzy right like people will be angry people will throw stuff it feels like and I'm not saying that that Chad Powers is is a rookie or a new fantasy player whatever but that's the kind of deal that a Savvy veteran offers to somebody they think may not be fully not know fully what's going on because like you said Andre Drummond is the hottest pickup in fantasy right now he's gonna be good for 10 days he's already had his game of the year he's not gonna put those numbers up again that's done the next one's going to be 12 and 9 or something like that  City May  just welcome back Jalen Johnson so they got Johnson Bay and the Henry Hunter who's out right now which is also a problem when he comes back so you are getting a 40 year old Center that had the game of his life the other day only thing you've done this year and you're getting city-bay who's a three-headed monster for the Hawks at forward and you're giving up Tyrese Maxey  like baby MVP uh who would just went over nine and didn't score in the first half in front of a nationwide Christmas Day audience shot four of 22 for that game like this the ultimate Bilo sell High scenario on both ends I don't think you want any part of it  how old do you think Andre Drummond is  what I just say 40 I'm gonna get like you said 50 and I won't stand for it I won't do you think Andre Drummond actually is I'm gonna go with 30  30 years old  wow 30 C do you see this is the perception I bet you these shock collars to think they got it all figured out around the NBA doctor looking at it in the same way it's 34 only gets his rebounds I can't do business with that I've got some young Hotshot might never will be who can bang a couple of Threes And so I got to develop him  again I got a million rants on the NBA and a million love points for the NBA as well but it is stock it is Camp oh go ahead one other thing Andre Drummond may not be done with his best game of the year because they host the Indiana Pacers tonight and they don't play defense so maybe Drummond has another monster game I don't know are you are you rolling uh  are you rolling drumming in Underdog are you rolling them in FanDuel what are you doing I'm not I'm not I'll give you my Underdog fantasy lineup right now since you brought it up let's get into this um I'll let you know here okay I do a lot of scientific deep Dives I I have fun with Underdog fantasy I don't I because I mean like Doc you and I watch all the games we consume all of these box scores like it's all in our brain it's all in our computer right somewhere somehow um and and it gets a little cloudy at times go into a bunch of concerts and so that you know so that happens but um I kind of vibe about the underdog fantasy and I say to myself I look at the schedule and I go who's popping tonight who is who is getting walk off interviews tonight at the end of game okay who are going to be those guys  and and so I'm not and obviously you look at okay you know you know with Houston right they've got some injuries guys rock guys can pop in that kind of thing but here's the thing the oddsmakers are on to these statistical increase these guys are going to have they don't leave the prop at the guy's average they will bump it up a little bit um to accommodate for up you know the guy being out anyway John Moran under  doc I'm going under on John Moran tonight the Grizzlies are at the Denver Nuggets tonight and I get it Aaron Gordon is out we wish him well he has a face and hand last rations from apparently a dog attack so we would 21 stitches it was reported the genre they're Forno  Jammer and stats are unreal  he's got to walk up buzzer beater he's got five points in ot to beat New Orleans he is being Trey young he is beating Halliburton okay he is rolling right now and he's due for class A regression to the mean this is at Denver at altitude against a phenomenal basketball team and he's going to have Casey p on him a lot okay and he's obviously a blanket I'm going under on Josh pra tonight doc I am it's at 40.5 I just feel like I mean love them I love the story can't wait to watch the game tonight I just feel like tonight's gonna be that bring him back to Earth game I've got Jamal Murray popping over 23 and a half again no Aaron Gordon he is going to be fired up okay with John in his house no no no no Jamal this is gonna be one of those like I believe Jamal Murray believes that he can flip the switch dock he did it in the playoffs last year he has these games for he's kind of in cruise control right and deferring and he's got all these other great players tonight's not going to be that night he's going to be throttled down tonight I got the Martyr Rosen you mentioned the defenseless Pacers doc I got him over 27 and I'm salty at DraftKings and all of these odds makers for this line right here give me a break 27 for the Rosen I looked at his last five games like 25 24 21 22 there are not numbers to support a 27 point prop bet okay  and then you have Indiana's defense you have the fact that the Bulls are rolling and you have the fact that I'm just kind of feeling a 30 plus pop game from tomorrow to Rosen call me crazy I'm going for it and then finally doc  the last leg of my four guy parlay here is yolk it over 26 and a half so I'm big on the Smith is Denver game um Denver you know yolk is play like crap the other day when he got gifted a lot of those free throws in that Warrior game on Christmas right he played like crap in that game he would tell you I suck today okay somehow they won I think you could just gonna be dropping up ball in the hole tonight he's got biyombo and it's Xavier Tillman and these scrubs are going to be trying to guard him and so that's my four pack on Underdog fantasy dude  I like it I I'm not betting anything against John Moran right now I the the Beast has been Unleashed and he he is taking no prisoners he is going all in at all times he doesn't care if it's Denver he doesn't care if it's Boston he doesn't care if it's Atlanta he does not care who it is he's gonna go out there his teammates are going to stand there and watch him ball and I think it's a gutsy bold move by you to go under if this if that hits  you deserve some props bro  all right doc so one last thing I appreciate that I mean we'll see if I win right but um lastly here before we go to the streets and talk with the people we have an injury situation times two with Houston Dillon Brooks has an oblique and we know how old bleakz go right they usually take quite a while to rehab from and we wish Dillon Brooks well with that Jabari Smith Jr ganked in ankle last night and we don't know how long he's going to miss he's a young wiring dude hopefully not long on Jay Sean take out the start last night for Brooke's notary Eason but tari Eason was very questionable for the game with the back to back he's got a lower leg thing that they're managing a little bit and so and so we've been on the the tari Easton Love Fest already here the ogs on the road to wire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy um Easton replaced Smith in the game last night um and you know obviously he would have played anyway but 25 minutes six points three rebounds two assists obviously just crud there five Steals and did hit a three um that was an off night for Tori offensively he's usually more involved taking more shots it's just kind of Ebbs and flows that way I'm in got 17 minutes um in this non Brooks and half of Jabari games that's not good news he had a pukey line and then a cam Whitmore popped for 12 points in 18 minutes um and so that's the setup here doc what what do you lookin' at to exploit and capitalize and benefit from are you looking for Easton more you know Jalen green who joke is going to have to play now or Kim Whitmore who they just brought up from the G league and he played well last night I'm still waiting for Tori Eason to blow back up he was he was on fire he got her he came back he is not been the same guy since he's been back but  Dillon Brooks not being there as a big deal and I think that screams tari Easton to me and the kind of nice thing about him not really blowing up lately is he's probably available in a lot of leaks and um you know it's it's coming you know Wednesday night five steals  you only had 6 points we had five steals only had three rebounds to assist played 25 minutes but as long as he's getting 25 between 25 and 30 I think the numbers are coming he had 16 and 8 the game before that so he's on his way back  all right doc so let's go to the streets here a DTM a look we appreciate you coming back with us a DF um a d yeah I should say he said hey what's up doc guys says the OG so hope your holidays are great YouTube a detail we hope you your holidays were great he says Army  I want to trade to get Luca well good luck um and he says Double D tomorrow Rosen and TD count in my 15 cat League who's TD why am I blinking a Tim don't get to me who's TD what what were these kids talking about now and he said for my heart and in campus is at a fair offer um  a GT I'm just having a hard time processing the players in this trade I don't know who's going where in and for what yeah that one let's do this one right and that one that's too much our brains dude it's it's not even noon yet we cannot we cannot function until he gets how many hours to sleep how many hours to sleep are you on oh I have no idea I have no idea is it less than six oh it's probably right around five or six I'd say somewhere all right go ahead go ahead go this point blank Mich when are we expecting players shut down specially on teams in the bottom of the rankings Rick like when you you've been doing this a long time you know that shutdowns are coming for certain guys what what time frame are you thinking is it All Star break is it after the All-Star break is it March 25th like what what's the date what's the magic number so you've got you've got the trade deadline you've got NBA All-Star you've got the buyout Market that's what it is and when that hits is around March um and and some teams will wait a little longer sometimes will get a head start on it you know what I've noticed guys is Detroit is not an empty the bench tank team they're taking because they suck um so I'm not worried about cayde and and you know whoever else is there you know they're gonna make trades and all this kind of stuff but they play their guys they're trying to win all right that's not a concern for me Utah is a blinking light concern for the shutdown okay I promise you they will shut down their guys they did it last year they suck again this year I know they're on a little three game heater here um you know they're alive for the plan tournament two and a half back right now but come on um they suck and and the shot down is coming um I do that do the Spurs need to shut anybody down no they don't they're 425 playing their guys they don't need to shut down their guys but it's a bitch so maybe I am worried about uh the I'm worried about all of them okay because they're they pop by the way I love them but he's done a horrible job coaching this team this year in my opinion a horrible job um I I think he's just he's running a daycare right now and and I like it okay um we're not isolating when be enough you know the vessel Off the Bench thing like what are we doing here man I feel like he's just like all right another let's move on to the next um Portland uh big time shot down candidates DeAndre 8 and Jeremy Grant okay buckle up for the shutdown I believe it's coming they've shut their guys down the last two years they super sucked now and I think it's happening again um so San Antonio Portland in Utah you got to look at guys on those teams is shut down candidates and then we go to the east um and Doc I've got good news there was one team that is going to have dude shut down one okay because I don't Charlotte sucks and and Clifford's gonna play his guys I I don't see them shelving ball and bridges and all these guys the Washington Wizards they shut dudes down last year and they're going to shut dudes down this year okay I don't think that kuzma or Ty Jones or Jordan Poole are gonna finish out this year and so it happens around the beginning of March it could be the second week of March it could be the third week of March it could be the last week of March heading into like that final little week and a half you know that first little portion of April but that's the shutdown Zone you're basically good through February and then once we hit March in that calendar and we all start talking about tournament basketball um that's when they they shut dudes now all right  Henry wants to know John Moran or dominant Mitchell 8 cat I know you're mad at Don one right now ah I'm salty I'm a little sad too like my son is like where's Donald Mitchell dude I'm gonna go Jai I I just I'm out I'm just I'm out  I'm out going jaw and out I mean the numbers are phenomenal but and I know Don is Big with the threes and the Steals and in theory I mean I I just was pissed okay like first of all I tried to DVR the Cavalier and Maverick game last night and for some reason it just didn't DDR I think it's because maybe my wife had a reality show here and I and it just it didn't take and it said that it took I went and checked on the guy that had the little circle that says recording I'm like okay cool I can watch Madison Cavs and it didn't record okay and so this morning I I see I'm looking through Twitter and I see Donovan Mitchell video bombs Jared Allen and careless Levert after the win and throwing water on and I'm like play  you're ill he's ill but on the road with his team laughing jumping around the arena and throwing water on the guys that actually played what are we doing here what are we doing here I've got a similar situation on my hands Rick my wife  has decided that it's time to start watching The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and so she streaming wait a minute from the beginning yeah from the beginning she's streaming this crap 24/7 and I sit laying in the bed and I'm like ooh do you think I turned know she's straight and if I change the channel if I go to DirecTV from her streaming or whatever it messes everything up you gotta get different remotes out that's all yeah so I'm like I'm like dude what season are you in she's like one I'm like how many seasons are there  well what  I can't do this till March April oh okay it's glamorous women screaming at each other and getting really really drunk and let's see what else yeah drama that's really not even there um try look like I could literally go on Andy Cohen's show I watched so much Bravo through the lens of my wife right I would not think any of this on ever but I like hanging out with my wife she's awesome she's my soulmate and so that's what wall is so that she can watch what she's got I got my games and so yes I process a lot way more Bravo than I want to a lot of below deck right a lot of blow deck let's see it's Miami it's Beverly Hills it's What What In And I think those one more that you watches but anyway I mean we've been on the Bible show have you seen this Netflix series The Bible no it's amazing we just finished it last night absolutely Guilford wants to know is OG anunoby your guy  he has zero steals zero blocks last night I noticed he had a he had a he had a party points though he had a good game but he did not have a steal or block I know go ahead doc I'm so Gianna nobe a Bi-Lo Target no no he's not um I believe that that we have a Nick nurse Darko reactivate transition problem here doc um I mean what what is Nick nurse defense defense defense Stevens um dot dot dot defense defense defense right that's all he cares about  I'm being embellished with that I mean obviously cares about both ends but we know where he hangs his hat defense okay and OG great defensive player he had a new coach in there okay and the team is very very mediocre and they're wondering about who's going to get traded and so I don't think goji's fully invested I don't think that OG is is wound tightly enough in the darker rack of its system which obviously is not holding them accountability to a better defensive effort otherwise we'd be getting it um like we talked about I made a trade for OG um and I didn't give up I gave up Clarkson tht and a third okay big deal um I'd rather have OG for the rest and Clarkson for the rest OJ's 26 Clarkson's 31 and tht obviously is what he is waiver wire guy so I don't I still don't regret the trade but I'm not getting the bank for the buck know he is not a Bi-Lo guy for me is Draymond Green  what a crazy question this is from Q socks is a Draymond Green worth a pickup in a point slee no um I don't think he's worth having in a points League even on draft day probably want the triple single in your lineup and a points League I mean what a great what a great call by the way triple single it's the best Charles Barkley by the way we got I mean that is possibly his best ever it's just the best one single it's so good really here's the thing with dream on Doc I believe that when he comes off suspension now this is me running their team we know that Steve Kerr has the infinity in this this enabling way with Draymond Green and the enabling continues by the way with that woj report that this is probably going to end up being 11 to 13 games what an absolute joke this is a hook up this is a vacation for Draymond Green he's out here violently attacking dudes and we're setting up to Bora Bora on frickin' vacation what are we doing here man um I believe command is gonna stay in the starting five above him  um DOC The Warriors are finally playing good ball no Draymond is it a coincidence I don't know doc he's not he's not making plays on the defensive end oh defense Stevens all he does is dribble handoff to Clay and stuff coming off screens that's all he does that polls right now is doing a better job of Draymond than Draymond on both ends  yeah you're supposed to better defensive player right now than Draymond Green I think so there's no question so that's why I'm at right Draymond Green is on waivers we can freaking stay there man I'm done I'm done with the Draymond thing dude I've been I've been a supporter a nurturer one of the first on planet Earth to beat the drum of Draymond Green's going to the Hall of Fame when I started that doc people like  um Camis got like five thousand points you're crazy and I say have you heard of satch Sanders  argument over  shut it down sat Sanders come on if he's in the hall dream on the hall and by the way that's standards is in the hall Robert Horry needs to be in the hall Dr  we got random takes all day long  we do
