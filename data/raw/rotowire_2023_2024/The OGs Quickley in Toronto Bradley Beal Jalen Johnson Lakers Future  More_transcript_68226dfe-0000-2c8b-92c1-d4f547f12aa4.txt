hey everybody Dre Steve Alexander here on the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast sponsored by underdog  I'm doc that's Rick it's Thursday January 4th we got a lot to talk about let's do it  happy New Year fantasy freeze it is your boy Ray boys Rick Hamlet and Steve Alexander here the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast presented by Underdog fantasy and happy New Year to you all um we got need to get into the fantasy Fallout of the OG&E trade a doc OG is back okay complained about him of I have a lot this year and when I saw I believe this came down on Sunday I owe gonna be traded to the next ah here we go baby um and and so many Ripple effects of this trade as well so let's start with OG Doc and and kind of take this one by one um OG&E I mean these aren't great stat lines okay but the goodies have returned I want Ogden and I made a trade for him in the cam Dynasty for Steals and threes all right in the two games in New York both wins by the way he's gone 176 with the rebounds with two Steals and three three she's gone last night against Chicago 11 8 2 with two Steals and one three so Doc in two games in New York OG I know he was averaging two threes and two steals per game this is what I'm talking about dude I'm very happy about the OG aspect of this trade my friend well yeah and I thought you would be and I like to trade for both teams actually in real life I feel like a manual quickly was kind of spinning his wheels in New York I feel like RJ Barrett was kind of not necessarily the guy the Knicks wanted I feel like OG was definitely spinning his wheels in Toronto like all of those dudes needed a new Vibe a new a new place to do their work and I know you you've been complaining about OG and Obi here for about three weeks now and I remember somebody wrote a question like is OG washed and you're like yeah I'm done he's done this year I'm so mad about that trade I did and I think this is New Life for him with the Knicks I think he's good to go the rest of the season hopefully we see that third round fantasy player instead of the ninth round guy we hadn't drowned on this year well let me just clean something up real quick I I have never on any platform says that OG&E is washed I might even use the word washed I might have been frustrated with it and like accused him of going through the motions and I wanted to be there anymore okay so osiyan and Obi is is cooking here guys and again OG on and obi's a role player okay we're not looking for 25 and 5 here I'm just talking about on the fringes looking for Steals and threes and the lovely and delicious fantasy gold now stand on the next year and we'll get to the Raptors in a second dock the OJ on and Obi trade and with RJ Barrett and Emmanuel quickly going out it has set up in all you can eat buffet for Jalen Brunson and Julius Randle I mean the shots for these guys Randall in the two games is going 39 on 24 Shots 35 on 23 shots last night against Chicago Brunson didn't shoot well in that first game 16 on 23 shots then had 31 last night on 22 shots okay and I believe on the broadcast they were saying it's the first time all year that Randall and Bronson of both at 30 in the same game not a coincidence guys Barrett and quick are gone these guys are going to get all they want every night both guys are going to get an uptick here Doc and scoring um and and I'll just leave it at that um but on the season Bronson is averaging 19 shots per game he is at uh basically 22 and a half he's already a three and a half shots per game Randall's averaging 18 shots per game on the season he said 23 and a half in these two games he's up five shots per game Doc giddy up if you're a Randall in Brunson manager man this trade was great news for them well exactly what you said ogm and Obi is a role player right he's not gonna he's not a volume shooter RJ Barrett is a volume shooter he needs to have the bondsman he just shooting time to really do what he does that's gone all of that is gone and pressure to be taking any of Julius Randle  shots so yeah I mean it's it's extra shots for both guys every night  maybe you know five to 10 shots that's a big deal and I don't know if you notice but a gentleman named Isaiah hartenstein wait crazy last time 20 rebounds five blocks I think he had 10 points he got some extra shots up too so I all you can eat buffet in New York is correct um hartenstein is killing it man is activity um achua God up to 11 minutes last night the way I see the stock ultimately is that hartenstein is going to play about 30 to 32 and a Chula will be in the 16-18 zone um tips was asked if a Jew is going to be the backup center and he told the reporters in New York he can be okay so essentially tips doesn't give anything away right you got to come in here and earn it man every minute you get his precious and you gotta earn it through sweat what he's Sweat Equity with me but I think it is going to eat into the playing time of heart and Stein a little bit eventually but heart and Stein is killing it right now um and I wonder  I wonder if hartenstein can keep this up I mean the energy he is expending flying all over the court banging off the ground trying to block every shot I mean I love it a freaking love it the guy's a tornado out there but I wonder how long he can keep that up and I think part of bringing in a Chua was that they didn't have anybody behind a Jericho Sims Taj Gibson I gotta work okay now you've got a good backup center and achua and I'm not saying go pick up a Chua I just think that you was going to get to the 15 to 18 minute range um and hearts tonight's gonna keep doing big things let's go to the Toronto side here doc Emmanuel quickly um is the big winner here and I want your you agree on that and so it start us off here on quickly and what you've been seeing so far in these two games in Toronto both wins by the way doc  I let's do that I also want to talk about Josh Hart before we're done because I'm wondering he's  cooked  or washed is he is he washed know I just wondered if he's if he's in trouble because he he's two steps have not been good the minutes are there but he's not doing anything  no shot looking at Three Points 11 points on 12 shots so for the last two games  yeah eight and three and there's a lot of people out there who have him on their fancy team right now and I like he was kind of my glue guy he was my role player on my fantasy team like OG is on the Knicks is he is he done and do I need to cut him and move on um it's a good it's a good question here  he floated on waivers in the cam Dynasty earlier this year and and I passed and I initially regretted it but  doc I mean it's just not there man it's just not there um you look at the the full season stat line from Josh Hart 7 points a game I mean you just you lost me right there let's go on though okay six three months very good rebounding guard three assists we're not even at a steal per game where one three per game Doc this is a waiver wire guy that we're talking about here and Josh Hart is one of these guys that is a stud in reality he is a Difference Maker for a contending team trying to rise the standings when playoff series but in FC I'm good okay so let's move on to a manual quickly  I raced out and picked him up this is the trade went down  we've been saying all season you know what's the difference with Toronto this year and why aren't they good you only really thing I can see is Dennis Schroder has been running the show there and Fred Meyer Lee was not but you know they were not happy with sure point guard I don't think I don't know if quickly or Scotty Barnes is the point guard now I haven't studied the film or watched the team enough to know exactly who's running the point I have a suspicion that's both of them but quickly looks awesome and quickly from day one got started job is gained 35 minutes a night he has a green light he's good to go I I think he's a huge winner in the trade I think if you picked him up that's awesome if he's sitting on waivers in your league you should go get him  we're gonna find out if how good of a basketball player is between now and April  so I'm in a league where it's a 10 team roster you keep eight okay we talked about keonte George she's on my team and  not happy with this so okay and and I went and picked up quickly I'm still hanging in there with keonte George but I think I'm gonna drop him for a forward because now I have a glut of shooting guards and point guards because Quickly's good to go like for years out into the Future Okay Emmanuel quickly is going to be doing this for a while now he's just starting point guard in the NBA the Toronto made a big trade to go get him and he's the guy okay and and I think he's going to take this job and with it DOC I don't think this is a blow into the dice and roll them down the table and it's going to crap out no I think it's gonna come up I think you're going to avoid that seven on that table doc he is to me the biggest winner of this trade he got the keys to a team that rarely happens doc okay we know how there's all kinds of good point guards on planet Earth okay but only 30 of them start in the MBA and and then the only like 15 to 20 of them are like really different makers right and I think quickly can get into that 15 to 20 group um in the two games he's never getting 20 or in four with three stocks per game and three and a half threes per game and he's just getting started getting to know his new teammates and finding out Rhythm and where they like the ball and all that kind of stuff and these are the results in the first two games and two wins come on man he is he is absolutely green lit for Success RJ Barrett here is basically to me the same dude doc okay getting in where he fits in we're doing the slithery Richard Jefferson slashed to the bucket thing dogs uh you know obviously not a good jump shooter or at least a consistent jump shooter he's gone 19 and 9 and 14 and 7 in the two games solid okay he definitely should not be out there on waivers doc siakam has gone 30 points per game in these two games do you feel like like OG somehow was in the way which I find hard to believe because they never ran plays for him or do you think this is Yo okay they just traded my boy oh Gianna nobe I'm next and so I better pick up my play here to raise my value and get somebody to come rescue me from Toronto how are you viewing Seattle  yeah it's interesting because you know siakam and OG we're both sorted just treading water and and  see I can kind of like a different players since traders gone down I've heard rumors about the Pacers I have a rumors about the Hawks Evergreen rumors about this and that like it sounds like siakam is probably one of the biggest piece is in the NBA trade puzzle that's gonna get moved this offseason and I love seeing the Hawks I love to see him go to the Pacers I don't really care I don't think he will stay in Toronto and he'd be wise to ball out as much as he can between now and then you know to raise his trade stock as much as he can but doc I know you're a Hawks fan cacao and Jalen Johnson who maybe we should just bring into the conversation right now uh me and Antonio Daniels on giving go on NBA Radio I believe yesterday just brought up I it might have been the day before um just kicking the tires on that report right it was Indiana it was Dallas and it was Atlanta as the teams that are kind of bellied up to the bar for Pascal so yeah we went team by team and I mentioned that the Raptors really really want according to reports Jalen Johnson in a trade and so at the Hawks wanted to trade Jalen Johnson they could get into some Paschal Soca Soca I know him you where you live right here because I know you have a big jail and John Johnson opinion you know I have a big jail in Johnson opinion are you sending Jalen Johnson to Toronto to get Pascal in a hawks uniform know  I mean just what we've seen Jalen Johnson do the last three games monster double doubles don't come personal Dunk Contest private Dunk Contest whatever in-game dunk contest  no I I can't I can't do that and and really I I I'm trying to figure out who I was talking to because I do this show with you on Thursdays Ken Crichton I do it on Tuesdays someone told me  within the last couple weeks that they were not a Jalen Johnson fan what's I just figured out who it is it's Mark Schwarz  the ESPN report retired reporter famous ESPN retirement before I mentioned Jalen Johnson to him he was like  not really feeling it like dude what is wrong with you you obviously haven't watched him play but I'm not  moving Jalen Johnson to see how come that the age difference alone is enough to stop me from doing that  when when I mean obviously he's he's been a badass in his craft he just doesn't watching he doesn't know much about Jalen Johnson um and I you know and that's scenario you can just say I don't know rather than like go out on thin ice and um but you know he knows a lot about fantasy dude like he was breaking stuff down like he he's on top of everything he just is not a Jalen Johnson guy okay oh that's cool we can more jail and Johnson for us um exactly so let me bring up this comment right here doc this is from WWW would you trade Beale for quickly and they had to head points lead um you guys I trade I trade bill for a  Schlitz Malt Liquor tall would you trade would you trade him for a beer bong doc would you would you funnel I would I would take I would accept a funnel I would accept literally almost anything I get people off your team as soon as you can and that is ticking time bomb  I completely agree with Doc he went right where I thought he would go with this guys look up Bradley Beal is back and now is the time to sell high with him okay because  he will get hurt again I can't guarantee it but this is what he does uh Bradley Beal in the four games since his return has gone six points all right first game back we get it then 25 really good then 21 and that was a solid stat line and the last night happened 21 points but it was on seven of 20 and like kind of a small stat line from there and you got beat by the LA Clippers now it wasn't all beale's fault Kevin Durant didn't play game over okay because the way Kawhi Leonard Paul George and James Harden are playing right now you need all of your weapons and it was a math problem for Phoenix last night I did just didn't have enough scoring but it by the way doc quick stat for you maybe the stat of the year in the reality portion of this the sun's Big Three  42% into the season has played 64 minutes together Beale Booker Durant 64 minutes together and we played 42% of the season  that's awful that's how you  put a disaster looks like it reminds me of Russell Westbrook to La like this is not working at all under two games over 500 there you know trying to stay above the plan tournament Line This is not how we saw this going but guys I want to give you the the solid advice from your boys the ogs here I'm Bradley Beal  now is through time to sell high with him okay troubles around the corner and doc I want to tell the people this do not ask for a lot for Bradley Beal I have shopped him in the cam Dynasty and it's crickets okay and I'm not asking for a lot I'm actually downshifting off of the full body of work and taking into account to dilapidation it is game and I'm making trades with that valuation of Bradley Beal and it's still crickets okay so you are deal for quickly  jump to the mouse jump to your phone and tap tap tapping except okay like you know what I'm saying doc like  I might even I don't know you'd have to give me some other examples here man but but I would be looking to bail on Bradley Beal for sure and and I would doc start with like a regular Market valuation and then I went down shifted like if somebody if you were offering a third round pick in a trade right and maybe a dynasty trade and and they said no it's not good enough well enough it put a second round pick in there and see if that entices it that would be a downshift that I would go with her to get Beal off my roster I mean we're living in a world where fantasy managers are dropping straight up dropping Jordan Poole right now  we're living in a fantasy world where Lori marking is a ticking Time Bomb just like Bradley Beal is now Laurie marking and I would argue is a true like get rid of him now why his values High Beale those numbers aren't even that good Rick six 25 213 on threes right Katie wasn't there if Katie's playing those numbers are half of what they are probably uh I don't even know if it's if it's qualifies as a so high situation like the fact that he's on the court and playing basketball and contributing to his team is enough for you to go try to move him and you're right you cannot ask for the world map you can't treat this like three years ago Bradfield this is today's Brad meal and even even if you're  getting rid of him at a high point you're still going to get a minimal return coming back no doubt man I want to bring up a comment here because this is pretty cool doc the worldwide presence of your boys Aditya Malou who is in here frequently says happy New Year 2024 docket and Rick K shout out to with much love from Jakarta Indonesia a d yeah that's

whistle lady blows the catering train whistle and it's it's amazing you you have to see trains the man I don't have a whistle nor do I have a bit right now in this moment but we shout out K train love that dude by the way a quick update on the cam Dynasty in my opinion the greatest fantasy league on Earth which docket is in um me and Darren Wilson who's a media guy a big time media guy Minneapolis reporter and in announcer me and him and Ken crates are all separated the leaderboard by one game Doc Doogie as we call him Darren Wilson 5721 and 2 I'm 57 22 and 1 I beat him last week five two one in an eighth category League we don't do turnovers over here turnover suck they ruin leaks okay and then we got the K train at 57 and 23 all three of us have 57 wins and then it goes 21 LS 22 losses 23 losses for Doogie me in K train that's pretty cool and then Justin fensterman who's a big-time fantasy name fantasy sports radio and I believe fantasy alarm and all this kind of stuff and my boy he's four so that's the top of the leaderboard right now but the K train is the defending champ and we're trying to knock him off man so shout out to the K train um a deta a doc brings up a question here are Easton tari Eason poached with Jim ski and Trace Jackson Davis still holds Yahoo Head to Head 1215 cat I say yes doc on all three of those guys are still holds how about you  can you throw that up on the screen so I can see it I sure can and I should have done that and so that only all of our viewers yeah as well so Taris and didn't play last game I don't think that is correct that is you know you know you know why right  okay let me in my birthday that I took off yeah no it was last night actually it was Nets at Rockets okay let me explain what happened there he Mayo doca has been playing tari Eason 25 to 27 minutes right and he's questionable for every game and so email doc was like yo bi-week let's rest him it's the Nets  that's what happened last night doc if that were the Celtics or or the Thunder or like a good team Eason would have played last night I am telling you right now he looked for an opportunity to restore Easton last night it is nothing to worry about  okay so and I'm still in on Easton I wish he was playing better than he than he is I wish we were I wish she was a automatic locks of people didn't have to even have to ask this question but I mean it's a pretty good question I like Ethan I'm in on Podge I'm all in on page like I'm not  I'm not dropping poach and then you know coach no tjd is awesome a guy I'm hanging on to until I just can't do it anymore we've talked about a hundred times here Steve Kerr loves him I don't know how he felt the 57th in the draft he's better than Draymond Green as a basketball player right now so I'm I'm in on all three of these guys but you know if you're in a say 10 Team league  and there's hot free agents these are the guys that you're going to be having to make decisions on so I get the question yeah trayce Jackson Davis would be the guy on the cut line for me played 24 minutes he is starting but he's not going to play Big minutes they're gonna work in Looney Draymond Green's return is gonna happen at some point here and that's going to eat into his minutes sarge is still a player in this and so I for now I'd hang in there with trayce Jackson Davis but Doc is write poetry ain't going anywhere man he plays harder than anybody else on the roster okay and they they just  I was thinking about the other day Steve Kerr was talking about we have a great problem right and they do but to me they just don't play hard enough okay they don't hustle they're not diving around they're not like if Klay Thompson sees a loose ball  he treats it like Cam Newton streets the fumble in the Super Bowl you remember when Cam Newton fumbled against Denver with the game on the line and just watch the ball and Denver pounce on it and you lose you remember that do you remember that doctor right that's Klay Thompson right now he diving on the floor you is Andrew Wiggins stopping on the floor right now no he's pissed he's in the dog house he's coming up the bench he came into the season in terrible shape blah blah all right I digress um we have a comment here from Alan Ramos just want to pull this up right here I picked up Jaylen Johnson he was on waivers in my league because he was injured just wanted to a shout-out Alan thank you for being in here and that is a big win or your team Don sicario says here without Jalen Hawks don't have anything worth Raptors time doc I would agree with that would you well that's that's yes and that's my big question about Dallas being in the mix what are they going to send  Toronto good question that is C I come back as a grant Williams uh yes I believe doc that Dallas is the best fit for Pascal Dallas needs one more layer of star power if you have siakam Kyrie and Luca and they're all healthy okay you have my attention Luke and Kyrie and the Luca ATS does not have my attention so Tim Hardaway Jr Doc would probably be in that deal he's at 18 and 16 I believe on the last two years of his deal Grant Williams is in the first year of a four and 53 maybe Messiah Jerry wants that barking dog who has not been a barking dog this year in Dallas has been weird in the performance isn't bad but yes maybe he wants Prosper maybe he wants Jalen Hardy maybe he watched Josh Green Dallas has dudes that can be traded for Pascal c o clebus contract for Sean Holmes contract they got stuck and they got picks and so Dallas to me is  going to be the next home of Pascal Shekinah and I will really like that move depending on what they give up go ahead doc as a as a Dallas supporter that one would be big like Luca needs help he can't do that he can't do this all season he just can't he can't carry the team on his back the entire year  oh I want to bring this up because this name is absolutely hilarious and as I bring this up I'll hope the NBA is listening it is Rick Campbell and Dr a Steve Alexander on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast presented by Underdog fantasy uh belief Scott Foster I mean it's hilarious dude you are funny oh would you trade Keegan for quickly in a nine category Head to Head um I would doc I would and he said me where I live right there uh so it's the announcer in Sacramento  road goes  I love me some Keegan Murray but  I'm gonna trade Keegan for quickly right now Doc how about you wow well Murray kind of blew up last night he had 2812  a couple threes he'd been quiet for four games before that so it was sort of  sort of a Bi-Lo situation on Keagan until last night but I I think he is more of it's sort of like you're trading Keegan for deer and Fox right because quickly he's gonna kind of be in that fox role and Keegan is more like in the OG anunoby role he's more of a three-point shooter and a role player guy on most nights he's gonna have big games here and there but I I think I'd rather quickly  it is Rick Camilla and Dre here on the world of wire fantasy basketball podcast presented by Underdog fantasy and okay what do I want to go next here with my boy um let's go to the rise of scooters in here doc  scoot Henderson it took him a minute but he is now doing what I think a lot of us thought he would do is in the starting lineup over the last week a four game sample size he is at 18 points four rebounds seven assists one block one steal two threes and 30 plus minutes each game in Doc last night he Blazers predictably got thrashed by the Dallas Mavericks  scoot was the only player to play 30 plus minutes last night and you look at the minutes played in the Box Score it's 21 22 24 23 that kind of thing and then whoa scoot played 33 guys that is what we want to see that is phenomenal news okay that is a clear indication that even in a 30 plus Point blow up we got to develop this guy and we got to play this guy okay this is a sign that they will not shut down scooters and this is a sign that he is the price line up wise for the rest of the season every Simon says who he is he's fantastic player Jeremy Grant is we as a fantastic player DeAndre 8 in okay is not it's decreasing to me Doc and I'm melted down on this on NBA Radio yesterday so bring it over here I still got meltdown left in me  I am out on DeAndre I am done defending him I am done trying to tell people to complain about his little motor that they're wrong because they're not he does have a low motor doc DeAndre has the worst talent to motor ratio in the entire MBA this should be 2010 walking man so anyway back to school here doc I believe that now he is the priority for the rest of the season they got probably 55 57% of their season left and it is all about developing the sky right here so talk to me about school I mean I hope so I had him in my DFS lineups last night what do you shoot two for 11 something horrific but the minutes are there  he's coming on he's he's actually playing a lot for Portland he's actually  over the last three weeks you see his name a lot more than you saw before that he's kind of balling out I think last time was a fluke I'm with you I'm kind of all in on scoop right now even even though he made me mad last night  all yeah and so I'm glad you brought that up because guys it's gonna be dirty he is shooting in the 30s over this stretch I believe in the 60s on free throws and I don't really care about 3% because it's about the the you know the number of Threes that you hit and then the percentage is sort of baked into the field goal percentage and had to at least that kind of thing so I don't care if he shoots 27% from 3-point range I don't care he's banging 2.13 per game that's all I care about and I I'm going to like understand that I'm gonna take a field goal hit here and so he's not a perfect player butt butt scoot is ascending and I actually loved to see that let's go back to the comment bar here Doc and and check in with our people here we love that you guys are out there let's go to what what is uh what is this one right here uh mucuge um right here says what do we think of ivy  so I love Jaden Ivy but I hate that pardon me the deployment of Jade and Ivy and doc I watched the fourth quarter and overtime of Detroit and Utah last night boy am I glad I popped that game on Doc I looked and I was like oh this game's closed boom popped it up watched that last part and it was like March Madness I mean the the back-to-back-to-back-to-back we had four like potential game-winning shots just balls heh three balls um in the last like 30 seconds to that game it was the good stuff man um but when I'm watching  document let me explain something I'll keep it very real with you in the people um I don't watch a lot of Pistons basketball I'm watching some Pistons basketball right now because the street okay and then how they kind of come out of the streak and they got smashed by Houston the other night and so last night of Utah I was kind of like all right Detroit you're going to go right back in with other 17 game losing streak what's gonna happen here they played very well it was a winning effort and performance I thought by Detroit but you tell us just a little bit better um but I'm watching these late games sequences and I'm always seeing Isaiah's out there and I don't see Jada and I be out there huge problem doc so in Dynasty I love them you love them and you nourish him and nurture him and keep him in redraft I in redraft he's just to do for me right now Doc well dude I sent you a picture last night of my three bad Beats at Underdog fantasy I had from Techo scoring 12 he easily hit I counted six is going to 18 He easily hit Cunningham easily hit Laurie marketing  easily hit the only I was waiting I was Jayden Ivy oh I'm I'm with you dude I turn on the Pistons game  and I'm like where is Jade not it's all Alec Burks right and it's all Isaiah livers and they're just out there run around run around run around all right  crazy three to send it to the second overtime or first overtime whatever yeah Ivy ivy got back in the game for the second for the end of the second overtime when somebody found out I don't remember who found out somebody's I think that came only went one over time last night I think you're confusing it with were you up late watching Secours Orlando by the way that yeah that was a freaking Game of the Year man that was a double overtime game alright God Bless America that was a good basketball okay so this was this was single over time somebody fouls out they put Ivy in there he's gotta open look at a three and he gets here and he turns and I'm like that's it I'm done I'm sorry that's true like Jayden I was not in the game at all in the fourth quarter say it just saying and it's goes back to money man I mean this whole win now been touting and Jay Navy young and I I don't understand it thank goodness scoot does not play for Detroit oh yeah I'll start Thompson too was in this minute buzzkill the Monty Williams has created but that was a hell of a game um and you know I  do understand Alec Burks playing a little bit because he's a good player and I don't understand livers being in the way of Jade and Ivy that makes no sense to me at all we're developing livers over Ivy a top five pick that's Insanity okay uh let's see here free key says do you think let me pull this up here um look at me with the tech today this is so slick doc free key says do you think clay talking about his combo with Kerr will help him improve this year that is a great question and me and Antonio Daniels talked about this yesterday on NBA Radio I feel like it's a bit of a penalty box thing for Klay Thompson all right Steve Kerr sat him down because Steve Kerr was pissed about the bad body language and Clay talked in that sound bite about how Kerr talked to him about how his bad body language and negative energy was impacting the team and it was I watched almost every minute of every Warrior's game and I cannot tell you how many times I've seen Klay Thompson like stomping brood back to the bench after three more consecutive missed three and just down like this and dudes are trying to adapt them up and lift them and he just not even his hand it's bad body language and yes it is bad especially for young guys and all this kind of stuff um it but just like who wants to be around a pouted up dude all the time okay so I don't think it's gonna have anything to do with Clay's play I think what Steve Kerr did to Klay Thompson dock is you put them on notice and he said if you want to continue employment here with us you have to change right now okay and if you don't do you're in a contract year you're up here with your evaluation of yourself we're down here with our evaluation of you  that they have talked off and on about contract extensional doctor no extension has been signed it's because Clay is overvaluing himself so I I don't see this positively impacting Klay Thompson at all how about you I mean the fact that we're City here in January still talking about Clay's body language and something doesn't look right and I mean the Warriors are the the most dysfunctional team in the maybe not only but their identity they don't have an identity they're just a mess Detroit's most dysfunctional team and then we can we can debate number two but but there are a mess like did Golden State has no identity clay clay kind of looks old you know he kind of looks like a guy who's had three major surgery was washed I didn't say washed  but the fact we're sitting here talking about clay this late in the season and like you know you you turn on ESPN right now and it's like do the Warriors have time to turn this thing around there on their this is like their last gasp and I'm not sure I'd put anything past Steph Curry but the way things are going in Golden State and it's your it sure doesn't feel all that great Rick I've got a I've got a question pulled up here that timely to what we've been talking about it's from the Philippines yes from Ian he says you hold on to John Collins if no one will give you anything for him  back in with John Collins here my inclination is to say hang in there with them I mean he's still a it's really solid player in the NBA now I I'm off of Collins because I fear the late season shut down um you know last last five games oh the minutes are Dreadful 1826 21 182 look man um  I'm looking at John Collins I mean if the minutes are going to slide like this you can cast him back to waivers I mean he'll be picked up immediately somebody hoping to things change and things budge oh John Collins on waivers bam I'm gonna snatch him up but you might not ultimately regret it on the season if you round up and round down like I like to do is at 14 and 8 not even close to a block worth 48 field 373 making 1.43 per game so doc we're really in the fantasy gold here man and the numbers are dipping the playing time is dipping to shut down his around the corner I would look to flip him for something um you know I don't know doc off the top of my head and listen go ahead listen so since you start talking about the the cam Dynasty and you always mention that I'm in the league but we never talked about where I stand in the league because I'm trying to  I'm always down at the bottom I mean I get it but you mention that I'm like you know what I haven't looked at that roster in a while so if I look distracted for the last few minutes because I've been out there dropping guys picking up my boys South and techie oh  dude I would drop John Collins for Kentucky right now if the Jazz are going to shut everybody down they're gonna let Saul play at the end of the year they're letting him play right now I'm guessing his minutes he's probably getting 12 more minutes again than John Collins's  yeah he's in the way he's in the way for sure keonte George is not gonna get shut down right they're gonna develop him he will stay on the court but the the market in the Clarkson's those Kessler well I mean Kessler's a second year Guy where are we shooting him down you know what I mean you lose every night anyway what they haven't been playing him very much I know I did that make any sense to you no I don't get it I don't get it either Kelly maybe they're trying to like  Bill O'Kelly Linux trade value before trading him into deadlines they're auditioning him a little bit but I think  that's a good point the the will Hardee's  deployment of Walker Kessler has been very missing this year um let's see here what's another comment out Yeah we actually got some Hong Kong speaking of speaking of keonte they're coming at us from everywhere Rick this is amazing Kong in the Nisha Philippines Philippines let's go this is huge man this is huge World Travelers without even leaving our homes this is freaking amazing I want to go back to bleep Scott Foster her real quick and have some fun with this um no I mean we're just freelancing here and winging it up he says Kamala and Dre gives me mid late 2000s NBA TV Vibes when Rick used to have doc via phone patch to talk fantasy Hoops to goats  doc believe Scott Foster just brought up a moment in time for both of us man you on your rise me on my rise having you on the show with the two ways that we used to do those were good times man those were good times we were we were popularizing fantasy basketball for the world in that moment and that is not in an accurate statement it's not and it also was such a such a crazy  crazy thing that it's come full circle like I feel like you and I started almost together on that show even though I wasn't paid I wasn't part of it I wasn't even a fantasy Analyst at that point really I just started at Rotoworld and I was like I'm gonna call my boy and I and you like a couple of my takes and you're like hey Doc next time you call in tell him tell him your doc and I'm just gonna have him ship you right to the front of the line and like like I would call in once or twice a week maybe more I don't even remember but they would just like hey Doc what's up and like like  I get hustled to the front you and I would have a conversation sort of like this and it's it's cool that there's people out there that witnessed that and remember it because it was a long damn time ago it was right around 2000 I'm guessing 2000 won it was a long time ago doc probably like yeah 0607 oh wait oh nine you know in that range right there because we we left I was in Secaucus for six years and then the last 11 years of NBA TV were down in Atlanta so and I started with NBA TV like 2003 and and then like I said 20 I'm getting my math screwed up here but anyway it was late late yeah I think it was in the 2003 to 2004 Range because I was calling the show from Indy and I moved from India in 2000 oh there you go  it was a yeah that that's a better time stamp that I got it was that you were that early on the fantasy show we weren't like cooking for a couple years you were like just like we had just launched the show on my boy was calling is that how that went yeah yeah and I just started it I think I started Rotoworld in 2000  and then I got my own column and like 2002 or 2000 three found you around that time how did you how did you find out about the the what was it called virtual GM Gatorade virtual GM how did you find out about that the TV show yeah oh I was riding him about the NBA I was going to bed you know four oclock every morning I was watching you know I flipped on the channel That NBA TV when they and there's some freaking a sweatshirt in a hoodie like he's in his in his bedroom mom's house bedroom or something we're in a Magic Johnson shirt talking about fantasy fantasy basketball I'm like oh my God this is how have I not seen this before and I I think the first time I saw that show I watched it every single  every single night for the pride until it was gone  oh my man I just a quick story like my start in this came through fantasy football and I saw a little newsletter or pamphlet type of thing in a bookstore in Downtown Minneapolis it was called fantasy football weekly a little like like newspaper thing almost like creative loafing or like that that like Indy ragging your city that has all the concerts in it right something like of that form and I look at this thing I'm like what in the hell is this cuz I was already playing fantasy football and like in the very early days and I'm like I pick it up and I'm like reading through it and they're giving like advice for the upcoming weeks games I'm like oh my God this is this is world changing right here and so I had that experience that the you like and then you said you watched it every night and you it was just like a point like I got that pamphlet every week um ended up going to Paul Church in the publisher of that pamphlet and he hired me and boom launched the whole career thankfully that was whole all operated Minneapolis that was very huge for me um if I was in Wyoming and it was in Minneapolis I don't know I might have been dead on The Cutting Room floor doc but  I was like like like like like like a kid that found Van Halen or a kid that found Led Zeppelin or a kid that father Grateful Dead about that right oh my God this is changed my freaking life um because at that time doc fantasy football it was about full season predictions in about books and magazines going into the year and there was nobody doing the in-season thing in terms of giving advice was here's my magazine buy it and then good luck the rest of the year sale out eh and so shout out to Paul Church in a Rob Vivian to goats of this industry as well you know my my buddy John dishinger  he called me one day in Indian he said if you seen this website  and it was website a lot like RotoWire and I said no and I went there and my head exploded I was like well this is straight up  news and it's happening live and so that that was mind blowing in the other really mind blowing moment of my life when it comes to my career was When We snuck into my wife's bosses office at midnight and got on his computer and hopped on America online at about David they told they were like now this costs like three or four dollars a minute we got to be quick we got in there and I went to sports NBA box score in the first time I ever saw a live box score the night of the game and not in the newspaper the next morning in 19 this Friday 1990 for 95  blew my mind I'm like this changes everything I don't have to wait for the Indy star to come to my house tomorrow to open it up and see the crappy box score that only shows points rebounds in the sis they have everything and it's it's live it's real time and I I just I could not believe what I was seeing  um so we're getting another shout out here Shea Sealy is watching from Trinidad this is literally amazing and humbling Trinidad we've had Hong Kong we've had the Philippines and we have Indonesia we got Central Europe all in the same show Central Europe is here this is absolutely amazing absolutely amazing all right doc let me let me see what are the Rhymes we got for the people here okay let me talk about where we were getting pretty close to the end here folks but okay this is a development last night Austin Reeves in the starting lineup and it does give us an opportunity to talk about Darvin ham being on thin ice um so Austin Reeves has needed to start for a while for me when they benched D'Angelo Russell that should have been Reeves in the starting lineup but you know ham went in some different directions and so he got it right last night obviously they got they didn't get destroyed but I never I never felt like Ellie was gonna win that game last night Miami had him at arm's length the whole game but Reeves doc fantasy wise oh boy is this a green light for him he went 24/5 and 8 last night seven of 12 overall two threes eight of nine three throws and played 37 minutes and doc I don't think he's going to lead this starting five for a long long time or unless he's traded to Chicago for Zack Levine and then he will start for them but if he makes it through this deadline and maybe they can trade rui and Russell and stuff for Levine then well Austin reasons may go back to the bench at that point because then it's maybe too much star power in your starting lineup um but I you know barring a Levine trade I think Reeves is good to go here Doc and I don't think he will  go back to the bench I think the toggling is over Frost and reefs how about you I hope so man I as a Austin Reeves manager in our 30 Team league where my team is in third place currently struggling this week a little bit but we're we're hanging in there I need Austin Reeves on the court as much as possible especially when my sixth starter is Robert Covington who's about as reliable as Bradley Beals left leg  Yeah I I want Austin Reeves out there I'm sight that he is out there I I don't know I don't understand why he was not out there to begin with but  and he goes back to Darvin ham  has lost his locker room and body language is bad in la la land and I'm expecting some news in the next couple of days how about you  unfortunately yes I don't like this at all I don't like this at all Doc how do we go from making an improbable run to the Western Conference Finals that nobody saw  and then we win the n Season tournament and we hang a banner  and now we've been in a rough stretch and we fire you how  this is way too quick doc this is Ed Odin LSU bullish you remember Ed odaran with with Joe burrow and Justin Jefferson and all these guys they win The Natty write 21 months later Edo's realm was whacked for your boy Brian Kelly and what the hell is he done at LSU except underperform  and steal the Heisman from Michael Bennett's Junior don't get me started  no I I'm feeling some kind of way about LeBron with this oh it's all the Brandy dude hang in there for a minute I know you're losing I know you're under 500 but now we want to whack the coach Doc they just whack Frank Vogel  they whacked him the Russell Westbrook thing was LeBron's fault he and David's they had a pow wow when wanted to bring him in and it was a disaster and so Frank Vogel gets whacked because everybody want along with LeBron and clutch Sports in that trade and then the Jeanie Buss Rob link and they took the steering wheel back of the team and they said we're not going to let you drive our car in the road again but here we go again I mean in a love LeBron overall and you know all this kind of stuff and I'm not like a LeBron Banker I want to make that very clear because there are LeBron bangers out there this guy that wears a toupee out west he's making zillions of dollars a year on an Empire created from banging on LeBron James it's not what I do here but I am feeling some kind of way about LeBron right now because if there's a disconnect in the locker room is is Darvin ham in a disconnect with Austin Reeves getting sham shirani to report know it's a disconnect between LeBron and Darvin ham and I don't like it DOC I don't like it at all hang in there if if you go through the rest of this season and you lose in the first round fire department ham  you're gonna Whack Him in January  right after winning the NBA cup give me a break dude give me a break this is not saying well with me at all  well and you know the kominsky Bros tweeted about LeBron's body language during the game last night they're like  I don't know if LeBron was hurt or if he just wasn't feeling it but he didn't look like he was very interested in what was going on and then today the report comes out that darvin's job is on the line he's lost the locker room and everybody's upset so that is a direct one-to-one correlation between Darvin Hammond and LeBron James I'm sure add probably has his back you know I mean LeBron holds a lot of power man  way more power than players probably should be able to I mean he's earned it right 21st season he's the third best player of all time in my opinion behind Jordan and Kareem so I get the power and where it all comes from but I think this is a bad and abuse of power doc to use an old historical reference from all the stuff that I've forgot from being a history major at the University of Minnesota my wife brings up a historical nugget right I'm like yeah I forgot that she's like did you forget everything you learned in college I said  pretty much just memorizing stuff to Ace testing have a good GPA what are we doing here am I taking all this these fine print historical facts and the rest of my life how the hell is that going to help me my story what's up sorry in his favorite saying right now is why do I need to go to school everything I need to know is on my phone in my pocket like what what why are we wasting our time at school because literally everything I need to know right there I'm not mad at sworn for that that's actually very clever thinking um and and this is a man a young man that wants to streamline his time how much wasted time do we have at school over the years right not so much in college but in high school my God I thought like half of that time is completely wasted and Bob Bob didn't even make it on the test that we had to take um doc we are on a time my friend any last massages for the people before we get out of here no it was fun taking a trip down memory lane I always enjoyed doing that hopefully hopefully people  get a kick out of it but yeah if I I I'm just so psyched to be at RotoWire and doing these podcasts with you and cried in a whole slew of people you and I I think should have had a podcast to go a long time ago it was a long time coming it's my favorite part of the week honestly and it's fun so  my guy my guy I feel the same way I I'm geeked about this every single week and shout out to all the bosses with RotoWire for bringing this together man we really appreciate you DJ trainer and Nick Whalen especially for putting this together man so for Dre for all of us here at RotoWire I am Rick Campbell a good luck folks and go get some wins and fantasy ball we'll see you next week
