welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog and FanDuel it is February 2nd Friday I'm botching this intro but thank you everybody for being here  I'm here with Shannon and Ken catering Christ  oh Lord speaking of award-winning  I believe this podcast was just nominated for another fswa award  yep see I mean now we get nominated I don't even care anymore we're not Are We Now needed we're in the semi-finals we're on the what's the right word for that  I don't know nominated it's it's their mistake so that was not really our problem um  speaking of mistakes Joel embiid played the other night now he has a torn meniscus this is all this is all allegedly so sham sharania tweeted that he Taurus meniscus but then Adrian Wars and washed Norske and Chris Haynes said that he was just a meniscus injury and like a tear having been confirmed my opinion on this is that you would not report that it was a tear if it was it like reporters are always going to lean cautious they're never going to be like this guy tours ACL just kidding they're always like it's an injury and then he tore it so the fact that Chompy tore it to me means that he probably told  ya the 65 games rule  I feel like this is partially a product of that has nothing to do with Jonathan comingo also falling on his leg there's that aspect of it too all we know right now is that embed is at least out through the weekend until a treatment plan becomes finalized I think is the is the phrasing from the team where look any meniscus injuries basically a tear meniscus injury best case scenario was like a three weekend injury he's done for the year  so if he's on your fantasy team  obviously throw them on your IR until we until we learn more but this is a tough situation if you haven't fantasy  yeah I mean let's remember and Beads been fragile so we missed his first two NBC's his first two NBA Seasons due to an injured foot and the process embed is average 56 game played games played per season after missing those first two years he played 66 games last season plus playoff games  but hey some good news right without indeed Maxi scored 51 points Thursday night and led the Sixers to a nice win in Utah so there's some sunny news for the Phillies  yeah we'll we'll talk a little bit more about some fantasy implications later on in the show that it's a official teaser But Ken we had some we have some good news going to cross the association  All-Star Game reserves were announced in the East Jalen Brunson Tyrese Maxey Halo bonero Donovan Mitchell Jalen Brown Jewelers Randall who's hurt and Bam out of Bio in the west Steph Curry add Paul George Kauai Devin Booker Karl Anthony towns and Anthony Edwards commissioner silver will need to replace the injured Randall and embiid Shannon who leads your list of snubbed non-allies and that Scotty Barnes for Toronto just having absolutely monster season a know Toronto is not having a great season so that that probably is part of the reason why he's not on the All-Star team and then Trey young with Atlanta second that in the NBA in assist top 20 in scoring top 25 in efficiency overall offensive efficiency terrible defense yes of course but true yeah Trey young should 100% be on the All-Star roster I think you can make an argument yeah I Jalen Brunson fantastic caliber and there's there's plenty of guards Donovan Mitchell who are on better performing teams and they're having monster Seasons as well but there's no way I don't care if Trey young were on the Pistons right now and had the stats that he has I think he should be on the All-Star team no matter what would love to see Scotty Barnes be the injury or placement for Julius Randle that's seems like an obvious fit but we shall see yeah if it was if it was Trey young and and Scotty Barnes in there I don't know who I would have Trey replaced maybe Jalen brown maybe Ben Carroll but that would kind of Celtics are having a pretty good season there they are having a pretty good yes I'll say this I hope D white is not a replacement and I want him to rest he's slumped for most of January I want porzingis white holiday go relax go nap this team is exhausted they got problems team success is the only justification for having Jaylen Brown over Trey young or Scotty Barnes and the officer team and Derek white I don't care about that half the game and then Derek white the dude is averaging 15.7 points per game he is not an All-Star just like when Tayshaun made the All-Star team not an All-Star like defense wins Champions championships sorry championships  well Shannon take us to some Rosie news out of Texas  yeah this a little bit out of the norm for for our breaking news but she went green deserves a pipe we need to talk about this man he is I think it's happening guys I think it is we'll talk about a more for DFS but over the past week he's the fourth ranked fantasy player is averaging 29.8 points 7.2 rebounds 3.8 assists 1.6 steals 3.23 is in 36 minutes per over five the last five games that's almost 50 fantasy points per game just absolutely crushing it you know it is I am someone has tent because this could just be a nice little hot streak that he's on his field goal percentage it has increased you know he's well above his 41.4 percent on the season and shooting 51 and a half percent but the 3-point shots not like insane 36% during this hot streak  I just I like he's been far more aggressive on offense he's picking his spots and taking three bounce coming from the rebounds are unbelievable thank you Street three straight double digit rebound games unbelievable but I think it may be happening we might see jail in green you know living up to some of that pedigree and a lot of folks who thought he was the top prospect coming out of that draft class what happens next season when Stephen Adams is the starting shooting guard for these Rockets that's a joke but last night the Rockets did trade for Steven Adams who's hurt all year a bevy of second round picks to the Grizzlies Grizzlies wanted to clear some sorry  and Adams looks like he'll be a backup to sang right are they going to power forward and be a backup veteran you know Cruiser project just that that that that tough veteran presence to have on their roster will be good for him yeah  well we'll close a bad news at a Boston the LeBron let's add list Lakers still shocked the Celtics in Boston Lakers win 1 145 so the Celtics after starting 20 and 0 in TD Garden have now lost three of their last five at home it's really a bad basketball stretch for the Celtics they are limping into the All-Star break but kudos to the Lakers they had 53% of their threes and much like Shannon's Mr Rosie positive about Jalen green might need to make that a regular segments and Shannon Rosie positive about each week I want to give some sunshine to D'angelo Russell who is caught fire despite that odd post game presser race seemed to be crying and seemed to like he was going to get traded anyway but since they put them back in the starting lineup on January 13th Russell's averaging almost 24 and a half points almost seven assists over four three-pointers while shooting 47% from the field this is over 11 games and he's playing 38 minutes a game  so kudos to D'angelo Russell  yes his past two games have been a little less efficient but the 14 assists to one turnover against Boston's very nice he's also going up against Derek white and Drew holiday Austin Reeves of the massive game too 32 points on 18 shots he got some praise from Darvin ham after the game who said he just like him know he appreciated Austin Reeves but it's time to talk about Underdog fantasy Underdog fantasy they're the number one

start with show Regular James says I have jail and Smith Mo Bamba Jabari Walker and blah cool Bali which two well have a good second half need to drop to uh well had this this embed injury you might want to wait on like I said at the top of the show it's possible you'll need to surgery and it will be out for the year but we don't know either way I don't think Bamba we'll talk about Bamba more later just don't get your expectations too high for bomb up but maybe  the average seven five and two okay Jalen Smith very up and down player Jabari Walker really interesting with the potential that Portland tanks same with Bilal coulibaly um I shared do you have any strong feelings on this group of four guys who for each of their own reasons are fairly underwhelming yeah I'm feeling Ken will agree with me but my number one pick to keep of those four is cooler Bali I believe he's and we've talked about him a couple times on the show I believe he's gonna have a very strong second half I picked him up in a couple of my own leagues and kind of stashed him a little bit early I think he'll see routinely Eclipse 30 minutes in games whether he's coming off bench or starting which could be in the in the future and already happened once this week he the second option it's a bit tougher I'm siding with Jabari Walker right now but I do think it's a toss up between him and Smith had a giant game last night and only 24 minutes 20 points nine rebounds two blocks two steals but his plays can be too erratic for me and I do expect once Indiana's fully healthy because they had multiple players  out last night again they're gonna work out a rotation with with siakam and Myles Turner in the front Court you have to expect those two are going to see the vast majority of minutes and I would be surprised if Smith has many 25 to 30 minute game like he's had in the past week or two you know he's got a couple of those right now but I would expect his minutes to hover like in the 15-20 minute range most nights once that team South healthy and with that I think he's tropical all right and then second question from David I have Tobias Harris in my 12 team 9 category league is Harris going to be stepping up now that Joel could be hurt for a while I think he will be yeah I mean they that's a lot of shots gone from from the 76 it's just a lot of rebounds gone from the 76ers Paul reads gonna step in MO Bamba is probably gonna do some stuff here and there but yeah to buy us took 21 shots last night against the Utah Jazz and I think he'll continue playing pretty well he showed in the past and ability to to step up his usage when he when he needs to so I think you'll love a nice stretch here yeah to buy his hairs averaging 6.7 more fantasy points for game that's with FanDuel scoring in the 11 games without indeed this season they had played in so that's that's a significant boost I mean he's he basically goes from being like a top 80 top 90 player to a top 40 50 player  okay and you know I'm gonna rephrase an injury question this would be more for Alex I think but any news on either the Vanderbilt injury and LA or Easton in Houston of any updates there Alex about these are those guys come back we don't know anything about Vanderbilt right now all we know is that he wasn't going to return to Thursday's game after he got hurt obviously that's that's old news at this point but the Lakers haven't provided any updates in terms of Ethan look it sounds like that he wants to ramp up his activity at practice this week that's our latest update but it's phrased as he could he could ramp up his activity and I was warning people I could ramp up my activity right we all could ramp up our activity so I look I I was warning people about this like two weeks ago a vague nondescript lower leg injury that's kept the guy out for weeks no idea what that means  I wouldn't be surprised if he stay on some sort of minutes limit you also have Cam Whitmore playing well  I I won't be shocked if he's out through the All-Star break let's just say that  yeah with Eason really The Hope was he would start contact worked this week and that hasn't really happened or well it could have happened but there hasn't been a report on it yet so  yeah if that happens soon and it goes well then he could return it shorter or like Al said it could be a couple weeks down the road still  all right Alex will take us to the money segment of the Pod the waiver wire as this how this thing works Cannon and I I love two regular free agent pickups or roster and 50% of fewer usually Yahoo leagues and then one long shot 25% or fewer of Yahoo leaks for those of you who are 14 16 maybe even 20 teams in terms of the schedule next week Utah Portland Minnesota Denver only F2 games so when when picking guys up be careful about that or if you're making some drops keep that in mind my first suggestion is Paul Reed of the Philadelphia 76ers not a big surprise here 34% roster at least he was last night when I checked a Joel embiid has a meniscus injury my my professional analyst opinion is that he toured the damn thing Philly has four games next week so even if he makes some sort of miraculous comeback or the injury was misreported who even knows you never hear some you never hear someone has a boo-boo on their meniscus right yeah he got back a small cut against meniscus one Band-Aid will fix that thing up yeah Philly is four games next week so Paul Reed definitely a strong add last night in Utah 7:10 and 4 two blocks one steal as a starter this year 127 and 350 percent shooting 1.4 blocks 1.2 steals let's not over complicate this thing just Adam this weekend yeah he's up to 43% Ross roster now so you want to move fast if you're gonna scoop up Reed  great hustle guy I'm gonna start with someone we've mentioned frequently the last two years Santi aldama of your Memphis Grizzlies who's only 27% rostered look no one is healthy on this Memphis Grizzlies roster he does qualify as a center and forward on both Yahoo and ESPN that flexibility can be really helpful aldama ranks 76 the last 14 days and nine category leaks he's only 27% rostered as of about an hour ago Friday morning last four games almost 15 points over seven rebounds 3.3 triples One stock while shooting 48% from the field he started in the last six appearances Memphis does only have three games though but rest of the season this Grizzly's depth chart it's a mass unit body's will be playing I think we could be talking you know the end of the season about the massive  Twin Towers of Santee Old Dominion and Vince Williams I'm with you can aldama he has a sometimes he's up and down you know the minutes aren't always there sometimes this production's kind of weird is usage fluctuates I think really depending on matchup but at this point with the way that yeah right he's all they got and this Tillman injuries lingering I don't think his knee ever got healthy know that's just seems so weird though the end and he's out and he's out so anybody that can walk might be playing for these Memphis Grizzlies I'm with you Shannon let's go to your first waiver wire pickup this player has become an unexpected favorite of the Friday waiver wire segment Aaron Nesmith Swingman for the Indiana Pacers he was 54% rostered yesterday that's up to 59% as of this morning you know we have to keep bringing them up because he keeps playing better and his value keeps increasing he's been a top 20 player over the past week averaging 19.4 points 7.8 rebounds four assists three trades 1.4 stocks in 35 minutes per game over the past five contest he is the player on the Pacers who clearly received the biggest boost in value from Bruce Brown going to Toronto I highly recommend picking him up in 12 Team league I think even has some value in 10 teams if you need production in those categories  I've been wagering the over on points and rebounds for East Smith for a few days now I have one on all those bets I keep waiting for Vegas to respond nice Smith has been fantastic playing as natural position a small Ford now they got spicy P there and little known fact he speaks with a bit of a list okay  I do I do want to bring up something we talked about Target tari Eason sorry for the hard transition their cat I'll talk about tari Eason earlier I think is Albert Chang in the chat said coach said Eason has done 2v to and could play next week we did find that Rapport and that which is true so you do have email doca saying that  Ethan could return next week again that's all that's all could and maybes and it's very much approaching the All-Star break on one hand don't be surprised if he returns next week and the other hand don't be surprised if he's out past the All Star break so we just need more information as that continues but he's pretty weak to weeks last day to day at this point my second free agent suggestion Gary Trent of the Toronto Raptors this is very specific if you are in a category League this is for you points leagues you only have to think about this he's been the starting five since the Seahawk trade averaging 15.6 points and 3.93 in 28 minutes he shooting about 58% on threes so expect that to go basically to like three threes a game but he's a great three Specialists and the Raptors are on a four game week so if that's what you need pick them up and the Raptors have almost practically made it to the fact that they're pulling the plug at this point so don't be surprised if the injuries keep piling up you know guys get dings they sit out Gary Trent keeps playing 30 plus minutes and jacking threes they trade Bruce Brown and now there's even more shots available for Gary Trent to keep jacking  right all right Ken who is your second suggestion uh we're going to the well again one more time back court of Chicago Bulls I owe to soon move the Illinois product he ranks number 43rd over the last 14 days and nine category League's posting an impressive 16 and a half points per game over two and a half stocks and shooting 60% from the field looks exactly I mean is still hurt and we keep wondering if he's going to get traded I'm frankly for these Bulls the pool plug on this veteran team that can't win I will warn you bulls have only three games next week but I think to Sumo is going to be their starting point guard for quite some time I would check also make sure you check Max druce Bruce brown or Cam Johnson those guys all have four game weeks coming up but longer term I like to soon move as I think you mentioned last week Alex for the Bulls I think I think I did yeah those are good suggestions though for streaming options as well as soon but we get we got like questions about cam Johnson recently do I drop him at cetera but you 100% constraint of it unfortunately weeks Shannon need threes that's what he does that's what yes Shannon who's your guy  yeah my second suggestion is precious the chewa forward center for the New York Knicks 24% roster in Yahoo League precious than a top 75 player over the past week he's earned three straight starts with OG anunoby and Julius Randle out Julius Randle is out for at least another two to three weeks oh geez probably gonna return soon but it's kind of to be determined what the Knicks will do with that starting lineup they could easily go bigger have precious start at the four have OG at the at the three move Josh Hart to the bench it's kind of to be determined I do believe freshest will continue to see an increase role during the next two to three weeks with Randall I either way so he is a short-term rental but the past three those three starts they've made so far 38 minutes per 13 points 8.7 rebounds 1.7 blocks 1.3 steals  you know when he had that clutch tip in last night to help the Knicks win in the last minute I thought oh my goodness Tibbs has found a younger Taj Gibson oh my God they did again bye I know they have an older Dodge Gibson the actual Taj Gibson but he's yeah she was a lunch box Nick I could see how Tibbs would love that guy we'll see he also had a very bad turnover down the stretch that looks like looked like Tibbs wanted or if his head off Jim's down yeah yeah I agree with you Sharon I look I don't think that she was gonna start with oh geez back but he was seeing like 20 five minutes around you know before OG went out so well I mean no Randall for a while no heart no Mitchell Robinson for the end of the season they've been grinding hartenstein to a nub like it'd be good to have another big  unfortunately I do have to recommend my long chat which is called oh please thank you bring on the booze I love it  2% rostered when I wrote this up last night four games for the 76ers that's up to 2.2% now oh thank you Joel embiid look I look and take me to say it I believe firmly that he tore his meniscus and that he will be out at least three weeks that's not officially been reported yet long story short other times indeed has been out the municipal up and down from Bamba but he's gonna be an extended absence I think they will need Bamba for about 15 to 20 minutes a night Paul Reed can get in foul trouble please keep your expectations to a bear Mega but last night mobile 4 Points nine rebounds of three blocks and when he's seen double digits this season 7 points six rebounds one assist 2.7 stocks so if you are in a deep League I absolutely grab them at least at least just a stream this week at the very minimum hi there are numerous rotisserie leaks that I'm in where blocks are a key category to try to chase down at this time of year and good luck ever finding them on the waiver where it's always going to be via trade  not with Mo Bamba even in limited minutes I mean he had three blocks last night he had three in 18 minutes against Portland on the 29th of January three blocks in 19 minutes that is the one thing he can do even in limited minutes  Ken who is your long shot my long shot mentioned earlier in the show by Shannon is ball cool balli 19 year old rookie guard for your Washington Wizards look Jordan Poole and tyus Jones have been terrible  the 19 year old Cola got the start Wednesday with pool was sick he put up a sweet 19.4 rebound to his game with three stocks stocks are going to be his calling card look this is the rare future asset for these Washington Wizards who should be in full tank mode to get as high a lottery as many Lottery balls as possible and remember the Wizards traded up to get cool aboli at the number seven pick in this Summer's draft this is the perfect time to throw a ton of minutes of cool Bali look this is the long shot section you might hurt your field goal percentage but he could have a really nice upside I'm surprised he's only 9% roster but it's just I think people have slowly it's slowly fallen off as people have lost faith and if you were stashing him and you are in the bottom half your league at some point you just needed numbers and get a lot of them go but now is the point where there's there's some value and risk-taking for sure and you know Ty's Jones would make a lot of sense for the Wizards to trade frankly oh yeah deadline so minutes could open up shortly and if they deals you're not going to be able to get cooler Bali and Washington Wizards management please trade the Milwaukee Bucks to live right please just do it yeah I that is a natural well give you we'll give you a second round pick that will that will be 57 it'll be awesome  okay Shannon who is your long shot yeah our last recommendation for the week another guy we talked about before cam Whitmore guard forward for the Rockets 24% rostered Camp Whitmore has been just tearing it up and limited minutes top 90 player over the past week and only 20 minutes per game over the past five contests he is averaging 18.4 point six rebounds and 2.83 pointers I also believe he has considerable upside in the Steels Department that really hasn't been the case over the past dozen or so games he doesn't have that many he's only averaging point six Steals on the season but we've seen it in spirits where he'll have a few steals in a game or in the in the in the summer league in particular he was crushing it in on the defensive side had a steel and a half in college still game in college so I do think there's some upside in that category I kind of view him as a saddiq bey  type player with maybe higher upside once he does see 30 plus minutes for game  that's sounds good we can move on to all potential drops segment one name I want to bring up Harrison Barnes if you if you pick them up I hope you got two maybe three good games out of them because it might be over now I will say past two games for him shooting the ball have been horrible but the Shire attempts are still up okay so if you're in a deep enough League like if you're in a 16 Team league and someone was like ah he's done and dropped him I actually don't hate just picking them up to see for like a game like a daily daily transactions leak or something but  yeah it's it's we won this from for drops in general remember you got four teams with only two games next week so Utah Portland Minnesota Denver you know Walker in Portland if you took a flyer on him but you really need some immediate production now might be the time to let him go I'm trying to thinking oh Shannon can I get an opinion on Jayden ivy  did Ivy that's tough one I do expect the Pistons to make some kind of move before the deadline that could free up minutes for Jade and Ivy or I mean basically the only way to free up Minister Jane Ivy is really for the Pistons front office to say here are eight players that you get to utilize for the remainder of the Season Monte if you give Monty Williams anymore than that he will take minutes away from Jane Ivy it's just a fact it's a truth hi  I  I don't think he's droppable yet he is still seeing he played 35 and 29 minutes past two games he's still in the starting lineup you know it's just when you have Alec Burks coming off the bench if he has a hockey it's gonna eat into Ivy's minutes on a given night but Ivy's been pretty solid even in the past four games where his Productions dipped a little bit 28 minutes per 13 points three and a half boards 3.3 assists and two three-pointers per game I think he's still I would be a surprise if he doesn't average 30 minutes for game for the remainder season  well that's the end of our waiver wire segment now let's talk about our good friends at FanDuel yes FanDuel who sponsors our Friday NBA DFS chat segment here on this show  but they want to talk about the NFL Super Bowl baby hey you can tackle millions of prizes for FanDuel fantasy contests if you're new to Fantasy the Super Bowl is a great time to get in on the action because right now new customers got a 100% deposit match of up to $100 playing fantasy for huge cash prizes on FanDuel is fun and exciting just draft your lineup and watch your team a move up the leaderboard I'm kind of high on George Kittle the Super Bowl Shannon who are you sticking in your DFS lineups for the Super Bowl one thing I do not recommend is going with Brock Purdy as your MVP choice if you're playing in the 2.2 million NFL big game ball 1 million to first place on FanDuel Brock Purdy is a fraud we all saw it in the past two games against  you know that the past two routes of playoffs he is not good and Casey's defense is underrated they've been the best piece of that KCT Team all season best defense Patrick Holmes ever had they are going to pressure pretty enough for him to make some of his silly throws and he's not gonna get lucky and have it bounce off a defender's head and receiver catch that the two yard line against the Chiefs so do not go with party at the MVP I'm going with the KC stack in that contest and I'm excited to watch them prove party is a frog  okay well with that let's go to the FanDuel Friday DFS segment gentleman  who are your picks for tonight's DFS action the 10 game slate today Heist over unders Sacramento at Indiana not a big surprise 248 and a half Phoenix at Atlanta another game that we are not surprised about the over under being 248 and a half all so Shannon  where are you turning first on this slate  wolf it's  there there are numerous options that are appealing but it it is really hard for me to get away from that Indiana Sacramento  game I like both sides of it I have some exposure to Darren Fox on the Sacramento side Keegan Murray as well and then Nesmith who we talked about earlier still pretty affordable on both DFS sites and he is performing really well so I  it's gonna be hard for me to not try to work more players in from that that contest into my lineup another game that actually has a lower over under that I like is the Charlotte OKC game there's just good value on both sides of that Charlotte you know lamelo ball probably unlikely to play William still out here we're still out so Charlotte's going to be looking for guys like Brandon Miller miles Bridges step up shoulder bigger load PJ Washington Off the Bench and then on the OKC side seeing what they do with Jalen Williams out it'd be interesting Kendrick Williams started the most recent game but then I don't believe he he lasted the entire game I think he actually came off the bench in the second half so does that mean we see Aaron Wiggins get more run maybe maybe case on Wallace it's really okay to be determined what OKC is going to do but they could adjust the starting lineup before tonight's latex  yeah Miller's tough for me because he had a hot streak where he was really efficient for like four games yeah a terrible game like he's efficiency has been way down lately the assists aren't there but at the same time past three games so Ricky 7 minutes 39 minutes 38 minutes and obviously efficiency doesn't count in DFS so at some point on FanDuel 6900  he's a solid I think he's a solid won't be an easy matchup because they are 16 point underdogs going into OKC but that that probably will not stop Brandon Miller from playing a ton of minutes miles Bridges with a good game if Jalen Williams is out  I mean miles Bridges is just he's just kind of been it's kind of been doing his thing you know like I don't know how else to explain it Bridges is like a walking 35 to 45 fantasy points every single night at this point he said he's had a couple big games with with mellow out as well I mean he's topped he's basically he's averaged 56 fantasy points over the past three 67 and a half in the latest game I do expect he'll have another big performance I mean the problem is Charlotte  doesn't really have a chance to win the blowout potentials higher than normal because they do not have a point guard in their starting or they haven't rolled with a point guard either the past two games after having is Smith's make one spot start it's my guess is they go that route again to have McGowan's Miller and bridges really handling the ball for them  you know you know we try not to talk too much about injuries in this segment because stuff is fluid but I will mention there are a lot of questionable guys for today's slates so Toronto has quickly Barrett portal all questionable Halliburton still going to be on a minutes restriction probably for that Sacramento Indiana game which is on the second half of a back-to-back for Indiana so we have heard anything about Albert not playing we have heard Jones and Zion Williamson questionable up and of course the Grizzlies have more players out than in yeah this Phoenix Atlanta game as well you know you touched on it the Indiana Sacramento over under Phoenix Atlanta is at the same over under  I think there's plenty options in this game it's again I think teams will be flying up the up and down the court like Durant you know his  his shock attempts have been a lot lower lately Booker is kind of taken over for for the sons the past was this five games for Durant he's averaging only 13.6 shot attempts schools still scoring 20 points a game you know seven boards seven assists okay really feels like Booker is now the lead guy for the Suns  anything else you're targeting Shannon  yeah I mention him at the top of the show Jalen green has been on an absolute chair I think he is still underpriced giving his current hot streak 7600 on FanDuel and 70 or 68 on DraftKings obviously I like the 60 100 a lot more good luck finding a player who's averaged 50 fancy points over the past five games under 7000 on either site but that's the case the jailing green right now a couple of discounts Kula Bali who we mentioned earlier or specialty if Jordan Poole misses another game Gallinari for the Pistons you've got Isaiah Stewart's out muscala who started who earned the spot start for beef stew on Wednesday night is is out as well which means Gallinari is most likely getting the spot start tonight we'll see if money changes anything up Gallinari started the second half and placement of muscala on Wednesday I would really love to see a sar Thompson get that start but it's probably gonna be going Ari and Gail and Ari is super affordable 3300 on DraftKings not not very high on his ability to go out there and post a massive fantasy performance but in 23 minutes he had 30 fantasy points against Cleveland on January 31st so  it's possible and at that price it's hard to it to really it's hard not to plug into your line up Here Comes the Rooster I'm contractually obligated to say that Here Comes the Rooster  it is it is unbelievable that that we even have to talk about this I want  what more guys Memphis too Obama who can mentioned and then Scotty Pippen Jr earned a start at point guard he's got a couple decent games in a row his his Price salary has gone up on both sides but he'll be an option if he's getting another spot search tonight does he still marrying Jordan's ex-wife or what was that's Jordan's kid and Pippin sex wife yes okay yeah all right so sorry for that tangent I will say back to your jailing green pick most of the Raptors are like a game time decision for tonight too so green could really be facing a hobbled Raptor Squad  and Houston is much better at home so that's something to keep in mind as well  Sharon any parting thoughts before we wrap this up  just fade for rock party  they brought ferdi everybody Gallinari and the rooster go all in  okay Ken it is time for your old man rant ah Philly what are you doing with embiid who cares if he plays 65 games and wins another MVP he already has an MVP last year do you think the Joker wanted another MVP trophy or a championship you'll catch wanted a ring  Philly hasn't had a banner since 1983 with Dr J and Moses Malone I love those guys focus on the true prize Philly if indeed's knee hurts bench him and bead is a fragile piece of china he must be nurtured cared for and protected throughout the season because it's a big soft baby who cares if the Sixers win in January at the slightest hint of possible injury and Beads fragile bones need to sit the Sixers are five and a half games ahead of the play in tournament relax and rest and bead ah  I was just thinking about urinating compared to my Purdy slander like I would not do that slander 2 and beats face but I would do it pretty face  I I'm sure can I'm with you I pushing a guy with this injury history people try to his medical file doesn't fit in this room let yeah so like last year he was fairly healthy and then coming into the season everybody was trying to say well he's just healthy now he doesn't get hurt anymore like what last year could be the exception I yeah I don't know I feel like we've kind of gone back and forth on this injury thing now people are like well guys are hurt sit up but then before everybody was like well these guys should be playing through injuries so it's like  I the goalposts kind of move every time but if guys actually hurt if he's actually hurt he should sit I like the 65 game rule and I think you should have to play you know about 80% of the season to get one of these big prizes but if you're a teen just care about winning  yeah I think I think the problem comes like I think the 65 games are really good because you shouldn't sacrifice or you should we should highlight players in a specific season that we're available exactly but the part of the problem comes in when there are Financial incentives attached to winning Awards you think it can be so having a hard time getting by the rent is you know it's looking extra however many million dollars that can that can set forth multiple generations of your family  worried about the 13th generation he could hey you know whatever I
