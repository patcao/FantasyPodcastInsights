welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy it's Friday December 22nd 2023 Alex Perrault here with Shannon McEwen and Ken k train Crites  let's jump right into the news the Western Conference leading Timberwolves beat the LeBron Les Lakers last night 118 to 111 but they did fail to cover the spread for those who care all minnesotans starters at least 14 or more points but the real story here Karl Anthony towns heard his left knee and the final stages of the game still waiting on some more information but he kind of limped off and look like he could Bend his knee very well  kind of like me when I get out of every morning Minnesota plays the king's next shit I wasn't the one to make that joke I'm sorry I stole it Minnesota next plays the king's in Sacramento on Saturday  is it Nas Reid time Shannon  yeah of course of course it's not every time that's much too Alex's Joy I mean not read his been fantastic so you know obviously keep an eye on the news around cap but if cat misses any time yeah now it's reading absolutely fantastic on a permanent basis and he's going to crush it if he needs to get more minutes in lieu of cat missing missing any games yeah well we'll talk about later yeah so I'm not gonna spoil that but but I think it is time so sorry so sorry but Shannon does not  get to celebrate the end of the Pistons losing streak as Detroit Falls 119 111 at home to a short-handed Utah Squad Detroit has now lost 25 straight former piston Kelly Olynyk lit it up for with 27 points 3 boards and six dimes last night Utah was missing four of their top seven scores or playing on the second of a road back to back  hey Jason Ivy not bad in his second straight start five stocks seven helpers a nine of 16 shooting but he did have five t o's Tio's a general problem for the Pistons their third worst in the NBA and turned over his game John Collins started for Utah He's still kind of stinks that Amiga 13 points on ugly four of 12 shooting did have nine boards and three stocks but really back to these Pistons Shannon wrong but we're at the Piston's favored at certain points during the day yesterday yes yes which I'm sure has to be a rarity this season I don't watch the lines closer to know how many times they've been favored three okay so so probably against the Wizards maybe against the early season Hornets which is one of their wins and then against the Jazz the visiting Jazz who were very short-handed and have also been cleaned pretty horrible basketball play you know the Jazz are 11 and 18 but I would argue they're not even that good and they're horrible on the road like that they get all those wins at home actually and as much as I like to Grape about Monty Williams and his rotations and his starting lineup decisions the Jazz fans with Will Hardy have plenty to great about as well you know it was nice to see the clinic get it have a big game not a surprise either really against this piston Squad you know when you have to match up against Marvin money bags Bagley and  Isaiah Stewart there's not much to worry about but seeing a Linux get starts over Walker Kessler is my numbing to me for a team that's not going anywhere and also for a team that started Walker Kessler two starts the previous two games Kessler started played over 30 or more minutes in each outing that's played well exactly and even last night against the Pistons on the defensive end he played really well he was blockage he had a couple blocks that didn't count because of fouls that were called let the Jazz and plus minus last night a plus 17 point differential and yet  Off the Bench super weird super weird but yeah on the Piston side there was a little bit to like Kade another gigantic game 28 points six rebounds Sorry Seven rebounds 10 assists three stocks two for six from down town got to the line seven times hit six of them as Ken mentioned Jayden Ivy solid game two major turnovers and had some bonehead plays but yeah we played fairly well my main issue  is it's freaking Monty and his rotations you know yeah he had a six the second most five used five-man rotation I was gonna get here ya go was Birch Wiseman livers Sasser and as our Thompson five bench players on the floor they played a total of six minutes together during the final stretch when they entered the game is both times when they entered the game they would weeds would crumble or or the Gap would further between Utah and the Pistons I really do believe the having those five on the floor late in the third quarters what ended up costing the Pistons the game it's just unbelievable to me that a coach doesn't look at analytics figure out that that the you know you need to have by zdanowicz Ivy Cade someone on the floor with some of your reserves you can't just roll out a bunch of guys who are shooting 25% or less from three with no available Playmakers no defense in the middle  it's it's it's getting hard guys it's getting hard to be a businessman I what I thought you were gonna bring up but is is you make a good point regardless you want our daily lineups page a very popular MBA daily lineup State page I rode a wire where there's on off Court stats and projected minutes and everything like that you can actually check to see how many minutes the starting lineup has played together throughout the season and see the usage rates and I discovered that the starting lineup that the Pistons throughout had played a combined two minutes together this season  and the starting lineup that the Jazz put out had played a combined one minute together this season and I just I don't really I don't really get the logic there  I'm sorry Shannon this was this was the one  let's let's go to Rozier news Alex take us to OKC I thought you said Rose the air news at first but no Rosie your News Oklahoma City ends the Clippers nine game winning streak last night with a 1340 as predicted on the RotoWire MBA show and Serious XM and ba radio Brava SGA had 34 8 with four assists he had six stocks and only one turnover in 32 minutes the man just puts up MVP numbers and his sleep Chet Holmgren had the big highlight pass to himself off backboard dunk he traveled that was a travel you can't leave it foot  you know they don't call that that pivot foot leave anymore if you shoot the ball right away kind of drives me insane to be honesty you know I will never do that during his family yeah right he keep his foot down I'd be in the league right now in 6464 Hakeem Olajuwon if I knew I could do that Chet had 236 and 7 with 9 of 11 shooting with no blocks which is interesting I didn't I didn't bring this up on the XM show but the Clippers actually allow I think it's the fewest blocks to centers and I was too scared too scared to take chat under one and a half blocks well he's leading he's fourth in the NBA in blocks with 2.7 game he's been amazing but for the Clippers here no Kauai which was his first missed game amazing amazing and he say alright got to hit ya hip issue and Paul George returned as well he had missed a little bit of time in nine category League's the Clause 5th in total stats total stats you always have to look at per game for the club but now no total stats suddenly he's Cal Ripken what I want to bring up player from this  game who's actually first in per game stats depending on the ranking system you use but basketball monster SGA is first overall per game value for Fantasy this season now my question is are we ever going to see this guy hit three pointers at a an All-Star or like a fantasy star caliber I I'm just amazed that he's only hitting just under 1 3-pointer per game he had one last night it was just a few years ago he hit two three-pointers per game I'd seen pull up confidently I mean it's hard to complain about the guy who's probably the best fantasy player or definitely a top three fantasy player in most formats but I really want to see more 3-pointers from them I think the better question for me Shannon both the better question is when does OKC replace Josh giddey with someone who can shoot from outside  yeah  yeah that's all fair question we'll see what they do at the deadline I want to be shocked if they move him because they'll if they don't they'll pay him sooner than later and you know I don't think he's necessarily a great fit with SGA and Jaylen Williams but I mean you're right jacket I mean he's not like a terrible three-point shooter by any stretch even even when he's stopped shooting them over the past two years he's still you know 30% basically my only I want to say a concern um but it's like if he's shooting more threes is he shooting less free throws and are the free throws at 91% actually more valuable than any threes he would hit sure can't this is you can't grind the bus GA come on hey I I have first and per game value as you said that's not I know he's great I got his first now before we move on to the next segment also one one other big game that we didn't talk about okay yeah the Pelicans and my boy Kramer feat Drake Started he had a spot start last night Zion was out and Trey went off in 28 minutes went 10 for 16 from the floor six for 10 from downtown 28 points four rebounds three assists one steal one block oh dream Murphy what was on what was on  no he can't what was Zions injury chubbiness is that the illness what was  the 10 I was to see I want to see Ken and Zion side by side with their shirts off  all right I'm 54 Millions I don't ya and can and can get two weeks to gain weight um okay before we move on to some fan feedback some listing your questions we do have to talk about our friends at Underdog please Underdog it's the number one fantasy platform for NBA

questions through the YouTube and Twitter shows our first one comes from Roger  he says should I drop who should I drop  between the wall oh my who's thank you Cole Anthony or Kyle Lowry I know where I would go about you gentlemen where do you go between the wizard magic or heat guards  um you know this is actually not this is a pretty in my opinion pretty difficult question I think below is a really interesting long term hold  and I'd be a little worried more worried about Lowry and Cole Anthony he's long-term value but they're better right now  Shannon do you have a strong opinion on this yeah I I think for me it's between cooler Bali and Lowry Cole Anthony I'm gonna hold for right now he's coming off a big game last night against the Bucs 46 fantasy points 18 points 11 rebounds six assists you had no sugs and no folks in that game for the magic co-head me you know it's tough his Productions up and down because he's coming off the bench even while the magic are shorthanded in the back court they're bringing Colony Off the Bench but he's been productive in that role averaging 15 points four rebounds 3.7 to assist and awesome  so right now I'm keeping cool Anthony Kyle Lowry  I'm siding with keeping Kyle Lowry I I like cool about for the second half of the season and if Washington moves out some of their older players create more playing time for Thule Bali but I do like Colorado Ali slightly more he's riskier you know he dropping Lowry no no I'm dropping cooler Bali I'm taking Lowry I value Lowry more immediately so cool about he's getting the cut for me  but it is closed between cooler Bali and Lowry  all right next question gentlemen from James  thinking of trading boots for DeMar DeRozan needs to help his free throw percentages thoughts on a douche for drozin swap an inner Bulls swap if you will  that's kind of an interesting inner team trade I think those guys are about equal value I mean in the past I would have said like definitely take the DeRozan side but the rose hasn't been playing well this as well this year and to me I I think  I view them fairly equally this year and if you if you need one particular help in category or a position I think that's fine to do yeah production wise they're they're pretty equal they're both are in that 50 to 60 range on a per game value this season so really like Alex said if it's one category you're looking for then you could you could be safe making that trade You're Gonna Lose a little bit in three pointers I mean boots Butch doesn't really hurt you with with free throw percentage though he's at 86.5% and the boots is your starting center make sure you get some block shots from your forwards or other utility players all right gentlemen that does it for the  fan feedback section  which means it is time for the waiver wire  the waiver wire the meat of the podcast sandwich if you are new to the show or just love hearing me say this every week the waiver wire works like this we get two regular Waiver Wires suggestions that means they are rostered and less than 50% of leagues typically Yahoo League's and then one long shot each a player who must be roster and fewer than 25% of League's if as far as a game Count goes  warning next week because the Cavs and the Clippers only have two games  so you know you're looking at Isaac okoro we're looking at Sam Merrill making some other you know tough choices just be just keep in mind they're not necessarily great streamers but maybe worth looking into I'll start things off with what we saw in Minnesota last night Karl Anthony towns limped off the court  so we don't know 100% what that injury is  so look into that or don't look into that see what they say you physically should not be looking at a car Anthony towns knee injury that would be that would be bizarre do not do your own research nasri and Kyle Anderson are guys you can probably explore adding off the waiver wire you're not read 67% rostered  Kyle Anderson 26% roster so if you have her shows out about 50% so I'm not breaking the rules read as a starter last year averaged 17 and 7 two assists a stealing a Block 33 fantasy points in 26 minutes Kyle Anderson has a starter last year 116 and 6 with August stealing a block 30 fantasy points in 31 minutes you know I don't know 100% know what they'll do here it's possible they start Nas and then give Kyle Anderson some more minutes it's possible they start Kyle Anderson and then bring knives Off the Bench so he can play some backup behind Rudy gobert I think either way both of these guys are seeing more minutes and more usage  and I didn't know Kyle Anderson he's shooting a career worst 10%  from the from behind the arc this season 10% it really does it's a problem for their offense I know they won last set against the Lakers but they really need a catch and shoot guy at the trade deadline and they should make the moves they're top of the west but I like those picks and I'm sure though you're not cheering for Karl Anthony towns injury Alex Wright  no I mean I look I wish I was read we'll play 40 minutes a game next to Carl Anthony towns and go bare but apparently that's not good basketball what do I know all right Ken who are you going to  I'm going with I think we've had him in the waiver wire section  four times a year for the last four years Donte divincenzo of your New York Knicks he's only roster on 11% of teams on Yahoo it was inserted as a starter on December 8th at which point he's been averaging 12 points almost four rebounds two assists and 1.3 steals with great shooting percentage the team is in with injuries so it means even more Monster minutes for even shenzo we know Tibbs loves to play guys and the Knicks have four games next week I love Donte divincenzo is a streaming option get you some threes three steals just nice production across the board for four games next week  yep Oh Shannon muted I got this guy's I'm a pro all right good recommendation we're gonna stick in New York okay we talked about the Sky last week but I think it deserves another mention giving the developments Isaiah hartenstein it it is finally heart in time with my boy heart and Stein with Mitch Robb out for the year Jericho Sims is now injured as well he's going to be out at least a week the Knicks have to play heart and Stein he's first he was forced into the starting lineup and he he's performing well I over the past four games 32 minutes per 7.5 points 11.3 rebounds and 2.5 Blocks he's a monster with field goal percentage 68% free throw percentage is really the biggest concern 57% over those four games but in less and less New York brings in  another Center I would have to imagine heart and Stein holds on that role for at least as long as Simpsons out but my guess is he played well enough to keep Sims at Bay and and really sees this role for the first time maybe ever heart and title will get a prolonged and starting lineup there's a lot of Believers out there a lot of hype within the fantasy basketball industry with heart and Stein I am not a believer but he's actually gonna get minutes now you gotta get the minutes so hopefully his succeeds he's rostered in 54% of Yahoo leagues if he's available in your league give him a look well we're going to see Randall at Center a lot too which is another reason I'm kind of keen on Devon shenzo but hardenstein  yeah we know he'll be nice across multiple categories just what she had done a little more when he started last year at the same kind of when Mitch Robinson got hurt again bummer Robinson's up for the year that stinks for his managers  it does um one other thing that stinks for managers if you dropped them is that now Taylor Horton Tucker is playing really well 45% roster from the Utah Jazz he did Saga sit out last night's win over the Pistons with foot soreness some people would say that's probably why they won that game but in the nine prior games Taylor Horton Tucker he's averaged 16 points 5 assists two rebounds 1.6 steals shooting 50 44/75  Clarkson Jordan Clarkson and keyonte George are still nursing injuries  Clarkson like a thigh injury he's going to be real evaluated soon but I don't think there are any rushed to bring him back George is kind of day-to-day a jazz of three games next week we we know the talent Horton Tucker story  playing while he's hot playing while he's getting minutes and then when he goes back to playing like 18 20 minutes you can you can probably drop them and most leaks  go ahead Ken well before I go into my second pick fans if you like our videos please hit like And subscribe below please I have another repeat name as well Derek Jones guard forward for your Dallas Mavericks only rostered in 22% of squads on Yahoo he's been starting all season battle a little quad injury last week which drops some of his management percentages but look last 10 games over 13 points almost four rebounds 2.3 stocks while shooting a very nice 49% from the field almost hitting two threes a game and shooting a very nice 83% from the free throw percentage free throw line  the Mavericks have four games next week so much like Devin chenzo Jones is also a very safe productive across the board streaming option next week I think so yeah I mean with the  Dallas is just they cannot be healthy and as long as he's playing minutes even if you're in a daily leak he he's an a shallower daily Jones is a great pickup for tonight Dallas we'll talk about later is absolutely decimated right now Lucas out Kyrie's this just for Friday's game yeah excellent and Luca and Kyrie all out so it would not be surprised to see Jones have a big game on Friday my second pick  this is the name everyone will be familiar with Grayson Allen guard wingman for the Phoenix Suns 35% rostered on Yahoo Grayson Allen has surprisingly been solid pretty much all year I almost recommended him last week but he was dealing with a minor injury he's playing a career high 33 minutes per game  for the Suns averaging 12 points 4.6 rebounds just under one steals 0.9 and what are 2.23 pointers made great percentage is 48.6 which from the floor which is a career high and 89.1% from the free throw line I just 12 teams 14 teams special if you need three pointers Grayson Allen absolutely deserves to be rostered over the past week he is the 52nd ranked player on a per game value basis 10 teams probably can avoid him unless you really are desperate for three-pointers but 12 team and 14 team leads he should 100% be roster  thank you Shannon excellent advice Alex who is your long shot pick I think you're going with a former Celtic  former Celtic Aaron neesmith 21% roster and Yahoo  last seven games for him 14 points 3 rebounds two and a half stocks 504% from the field in 26 minutes the biggest issue for him kind of his limiting factor continues to be as follow trouble 4.7 fouls per 306 this was all in an issue for him in Boston but Obi topping just is not he's not going to happen is just passive yeah he's passive he's just not that good can't rebound he's six nine get a rebound Nesmith is like one of the Pacers only positive Defenders as well besides Myles Turner maybe maybe Bruce brown but he's undersized Pacers have three games next week so it's not ideal but again these Smith if you're in a 14 Team league I think it's fun to just keep them on your bench and just kind of see what this turns into oh God help your stocks help your stocks and nice percentages this season he's been really good yeah he's closing out games too like he's not starting over topping but niece Smith does close out most games for the Patriots if you watch those New Balance adds the back right Nesmith  you can just barely see him at the end New Balance signed into a deal because they're in New England when he was first trumpet of the Celtics perfecting it is he doing like lateral movement calling drills he's at the end they all cross arms and do like a cool team photo and he's back right  behind a legitimate star shoulder maybe Murray I can't remember  all right now nice I love that long shot I have a super duper long shot if you need point guard help Craig undrafted rookie Craig Porter for your Cleveland Cavaliers only rostered in 5% of leagues out there look the calves only have two games left next week this is a speculative pick if you have room on your bench but notice it was Porter and not Carousel Levert that was starting at point guard for the calves now the Garland's out multiple weeks with a jaw injury Porter started the last two games at 11 assists last night and I lost the Pelicans if three blocks the prior game versus Utah anyway big minutes in point in both games  excuse me point guards are valuable  my apologies everyone there is a first ever podcast Sneezy been doing this for like five years for five years yeah finally got up and report cards are valuable in deep deeply think about Craig's man I thought you're having a stroke always the possibility always I mean speaking stroke Craig Porter is great if you're a DFS player you're probably very familiar with Craig Porter he had monster roster ship the past two nights starting in place of Donovan Mitchell I love that suggestion Ken my long shot and our final waiver wire pickup of the show is trayce Jackson Davis he he said hey I've loved that you love it Ken and I love you tjd is 19% rostered on Yahoo you know he hasn't been  he is the guy who is stepped up for the Warriors in the front Court which with Raymond out you know has it been confined loonie coming gets been solid sorich a lot of people you start was yeah he was big part of the rotation early in season had a very strong shooting stretch but trayce Jackson Davis has just kind of come out of nowhere he's providing the warriors with a defense of presents in the post that they really don't get with Looney and the most recent game or back-to-back games actually he is top 35 fantasy points in those two games he's played 23 and a half minutes 12 points 10.5 rebounds one steal and two blocks I think this kid could really start to get earn more minutes and steal those minutes from Looney even after Draymond returns so he's an immediate streaming option for 12 team 14 teams and I do believe that he could you know he's shown he's the last few games at least he's productive even with limited minutes so I I think it's worth taking a chance on him see if he can stick in the rotation long term he was a victim in the draft of Ages like they punished him for playing four years in Indiana his senior season at Indiana was awesome 21 Points 11 rebounds and almost three blocks a game  shocking he fell that late but hey kudos to the Warriors  yeah he he's averaging 1.1 fantasy points per minute that's a great Mark already one of the better offensive rebounders in the MVA we need a little bit more of a sample for that but look for him let's end with some drop suggestions and I'm going to suggest a controversial one that I thought would be a hot pick up but Charis Levert  first of all the Cavs only have two games next week  but unlike Porter Levert has not really exploded with all those injuries to the Cavalier guards kind of a disappointment and then I'll throw out their Malik Beasley he's hot early bucks only have three games next week ah because it was a little dinged up so I think your pro Beasley right Alex  oh I'm not probably Beasley okay  in general in real life I mean look he's fine as a shooter but there's a reason the Box defense is bad and it's actually in the back court and yes it's Damian Lillard but also be as Beasley again  he's fine as a 3-point specialist but yeah they would drop again using using Beasley is your perimeter stopper on the defense guy I see him try to guard gate against the first game against Pistons was hilarious to me I I think Beasley it's kinda same thing we seen in the past right when we've recommended him a couple times this season if you need three pointers he's gonna be a solid option 10 teams probably not 12 team 14 teams could still hold just depends on your format but if you don't need 3-pointers he's not really worth rostering I'm gonna push back on more I think he's a hole for his long as Garland and Mitchell out what's Mitchell returns which will be soon Mitchell's just dealing with the an illness right now but Levert probably last night's game take it with a grain of salt is the second game of a back-to-back I know it was kind of out of hand New Orleans was pretty much running away with it so Levert only played 23 minutes off the bench the previous two games before that he played 27 minutes in each game average 17 and a half points five rebounds six assists 1.5 Steals and 2.53 pointers so yeah ABS only have two games next week I know I get it I get it the honeymoon's got to be over with Goga Batista got the dnp the other day for the magic with Carter back  and when you guys added Caleb Martin to the notes  I did um because he's he's been down lately past two games he saw 22 minutes on the 18th two days ago against a magic he saw 18 minutes and he scored a combined seven points eight rebounds three assists two blocks or excuse me three steals zero blocks  I don't know if he's a if he's like ah you must drop him but I would just keep an eye  on what's going on with the rotation Jimmy Butler's out tonight so he could have a big game but I would I would just be careful be careful in his way way way it's Kayla margins definitely something to watch he is still starting Jimmy Butler also missed the most recent game so it was concerned to see Martin only play 18 minutes but yeah Triple J and Tyler hero being back or the two big changes there all right someone that is the end of our waiver wire segment we now move on to our Friday DFS picks with Alex and Shannon Alex take us away for tonight's six games late  yeah it's a relatively you know usually there's more games on a Friday but only six games today is the NBA stacks Christmas Eve okay there are actually a surprise injuries on this late I feel like guys were getting ruled out left and right I'm like these real injuries or these  I'm going home for Christmas early injuries I think the biggest stuff that's kind of happening Don chiche will not play and exit will not play in addition to like basically talk about their roster and then we have Jimmy Butler off from Miami obviously you have Draymond Green now for golden state nurkic is out for the Suns as well those are some of the bigger injuries but on this slate in general Schengen was what was the first place where's the first place you turn honestly the new kitchen jury was the first one I looked at and I you know I believe  that the spot start is going to go to Drew Eubanks for the Phoenix Suns he's the guy he's the more productive option as far as their Backup backup Big Mango Alex helped me out with this name chimiche me too  close to me too yeah that's you all right because I didn't want to be involved in any of the me too stuff so that's good that's good all right so Drew Eubanks as the guy who's really stepped up when she was limited and I played a full compliment of minutes earlier in the season they brought in Hugh Banks kind of as a nice piece who could roll out and play 25-30 minutes and the production not really drop off we saw that with Eubanks with like Portland last year I think Eubanks is the one who's going to get the starting nod at center with nurkic out and he is an absolute steal on both DraftKings and FanDuel if he does get 28 30 minutes 4500 on DraftKings 4100 on FanDuel also on FanDuel he's powerful and Center eligible so you can get a little bit creative with your roster if you plug them in here also no Washington and golden state has the highest over under tonight this is a Jordan Poole Revenge game situation you only get one of these one of these a year cross-conference all right so take your chance to how many toes for pool tonight 6 I don't know I wonder what is prop is that I put the over under five and a half I'm taking I bet it's at 4 or something I'm taking the year the important question is how many feel goal attempts and I'm gonna say 36 they don't like hey I'm supposed to be taking those bad shots  I don't see his props up maybe is there is there some injuries we should be no I don't know they're scared I think they're scared the books are scared to take any action on Jordan Poole positive or negative yeah 246 over under in that game so keep that in mind when you're building your lineups if you just need a fill in for Pace but yeah I mean I think tonight you know if you're building your lineup I think it's gonna be difficult to avoid having Eubanks in there and I think I mean I don't think you mentioned him Jaden Hardy tonight for for the Dallas Mavericks who is 49 100 dollars on FanDuel like I mentioned Don just out Xmas out Josh Green is out Kyrie Irving is out Derek Lively also out so it's not going to be just Jake and Hari I assume Shannon as well you you're at least looking into Tim Hardaway and and Derek Jones no Hardy Hardy's in my lineup on both FanDuel and DraftKings Derek Jones and not as an option Tim hardaway's an option Grant Williams is an option the you know the only the only position or player I'm really not gonna go to in Dallas as gonna be at the at the pivot I'm not going with Dwight Powell okay I don't care you know if Cleveland were healthy he might be an option he's out too but Dwight all even you know he started the past game or two and just played 20 minutes for but he's not doing anything even the most recent game against the Clippers 17 minutes three points one rebound one assist he's just not he's not a guy who's gonna rack up a ton of fantasy points but anyone else on the Dallas roster and anyone who gets a starting nod certainly is going to be look worth a look those are really the two big teams Dallas and then the the what the Suns do at the five where I think you're gonna find good values you know we joke about Jordan Poole  and but  and revenge games let me be clear Revenge games are not a thing all right there's no statistical proof for evidence that players play better and revenge games but  if there's a type of dude who will have a Revenge game it's Jordan Poole so that I don't know percentage won't hurt you right no no and the fact that it's in Golden State you know it's it's an away game for pool he's going back to that Arena tribute video they got a tribute video you think queued up I there's no way right no way this is just straight it's dream on boom yeah it helped her at trayvon's out you know motivation I think it helps I think it helps because of Draymond Green is green kicked out of the building intimidation can he street clothes this game I don't know I don't know actually suspension rules and then you know outside of pool Tice Jones who we've many of us have complained about lately yeah he's been really hot lately he has topped he had a 51 Point Fantasy game a 63 Point Fantasy game and back-to-back 33-point fancy games he's 6600 on FanDuel I think he's worth a look as well it's not a great matchup against Golden State but then we get to go to the Golden State side and tjd trayce Jackson Davis he is 4600 on on DraftKings I actually think he's too expensive to consider on FanDuel but on DraftKings I love them at that rate kamminga coming off the decent game he's a guy who could have a nice outing as well but looking at the star players the expensive options for tonight there are two guys that it's hard for me to move off of first is Joel and bead who is the highest priced player on the Slate I rarely go with the highest price player but John bead is essentially two All-Star players in one right now from fancy perspective on DraftKings he is top 70 fantasy points three games in a row and even if you go back to to eight games he's averaging well over I'm sorry you go back to 10 or 11 games he's averaging well over 70 fancy points per game over the past eight to ten games absolutely fantastic I don't know how you can avoid him but I am probably gonna go with indeed on both both FanDuel and DraftKings tonight and then my last suggestion is Tyler hero he's looked fantastic and his two games that's coming back from injury 35 and a half fancy points in 44 fantasy points 33 and 35 minutes so the minutes you know he's not going to be in a limited role and Jimmy Butler's  gonna be out so with Jimmy Butler out Tyler hero always gets a nice boost and I like quite a bit for tonight's late yeah and be like a hero Point like the hero Point yeah and B has played Toronto twice already 311 and 8 are those averages with a block and a half it's very very good my only concern about the the hero point would be I worried he'd get the dejounte Murray treatment but you know again the usage is going to probably be so high that it may not actually matter I just saw Cade Cunningham get the job deshante Murray treatment and he went off for 65 fantasy points I think the Deontay Murray treatment is a fallacy I don't think I don't think it exists anymore whoa well you know you know even when you get Maria assigned to you you're still gonna wind up with Trey Young on some switches so it all balanced out you know right um okay I mean any final thoughts Shannon about covers it  well then it is time to go to Ken's old man rant  Oscars hung  afterwards for winning the in-season tournament are you me they won seven games  seven games that's not enough to get you passed round two of the playoffs and to prove how meaningless the IST is the Lakers of gone one in five since and now sit 10th in the Western Conference 10 I'm sure Jerry West and Magic Johnson are proud to share room in the Staples Center's Rafters with the IST Banner one by Austin Reeves and Tori and Prince  the Pistons are going to hang a banner with their next win so I I think I'm all for it I love you this was this was due for an old man rant you know this was that a spotlight ceremony and the black cloth that was pulled off of it as if they had just landed on the moon or something please  really good in five November I think we we avoided any severely mispronounced names there were a couple names checks know I really messed up the rookie for the wizard so I'm not even gonna say Kula Bali yeah and I don't even think I did you even try to say I I heard but like Christmas ham okay I have that out and then Matt too I I had met and well so is it exam or actually yeah no exam like like you're digging up a body he wasn't he wasn't sued thank you figure out why I was away I just want to show off the elf sweater but yeah I couldn't figure that out yeah thank you that makes sense okay uh thank you ruggie for joining us on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast presented by Underdog fantasy Kent take us out of here I do want to thank our
