welcome to the award-winning fantasy basketball podcast by RotoWire brought to you by Underdog fantasy and FanDuel today's Friday January 19th 2024 Alex barua here with Shannon McKeown and Ken k train Crites  all aboard  let's jump right into the news the shorthanded Indiana Pacers covid Sacramento and beat these suddenly struggling Kings 126 to 121 there was no Haliburton  no nem hard no see yakym  our guy the Cockroach TJ McConnell 20 points 10 dimes King's got only 16 points off their bench Harrison Barnes and 2 points and won't Rebound in 22 minutes although Kevin herder is kind of back glad Mike I'm glad Mike Brown realized that Chris Duarte sucks and just stop playing him yeah and it's just like let's just give her 39 minutes because you know he was rather have that seven Molly's seven triples seven triples yeah  yeah Shannon what you think of this this king's team they're kind of struggling you know last year was a was a big sort of breakout year for that when the playoffs they look good against cold in the state in the first round the 23 and 18 right now they're kind of in that that mix of like New Orleans Dallas Phoenix and kind of Utah and LA right now  yeah I mean it certainly hasn't been going as well as it did last year I think General consensus or at least in my mind is they played a little bit above their heads but 23 and 18 you're still above 500 seven games out from the number one seed no one's really running away with the West I mean Minnesota looks good 30 wins 30 and 11  but they're still in the mix I expect to be in the playoffs I just I also don't believe they were as good as they were last year you could still see them in from here they're probably going to be in the market to add some pieces Keegan Murray has kind of stepped up and claimed that number three role or if you want to say Malik monk still the number three role that will call Keegan Murray number four but he has stepped up he's having a better year I think we'll see continued growth from him so I mean if I'm a Kings fan in general I'm not worried  four straight losses I think they might be playing bound though we'll see pelicans Mavs and Kings fighting for those last two spots to avoid the plan uh Ken let's go to the next game last night yeah Jalen Bronson scores 41 on 14 of 27 shooting versus the woeful Wizards Donte divincenzo with 19 points guys should we always bet the over on guard scoring versus the Washington back court  maybe yeah but you buried the lead because Shannon's Marvin Bagley went for 20 and 11 which two Steals and three blinds after he was a concussion concussion yeah and for Gafford right away like right off the bus from Detroit and started well yeah he only other Center they have on the roster yeah that that exactly that's what he had worked for him is they just had no other centers they definitely would have went small you know even I mentioned this on previous shows but even gallon Ari was getting some minutes at the five for this Wizards team so it's not a surprise with Gafford out to see Begley get 39 minutes you know he is a guy where he's playing 35 Plus minutes he's got a probably put together a pretty impressive line I don't think it I all it does on the fantasy side is cloud Gafford and Begley's value moving forward because Gafford had his opportunity the first 40 games of the season and really wasn't able to run away with it so I expect vaguely will eat in the gaffer's time you know Gafford was already rarely topping 30 minutes anyways but Bagley will get some minutes to both get minutes they might even you know swap starts on occasion and both will have middling like 14 team value but 10 and 12 team leads long term I don't expect either to have much value for the immediate daily pickups Bagley obviously is an option while gaffords out  how does money how does money bags a professional NBA player go over five from the charity stripe how does that happen  I don't know because he maybe he shouldn't be being paid 13 million dollars in the first place there's a lot of team did the rest of the Wizards did not miss a free throw but money bags went over five little box score Oddity their Brunson though did light him up he had eight dimes and eight reborn or rebounds and three stocks a great in Daily or wagering I feel like the guards facing Washington always a good move Alex take us to an exciting game in Utah  yeah the Thunder Dan did Utah six game win streak Utah has been absolutely on fire like one of the top I think five teams the MBA over the past month in terms of record they play really well at home Colin Sexton is ranked 37th and fantasy over the past two weeks absolutely cooking really efficient  I don't know Ken do you think this is what I mean Utah now is 22 and 21 they're in that kind of mixed we talked about with Sacramento where they're within like two games of the seven seed  it's kind of unclear like are they gonna you know they walked into holiday before the season apparently do they go in do they go into try and make a win now or they gonna try to sell off some guys like if you have if you have any buggy on Utah's roster on your fantasy team are you having are you like I gotta sell hi Colin Sexton about you know Walker Kessler I'm buying I don't know I don't know the Kessler minutes or frustrating as heck he got 24 Off the Bench last night I did have his three blocks I mean if you need if you need Blocks he's still getting those left and right you know done has been a huge part of this turnaround but for last night they were 12 and 2 with done as the starter when he got injected into the starting lineup that's really a defensive play the only game of 13 minutes last night though which is odd I think because they're playing from behind I suppose in the second half  but you know I like Clarkson I you know I prefer to have Clarkson coming off the bench lighting up second teams for points like he did last night 35 minutes 18 shot attempts for Clarkson the last night I think he's a he's kind of a buy cheap guy but  you know Danny is probably I don't know frustrated by their winning it's weird and it screws up the rebuild it is a tough one you know from from that standpoint I mean there's tons to take away Chris Dunn is kind of just that placeholder starter you know 13 minutes last night like Ken said he hasn't he the most amount of minutes he's played in the past four games is 21 minutes 17 17 21 13 Even when he does play his full a lot of minutes it's like at Peak it's like 26 minutes as the starter but it's frustrating for guys if you're stashing Kessler hoping that eventually gets those starter minutes or keyonte George same thing especially after keonte had that stint in the starting lineup prior to his injury it's tough to know what to do with the way they're performing right now the way they're winning I don't think they're just gonna sell off all their veterans they still might move a Clarkson's or a clinic but I don't think all three are necessarily get to be moved whereas a month ago I would have thought that was going to be the case but from a fancy standpoint I'm holding  on most of these guys I mean sexton in particular has just been and absolutely be for this team you can't get out of starting lineup can you no absolutely not I mean before before last night's game he had a stretch of 13 games as the starter but he was only playing 24 and a half minutes per game absolutely crushing it in those 24 and a half minutes for game I mean his per 36 this year is 26 points 3.9 rebounds six assists 1.1 steals 2.23 pointers shooting 409% from the floor 89% from the Line This is why this one of the reasons why I was always so high on Sexton is that efficiency from the guard spot and he's proving that this year and still doing it even when he's playing just you know 25 to 30 minutes most nights I I'm holding him just in case this run continues and he creeps up his Menace continued to creep up like the 34 he saw last night well they have a good amount of money investing in sex in too like when he when he was traded to the Utah it was on a four-year 70 million dollar contract so it's like they they would like for him I think be good they don't want to like you know keep him on the bench playing 15 minutes um okay let's let's talk about our friends and Underdog fantasy they're the number one

subscription and deposit bonus that's code r w n b a okay Gentlemen let's go to the fan feedback we've got a question from Paul that's rather details you saying which of these two players should I hold  that includes so from which two do you keep between Duncan Robinson Alex Caruso Dante Davis Brown and Larry Nance Jr  yeah I mean I think some of this is a question of like are you looking for upside which I think I would say you are because all these guys are like at the end of your bench as anybody who listens to this podcast knows I'm very partial now as read mostly because of his upside and again you're how many times are you starting these guys in any given week so I would say read is one of them  other than that I mean  I am curious to see what Bruce Brown does in Toronto you know I think he has top 80 upside he's a little disappointing in Indiana but I'll defer to you if you have a strong opinion on these  guys for me Caruso and Dante were the two that I immediately defaulted to they both top 80 values over the past month both are starting for those teams and unless there's additional moves made I would expect both to stick in the starting lineup as well and those are the two there I'm defaulting to Dante and Caruso Bruce Brown is is an interesting guy to see how Toronto does deploy him but I also it also seems like they could dangle him in future trades it's it's I don't know if he has a fit in immediately in the starting lineup they started Gary Trent at the two last night with Bruce Brown I believe was Bruce Brown unavailable or did he play I I don't think he played yeah I think you might have been unavailable so you know I want to see do they do they put Bruce Brown and that starting to spot that could add him to the mix but right now it's not taking so for me he did he did play there were some confusion about he did end up playing 15 points 7 rebounds one it says one steal and 25 minutes yeah a lot of minutes off the bench I don't know where the bench is just you know we'll continue our Phil start as Shannon I mean they're benches terrible regardless like they could play him 35 minutes off the bench because well says there so yeah all right next question  about Memphis  would you guys had a good old salty aldama oh boy I put that one in a 12 team League generally referring to all those injuries in Memphis um maybe it's hard to say he's very French like I think his his upside I don't think is particularly High and a points League unique him to get at least 25 minutes a game consistently I think for it to be worth it and even then  kind of borderline I'm off a bench last night did not start yeah I mean I think he's a fine ad and see what happens but if he's again he's not seeing 25 minutes consistently it's not worth it yeah with the Grizzlies someone has to play someone asked him minutes he saw those 25 minutes last night his offensive rating was 74% not great he had 13 points five rebounds one block one steal a couple three-pointers  I'm interested to see if he could if he can carve out 25 to 30 minutes he's out I think he'll earn a 12 team role  that's to be determined I'm fine grabbing him stashing him if he if you need threes in particular and you have room on your bench you have a cuddle cuttable player right now then I think osama's worth a look in 12 and in many 12 teams all right and one last one gentleman  should I hold Luke Kennard or Gigi Jackson going forward in a point sleep well we're going to talk about both those guys later so basically right now so stick around for another five minutes and we will talk about both of those guys  all right  that's it for the fan feedback section  let's jump into the waiver wire how this works each of the three of us have two regular waiver wire pickups guys roster and less than 50% of leaks and then a long shot guys roster in 25% or fewer of League's busy week next week 12 teams with four games the rest have three games no two game weeks so just keep that in mind my first waiver wire suggestion it's gonna come with a lot of caveats so don't take this blindly GG Jackson from Memphis 36% rostered here's the story okay he was the number one ranked player in the 2022 excuse me the 2023 High School class he reclassified to 2022 and play against South Carolina last year he sucked he was terrible he scored 15 points a game on 38 32 68 shooting he had more than twice as many turnovers to assess 2.7 turnovers to 0.8 assists terrible he dropped to the 45th pick in the draft this year and signed a two-way deal so he's been playing in the G League okay and he was fine 50% shooting 19 points a game in six appearances  but  then you go coach Taylor Jenkins is like hey look everybody on this team has hurt  we have no Playmakers the one thing GG Jackson does is he puts the ball in the basket or at least is able to get the ball in the air towards the basket so they people like him 27 minutes he scored 20 points six rebounds playing 29 minutes the next 23.6 rebounds great go to fish and sea shocking last game  yesterday against Minnesota tough matchup  ten point or ten minutes for GG Jackson 1.3 rebounds over three not follow trouble he had two fouls  but you make of this versus the best defense in the league sure what do you make of this I have no idea um look what are these games John Carter did not play he's just a DMP very bizarre the next game I think it was all dhamma one of the other games all Donald was out okay so my coffee out with this is look Memphis that's four games next week so if you pick him up he sees like 15 minutes it's not going to be great but it's not going to be like the end the end of your fantasy team I would just see what happens tomorrow Memphis play Chicago if GG Jackson plays 10 12 13 minutes again I'm just out look this guy again 38% shooting in college 2.7 turnover 0.8 says if he plays 13 minutes a game I'm just out if you place 25 minutes maybe even 22 minutes board game week next week you we all know the injury situation  it's fine to go in and see what happens  that's my feel yeah 10 teams I think you can safely avoid for now and wait to see how things play out deep 12 teams I think he's worth a stash if you have room but don't cut a player who's actively contributing to your team right now  yes um can take us to a another sort of interesting option off the waiver wire yeah Shannon and I both wanted to discuss him today Shannon was gracious and let him stay on my list Wendell Carter Junior Center for your Orlando Magic his roster ship did go up last night I had him at 53% yesterday's up to 58% back from injury again he had missed five straight games with a reoccurring knee issue for now coming off the bench with Goga batsy starting but hey Wednesday night Carter 18 points five rebounds two assists three stocks which is nice to see his traditional has not been good at this deals and blocks and in 20 24 minutes you know I'm on that continual quest for my third Center on a few teams only negative is Orlando has three games next week not four  but kind of assume that Carter is going to gradually earn the bulk of Center minutes on this magic Squad  yeah I agree with that I think he eventually reclaims to start starting role that's that's the role they expected him to have at the beginning of the season and the really hadn't passed years his biggest question mark is just can he say healthy so I like Carter I think he's gonna see his role uptick here in the coming weeks I'm again a move on to my first waiver wire suggestion an old favorite of the show Mason Plumlee  you know he's got to be up there one of the one of the leaders in mentions in our waiver wire segments over the last handful of years  zubats for the for the Clippers zubac is out with a calf injury for at least four weeks at least four weeks is what the report says and in his place Mason Plumlee is stepped into the starting lineup earned a start a get against the thunder on January 16th 28 minutes 14 points five rebounds three blocks we know it Mason Plumlee can have offer he can get you some blocks not a lot but you know if you playing 25 minutes he might creep up towards one block for game and get some rebounds and maybe get you a 1011 points per game that's about it but if that holds value in your league I think he's going to be there for the next month used to be a good a CIS guy for a center too but I think that's fading as he's not allowed to touch the ball over those Stars it's yeah it's tough when James Harden Kawhi Leonard Paul George on your team is only so much here right can you imagine the epic battles they're having him in practice in LA with Daniel Tyson and Mason Plumlee just going at it we need some spy cam on that practice footage  I like the suggestion Shannon like you mentioned we all know what he can do when he gets the minutes so I it's good at  my next suggestion off the waiver wire he's back baby Jeremy Sohan  San Antonio Spurs 44% rostered he's back to playing his real position look what happened right 94 over the past two weeks which again not that exciting but compared to what he was doing at point guard but when we all dropped him this is better so I said 94th over the past two weeks but I got 12 games sample where he's averaging 12.9 points 5.8 rebounds 3.5 assists 1.4 stocks in 30 minutes a game which is good because it's minutes were up and down a little bit too yeah early in the season shooting very efficiently 46 4185 3-point shooting is awesome he's taking about three a game the free throw shooting one hand awesome love it first before games next week so I'm I'm willing to just buy in and just he's definitely a stream he's definitely a stream for this week we'll see what happens after that thanks to see his percentages improving as he returns back to his regular position because they were getting a little scary low or during the point guard exper he really he's just such a great compliment off of one pajama at the four and it's like why would you I don't know we we've done this whole bit already we don't  they've moved on all right well I'm gonna continue the theme of cranky old centers and I'm gonna repeat somebody from last week but he's playing well and no one's rostering him Xavier Tillman  25 year old Center for your Memphis Grizzlies again Memphis a team struggling to put a lineup out there because of so many injuries Tillman starting and playing huge minutes he's the only legitimate Center on this grisly roster I know he sound like a broken record but he's roster percentage is just too low at 38% Thursday night he played 36 minutes 10 points five boards six dimes in two stocks look last four starts 11 points six rebounds four assists and 2.3 Steals and one and a half blocks yes he has a bad free throw percentage like Plumlee but like Plumlee they also takes very few free throw attempts and Memphis has four games next week so a lot of streaming old guy Center options this week absolutely oh go ahead absolutely with with Tillman you know it's going to be him or aldama it's not going to be both right it's probably gonna be one of the two right now it's still men so he's the guy to ride I I can't believe that he's only lost 138% of Lee's after the past week he said criminal yeah we need we need like a broken record section of the waiver wire where it's like there's just five guys who we just would suggest every week  stats are funny too because it's like he just he has he has 20 of them but you don't know what category they're coming in you could just like roll five dice and be like oh sweet uh night rebounds one point four steals a block that's kind of bizarre but he's a he's a good option who is your next wait for wire pickup well this guy we've talked about this year as well mostly in a negative light Andrew Wiggins Golden State Warriors 52 53% roster donkey Yahoo  he's been frustrating this year probably having you know if not the worst season of his career one of the worst but he's showing signs of Life over the past three games all three starts which it's been a couple months or he hasn't started three games in a row since early December three starts in a row and these past three games also Mark the first time this season he has played 30 minutes or more and three consecutive games that's really the most encouraging part of it over that three-game stretch 31 and 31 minutes 13.3 points 14.7 rebounds 3.3 assist one block one three-pointer made we know white Plumlee we know what Andrew Wiggins can do that that's 12 team value most 12 teams at least if you're kind of a standard 12 team roster size  that's good enough value he's creeping up 102 ranked player over the past week so he's creeping up in value and I think he's worth playing and plugging into your lineup and tell the Warriors just decide to switch up their rotation or the starting lineup again  yeah he he mentioned I mean what do you played there's been seven games this year where he's played over 30 minutes he's averaging 185 and 3 and those games so you mentioned it with the minutes minutes and performance are always good to indicators of fantasy value sometimes the minutes come before the performance or the performance come before the minutes but  yeah I think you mentioned he's 53% rostered I think some of the more competitive league it's probably less I think is I think it's roster is probably a little sticky from some dead leaves that are out there so yeah I think I think that's a good suggestion for a pickup my last suggestion we made this this user who asked about Canard and Gigi Jackson wait this long I'm sorry sir I know you have work to do Luke Kennard of the Memphis Grizzlies 19% roster is my Longshot you start the past six games over the past five he's averaged 13.6 points 3.8 boards and rebounds each or borns and assist each three three steals I can't talk three threes you know what Luke Kennard does he hits threes I don't have to tell you that Memphis has four games next week  really good chance you get 12 threes out of him I think he could continue starting um as to the guy you know the our listener who asked Jackson or Kinard  the safest option is Kenard to high upside option is Jackson hopefully you don't have to make that decision before tomorrow see what happens tomorrow with Jackson's minutes and then I can start going to continue playing  upper 20s to low 30s the rest of the season someone has to play for Memphis right yeah like they're legally we're at that we're really at that point in the season like I was looking at some of the you know the rankings over the past two weeks and I'm like oh we're here we're here there's a lot of names on this list I'm like okay Chris Dawn is back Luke Kennard is back Mason Plumlee is back yeah it must be must be mid January  well I struggled to find a long shot so instead I kind of wanted to flag a guy to watch and Alex you made the same mention and that's Bruce Brown now a Toronto Raptor after that Pascal siakam trade Brown's rostered in 63 percent of League's but I think that might go down as people somehow might think his role in Toronto is going to decrease but hey he came off the bench last night and his debut played 25 minutes 15 points 7 boards one triple one steal look this is who he's competing with for minutes Jordan Laura Gary Trent Chris Boucher and gradey dick that's not exactly the 1990s Chicago Bulls there I think Brown ought to be able to easily carve out 25 to 27 minutes a night Toronto only has three games next week so I'm I think a lot of folks might drop Brown over the next few days and I say keep an eye out for them and pick them up I think he will be value rest of season  good suggestion Ken my long shot of the week  is Jabari Walker forward for the Portland Trail Blazers roster and 16 percent of Yahoo leagues Walker has made back-to-back starts for Portland tomorrow who had been starting a small forward is out of the starting lineup and we've got shaedon Sharpe who's out for I think the next 10 days to two weeks right now for as long as Jabari Walker's in the starting lineup seeing a healthy amount of minutes I think he's worth a look in 12 and 14 teams over those two starts he is played 29 and a half minutes averages averages of seven and a half points seven rebounds and one and a half three pointers not much else it does look like he can hit some threes he can get some steals based on his per 36 numbers for the year it's at 1.3 steals one three-pointer 48% 48.8 percent from the floor 77% from the  line so he doesn't really hurt you in those two categories he's worth a look so some hockey Walker's son I believe give him a look Walker  go ahead go ahead Alex not go ahead oh well I I mean two days ago on Wednesday I wrote a an article about like guys to Target if you're rebuilding and Dynasty leaks and Walker was one of the guys who just missed the cut for like deep leaks for me I took a look at stats like she had mentioned  really interesting stat line averages also like three offensive he's a great offensive rebounder three offensive rebounds for 36 I don't think you mentioned it's free throws Shannon 4.3 free throw attempts per 306 was a great number for a guy who it's a second year in the league doesn't get a ton of usage and is also taking threes and is also getting offensive rebounds those three things are really tough to do all together it's just a really active player obviously Portland's not doing well at all it could be tanking Lego down the stretch you might be able to add Walker and get more value in March if you're able to hold on to him for longer so that's that's good suggestion and his first start of these back-to-back first start was in place Jeremy Grant second start they slid Jeremy Grant to the small forward position and started Grant at the four and started Walker at the four DeAndre 8 in is probable for Friday night's matchup so they're starting lineup could change again and it's worth keeping an eye on things in Portland because it's I think it's going to be fluid for most a remainder of the season but I like Walker while he's starting and they got a trade Malcolm Brogdon for picks and I know Brogan's you know backcourt but still they move Brogden that opens up minutes for everybody including Walker  yeah I think that wraps it up for our waiver wire segment count right  that does that is the end of the waiver wire segments and now let's talk

to do like an NFL hits somewhere they'd be like who do you like in the upcoming playoff game I'd be like you know I think the claxton's actually gonna have a pretty big night you know Brooklyn they really need them tonight so you know again against add yeah um well luckily gentlemen you each have an entire segment as we do every week to discuss your Friday FanDuel DFS picks it's a seven game slate tonight Friday the 19th and the highest over under is Indiana at Portland so it's not that high it's 22 238 and a half points  take it away boys  it is high but we become desensitized to numbers under 240 at this point so it doesn't even doesn't even register as always if for injury updates which are extremely fluid throughout the day check the world of wire lineups page check the road of wire injury page  I will say of massive note Victor will not play tonight  I assume Shannon opens up some value on San Antonio for you against a horrible Charlotte Hornets team white believe as one win in the past 30 days  they're not good they're not good there's a lot of very bad teams starting with my Pistons you know the former Bobcats the Wizards of garbage teams in the NBA this season it's beautiful it's beautiful I you know Victor Wendy went beyond a being out of course  create some value for San Antonio where that value is as kind of hard to determine right now because that Collins might be making a return for Friday night slate he's been deemed questionable with his ankle injury he has been out since December 29th was the last time he played you know if Collins is active there's a good chance they'll have a limited role he might get the starting nod but I would be surprised if he plays more than 22 to 24 minutes and with that that makes him tough to deploy in a fantasy lineup on my end you have Barlow's the other option but he had a spot start for Wendy about a week ago and didn't really impress so there's going to be players like vessel your boy so high who will be options in our decent values on both the on both DFS FanDuel and DraftKings yeah we have the on-off Court stat stuff it's our daily lineups page if you just need a quick quick fix keldon Johnson sees the highest usage rate with one banana off the court how you should straight increase I should say up to 27% it's a 7% increase compared to one would be on the court so that's an option as well we know they they need some scoring Let's see we also have DeAnthony Melton out for Philly he's been out for a while maybe some more for Kelly oubre we're not sure about hawks I think he's doubtful for this upcoming game for Miami so there's going to be some extra line of stuff going on there Shannon mentioned Aiden probable for tonight's game that's interesting and then everything else is pretty chalky on the injury side so besides you know that that situation where you turning Janet yeah with Hawkins most likely out I do think Martin will see more value with the heat he's probably going to be coming off the bench but he's 5500 tonight it which is just a manageable salary to get into your lineup I I really like the Indiana Portland game no big surprise there I actually you know and if I were betting I would bet the over its kind of to be determined what's gonna happen with the starting lineup for both teams because right now basically every you know you've got half of Indiana's team is questionable including Halliburton Neymar Naismith siakam if those guys are ruled out again they all sat out on Thursday night if they're all ruled out again that that brings TJ McConnell but he healed Matthew and Myles Turner Jalen Smith all of them would be options on the Portland side you know Jeremy Grant's under 7,000 on DraftKings I believe Simon's who is coming off a big game he is good value Jabari Walker we talked about Ad nauseam already this episode I'm staying away from eating because I don't expect big  minutes in his return to action  yeah Indiana terrible transition defense team so you should probably expect guys like Jeremy Grant and you know amphi Simon to get out and run in the game let's see here  we have yeah I mean  indeed versus Orlando I think is a spot where people are kind of look right because indeed is gonna be going up against go-getter say Wendell Carter who again we mentioned have been playing well but it's I think it's gonna be a struggle for them probably a lot of double teams coming and Beads way for me that might be like a Points Plus assists play on like you know a pickup site like Underdog but on FanDuel I think he's going to be a good value as well  where else you turning and  yeah a couple of the higher price guys or big name players who I think are just salad values tonight Michael McHale bridges for the Nats he's questionable actually listening is probable so I expect him to play against the Lakers he's been turning up and has been better the last few games I expect him to see to be a decent value tonight and then  my boy Zion Williamson  I just the price is just right for him EFS I really really like him he's 7700 on FanDuel in that same range on DraftKings when he plays he's pretty much a locked to approach 40 fantasy points and he has the upside where he can have a 50 or 60 point game I'll take that safe floor you know he is active it should be a competitive game not really seeing a blowout potential in that one so with that I love Zion to as kind of a safe floor upside for a lot more and a decent salary  let's see can we have your Boston Celtics on the Slate any any insights for us going up against the Denver Nuggets Denver I mean is this a files review Gentlemen let's see I don't know um oh no I mean the thank goodness they're healthy again so it's good to see the big five all back from Boston but that creates the DFS dilemma of who of all this star-studded top five lineup is going to bust out really same thing for Denver in that they have no bench all starters have to play ridiculous minutes but I'd say d white do for a breakthrough he's been a little quiet as of late that's named betting with my heart not my what but always loved me some D white also public service announcements remember that Dallas and golden state has been postponed tonight due to the very unfortunate passing the Golden State Warriors assistant coach so either in your daily move League's or your DFS work remember no Mavericks no Warriors playing tonight  very good note Ken I think Shannon unless you have any parting words I think that can wrap up our DFS segment good to move forward  okay Ken we have a old man rant that I am I some you know sometimes I don't know what to expect I mean I'm excited to see this because it's something I've also felt like I need to get off my chest for a number of years ARG Patrick Williams  stinks he stinks the Bulls Lottery bust has the audacity to expect a 20 million year five year extension as reported back in October the guy was picked fourth overall in the 2020 draft now in his fourth season he's averaging less than 10 points and less than four rebounds per game last night he played 23 minutes off the bench versus a depleted Raptors team in those 23 minutes Williams gathered zero rebounds zero Steeles and zero blocks in 23 minutes what's got that odd thing going on with his hair you're a millionaire man fixed that Williams is a bum the bullshit run out of town  he is a role player and not a very good one I I think you know in fantasy we talk a lot about guys who you think are going to be good or who are set for a breakout versus do you is that really what's going to happen or do you just want that to be like do you just want Patrick Williams to be good and I think it's given us enough sample size of this point know the extension is crazy I mean I at best he's the the fifth starter on a very good team at best  I would if he weren't if he wasn't picked fourth overall I don't think he would be viewed through the same lens if you speak 24th overall for instance I don't think we view Patrick Williams through the same lens  true but the contract demands 20 million a year for that terrible production or just unacceptable  yeah maybe that's his way of being like you know what just get me out here please please don't sign me Chicago I want I want to go elsewhere um okay mispronounced names I didn't type this in but I see Auntie El Domo I think I stumbled on it I just stumbled a little oh yeah you may have said salty all Dominos I'm  I'm salty when he doesn't play 30 minutes a game well I thought salty was Shannon's nickname for him and then I lost confidence because I couldn't remember if it was the fun nickname or was his real name and then I stumbled  I apologize the larger Obama family my yes  okay everybody thank you for joining us on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast presented by underdogs and FanDuel Ken take us out of here well hey let's go to Utah where OKC got the win last night did you know that Jalen Williams is now nicknamed fourth quarter dub  I didn't know that till last night it's good here's what coach Mark dagnar said about him after the win over the Jazz where Williams scored 27 points quote the guidelines up and guards a premier match up every night and for him to be able to do that offensively and do that defensively is a very complete game it's very impressive  attention passengers this three car fantasy Trainwreck has hit the end of the line  you need to apologize
