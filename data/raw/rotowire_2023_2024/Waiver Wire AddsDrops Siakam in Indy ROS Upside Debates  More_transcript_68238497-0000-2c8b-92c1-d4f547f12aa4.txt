welcome back to the RotoWire fantasy basketball pod it is Monday January 22nd Nick Whalen Alex barutha back with you've had a weird couple weeks out we had you know no show last Monday with the MLK day we had a bunch of games going on a lot of kind of background work to do yeah I think New Year's Day ended up being a Monday as well so I feel like we haven't been doing this one as consistently as we'd like but you know up until the All-Star break you'll be on our normal schedule though we're not too far away from that at this point before we dive in on waiver wire so notes from the weekend looking ahead to the week ahead we'll talk about the schedule you know it's a team some situations that you need to be aware of how was your weekend are you still processing the Green Bay Packers lost on Saturday I know you're not maybe as big of a football guy as I am but where you at emotionally  uh look I think the fact that I mean they got through the past the first round I mean with the team that looks so good at the beginning of this season like Jordan long the thing is the transformation Jordan love went through during the season I feel like this is a pretty good like if you had said you know after week three or after week four maybe even further that this was the outcome that you played the 49ers close um at this point I think people would have been actually pretty happy about that  you're not wrong whatsoever that's an extremely rational way to look at it that's what I was saying that's what I was saying all week and for the record if you're watching a Long Live we're both here in Wisconsin that's why we're beginning with like two minutes of Packers talk but that's what I was saying all week was like oh you're playing with house money you know three weeks ago we didn't even think this team would be into the playoffs there were two and five at one point and then all of a sudden you know if you're saying all we need is a close game and I'll be happy then he get the close game and you're like well you know if we're up by seven going into the fourth we might as well win this thing and yeah it's the group chats Alex have not been not been friendly over these last couple of days a lot of stats a lot of commiserating being thrown around Green Bay now four and nine in divisional and NFC Title Games since the Super Bowl year but anyway that's neither here nor

questions in the chat again guys keep throwing those in there we will hit those in a little bits let's talk waiver wire Alex a lot of waivers in the leaks that I play in at least run late Sunday night I usually find myself doing waivers like 20 minutes before the waiver wire deadline which was once again the case last night didn't really do a whole lot in my nfb Casey through a couple bids in but you know just kind of just kind of playing with the roster that I have right now got lamelo ball back so should be okay there did you do anything in your nfkc  I did not  my team is just not doing that well I I don't think it's like really saveable but I mean the people you know people were pretty aggressive and in the league I think it's that time of the year where people like I got I gotta get my guide because how much Fab do I have left at cetera Brandon Miller went for 216 of the 1,000 Budget Inn in nfkc Brogden went for 15 we had a star Thompson Marvin Bagley Luke Kennard I'll go off the board as well yeah I'm I'm not currently doing well in my league that's because lamelo missed so much time but one of the cool things with the NFP Casey's you can you can kind of filter by week and see like you know how your team did that specific week so I've I've been a top three team now for three straight weeks essentially you know with the metal ball back in the mix so I'm optimistic that we can get this thing going as long as he can stay healthy but the injuries are just been killing me Mitchell Robinson and CJ McCollum you know he missed time early on Marcus Smart you know Marcus Martin I think I might just have to drop at some point here you know like I said I didn't do a whole lot in terms of Fab this week but some interesting names were either picked up or dropped and I I do wish I would have been a little bit more aggressive across the board on Mason Plumlee mostly because I have a couple where I really need rebounds I was riding the Andre Drummond train for a while Chicago schedule pretty unfriendly up until the All-Star break yeah I still I'm still okay throwing drum it out there on a four game week in a 16 Team league like the the roadwire state League because the other options like I was I was scanning through people's rosters last night just to be like all right where do I you know where are my deficiencies and even the best teams in the league are starting almost everybody's starting at least two guys where you're like man that guy should not be in a starting lineup but that's you know that's life when you're in a 16 Team league so I don't really mind Drummond on a four game week you know two game week you can't do it three game week maybe maybe depending on who your other options are but I think basically is a solid pickup if you need rebounds I know we kind of split time with Tice in their last game but I still think Plumbing is the guy there both Mark Williams and Desmond Bain were dropped in my nfpc this week  I understand Bane I guess I understand both um I mean I joked on the podcast a while ago and Mark Williams went from to out for all those games I was like yeah he's probably done for the year then since they decided actually listed him us out and you know I mean Steve Clifford said he's not that close to being back so what does that actually mean and then Bane you know Bane's expected to come back maybe late February early March and like a lot of fantasy League's end in March at this point like early March depending on how you know your league manager wants to do that sort of thing yeah I'm going through that same calculation with Marcus Smart and obviously there's you know lower upside with smart so yeah I don't think you'd really think quite as much about or think twice I should say about dropping him I mean Bane obviously I mean it could be a top 30 guys so it's a really tough decision to make but I think it comes down to you know  if you comes back before your league is over which I do think timing wise you should write they originally gave us I think six weeks on Desmond Bane that would mean he could be back like a week after the All-Star break and then you're getting you're getting a month out of him it's just the question is you are the Grizzly's are they a 16 win team at that point and they just say you know shut it down or you know you get two or three games and then that's kind of it like I it's super super hard to predict I and in the NFC you don't have IR right so that's the other thing it's like if you have an eye our slot I think I'm not I'm not jumping Desmond Bank quite yet I think  you know unless you're buried and you you just really can't stop it you know if you have an IR spot and there's nobody else who makes sense to hold in there I faked the promise of getting him for a month or even a month and a half later in the year is enough that I would hold him but if you don't have IR I mean it makes sense  yeah I mean I in stakely I just had DeAndre 8 and come back and now I gotta figure out who could drop smarts on my bench this is like I've seen that's two balance yes I have Marcus Smart Spencer Dinwiddie Al Horford and Doug Smith Jr and my concern is that if I dropped in Whittier Smith Jr that that particular one is going to start playing better again like if I like if I keep Dinwiddie he's gonna start playing like crap again and if I drop Smith Junior's going to start playing 35 minutes  so maybe the move is just a drop Marcus Smart I don't know but I gotta figure out what to do there  look at through some of the moves in the stakely which we kind of use is our standard League again at 16 team very competitive everybody knows what they're doing so I think it's you know it kind of reminiscent of what a competitively I think should look like maybe you know most people are playing in 12 or 14 teamers so you gotta you got to live with us mentioning guys like man I I'm scared to drop out Horford I'm scared to drop it because that's that's how to sleep works but I mentioned plumblee he was one of the one of the higher dollar ads only four bucks on a hundred dollar budget Janet grab him he dropped trayce Jackson Davis in order to add Plumlee you know I put in a bid for Santi aldama  you know they can all right you know look good the other night you never know what Jaren Jackson you know Xavier Tillman you know his bed banged up he went for seven bucks I did not go up to seven dollars for all yeah aldama is one of those guys who I think we all want to be better than he actually is like I've just I'm just resigned to this point where it's like yeah that was gonna have like three good games and he's gonna play like crap for four games and then it's gonna be like you argument you drop them um I got 16 Team league it's fine and you can weather the storm a little bit and maybe it pays off like way later in the year you know like maybe in March it he's actually playing 35 minutes a game and he's doing that but it's it's almost as frustrating to roster him as it is to not roster him yeah in a way um our guy DJ trainer he ended up adding GG Jackson for seven bucks I'm gonna see DJ I'm gonna go hang out with him later this week so I'll you know maybe get like a boots on the ground interview here I'm guessing he put this claim in earlier in the week I like would you still be comfortable spending you know 7% of your budget or at this point you know probably significantly less than that on GG Jackson based on what we've seen the last two games yeah obviously if you threw that  bit in like this past you know we could go last Monday that looks great but you know he's played only 28 combined minutes over the last two 11 total points for total rebounds nothing on defense did hit a couple of Threes the other night I get Chicago but this is kind of what we're dealing with these Ultra small sample sizes and again in a 16 Team league you have to kind of take that risk but I don't I don't really know where to go forward but him at this point I have a huge monologue about him on the Friday podcast after after that 10 that 10 minute performance and I was like look  he was terrible in college that's why he fell so far after he reclassified horrible field goal percentage three times as many turnovers as assists how many times does a player like that get into the MBA on a two-way deal and then they're good basically never and then yeah so yeah you know he had two ago Bobby experience is  I was like look if he plays 20 to 26 minutes and its next game sure Adam if he plays like I was like if he plays like 10 18 19 minutes just leave it alone so um my advice to anybody after that second game against Chicago where he had was just don't don't bother he's just not that good yeah and you know we'll see what he develops into I think there's going to be more opportunity as a year goes along but that was that was a game at this loss by what 29 Points right that's the ideal Gigi Jackson situation it's like games out of hand there's nothing on the line throw them out there and you know still only had 10 points in 19 minutes I you know the Grizzlies are just kind of a mess right now I know David Roddy was added in a bunch of legs I think James grab him over the weekend I would rather have Rowdy than GG Jackson no question no intrigued by Vince Williams like I watched that whole Grizzlies t-wolves game that goes on Thursday last week he's a really interesting player like I don't you just kind of does it all you know gives you some defensive stats he could pass a little bit you know took six threes on Saturday get Chicago so I think there is a reasonable amount of upside there but it really like Memphis to me is not a team but there's an obvious like all right this guy's just gonna step in and be like Camp Thomas and give you 25 at night right like I just think you have this all of their younger guys are kind of role player types you know I don't know  there that there's somebody who you know goes from playing eight minutes A Night to 22 minutes a night and you know all the stuff looks like Anthony Simons you know they don't really have a guy like that no I think that's why people act at Vince Williams it seemed like he might get the most usage or at least he had a diverse enough skill set where it's like you might get you four sis you might get you two steals some threes he's actually the 45th ranked player in fantasy over the past two weeks but yeah I mean Tillman's back in the fold caner and I guess is playing point guard which is whatever you we all know what Luke Kenard is at this point but yeah I think that's why they brought up GG Jackson because they're like well we know this guy can at least get shots up  which is just a pure problem for emphasis at some point  yeah I mean contractor started the last two games for them he's played 27 minutes in both  not really doing anything not a high usage player I mean he's taking six shots and no free throws in 54 minutes so I know there's been times in the past where he's been like a reasonable streamer I think it was like early last season yet I got a nice two week run but the overall sample strongly suggests that he's probably not worth an ad in anything but like the absolute deepest League's so yeah I think Vince Williams of David Roddy to me are the two guys and then you can kind of play the rotation at Center you know him in Romans had his weeks like I don't mind I don't mind holding him in a deeper league and obviously Obama like we just talked about but yeah I think Vince Williams you know a week and a half now that we've had without paying without Smart without jaw I think to me he's far away the clear winner oh yeah yeah I think so um yeah it's just it's gotten it's gotten so gross so quickly in Memphis  it certainly has  Pacers went down to the Suns last night almost covered by the way without Tyreese Halliburton thankfully we ran out of time when I was on Vincent yesterday I was ready to go in on why the Pacers were covering this game but I also thought Albert was going to play which he did not so they end up losing by seven I think a respectable results all things considered you know Phoenix didn't shoot it well from three did you know well over 55% from the field however I just kind of want to do a check in on MCA I think we're hopeful nearing the point where Halliburton is no longer game to game and he's just kind of back in the mix going forward it's been you know a little bit concerning that he came back missed a game you would think you know starting this week he should be good to go they're off today then they played Tuesday Thursday Friday Sunday so four game week for Indiana I know you watched some of that that Suns game yesterday siakam 30 minutes only 15 points on 14th no steals no blocks they have seven assists and four boards but what have you seen from him so far in Indy I mean he just he needs Halliburton to be there it's a really bad setup for him to be kind of the just thrown out there with no Halliburton it's um he doesn't know the offense that much the other guys on the team he's gonna be bumping into guys and stuff so it's like I don't take honestly a lot from the last game although then it was funny to see him throw his hands up and confusion on defense when his team wins like guys would get blown by and there was no help rotation and he was like in Toronto this would get anybody yanked like no you just won out be on the court if you play defense like this um so that was kind of funny but I mean it's in the game where  Halliburton played he played really well see how come did 216 and 3 very efficient I I think that'll continue for him  yeah I did follow out of that game but don't be misled about the box score he committed a foul that the end with like 10 seconds left so it didn't really didn't really impact anything all though it was a little bit of foul trouble and I think that's why you played closer to 30 minutes you kind of weird TJ McConnell usage and this started you know even even when Halbert was still on the Shelf last week you know he went from 225 minutes you know had that 33 minute game against Sacramento and a couple rules under 20 you know started yesterday against Phoenix only played 12 minutes in that one a lot of bench usage for the Pacers yeah I mean  you know McConnell has this game it's just it was just weird at the beginning of the year where he wasn't being used at all  and it seemed like they were going away from him entirely you know just running with like nem hard as the backup  and then Carlisle was like no you know we're gonna we're gonna do some more McConnell here and there and then they needed when when you know when when Halliburton got hurt and  it's just it's really hard to trust him I I don't really understand what is going on like I wish I had more clarity but I think they're just some McConnell games where he's on and it works and there's other games where it's like he's getting played off the floor because of his defense and things like that he just doesn't work and I think Carlyle has a quick leash with him a Ben mathurin as well who played 14 minutes yesterday I you know right when helburn first went down I feel like we were spot on we're like I think math and this should be his opportunity to take off like he's gonna Force carlyle's Hand even if he doesn't like him you know even if he doesn't like what he does that defense like they they're gonna need to scoring and you know he had a pretty nice run up until this past weekend where he was in double figures in 13 straight games he was averaging about 18 points at 52% shooting the three-point shooting had come around as well we started to get to the line a little bit more that was something that it dropped off pretty significantly early this season like you forget as a rookie even he was getting to the line almost six times a game which is crazy he's out like half of that right now but played 23 minutes in that ugly lost to Portland on Friday and then just 14 minutes off the bench yesterday against Phoenix so I mean I not really knowing right now what's what's up with albertin yeah we won't get it update until tomorrow like would you would you be comfortable starting been math and not a four game week does it have to be 16 plus Team league  yeah I'm gonna I don't even think you need a roster I'm a 12 team league and I'm just 16 Team league I honestly would not feel bad about keeping them on my bench I think I'd like I'd want to start him in a 16 team we're on a four game week but I also may have other options again a kind of depends on your team but yeah it's like  you know the first game like look siakam joining the team is not what made Ben's score two points because he took a shot he just missed his shots so you know expect that to that should have been like a 12 point game in theory if he stayed with his efficiency and then this game against Phoenix was was bad so  it's just it's tough man because they don't you know training for saieko the the Pacers main issue still now is they don't play defense  so there's just going to be a lot of games where it's like we don't really need bathrooms scoring we need niece Smith's defense you know and we might need Neymar out there for whatever reason because Albertsons are the game and again he's just he's a there's a ton of guys in this team are just like Carlyle is so hot and cold with the guys in this team he plays who's playing well whatever they need he's not locked guys in a minute or anything so it is hard to predict on a game by game basis  and Dr Rivers was on a pod I think it was last week talking about Lou Williams and he basically was like yeah when I had the Williams on my team I would tell him like you're going in the game and your one job is to score and if you don't have that night I'm pulling you and that's that's just what it is like you basically have like a five minute audition and you better look good if you do you know we'll play more you'll lead the second unit the whole night and that'll be that you can get a 25 point game if you don't have it that night where we're getting out of there and I feel like that's kind of where in that with Carlyle yeah I think so and some of it again I think he's really talented he'll probably in my opinion you'll probably cap out like his best role probably is like a six-man um of that of that elk of the Lou Williams Jamal Crawford type  and the Pacers are competitive team right so it's not like it's not like this team is you know bad and he should be getting 35 minutes it's like well he's just gonna they gotta play if he's contributing a winning he's gonna play if he's not he's not  a couple news items will hit and then we'll get to some questions in the chat Trae young we found out last night entering concussion protocol they last played Saturday against Cleveland so got a little bit banged up in that game he will not play to begin this week and as we know with concussion protocol you know could be one game could be two games could be more it is a four-game week for Atlanta so they're at Sacramento tonight at Golden State on Wednesday home for Dallas Friday and then home for the Raptors on Sunday I absolutely hate these situations and unfortunately I don't have Trey young in like I don't know if I have been a single League this year I wish I had more of him over the last couple weeks he's been on a bit of a downturn you know the field goal percentage is really suffered the assists have been down as well I was shooting like 35% over his last six games but obviously unbalanced he's one of the safest players in fantasy you know how do you typically handle a situation like this where you have you have a guy who's in every week starter even on the two game week in a deeply you're probably starting trade young but not knowing you know his concussion status going into a Monday game did you still throw them out there do you go with like a significantly lesser four game option I how do you lean in these  yeah the concussions are tough because sometimes they last like three days four days and other times it's like two weeks I would say young is so good that if you just hope that he's gonna play two games you still start him like if you think there's a fairly realistic possibility place to Games you start up and I think there is so I think this is this is a situation he's so good where you throw them in your lineup and just it's just kind of a Hail Mary play  well it's kind of nice the way things are spaced out right like if they had a Monday Tuesday back to back  I think I would maybe hold them out because to me you're guaranteed to miss two games whereas it wouldn't be that crazy if he was back Wednesday at Golden State you would think you know five days should be enough in general to clear protocol and get back for for Friday and Sunday so yeah I think when it's a player of Trey Young's ilk you probably lean toward putting them out there if you're into 12 Team league you know it's maybe a little bit different or certainly anything shallower all right any other major news items for the weekend and he players teams you want to hit before we start entering these questions  oh  no I think we can just we can just dive in all right let's do it well we will go through Car Lot logically here first of all the doctor D 314 says thanks for everything you guys do not have a question we appreciate it nonetheless thank you Dr D for tuning in Jordi says Caruso or balali for the rest of the season he's playing in an eighth cat League  that's interesting my you know my concern with Caruso always is that he just gets her all the time like I think Caruso is the better player has more upside even in fantasy  but it's constantly hurt there's the trade rumors as you get moved hard to know I think if he does get moved he probably still plays 20 to 25 minutes I think I would rather have Caruso because the Kula Bali thing is still very unproven and we know we have a Tonka defensive upside but it's not it's not like freakish right now you know it's it's 1.1 blocks and 1.1 steals per 36 which is really not anything crazy so I think I would rather have Caruso  yeah and the Wizards you know two weeks into the year it was like all right the season's over you know so I don't know that there's some sort of like I don't think there's some sort of like late season like oh we got to get cooler volleyball involved it's like that's already kind of happening like he's playing 25 to 30 minutes most nights already like I don't see that number dramatically increasing over the last month he's averaging six and a half points for rebounds two assists 1.6 combined Steals and blocks like there was some 3-point volume early in the season that was encouraging that's kind of dried up like he's giving me like half a three per game feel full percentage just terrible I mean carusoe for what it's worth in the last month's like 140 spots ahead of him so even with some of the wrists there you know we don't know what Chicago is gonna look like Rousseau could be somewhere else a few weeks from now but I think he's pretty transferable I would you know unless you you know you this is like a positional eligibility thing and you'd rather have somebody who's forward eligible this is pretty easily Carousel for me  yeah I'm with you all right Manila Most Wanted ask is a time to drop cam Johnson not a not a question that we necessarily thought we would be answering this season but yeah it's been a it's been a rough couple weeks for Camp Johnson last seven games he's under 10 points per game you know the three-point shooting has been disastrous hovering around 25% for the most part the volume has been there the minutes have been about where he's been sitting for much of the years so I'm  you know again depending on your league size I would be more inclined to ride this out because I don't know how much better you're going to do but if you're in a 10 or 12 Team league then yeah it's at least a consideration  yeah I don't I don't hate the idea of dropping I'm attend Team league  um you know last year I think was a look at sort of his ceiling like last year he ranked 89th per game I think the whole this year is he'd be somewhere closer to like 60 or 75 and you're right he is just shooting for Lee like assuming he can give a shot back it should be fine and you should go back to averaging 15 a game but he's not like  he's not been projected to be or even when he was shooting that well he wasn't a great fantasy player and it's 12 Team league I would still hang on you never no longer with what's going to happen with the Nets at the deadline I'm not saying they're gonna trade McHale Bridges but  they're just gonna trade Michaelis I am yeah they're gonna they're gonna deal him you heard it here first but yeah he's he's fine I would hang on to him in 12s 10s  it's not it's not necessary but he's still averaging on the year he still averaging 25 fantasy points a game yeah I mean prior to this two week downturn you know over as previous 20 games so we're talking like Thanksgiving through the beginning of January 15 points 2.83 per game 50% from the field 45% from three so I think the larger sample would imply that that he's going to come around and he's young enough that you know you don't worry about you know if the Nets were to go in a different direction you know he's like you know losing minutes at the end of the year like I still think he's kind of a foundational piece schedule wise they have three games this week I think we have 12 teams that have four games so threes you know closer to average three games next week and then four before the All-Star break so no you know nothing major there it's not a great schedule but it's not it's not a disaster  Matt Harvey says Man actually have won that one Packers Fan as well from Wisconsin Matt our condolences I am actually Jaguars fan first and foremost but every year this happens the Jags get eliminated and I'm like all right I guess I'll root for the Packers and I was I was doing and hollering a little bit on Saturday night but yeah man it's I was texting some friends this morning Alex and I'm sure you've been through this like with the bucks or any other teams you care about like one of my favorite things every Monday during football season is I just like you know I binge through a bunch of recap pods around the NFL Bill Simmons were so low and it's like when your team wins that's all you want right you just want to read more and more and more about how great your team is but your team loses that is just torture  yeah um I'm with you man it's just the again if you reset the expectations to what they were in the middle of the year you can't be that mad about it and I think it's like it sucks now or you're like  you know oh we could go on farther we had that game  everything like that but if you  just look ahead until next year like things should be you know we have completely new expectations  13 straight years that was been all right we'll get next year next year will be the year the work last week I'll say on this worst part is like they would be the Lions I don't I'm not I'm not in on this lines team I know it's a fun story whatever I feel bad for Detroit shout out to Shannon but that's the thing it's like this would have been the toughest test you know think you beat the two best teams that you're gonna face in Dallas and then potentially in San Francisco and then you know all the sudden like man that just goes from Fun Run to like what we could be in the Super Bowl but anyway that's neither here nor there listen to our Show on Sirius XM tonight you'll hear a lot more Packers talk for me there all right Paul says I traded away porzingis and Jamal Murray for Kevin Durant and Val junior is this the win in a nine cat leaked porzingis by the way will not play tonight sounds like it's somewhat load management for Boston  yeah I found shumis is a little inconsistent now with Larry dance back but he's still putting up numbers um still like a threat for a double-double great per minute  I think this trade is all right these are these are always hard trades to evaluate in terms of like you traded to  you know top 50 guys for like a top 10 guy and then like a 90th ranked guy I think you're fine like I it's hard for me to like necessarily grade this a win but I think this is a fine trade it's not a loss I'll say that I think I think you you have more upside because you have KD but you've also exposed yourself to a little more risk you know balance does not have top 40 upside in the same way that both ports and gets and Murray do but was like I said Murray don't have top five upside like coming to rantas so I think if Katie stays healthy this probably goes down as a win for you obviously if Katie gets hurt you know that's part of the risk calculation here then you're going to be in trouble but I think it's fine deal Paul also asked who's a better long-term hold so hot or Caruso um  I mean if you know if San Antonio start shutting guys down  in which I don't even know who necessarily that would shut down this whole team is Young and they're already so terrible but so I've been playing better lately like 60th ranked play over the past two weeks  um  better long-term hold  it might be so Han now that they not the Spurs have committed to playing a real lineup  um and he doesn't have the the sort of injury wrist of Caruso but do you have a do you have a strong opinion on this yeah I think you said it yeah it might be so Han it also might not be so Han so we need we need to keep keep that in mind no I think if you're looking for upside it's it's so Han you know he's been the better player of late he was playing 30 plus minutes you know the assists like some of the like you know High upside assist games have been there he's got a couple you know seven eight assist games over the last few weeks rebounding spend a little more consistent and you know I  like you said I I don't know who would be shut down for this team ironically I think it might be women if anything right it's like that's the asset they would want to preserve it would be kind of a reversal of what you normally see when it's like you know the veterans are the ones sitting down at the end of the year whereas like I think at the first just like get to the 62 game Mark and they're like all right we've seen what we need to see women as the real deal you know what what else are we doing here by by playing him for the final 15 games of the year other than exposing him to injury risk you know maybe that opens up a little more for Sohan although like a Swiss wise I think having women out there is a good thing for him so maybe that's a net neutral but if we're talking Beyond this year then it's still probably so hot for me there's I've never been super high on him I think you know we're starting to see some improvement that didn't look like it was there early in the year but if you're if you're saying like who could be the better player three years from now than I think you have to you have to at least be able to imagine what what's so on could become yeah I still really I really like so on as a player he just shouldn't be a point guard it turns out he plays while when he's playing his natural position  all right Dr D back in the mix 14 team points League he's this is a trade question Drew and Brandon Miller for Wiggins and Dilo he said it is very trade deadline dependent obviously Dilo could be on the move even Wiggins I suppose could be on the move  but let's let's just say current situation with your other have Holiday Inn Miller or Wiggins and Russell  Wiggins is horrible he's very bad Brandon Miller pretty up and down but really strong past two games so I think you need to take into account at least I think I would rather have Drew and Miller  um yeah we should mention dealers been balling out but it's like how long is that last where they up to it's just I really don't understand what's happening there I wish I did I think I would want the jury Miller so I feels a little more reliable to me  all right good question from Victor G he says is Jayson Tatum a buy low right now where do you project him finishing in nine cat ranking so let's go over to nine Cat last 30 days Jayson Tatum ranks 18th and if you're looking at just the last two weeks he comes in at 81  so yeah it's been a bit of a rough go for Jayson Tatum a lot of that is percentage dependent you know even in what's considered like a bad two weeks for him he's still averaging 23 7 and 4 you know two two and a half threes a game but he's shooting 40% over the last two weeks so that's really what's killing his value free throw shooting spend down a little bit so yeah I mean I'm I'm a huge Jayson Tatum guy specially in fantasy he's like Trey young to me where those guys don't really miss time they don't necessarily have top three top five upside but if you look at total value they always ranked like five to ten spots higher because they don't miss time and they're super consistent so yeah there's somebody who's you know panicking about Jayson Tatum who has like you know there's no reason to believe that his performance is just gonna fall off the rest of the way I would be buying him right now if I could  yeah guys like this um  I don't know I think you have to look at  and the NBA like a two-week Chunk in the MBA is kind of like one game in the NFL so it's almost like if you don't play NFL fantasy I don't really play a Fel fairy but it's it's you gotta think of it like you'd be asking for the best you know a top 25 player in the NFL had one bag game and you're like do I buy low um so it's like for a superstar like Tatum yes buy low because I it's just he's at a you know a bad six seven games or whatever it is he's  again I would I think I would trade any  like you know I I projected to be a top 25 player the rest of the year nine cat so yeah if you can get rid of like a the 30th ranked or a 35th ranked player form or something like that I would I would absolutely do it  yeah I think you can rank higher I would die I mean it could be a top 15 guy the rest of the year you look at where he's finished and total value the last few years fourth fifth eighth 15th and that takes us all the way back to his third year in the NBA in 2019 so I mean he's just he's been about a safe as a bad as it gets and you know he always ranks a little bit lower in her game value but he's been at worst he's been like a mid-second round value for four straight years so in summary by Jayson Tatum  Skeeter says should I be looking to trade away when Ben Yamaha do you guys think it gets shot down  yeah we talked about that a little bit ago I mean I I think it's happening at some point I would be pretty surprised if webinars out there for game 82 for the you know 13 wind San Antonio Spurs it's just yeah like you said when does it happen and you know the Spurs aren't gonna tip their hand here they're not gonna make an announcement you know I'm maybe it's like right before the All-Star Game they'll tell us when he shut down and it's a tough game to play man because it's even though he's you know this Minnesota has been really frustrating it's been going on now for 12 games his numbers are fantastic I mean 22 8 three and a half 3.7 blocks you know he's still taking a decent amount of Threes like it's  you know it's hard to say that you want to get off of a guy right now I would I would probably wait a few more weeks maybe there's someone in your league who doesn't think he's gonna get shut down or is it paying attention but what do you think  it's tough because the minutes are they're back up now um you know he had played like he hadn't reached like his past three games he's played at least 27 million minutes  he hadn't reached 27 minutes before that since December 17th  but we all know he's not the back-to-backs thing it's still limited minutes  he still ranked 11th on the year so  it's like  what you trade him for is is really confusing like if you trade up I still think you've won a top 25 player back  yeah and I know yeah it's like he's talking about he trading you at top 25 player for one but Yama if they think that one banana is going to get shot down maybe they don't think that I mean again  if you want to float him out there and someone doesn't think he's gonna get shut down or whatever and you someone offers you here Jayson Tatum I would probably do that but nobody knows I wish I wish we had like more insights but we don't have any more insights than anybody else does  all right Matt says who do you think's the best stream out of jail and Suggs Jade McDaniels or Luke Kennard Yahoo points League you know I will say if we're talking for the week Jalen Suggs has three games the other two guys have four so maybe that that kind of breaks the tie and then you're just deciding between McDaniels and Kinard depends what you need of course as well I mean if you need threes that I think you look to Kennard who is giving you three 3.13 per game since he's moved into the starting lineup again for game week for Memphis played well too obviously gonna give you a different stat profile but you got three pretty decent options there I guess  on balance I would probably lean Kennard I do like jail and Suggs tonight I think they got a pretty decent matchup much more favorable than playing in Miami the other night and he's been you know it's been so much better at home this season been on the road but yeah I'm not I think it's close enough where I'm not leaning sucks when he only has three games yeah well it's closed like this you just lean on the guys who have an extra game that's Canaria and McDaniels and I would lean Kennard because he has more of a usage upside and is playing 30 minutes it's pretty consistently you know High usage hi minutes that correlates really well in points so I would I would lean on Kenard all right well try to go quickly through some of these scoot or Nesmith nine cat rest of season could not be more different players  yes seriously um look I just don't think  what are the chances of turns things around to a significant portion and becomes like really a viable Nyan Cat player like he's had some like at the beginning of the year he couldn't even put together like three good games in a row now we've had some stretches where you can put like three decent ones like a role but then I just falls off again yeah  even if he gets more usage I don't know his field goal percentage just bad is turnovers are really high  I think I think I would rather have nice Smith honestly I I could understand the scoot thing but the scoot killing you in category leaks he just is  yeah I mean he ranks a good like 200 plus spots behind me Smith in the last month and you know that's not that's not gospel it's situation so in some ways but yeah and I got a specialty the turnovers really really hurt you so I would I would go niece Smith and tell you know scoot proves that that he could be a little more consistent and again this is a situation at Portland where it's like they've been at the tank all year you know I just I don't know that there's a handed over to school moment coming maybe very late this season if they were to rescue guys like Grant and Simon's but they've kind of been in that boat already so I would go niece Smith All right we just start tonight Barrett Suggs or ivy so for context  Barrett and the Raptors are home for Memphis Subs home for the Cavaliers Jane Ivy home for the bucks  kids not back is he  listened as doubtful so probably not  I would go ivy  I think it's a really tough matchup against Milwaukee in a sense although Milwaukee's defenses there is their weak point but court defense so I think  you know it would for me it would either be Ivy or bear it Bears on a on a heater like a lifetime heater right now um shooting the ball but I don't have a strong preference between Paradise Ivy I mean bear has a better match up so if you want to leave on matchup I would say Barrett but both have both have upside  yeah that's that's a really close call to me I would I would go bare and I think he's just a little bit safer I think his I think his floor game is higher than than Ivy's floor game and I think they have comparable upside right now I actually I don't know if it's really a bad matchup it's blocky and they put up what 135 on them a couple days ago did the business did hit 213 season that game which is part of the reason I actually like Milwaukee to win and cover I think they're 12-point favorites tonight I just not gonna be repeatable that's the most threes they've hit in any game by like I think by two or three all season so that's more than anything what kept them in but yeah I would go there I'll break the tile I'll say Barrett all right Zach says hi great show thank you Zach thinking of trading for Halliburton by offer his Booker plus someone needs thoughts on who I should pair with him range wise thinking Caruso  yeah I think that's a decent place to start you know Booker Booker by himself is a pretty appealing player you're not getting Halliburton straight up for Booker but you're going to need some sort of sweetener and Booker's good enough that I don't think I don't think that that sweetener has to be like another top 50 guy obviously  yeah I  yeah I would not ideally you could trade like your worst consistent starter I think is the way I would put this like I would I would move Booker and your worst guy that you start you know 75% of the time Troy start there  and then see what the guy see what the guy says because in theory you should be able to to you know you're gonna get the Halliburton upside and return and you should be able to put you know you should be able to stream that that last starting spot anyway especially late in the year when there's more resting more injuries there should be more streaming options and you could be really we haven't even talked about this all  work coming up on one of the most crucial waiver wire periods of the entire year at the post deadline waiver wire period so if you are really aggressive if you're in a Fab League after the waiver or after the trade deadline in real life you can make up for some of that lost some some you know lost depth that you may give up on a trade  all right Derek white or tyus Jones rest of season if you're punting turnovers you know both guys pretty low turnover players so I'm not sure that really affects the calculus that much my default is Derek white here pretty obviously I mean he's been a fantastic player kind of you know borderline All Star talk I don't think that's gonna happen but you know it's been a much better player on balance that ties Joe and so to me I'll just say Derek white unless you are in dire need of assist  it's definitely white has been better all year role as way more stable yeah definitely definitely Derek White  Michael says Hey guys are we dropping nazre Dame in chenzo or Brandon Miller to make space for France Wagner coming back from the IR slot 10 team 9 cat lady  so this is tough because Brandon Miller has had two great back-to-back games um  and read nasri is pretty reliant on like gobert or towns getting hurt but he could have big games regardless  depends if you're talking upside or not like if you if you want the higher upside guys I think you actually keep Nas and then you consider dropping Dante or Brandon Miller  I would say it's between Dante and Brandon Miller as a drop for me I just I'm so  I don't know what the right word is obsessed with nausea reads upside that it's really hard for me to say drop him so I mean do you have a strong take on this I love nazreen man he I mean he's like their Bobby Portis I think it's some ways where it's like you've seen Port is like Port was a top 100 player a couple years ago and Brooke missed all that time and it's like yeah towns are go bear to go down and I think he could really explode but you know you know neither of those guys I guess you know towns have missed time on and off but it's been like one catastrophic injury or he plays 70 games it's like no in between with him and go bare as far as like big bang go go Bears been underrated the like super healthy his whole career like usually guys you know some sort of degenerative lower body issue at some point and he's just doesn't really miss games so yeah I mean it's a tough time to ask this because like you said A week ago I would have said drop Brandon Miller we do have to keep in mind that Gordon Hayward should be back and like a week you know and yeah Cody Martin well yeah don't even call career but yeah the moment that I added him in an important League he's just like day-to-day now I think I would drop Miller I think I would like you said you're pumping out some upside there but David chenzo has been really consistent you know now is read even in lighter minutes has been pretty consistent and I do worry I mean Gordon hayward's not a part of their future but I think they're gonna play them when he comes back and I don't really think that helps Brandon Miller  yeah Matt says could help her and have come back too soon and hurt his hamstring that's why they arrested him very possible yeah and maybe wanted to get him out there was yokom I get that but yeah nothing nothing long term there for Haliburton  let's see  Alex says should I try to move Kessler when he plays he's great but he seems to have settled into the backup center role unfortunately yeah super weird situation and I was just a Utah's playing well so you know what are you gonna look real hardy in the face and be like your rotations wrong they have lost two in a row two close games to decent teams in OKC and Houston so maybe nothing too concerning and Kessler did play 32 minutes before filing out against Houston and the other night I mean he's got 13 blocks over the last three games so while it's weird and frustrating that he's not starting he's averaging more blocks per game this year than he was last year so ultimately I think the numbers have actually been okay the rebounding is down a little bit I think you know if I have Kessler I'm ultimately okay with the situation you know it'd be one thing if you was playing like 14 minutes off the bench but for the most part you know if you if I isolate his last  13 games he's averaging 22 and a half minutes again not what you want but the production has been okay he's averaging you know almost three blocks a game in that span  yeah I mean 8th ranked player and ate cat over the past month despite playing 22 minutes like you just said this has to be his floor  like he's not going to start playing 14 minutes so I think it's only upside from here I would actually I would looked at I would look to keep him probably and just hope that maybe they do something that deadline free sum up even if they don't you're still rostering a top 100 player who is getting you great blocks so I I just hang on a my trade so far says carpo Flex he said he traded for Butler and just proposed highest Jones for Duran I would cosine both of those you know if you need assistance it's tough to part ways with Jones but I think during a basically a double-double every night and I think we talked about this one a couple weeks ago Alex the cell Butler situation you know you're trading consistency and health for upside but I feel like you know somebody had told you even a month or two ago that you could get Jimmy Butler for Devon to sell you'd be like yeah I'm doing that every time  yeah Butler's injuries but hey you did the trade you got the upside you know yeah if you can get during for Ty's Jones that's a huge win so I like that proposal maybe holding the guy the Rival manager needs a point guard really badly and he's willing to take that because I think Dern's the during is the much better fancy player  Ray says would you rather pick up trade Jones from San Antonio or Jaden Ivy from the Detroit Piston's I  probably probably Ivy I've been kind of an ivy hater like I loved him in college and I was just like I just don't know if this is gonna translate didn't look good last year he's played pretty dang well pardon my language the big question with Ivy is you know cage back later this week then what yes that's my concern because I think I think Trey Jones like we saw what Trey Jones upside is last year which is like a fringe top 100 player and that's what he's doing this year since becoming a starter he's like in the 90 to 100 range which is like a nice  floor if in a 12 team League it's a nice guy to have  but Ivy Yeah you mentioned has played so well with Kate out  that  he's kind of killing your free throw percentage but part of me would hope  who's to say Monty Williams does the right thing and just plays Jake and Ivy 30 minutes a game no matter what  so I think I would prefer taking the chance on Ivy  but just know that that's a ceiling play and if you really really need like I absolutely need a top 90 player on my team a top 100 player on my team I just need that production I can't give it up like if you're in a 16 Team league  trade Jones is probably the better move but again it's a Florida Aunt familiar name in the chat says sup fellas need someone for Steals and I have Ethan and Nesmith who has more upside great show keep up the good work thank you and we appreciate that so Ethan versus Nesmith if we're just talking steals we should know on East End you know he has not played since New Year's Day and he did not play Saturday or Sunday and there's a chance he could be back this week they're taking a game to game used to play to Wednesday so we probably don't get an update until tomorrow night at the earliest maybe even Wednesday then they have a back-to-back Friday Saturday so you know even if you come back Wednesday you could see them maybe holding him out of one of those back to back so you're probably looking at maybe next week situation as far as getting East and back in the lineup Rockets to a four games next week  I think in terms of deals upside it kind of has to be Easton because the steel rape was Preposterous before he got hurt I mean he was averaging 2.6 deals per game over his last 10 games before the injury  he's the bugger Steel's guy per 36 and he's also the better fantasy player per minute like he's in the permit it fantasy monster that's been talking about that since since last year the lower like thing concerns me I got I got to be honest like just being semi day-to-day with like an undisclosed leg injury that's just being described as soreness is super weird he's not a guy that was playing big minutes anyway um  so  look I would love to roster Taris and I think he's the he's the better guy but I just  I it still worries me I don't know how else to I wish I had like a more definitive answer  yeah if you're looking for safety and you need immediate impact and just go grab Eason you know or grab you some sorry go grab me Smith because we don't know when eason's gonna be back and you know now they like I'm at Thompson's in the mix can't whip Moors in the mix it's like it's not  it's not a guarantee that he's in walks back into 25 to 28 minutes a night like he was playing prior to the injuries so more upside with the with Eason more uncertainty there as well would you drop Grayson Allen for either Nas Reed Malik monk or Wendell Carter he says Alan is my worst player and I've been streaming that spot in a pointless leak  uh yeah I mean Alan Alan's been pretty good I don't do you have to drop him I mean I yeah I don't think I don't think you have to I mean he's  he's ranked 40 like 45th over the past 30 days and 50 second over the past two weeks like he's awesome if you really felt like you had to drop him for some reason maybe monk um I don't know how much I trust window cargo to stay healthy played pretty well recently since coming back but I don't think I don't think you have to drop Alan  no I mean I think him and Malik bunker weirdly comparable players now because they both have these Boom games like Grayson Allen has  an 8 3 pointer and 293 pointer games in the last month and that's also kind of what Malik bunk does like once every couple weeks he'll just go like seven for nine from three he'll also mix in some terrible games in there as well but I mean he's also been handing out quite a few assists this season and he's been blocking it on a shots for a guy his size he was up like point eight blocks per game that's significantly higher over the last few weeks one point one block per game over the last 15 so those are all pretty appealing options to me honestly I don't think you can really go wrong but yeah I think I would just default to ride this out with Grayson Allen and he's in a pretty good spot right now so that's right yeah yeah and a points League I could see the argument for dropping him for for Carter just because I think Carter's probably a better like permanent fantasy Point guy  but um  yeah it's our choice  all right Pokemon cats says how do you feel about the magic rotation with their Preferred lineup finally healthy barring folks sitting out today of course he also notes that he dropped cam Johnson in a 10 team or this morning for Wendell Carter  I think that's a fine move that's like a very very good 10 Team league transaction yeah I  you know we've been kind of talking about what what's going to happen if it is false ever gonna come back wins Ron's Wagner coming back and that you know it finally happened  yeah I mean fulls as a guy who is seeing what the ministry seeing right now which is like 23 to 29 30ish  I don't know if he's a 12 Li tell 12 team lead guy I can see walking to Adam just to get out ahead of it because he he's proven to be 12 week 12 Team league viable in the past  you know but Tate was a DMP  that was kind of weird he might be an auto drop at this point  but  I don't have like major major insights besides saying like Wendell Carter looks like a pickup right now yeah and I I was wrong I didn't think we would I kind of wrote him off I was all over Batavia who was a dnp in their last game which is notable because he'd been playing pretty well yeah Carter's just kind of rediscovered it out of nowhere honestly I mean he had just not looked anything like himself when he played earlier this season and now 17 18 25 17 points respectively in his last four defensive stats I think are going to vary rebounds are gonna vary but he takes some threes he gets he's been getting into the line at a decent rate I think you have to buy on him right now  Christopher says do you think there's change coming in Houston  and suggesting you know perhaps Camp Whitmore you know taking over some more minutes from jail and green  I don't know he's just got too many guys man I think we were on this early in the season and I was part of the reason that I kind of stayed away from I'm at Thompson and then the injury just kind of solved that for us on the fly but they have they have so many options at like the two three spot specialty  yeah I don't I don't know if changes are coming I mean I think they're kind of playing with house money this season doing extend their young enough team where it's like they're they're building towards something right now  I don't think they would swap with more for for green in the starting lineup but yeah you also have Easton coming back  yeah I mean I I don't think there's a major change coming I don't I don't really anticipate that  too much invested in jail and green you know it'd be one thing if his minutes were starting to tail off they really haven't and I know Fred Van bleeds been out so it's been tough to get a full gauge on that I do think you know you don't is one of the few coaches who would have the balls to do that so that is it you know like if you really feels like JL Green's hurting them  I don't think it's out of the question but we just haven't seen enough evidence yet for me  all right wait a few more before we're out of here guys how do you feel about the article that was released by the NBA that stated resting as no correlation to preserving health for athletes good question  yeah right into that a little bit over the weekend  you know you and I was dealt with this boots on the ground more than anybody so I was like you know I was kind of relieved to hear this you know the whole covid situation was a nightmare for us logistically on this on the road to wire side of things I mean obviously we provide player news but we do you know projections and lineups and there was just a  significant number of Hoops that had to be jumped through to accommodate all that and you know rest is kind of been something that's that's you know build upon that I don't I feel like anecdotally we're seeing a lot less rest this season right like is anybody is anybody talked to you about why Leonard missing too many games not really no maybe some of that is the the game's minimum guys want to track a hit that so there's there's less resting early in the year but then my question is going to be  well if a guy's on track to play like 78 games and there's 10 games left in the season and they know that he can rest like seven of the last 10 if they need him to because he's he's gonna hit the minimum  how do I feel about it  um  I don't know I look this I don't want to say it's it's a lie or its propaganda but if you play pick up basketball go play pick up basketball two days back to back and then take a day off and then play again  and then next week play just one day and see how you feel see how your knees feel that is that's what I would say about that  okay all right fair enough I I'm not gonna speak anymore on this I need to read the full report but before I dive in but it's  no I it's it's it's certainly interesting and it's very interesting to me that the NBA like put this out publicly right it's almost like a c c you don't need to be resting right like the NBA kind of trumpeted these results I thought like which was the most interesting aspect yeah it's not like they in turn they didn't circulate this well I guess maybe I mean sort of internal I don't know it will get leaked regardless so maybe they just figured we put it out there but um  yeah I don't know man I think it's a lot he's wearing tearing your joints  and soft tissue and stuff like that to play all these games and I  yeah I I don't know I don't know what to believe  all right we got a few more minutes let's go rapid fire here  a good pal carpet Flex by the way reminds everyone liked the video please like the video subscribe to the YouTube channel you can follow us on Twitter as well see it on the screen there any of that really really helps us more than you guys probably realize but yes please we appreciate that shout out give it a like give it a share whatever you can do there Mike says do I trade Scotty Barnes for Kawhi Leonard in a 12 team points League  that's practically qualifies as a blockbuster what  I I am fine with that trade you we all know the rest about Kauai and I assume the person you're you're trading with is all so everyone understands what's going on here everyone understands what this trades about so I it's I think it's worth it I think it'd be hard to pull the trigger for me because of the concern for Kauai but is it worth it in a points League specifically because you know a huge part of the appeal with Kawaii is he shooting 52% from the field which is ridiculous 88% at the line you know Barnes if you look at you know some of like the season long ratings he rates lower because he's 74% at the line you know shooting you know 48% from the field but it's not quite level so if you take that out of the mix are they a little more comparable  yeah I guess like a points League that's a good point  yeah I didn't read that it was points League that's my fault  I don't know I mean it's fine but what I don't know if I would necessarily take the risk that I apologies for not realizing you said points there's probably I should probably read with my eyes I think it's close enough in a place that I just I you know why is the better player not saying he's not we just you know we know what the history is there all right we'll do this one quick Katie or Tatum rest of season 9 cat  I think this is another like injury risk versus safer guy with lower upside thing if you need the like if you need the jolt you know like if you're six then you're standing and you're trying to make a run for top three I think you you make the trade for KD if you're at the top of your league you know if your top three and you just want to use one play it safe I would keep Tatum  all right Admiral Nita says do I trade Jalen green for Wendell Carter and Draymond Green in a 12 team category League I think you do I think you do because Jalen green is like barely I don't even know if you have to roster him in the first place in a 12 team category League Wendell Carter Junior is Apex is definitely Ross durable or should be rostered and Draymond probably yeah should be roster as well so I would I would do this yeah two for one for sure  thoughts on Jabari Walker rest of season he has started four straight now for Portland he's been in the mix you know really all season in their rotation he's picked up more more minutes over the last few weeks of no you know what from playing 32 29 341 minutes down to just 22 with dominating back in the mix able to get to the arena these last couple games so  you know you gotta you got to worry about that a little bit um but yeah I mean in terms of you know Izzy roster bull or whatnot I guess yeah I mean Portland's really struggling to score they're struggling to do everything lately there's going to be some really ugly games I mean they've scored under 90 like four times in the last couple of weeks so you're gonna have to live with the with the downs but I for the most part I really like what I've seen from Jabari Walker I think he feels he feels to me more like a like a true like this guy could be part of our future as a we're just throwing minutes out to anybody because we don't care  yeah I talked about him a little bit on the Friday pod but kind of reiterated because I wrote a I also wrote a like a dynasty article about like young guys to Target and he just he just missed the cut I mean I didn't want the article to be like 4,000 words about every young player in the NBA  but he has a really like he's just a really unique step profile where he's taking three threes a game but he's sorry for 36  her 36 minutes he's taking three threes he's also giving three offensive rebounds and four free throw attempts a game and in addition to his 11 rebounds and solid defense so it's like a really bizarre you don't see this a lot a combination of like good 3-point shooter all so offensive rebounds also gets the line that kind of a thing so I'm really intrigued by him going forward I think I think this season yeah maybe at the end of the year he'll break out but this to me is like if you're in a deeper Dynasty format and you're looking for someone like maybe I'm just grab this guy really low-key  No One's Gonna notice I just stash them for a while I think I'm pretty interested in him I gotta be honest  all right we will hit a couple more here what do we got  all right Alex says get Derek white for Anthony Simon's thinking about doing a soft punt of points in a 12 team 9 cat leaked so he'd be basically trading Simon straight up for Derek White  trading Simon straight off for Derek white I do do you have a strong opinion on this one  I I love Simon so much and you know he showed basically showed exactly what we hoped early in the season and then you know he's been like sick on and off the last couple of weeks and it feels like that's impacting him a little bit I think the Blazers just sucking has also Dragon him down but if you're putting points I guess Derek white yeah then that makes sense because  Simon gives you okay rebounding for size okay assists really nothing defensively whatsoever the big thing I guess you'd be losing other than points would be threes because he is very 3-point dependent gets to the line a decent amount but if you're okay hunting points then yeah I think I'd prefer Derek white because that's you know points are really what you're seeking assignments yeah assignments has been a little  cold shooting the ball lately I still think he has like top 60 upside ideally but White's been playing at top 60 upside like all season or he's been playing he's been there so um yeah I would I would want white I think actually yeah  good question for Paul is Chris Paul a hold or a drop you know we talked about some of these these injured guys being let go and so competitively their last update we got was like almost two weeks ago that he'll be reevaluated in three weeks so could be back right before the All-Star break would not be surprised if this goes to after the break but what say you on dropping him  eighties ranked 10011  it wasn't it wasn't like trending up or anything you know I feel like he's kind of just been this guy all year  I think it's a fine job to be honest I mean if your IR is full um anybody outside the top 100 if you're a standard League you don't really need to be rostering assuming you're not expecting anything crazy  I think you can drop them yeah  okay thanks all right we'll do a couple more in the outta here they can have giving so he'd be offering Daniel Gafford and Wendell Carter for Darius Garland because of playoff schedule is it worth it basically to to make this deal take the short term hit and then get Garland later he offered and Wendell Carter Junior um  I think it's like a points League  um you're just it's like it's it's a lot more straightforward with some of these trades because you're just you're just adding up the total points so  um you know with gaffer he's averaging 30 fantasy points a game which I think is more than people kind of realize that with window Carter showing like 30 fancy Point per game upside that's 60  Garland's Gonna Get You 40 probably  so I think I would rather keep the two guys  if you if you think the playoffs schedule is like way way better I understand walking to make this move  but  it's uh  it's it's it's I think it's it has a chance to be even  but yeah I think you broke that down well the only other thing I would say is are you starting both for in Carter Junior or if you're choosing one of the other and you can't start in both each week because they are both centers obviously then I would just do the do the deal and get Garland but if you're if you're able to start on both then like outside you know the math is pretty simple to add up and I think that's your better option especially not knowing when Garland's coming back he's gonna miss out at least three more games there's been no real indication that he's all that close and you just never know with something like a broken jaw shahu says who would you prefer in a 12 team points League buddy hield or Markle fultz  tough question  probably faults  because you aren't like a lot of heals value when we talk about healed and fantasy is the three-pointers and you don't get a bonus for that appoints League like there's no  like a real bonus for that  so I would I would go full even though we have some injury concerns it's just like healed is  heel has been up and down like he's playing real well lately started the past five games and everything but like he's averaging 24 fantasy points a game there should be a million guys in the waiver wire close to 24 points a game especially if you can consider guys on four game weeks I think I'd rather have full for the upside  yeah you said it I mean love yielding category League's every year he's top five in total made threes he's inching his way toward that actually by the end of the week and probably be in the top five which on missing time so yeah just a different player in points League then he is in category League's  all right let's see this is a good one would you trade Jaren Jackson for the Occam points like  probably yeah I'm worried about jaron's action yeah getting shut down  for sure  yeah I worry about that too yeah the inefficiency less of a concern and points I do think Jared Jackson is a slightly better player but I think I think the outcome is gonna take off over these next few weeks in Indy all right Let's do let's do one more and then we'll wrap it up  let's see  I mean  well this is a good one we just talked about folks cam Johnson or folds I would still go can I little concerned about what I've seen for folds I think I would still go cam Johnson because I think he's just first of all I think he's just cold shooting  the average in 25 points a game on the season  um yeah I don't know folks is 100% healthy like it's hard for me to say you know we again we just talked about fultz  and there are situations where you should pick him up  but I think it's a decent by law on cam Johnson  worth holding Shane sharp on IR  totally this is a it depends for me I do think when we saw at the end of last year like they're not shutting him down right like if they do go into shutdown mode it's grants I guess it could be Simon's although he's young enough that he wouldn't think they need to you know Brockton we'll see if he's even on the roster eaten but sharp went nuts at the end of last year the question is is like is it just too late and it doesn't even count for fantasy a very possible yeah and I think Sharps a little bit of an overrated category League player anyway in a points League I would say he's 100% worth a stash if you can again if you don't need the spot necessarily like  but yeah and category leaks these he's not like a fantastic guy yeah  appreciate the kind words here from manila's Most Wanted I wish we could do this every day man us two one of the best fantasy weekly shows we do do it every day not Alex and I I will say that but we do have streams going every Monday through Friday so I'm with Alex on Mondays but we got Steve Dre recent Hall of Famer in the fantasy industry he hosts on Tuesdays I'm back with Brandon Kravitz on Wednesday we do a very similar show to this one on Wednesday mornings and then Alex back on Fridays with Ken and Shannon that's always a really fun one that one does numbers you guys talk waiver wire Super valuable going into the weekend so while you don't get out tonight every day we do have five streams a week so make sure you check those out on Twitter or on the roadway or YouTube page well and on this one Alex Matt says thanks guys appreciate the show appreciate you listening Matt two bad about the Packers but I'm excited about their future yes I am as well do you see the Bucks making any moves before the deadline this is a near and dear to our heart  we had that weird report that they were interested in dejounte Murray  you were not kind of talked about that I'm like with one assets  I think they will I think they will try to make a move  in my opinion I don't think they should be shy about trading guys like Beauchamp  or Andre Jackson and pain and whatever pick second trade on I don't think they should be shy about that I know some people are kind of attached to both champ he's fine if we can get someone like even like Caruso or someone like that I think you just you just do it Delon Wright I don't know you just do it yeah I think those are far more realistic targets I mean I had so many people text me last week like are we getting dejounte Murray I'm like how how man like I mean they want are you sending out Chris Middleton you know like for one matching salaries is one thing but even even if that wasn't a consideration it's like you know to the Hawks dying to get their hands on Pat connoting Andre Jackson and margin boat I think have some value I don't think those are the key pieces and ajanta Murray trade I just I just don't think that type of deal is likely for Milwaukee I think they'll you know maybe you get a third team involved I guess but again like Milwaukee's all their draft capitals tied up through 2030 so they don't really have a whole lot they could put on the table there either I just I don't I don't really see it you know that's you go all indicate Damian Lillard that's the price you pay is you just don't really have that kind of flexibility so I think they'll do something they'll be active in the buyout Market but I don't I would be very surprised if they find a way to bring in someone the caliber Murray all right guys thanks everybody for listening and watching a long live you can catch the archive version on YouTube whenever you want we put this on
