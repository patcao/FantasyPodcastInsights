hey everybody I'm Steve Alexander Dr a that is Brian Rosenberg sold drummer of the band Guster it's Tuesday December 26th the day after Christmas we're here to break down what happened on Christmas day in case you slept through some of it which was easy to do I for one forgot that it was Monday but that's another story today's Tuesday let's do a podcast oh hold on where's my  I'm not ready  well I'm gonna have to be  where did it go Brian what are you talking about this  I mean can you believe they let me host my own show Brian I mean somebody should be here in charge besides me  was I supposed to make my screen horizontal like yours because I'm vertical  you know I mean if I had a producer if there was someone here in charge you what was going on if there was somebody here to play that that music when they're supposed to we would we would have answers to these questions right insane amount of responsibility Steve absolutely insane and I I kind of worry that I'm gonna sleep through one of these and not be here for it I mentioned before I couldn't find the music intro that I forgot yesterday was Monday which it's easy to do during the holiday season to lose track of what day it is but I was sitting here around midnight watching Luca Dash It's just go nuts and I was gonna write in the right one little game recap for that and then I was gonna go to bed we fresh as a daisy for this podcast today and then it hit me  it's Monday and I have a huge riding assignment due that takes me about four hours to do so I did that from midnight till 4 a.m.  and here we are  here we are staring at the crust in your eyes Steve Yes actually I feel pretty good I feel like I came out of that on the other side we did it let's talk about what happened on Monday Brian then the New York Knicks I understand your New York Knicks Suk out the Milwaukee Bucks I've argued since day one that the Bucks are not nearly as good as they were without  Drew holiday there to play defense it makes Boston that much better that they have him especially when you add in Derek white to that combo and then the next you know Jalen Brunson  scored the third highest total on Christmas day in Nick's history had 38 points  she was ran on 24 RG Barrett and quickly and 21 and 20 and my guy and your guy I noticed these on he's on your team again you're you're team had a lot of players play on on Christmas Day I say a hearty heart Stein  came through love points eight more is forces and a Blog have 33 minutes 30 minutes and six straight games I'm all in  you know six years later Brian I am all in on your heart and shine call  well you know is a breakout year for Mitch Robb so let's like acknowledge that this Nick's  surge as well documented by Tommy beer  is it's more than Brunson it's been it's been Mitchell Robinson but you know we're looking at a solid two more months of iHeart and I'm ready  yeah and hartensteins available in a lot of fantasy links like  Brian and I probably aren't gonna aren't gonna Enlighten the world with too many things but I think we can both say that you should be picking this guy up if he's available and you're in your lease if you need a center  and all it took was for every Center in New York to be injured and Tom Thibodeau is suddenly playing him 30 minutes a night it's it's a miraculous  yeah I mean you can get huge scoring numbers but you're gonna get gonna get some defense gonna get some boards it's going to be a solid contributor he's not going to give you the hustle of Julius Randle  that's the joke  and you just cut it off so probably I wasn't sure if there was more wasn't sure I was waiting for the punchline right so the Knicks play three more games this week they played four times next week so heart and I think it is solid pick up and if you need a garden you want to go with a manual quickly I don't think there's anything wrong with that he's he's at least making some noise in the Sixth Man six man race  the Box were led by giannis's 32 points full stat line Damon Lillard had 32 and 8 and 8 assists  four three-pointers khris Middleton season High 24 points that's kind of a big deal he had 20 on Saturday and 24 um on Monday maybe he's finally getting healthy maybe he's gonna start looking like Chris Middleton again because so far he hasn't felt very Middleton is to me and then Malik Beasley was one of the buzz kills on Monday if you if you rolled with him and DFS or you've got him on your team you know he'd been playing pretty well I 19 on Saturday and he didn't score a single point on Christmas Day  yeah that's a bummer if you rolled with him but like you said the proof is in  the bucks without Drew holiday in the Celtics with Drew holiday their these players who are beyond their fantasy statistics they're just real life winners and I think holiday is one of those guys  I agree and you know not to this damn Lillard I mean Dame's of he's a good dude he's a fun player he's he's fun to have on your fantasy team it's fun to watch him play generally but he just doesn't have that defensive dog in him that Drew holiday has and Drew holiday  when you add Drew holiday and you've got Derek White having a big role one of the best rebounding guards in the league and then you've got kristaps for zinnias healthy and playing like he did yesterday  I don't know who's gonna be the Celtics but yeah they they look like Geniuses over there with Derek white I mean  that guy's putting up offense and defense right now he's he's just a winner seems like someone in the front office knows what they're doing I questioned the porzingis trade and if he stays healthy enough they made they might look smart there  well and I feel like they're going to let him rest whenever he wants during the regular season whenever they need him to because they don't need him out there every night to win games as we've clearly seen and you know porzingis can take one game off every single week from here into playoffs and the Celtics are going to be just fine and he'll be ready to go during the playoffs I'm going to skip over the next game on the docket which is nuggets Warriors to talk about the Celtics and Lakers since we're already talking about Celtics so much then we'll go back and get that one um all five Celtics scored in double figures for zingus led the way 28 and 11 two blocks two threes  he's only played in six of their last 12 games he's had an ankle injury which is better than a knee injury I suppose just Tatum at 25 points Jaylen Brown I got hurt went to the locker room  collided with LeBron James heard his back King back played through it that was good to see Derek White  11 rebounds two steals two blocks two threes man I mean what  a ball or Drew holiday at 7 assists Steele block  three three pointers both of those guards scored 18 points impressive Road win at the Los Angeles Lakers for the Celtics feel like they kind of wanted to make a statement in this game I feel like they did  oh  the Celtics  moving forward get the Detroit Pistons on Thursday Brian now the the Pistons as we know of lost 26 straight games after Monday night it might be 27 as they host your former Brooklyn Nets  how many guys are the Celtics gonna sit and see if they can still beat Detroit with on Thursday  and when they're not playing Tuesday or Wednesday that she give a porzingis and Jaylen Brown time to nurse their injuries but you gotta wonder if they're gonna be in the lineup I can't understand how a team can lose 26 games in a row Pistons have Jalen Duren returning tonight I was able to activate him in a league where he was on my IR spot whereas porzingis last night I left on the bench somewhere because I'm I'm not paying attention  but yeah Pistons are going nowhere they're going to have people sitting against them they got the Nets tonight  yeah  they do  I mean I was once and that's fan and then they went for that big ego forward power Trio thing and no one liked him they lost yeah they did uh you know I was looking something up on my phone and I totally forgot I had like 12 text messages one of them  had something to do with me singing a Backstreet Boys song but that's another story I got I got distracted um the Lakers Anthony Davis  played through his ankle injury went off for 40 dude 40 points 13 boards LeBron played through his ankle injury LeBron did not look all that LeBron's Christmas Dash yesterday he had 16 points 9 boards 8 assists so okay he almost had a triple-double but we we need LeBron he scored at least 30 on Christmas Day for it to be for it to be a LeBron type game  the crazy thing about the Lakers is this this lineup shake-up we got the Angelo Russell coming off the bench he's all the gone right they they're dropped  you straight up cutting I I straight up cut him it's in a league where there's playing a good people on on The Wire it'll be a long time before he is back and forth on another team or on this team so I didn't want to wait for it well I mean he played 18 minutes he played I think 19 minutes the game before that the everything's down the Lakers want to move him at the trade deadline they want to let LeBron be the point guard of this team all of that is bad news for D'Angelo Russell I mean  I think you hang on to him if you can but if there's a hot free agent out there that you need to pick up you know he's a guy that's drivable right now oh back to the Pistons real quick  the kid from Jayden Ivy and the kid from Purdue Jayden Ivy's been hot like very hot the last couple games I think he's a really strong DFS played tonight  I'm rolling him in my FanDuel lineup for sure the Price Is Right he scored about between 43 and 50 FanDuel points is last two games I think  but back to the Lakers this whole starting Prince  Jarred Vanderbilt Vando and Kim reddish  he's our guys that couldn't stick with like  pretty mediocre teams um  you got hachimura is in there too now it's like I don't know I was hoping Austin Reeves would step out this year and it's kind of happened but not really  yeah it's been more of the same from Reeves I was kind of hoping for a breakout season it's been  great game good game mediocre game great yeah it just kind of bounces around those three from night to night I was hoping he'd be a little a little more consistently big 11.643 assists and a steel off the bench size 9 but you know the minute any of us bench Austin Reeves or leave do something dumb with him he's gonna go crazy so you just  that's why that's why they play a whole week worth of games and not just one you just leave him out there and let him do his thing  I don't know what to tell you about Tori and Prince I'm not running out there to pick him up anywhere have you considered it Brian  no I'm not looking at any Lakers to be on us I dropped my one liqueur  who was that  was D'Angelo Russell and I was really excited to get him in the preseason I thought he was gonna do big things you know there's gonna be some injuries you know LeBron's old he went down yesterday and he was grimacing in pain holding his knee and I thought well this is it this is a real injury and then he was back minutes later he kind of crazy block  that was that one when I got knocked out of touring princes Hand by somebody else and then LeBron blocked  yeah oh Tatum was going up and kind of bobbling the ball and like LeBron absolutely slaughtered it up from behind as he does  yeah and then they reviewed it and called the foul and Tori and Prince cuz he knocked out of Tatum's hand to begin with and so LeBron played didn't didn't even count as a block but  Scott Foster when he when he looked into the camera to get ready to announce that decision he said oh you are you know like this I thought that was pretty funny  all five nuggets so the Nuggets played the Warriors the night what right first of all let's explain to people while you're here people are probably like who is this guy sitting next to the doctor a he said he doesn't even know how to pronounce the names of the players I don't either I don't hear so that's okay that's not a prerequisite but who is this dude well he's a drummer for the band Guster but  you are in my eyes Brian a fantasy basketball legend you've been doing this a very long time you play in tons of leagues  even though  you're funny and you like to joke around you do know what you're talking about you do know what players are good you do know how to win League's you've written columns for me before but at my old job we've been podcasting together on and off for years and it's great to have you on the show again I always look forward to you being here well thanks Steve and most importantly I'm in Missouri right now and when my in-laws tried to put on the Kansas City Chiefs game I said no no no no  this is an important New York Knicks game and we got to watch it  well did you watch that Kansas City Chiefs game  I I was forced to this is like the that BBC show where the kids and the nanny come in and he's got like I watched some of the Chiefs game I read a lot of people online trying to like Farm engagement by saying it's a curse of Taylor Swift I don't believe that to be true  I thought Las Vegas looked really solid that's it nobody wants to watch the NBA out here when there's a football game on well there should be not be football games on Christmas day it's a basketball day  and for some people see official start of the NBA season now  I would have rather watch football I think then the Sixers Heat game with Joel and bead and no Jimmy Butler but that would have deprived me from seeing the Jaime game which we're gonna get to in a second let's let's jump back to that Nuggets win over the Warriors all five nuggets  starters scored in double figures Jamal Murray had 28 yoga said 26 and 14 and 8 and PJ had 19 and 10 with four blocks and three triples and one sweet behind the back pass  to continuous called Pope I believe that was yes let's talk about mpj for a second because he's I'm out here in Columbia Missouri and that guy is a Mizzou product he's a local it seems like my in-laws all wanted to point out that in the last two games of the finals he was benched in favor of Bruce Brown and also that you know he got a max deal when  his injuries aren't going to let them even play for enough Seasons to make it worthwhile it seems like there's some bad blood with mpj out here in Missouri  I just I'm just saying I don't want them on my fantasy team I feel like there's a curse that's a lot of that's a lot of inside information from a family that didn't want to watch NBA basketball yesterday like those people they know their mpj and again we're getting off track here because a lot of these people watching this podcast most of them are only here they're not here for here you and I banter and and make each other laugh they want to hear fantasy nuggets they want they want info Brian but I'm just gonna say  is Missouri going crazy right now waiting for the Ohio State football game like is it is the world exploding there  yeah the world here is exploding as they wait for this Ohio State football game actually I have no idea what you're talking about because I don't follow college football but yeah probably yeah they're fired up trust me um all right yolk it should 18 of 18 free throws Steve Kerr called it in a space he said no one in the right mind would want to watch the second half of that basketball game the referees have been taught how to ruin the game and take defense completely out of it your take on that I actually I honestly felt the same way watching this game I felt like there are a couple of really cheesy calls no kids going the line Sorry yoke it's going to the line that much is boring and they're protecting him and I I can't as usual I agree with Steve Kerr  the Warriors got eight 22 points from Andrew Wiggins who led the team in scoring  we've seen Wiggins play well in two of the last three games horrible in the one he didn't play well but Wiggins has been a disaster absolutely disaster this year he's on waivers everywhere because everybody who drafted him thinking he was gonna be good yeah tired of it and dropped him that means Wiggins a guy we should be targeting right now no  I'm in a league where Brandon pods the entry is available on waivers and he shouldn't be at five steals last night full line and he's been solid and who should I drop for him like so on my team I've got  as options Jordan Poole ironically I got Max Drew's I got Jabari Smith and I got Daniel Gafford which of those guys would you drop to pick up Brandon pods and ski  Cool baller and I love him and he should be rostered everywhere at least until draymond's back and probably their after out of that group Jordan Poole  as tempting as it is I don't think he's tropical just yet  what about Gafford and Jabari Smith those are big guys who normally wouldn't count on but you know Gafford put up six blocks and four steals the other day yeah I mean I think Spruce is the answer dude I mean Spruce is three-pointers is his middle name everybody's hurt in Cleveland right now  which is a good good time to have streus but eventually those guys are going to come back but I just think you need some Podge in your life man I I've been telling my son to pick him up for a week and  I I think but the Gypsy yesterday and 13 points nine rebounds six assists five steals three triples played 34 minutes they played four times next week I don't know how I don't know how he can still be sitting out there  yeah they say Max Drew's is just a poor man's pods and ski anyway  Jonathan kuminga at 13 points of five boards she's been kind of boring I mean you want poejo you want pose over Wiggins um  I just feel like this team is sort of at a moment of an identity crisis where there's a Changing of the Guard but the the guard has been so established there that it's hard to do and so you have Draymond acting out you have Klay Thompson who's not performing like he used to and you have Curry who he was seven for 21 last night you know he's not he's maybe not what he used to be it's an awkward time to be the Golden State Warriors what do you think I mean Curry was seven for 21  clay was three for 12 nine points on Christmas day like this supposed to be there coming out party  so the world that they're they're better than than we think they are and they're just kind of a mess right now and you got any time you got the Warriors and and you and I can see here and literally lists six guys that you have to be thinking about picking up off the waiver wire something's wrong like they're Foundation is confusion right now  trayce Jackson Davis went in Indiana got hot for a minute Play Just 15 minutes and he was in foul trouble the whole game but the Warriors and Steve Kerr really like him he's gonna be playing he needs to be giving a look in fantasy and then you've got Daario Sarge he was also getting minutes and and doing things with Draymond gone so  they're a mess I think they are they're having an identity crisis right now and and Clay didn't look right for the first  20 games and then he sort of started looking right again and now  I don't know where we are yesterday was kind of a disaster for Golden State  Steve Kerr is gonna figure it out Legend  speaking of legendary coaches Eric spoolstra  stayed perfect on Christmas day he's 9 and 0 on Christmas Day Brian  they beat the Sixers the Jimmy Butler less Heat beat the Joel embed and this  Sixers  Sixers are owing for without Joel and B this season  and we got thank goodness the only good thing to come out of this game was we got the homie Hawkins game  where were you  for the Jaime Hawkins game you were right I'm just shocked at that that's how you pronounce his name so Jaime jaquez um  yeah he was on my team earlier and just leave a couple weeks ago I had to drop him because he was inconsistent I do think he's a future star  I think you know it helped for Butler to be out but yeah he's the real deal and it was yeah the game you didn't want to watch because Tyrese Maxey even who's a superstar now and is showing that he's more valuable on a team than James Harden when four for 20  tough night for Sixers  yeah he started out overnight didn't score in the first half Jamie Jamie  jaquez thank you thank you because  um this dude now granted you're right Jimmy Butler was out  and Caleb Martin got hurt very early in that game which opened up a ton of alleys  for God has to have success  and you know when people were asking me about him a month ago I was like man you know the heater gonna get healthy he's gonna get squeezed out of the out of the 30 minutes tonight he was getting but I don't feel that way at all anymore and I didn't feel that way for very long once I said that because he has really endeared himself to the fans he's in dire himself to his teammates and co-chair expulsa  he's the leader of this team I think like he's now the locker room leader as a rookie because I don't think bam and Jimmy Butler get out there and raw that the troops and I think he he's a guy that all these guys are sort of like all right let's just follow him because he knows  he knows how to ball and you know unlike is bad as Maxi was that's how good how can I was like 10 11 to 15 shots 31 points 10 boards easily the game is life Caleb Martin can miss several games with his injury which means Hawkins is gonna keep rolling Jimmy Butler is gonna take one game off every week which means Hawk has gonna keep on rolling and  I mean he's a guy at this point you're sticking with him through the good and the bad I think  all right I like it I mean and also the Heat or a team I like to just kind of ignore but they went to the finals last year he came out of the East you know  they know what they're doing  and Bam was bam was fantastic Tyler herro put up 22 points  yeah it's supposed to be genius and and he's also somehow able to get all of his guys minutes when it doesn't seem like he can get all of them minutes like he finds a way to make that happen  one two things that stuck out to me about that Sixers  situation is Kelly oubre he came out on fire  he had 25.6 triples big stat line  so he was awesome if he's available in your league you he's got to be picked up the thing that made me really mad about this game is we were promised sort of  that Robert Covington was good to go and was gonna play Nick button was was already ruled out with a hamstring problem so I loaded up coming to him in FanDuel he's in my 30 team lineup he never got off the bench so that nurse and I have a long history together with Chris Boucher and who I've sometimes called Chris Bosh and Nick nurse I'm officially done with him  it's over  so well I mean talk about people getting burned Paul Reed was a popular pickup right he put up nothing he comes out and racks up four thousands in about 11 seconds as fast as Reggie Miller scored all those points that you're against the Knicks at the end of the game to win it that's how fast  Paul Reed racked up for fouls last night and is it just me or every single time Joe Ellen beat his out everybody races out and rules Paul Reed out there they pick him up for their fancy lineup they put him in DFS they bet money on him and he never ever ever comes through I'm done with Paul Reed and as a result of Paul Reed completely  having a meltdown and doing nothing mobile  I'm I'm Obama scores 18 or no yeah what I wrote a stats down wrong right you didn't correct me on that he had it sees and I 18  and then he did six of something else and three three pointers I I wrote those numbers down wrong which hopefully they caught that before they published My article but  MOBA just went off no we had a season 18 points those numbers are right  I gotta believe in yourself yeah it was the dude from it was chimzi me too that had the 19 or 20 rebounds or whatever yes Mom is numbers right he had 18.643 triples that's a fluke don't buy into that that's all because Paul Reed sucked and joy and be did not play so  whatever I'm over the Sixers I don't I'm not really gonna be ruining for that I don't enjoy the fact that every time  Jill and bead has a big opportunity to come out and make a statement do something he disappears and tends not to play right here yeah I mean  it's Christmas Day and most people were watching football  fantasy is number one platform for NBA best ball and DFS player

I had I had an underdog lineup last night they had Lucas in it and added some basketball had some football  in the only thing left that I needed to hit to win all the money in the world  my one dollar was gonna turn into like 20 dollars I needed 255.5 passing yards out of San Francisco quarterback Brock Purdy he threw the diva Samuel Samuel broke attack hole ran all the way down puts him at 2:55  five minutes left the game San Francisco has the ball one could go wrong Purdy's like up  my shoulder my I got a stinger doesn't feel right walks off the field never comes back  lost if I have yard  it's almost like the franchise in San Francisco was conspiring to not get you a 19 dollar win  yeah I mean seriously that's exactly what it felt like I it was a personal attack  oh my rooting against the Niners these years  they got me back Brian they didn't like it all right  I can't talk about that anymore talk about Luca we got to talk about these Dallas Mavericks my Mavericks 128 the Suns with Kevin Durant open around out there looking miserable one 14  I don't hear anyone  complaining about the fact Luke had 12 of 12 free throws last night he got the line but well times he put up a monster line and you know I own him in the league that we're in together which is funny because you usually like to draft Luka doncic but not not this year  Kevin Durant as you mentioned he doesn't look right he just seems like he's an expired version of himself out there I know he's putting up numbers and like some people are have them in like their top 10s of the year but what I saw last night  it didn't look very effective  well I I just don't think he's he's happy he like Brad Beal only playing in six games is not  is not cool  and  outside of Devin Booker  and Katie what what do they really have their kids didn't play  they don't have the undertone anymore nurkic is serviceable he's not great Eric Gordon is you know  an old guy kind of like us  what might say that they traded some of their better assets to the Brooklyn Nets I mean Mikhail do they miss Mikhail bridges yeah so much and they miss Satan and they missed the cam Johnson was on that team right yeah um yeah yeah they don't seem like they have the depth and meanwhile the Mavericks who I was guilty of saying was on this team besides Luca they're you know they're making this huge mistake they're finding ways to win you know Derek Lively came back put up 20 and 10  they just seem inspired  I don't know I was wrong  well so was I I mean I was like take the under in Dallas wins cuz  you can't win with one guy on your team in the NBA and  Luke was saying last night after the game next man up Lucas line first of all was stupid 50 points 15 assists eight triples  12 free throws  what six boards like just he had like three Steals and three blocks or something was it he had a bunch of blocks in a month he had four steals in three blocks I believe just a ridiculous line my friend our friend Keelan likes to make fun of Lucas new headband I don't know why he doesn't like it I it doesn't really bother me if it keeps the hair out of his eyes and lets him do this every night who cares let's look at your team real quick Brian you're rock and roll team which is in second place behind Steven Malcolm is team even though Mount was didn't even bother to show up for the draft and you keep saying you keep you keep pretending like I had a chance to draft Luca and pass him up but I was picking till like 10th or 11 so I don't even know it was my first shot at anything but even if I would have been picking fourth you would probably would have been picking third and would have taken to Luca right in front me anyway I didn't even want Luca I just didn't want him to fall to wherever you were  well thank you for that but let's look at this team real quick you got Kobe white he's having a breakout year for the Bulls now can I got him off waivers by the way yeah Cameron and I were talking about Kobe white last Tuesday or Thursday are you thinking about getting rid of him while he's hot or do you think he's locked in for the whole year with Lawns of ball nowhere to be found oh yeah I think he's I think he's locked in this is a real breakout I also  on this team was a just got a an offer someone offered me Lowry Martine and for my Jonas valentina's and if you look at you know  which  big Viking European you want I think it's Jonas he's been amazing  and you know it comes down to just like my personal distaste for Lowry based on like his performance as The Bull when I had him on my fantasy team many years ago and I hold grudges against certain guys but I'm not doing that trade I'm holding on to Jonas well Brian not ionically I got an offer involving Laurie Mark and in the same league from the same person yesterday who wanted to do me a huge favor and send me Laurie Markin and  for who did she want for him  so anyway it's funny because Amy is listening all this like I've been recalling and I have been preaching like  so high on Laurie marketing before Utah shuts him down it's this shutdown is coming like he's gonna be injured all year anyway and then Utah's not going to make the playoffs they're they're not going to play him so I'm in shouting at and I talked to my son in yesterday and I was a dude you've got to move Laurie Mark and him before it's too late he's playing right now he's scoring like everything's good right now you need to move him and like five minutes later he comes up he's like hey traded a marketing and Simon's to get Jaren Jackson Jr I'm like yes  I love it now he gave what he gave up a lot and free Simon's and Lori Mark and is a lot for JJJ but I still like I still applaud the kid for going out there putting a deal together that quickly and getting it done who did who did Amy offer me marketing for I have to figure that out just real quickly to go to the rest of your team you got James Harden Mikhail Bridges Kelvin Johnson chat homegrown who got probably in the third round  balance units you got Jalen during coming back tonight that's big you got Julius Randle and you have  a Harvest Time and Jarrod on and then the guy sitting on your bench tonight because he's not playing his Luka doncic I mean that I'm stacked and yet I'm losing to Stephen malkmus who Auto drafted but yeah my team is stacked this year it's super stacked  I love it oh it was it was Lori marking for Jalen Brunson I said no yeah that's a no but if you're listening to this or watching this and Amy if you're watching or listening this I apologize for calling you out but we sort of I mean it came up organically I mean he got to try to move the guy I'm with you there keep trying I need wimby to play tonight by the way  um okay  uh back to Christmas Day this is last the end of it Luca  comes the fourth guy ever scored 50 points on Christmas Day is the seventh fastest NBA player to ever reach 10,000 career points the fastest since Michael Jordan did it  him and Grayson Allen both hit 83 pointers yesterday to I believe that tied the Christmas day three pointer record  my guy on my 30 deep team Derek Jones Junior having a career year and 23 points three boards of Steel three triples Derek Lively back from an ankle injury to cut them out for four games double double with 20 and 10 hit 8 of 9 shots and Tim Hardaway at 18 points 7 boards three three pointers if if Derek Lively was dumped when he was injured it's time to go pick him up again it's so fun watching him and Luca run pick and rolls  I love Derek Lively playing with Luca that this team is just flat out better without Dorian Finney Smith playing 39 minutes it really is and and you know what I liked about yesterday's game when I saw on TV was when Luca went over to the sidelines Kyrie was the first one there like  pushing him and like Yeah Boy you on fire like dabbing him up and talking smack and I feel like Kyrie is if he was not really hurt he would be fully invested in this team and out there playing every day I just think he's really hurt that Dwight Powell falling on both of his feet when they're sticking straight up and there was not it was not good I mean that would put any of us out of commission for a long time so I did the Highlight where Dwight Powell jumped up and hit his head on the the beam as he was walking out onto the court it's worth watching it's looked really painful  I will check that out she missing me to for the son's  with your kitchen out somehow had 23 points in a career high 19 rebounds he looked amazing I watched him for a while and he looked great their kitchen is an out for very long but there's a great streamer  I mean he was a great streamer last night nurse is a personal reasons guy right now so we don't really know when he's when he's gonna be back probably won't be too long Booker at 20 Durant had 16 Grayson Allen was awesome Alan had a career I 32 points for boards for assistance steal an eight triples I've been riding the Grayson Allen train throughout this whole Brad Beal mess I will continue to do so they they need him right I told my brother-in-law who's who's got Brad Beal just sitting out there because he's already using his IR spot I was like  I think feels a drop and now I know you think that sort of Reckless thing to say on a fantasy podcast but I can't see him  putting up huge numbers this year I just don't see it  corner like Austin Reeves when when LeBron James and Anthony Davis don't have the ball  and he's ankle and his back problems probably aren't gonna go away I mean bradfield's lower leg is always her it has been for like six years um  Grayson Allen's not going away  Eric Gordon's probably not going away I I mean I don't I'm not gonna sit here and tell people to straight up just cut Bradley Beal but I don't hate you for telling your brother-in-law that like  I  sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do I mean people people didn't think that dropping Ben Simmons two months ago was was probably a great idea but where in the hell is Ben Simmons yeah and it doesn't matter what I tell my brother-in-law to do his response is always did you know Michael Porter Jr used to steal packs of gum from the Walgreens Downtown  oh I love that so much that is the best dude that is that is outstanding about  Bad Blood Bad Blood donate some by the way very quiet yesterday but he's been awesome filling in for Kyrie as well we still don't know when Kyrie's coming back although they did show Brad Beal in a hoodie shooting jumpers yesterday Brian did you see that I got him on an IR spot in my one league but  I don't know well you can't hire him up I I'm with you man I don't know that you want him on your  cluttering up your roster a bunch of dnps  six games Brad Beals played in this year six  hey let's blow through this lineup real quick and then answer some viewer questions okay I want to look at tonight's schedule so Brooklyn is at Detroit Brooklyn has to win or they let Detroit snap a 26 game losing streak on their watch that would not be a good look or Lando at Washington I don't care Atlanta at Chicago I think I'm rolling some  who's the who's the point guard  why is his name Stephen this is what happens when you get old I think I think Kobe White against the Atlanta is a very good play I know Trey young is kind of iffy Alex Caruso is the guy he's thinking I'm gonna play in the night Atlanta's a sieve just like Indiana the Bulls score a million points and the Hawks will score a million and one  same thing with Indiana Houston Indiana doesn't play defense  Alfredsson goon she go crazy who knows what bennedict mathurin will do dude it's either 6 points or 30 there's no in between yeah I had to let go of him he's inconsistent thought I even drafted him and I thought it was gonna have a big year I would take Obi topping over math or if you want to pay her that you can be Expendable on your roster  tari Easton's been hurt he was fun before he got hurt hopefully he's back and ready roll tonight in New Orleans we got ja Morant going for four winds in a row versus Zion Williamson I think that is gonna be fun  Josh price tagging the fs through the roof now I I feel like he's a must-have guy but he's 10,000 on FanDuel and that's just that's a lot of money man  I mean yeah he's probably gonna put up solid numbers and man his first game back I watched the whole game and he was he was impressive it was awesome he's been impressive in all three of them hey and he's he's been turned loose set free and he's fully healthy he's been doing nothing for like a year except waiting to play basketball  he's just he's just ready to be Unleashed game of the night Brian who would have thunk it back in October Minnesota at Oklahoma City yet number one versus number three in the west I love this I love but Minnesota Oklahoma City is not something that the like TV networks think ahead of the season oh we got a show everyone this but it's the game I want to see I don't want to see Golden State against the Lakers know your choice is this evening on NBA TV are the Pacers at Houston which I get it Tyrese Albertsons fun and that should be I like watching the pace I love this page 16 and then you get Charlotte Hornets at the Clippers  at 10:30 on NBA TV Brian what are you gonna be doing instead of watching that game  you'll probably be reading I mean I'm stuck here  I'm stuck here in Missouri I mean I'm gonna watch Rudolph again but yeah Minnesota Minnesota's so fun and then Oklahoma City is obviously like  on the up and up and young and exciting like that's the game you want to watch you have to live in one of those cities to get the game on TV or you have like the special package do you have the special package yeah  you should have come to the long to Georgia for  Christmas and then you can watch here we could watch the Thunder and Minnesota game tonight what you should do tonight is read about the Missouri House State matchup in the bowl game all right you got windy against Lori marking and the Jazz  we don't know if Kiante Georgia is going to play if he doesn't Chris Dunn is a very strong DFS play tonight  I need women I need women to play I literally have him on every fantasy team I have you have to expect a bunch of knights off when you draft the guy like Gumby like it's like  hey you have Chet homerun bro same thing  I have one being one of my three teams but like this is part of the deal the problem is the Spurs had that two game week and he only played in one of those why everybody else is playing for and I've never recovered since you got the Kings at Portland  Kings should roll them and then you got Charlotte at the Clippers on NBA TV at 10:30 make sure you tune in for that one although the Clippers how to see baby  it looks like it's working it's all working out  I really I love Kawhi Leonard and he has played more than expected so far this year  so  I hope  all right Ryan we're gonna go quick hits on these questions are you ready yeah let's do it  Mr C wants to know who do you prefer arrested season Derek Lively or Isaiah hartenstein  oh God it hurts me to say it but Lively a lot of these got minutes guaranteed so I might I might choose that over iHeart who's gonna go back to the bench when Mitch Robin's back what do you think I'm going to say short-term I want Heartstone long-term I want Lively  I I'm gonna find a way to have both of them on my roster if they're both available in my league but if you're in like a ten man or eight man that's that's hard to do Brian this guy is helping you out Tristan Tristan I sold  telling you how to pronounce Jaime Hawkins I'm sure when I called him Jaime jaquez  people are just like what what an idiot yeah I I was the one who called them that first and I played the Bongos so you're cool  rough  I must lamelo ball and Drew Holiday trade for Anthony Davis  I don't know what they make it depends what you think lamelo's situation is what do you think  well I tell you what I like about it from a Davis perspective is Davis  is playing through injuries and looks like he has a different mindset as far as playing with injuries this year than in the past so I don't  know that he's going to go to the locker room every game like he has in the past  I  also don't know where Brian just went but he's back and then lamelo and Holiday  man that's  I don't know that I can give up lamelo and holiday for Davis but if you're gonna trade for Anthony Davis that's the kind of deal it's gonna take so and now is the moment you want to sell high on Anthony Davis if you if you own him and you looking to get rid of him  so yeah I I think it's a fair trade I think it's gonna have to be something like that to get Davis a Dita is back as he is every week I dock and Brian Merry Christmas both of you is Terry Easton still a hold  and that that's that is a great question I mean when was the last time we saw tari Eason  play Brian you remember I don't I mean he's at he's asking about Head to Head 12 Team 15 categories you're in like a 30 Team league where someone like that as a whole  15 cat how do you how are there even 15 categories are they doing like  they're doing defensive rebounds offensive rebounds  free throws made free throw percentage um so last time we played was December 23rd  which was Saturday  8 points for boards la  doesn't seem like a whole to me well the the problem was he was bawling  and then he got hurt  and he had 14 points 8 boards four steals  and a block last Monday  I'm still trying to hang in there with him but again if if he's the worst player you have you're in a 12 team League  somebody really want to pick up a city out there you got to make a decision and go with it so I mean I could see dropping car Easton to pick up a hot free agent  what about Caris LeVert um  what about cares alert would you drop Ethan for Levert  no  depends on who who's on the wire in that League you know you're not going to find a pods zensky out there in that League I would drop Easton for pajam ski in a heartbeat oh Brian to answer your question he said it's your typical nine cap plus field goals made free throws made  three pointers percentage double-doubles triple double spells and flagrant fouls it's always been my dream to be in a league that rewarded or punished you for flavor fouls  he did this man is living your dream  really well the actual dream is for you and I to do our permits League that we keep threatening everything here  mentally would be amazing iHeart would be amazing well we need to get together sometime and like right now like we need to we need to have a meeting to figure out how we're going to do that  all right we got one more question one more comment and then we're gonna then we're gonna roll out of here and go enjoy the rest of the holiday Tristan also says accepted an offer Kauai Leonard for my Devin Booker last week about five minutes for he was giving a GTD and miss the next two games I didn't need him last week Queens seven one good Trader not uh  gave away Booker got Kawhi Leonard Brian don't like  yeah I mean you got to think that Kawaii is gonna be sitting on the bench too many games down the stretch  and Booker doesn't have that quality  so I would probably be inclined to hold book or but straight up numbers wise Kawaii might be the better  fantasy asset  I like Booker better than Kawaii I will just say that I'd rather have Booker  Brian I lied we're doing another one WWE wants to know should I drop Jordan Clarkson and Devon vessel  for Derek Lively and Jill and Duran absolutely go big  I am not going to sit here  and tell you to drop Devin vassell for anyone  I would hang on to vassal I would drop Clarkson and I would pick up Jalen Duren  how about that there's a couple nice centers right there but yeah vessels for real interesting is coming back at us with only missed two games Bookers Miss 10 or more which he's got a point and I feel like Kauai is is right there with ad  in that mindset of I'm going to play as many games as I can play in this year in the Clippers are special we're gonna do something so I again I don't hate to trade I just like Devin Booker better um I I trust him more than I trust Kawaii but I mean it I don't I'm not gonna sit here and say that was a bad trade that's a fair trade anyway slices I feel like Tristan is our special third guest on the podcast this week well he is he's always here Tristan's always here dita's here a lot of these guys are here every week very loyal supporters I

would go for a 30-minute solid without ever getting old  and be like the like Charles Barkley who he played for except to be Thunder God how he say this  oh that was that was that I've kind of proud of that all right  all right  go back to your brother-in-law tell him that he was a hot topic on today's show  find out about this Missouri this is Missouri football team in fact I  are the even playing on how state I'm pretty sure they are Missouri was really good this season in football and Missouri fans were talking so much smack about them all season long and they got a chance to really make statement and take out Ohio State so I would like for you to report back to me via text message later what your family's feeling is about this football game  I'm on it all right everybody have a
