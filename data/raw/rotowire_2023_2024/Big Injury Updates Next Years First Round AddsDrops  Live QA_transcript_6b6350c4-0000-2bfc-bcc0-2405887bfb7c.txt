big whale and Alex Bertha here you're listening to the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast so if you're watching along on the RotoWire fantasy basketball YouTube channel as well we'll be recapping the weekend talking about the week ahead it's finally here Alex five game week for the Brooklyn Nets we've been four shadowing this talking about it for weeks so if you're if you're throwing the call britches out there congratulations we'll get some schedule notes as well heavy week overall a lot of four game weeks in the NBA talk about some injuries and hits a big picture items as always give us some questions in the chat you know we're coming up on the fantasy playoffs and down to that stretch run if you are if you're wondering about any moves if you're wondering who to pick up who to start throw those in the chat we will hit those throughout the show and if we get a bunch of questions in there we'll go rapid fire at the end Alex it's Monday I was your weekend and anything major go down for you in Madison ah nothing major I mean I re-watched the movie face off not sure if you're a Face-Off guy is that hockey movie know everybody thinks it's a hockey movie it's John Travolta and Nick Cage and it's like an action movie and they swap faces it's an all-time action movie in my opinion Nick Cage is that is absolute Peak they're sort of pretending to be each other Nikes is evil John Travolta is good it's a it's a cop robbers sort of a thing it's  if you love like I'm intentional comedy the sort of like late you know 90s action movies stuff you will lose your mind at this Johnny loves this movie yeah Johnny bar the Chad says great movie was five exclamation points  so is it unintentional comedy is there any hint of intentional comedy yeah just switching faces like you can only take that so seriously yeah so it was sort of at the time you know in movies I think he came on 97 where I think action movies were still fine like taking themselves like 75% seriously and then 25% like they know it's they know it's all talking cheek in a way and Nick Cage any time you know anytime Nick Cage brings a performance it's always it's always insane but yeah you need to re-watch we watched it on VHS the the right way and it was it was just I think it was funny or the second time around to be honest well anybody who knows me or has listened to me on the radio or podcast over the years knows that I do not watch movies so it goes without saying that I'm not seeing that movie and probably never will but I appreciate you giving me the synopsis like this is part of the reason I don't watch movies is I hear about it and I'm like all right I know what happens like what is there to watch here I I'm a big reader of movie Wikipedia pages so I've read a lot of movies I've not watched a ton is there a favor that you've read  um  let me think no no not really I have like four movies that I like and I just gotta go back to those when I need to but any TV recommendations by the way throw those throw those in the chat guys I finished her detective last week or a couple weeks ago so we need something to to fill that Gap let's talk about basketball I want to go too long on this this hullabaloo before we talk injuries kind of a tough weekend in the fantasy basketball World Alex for one we had a bunch of low-scoring games you know that the scoring debates seems to continue to Wax and Wane or it feels like some nights everybody's scoring in the 140s as Boston did yesterday and some nights you have some competitive games you know into the mid-80s and the 90s as we saw on Friday but we gotta start with the injuries obviously Trey young last week that was the big one we got three more that were keeping an eye on and we'll start with Scotty Barnes because I think this is probably the most concerning of the three the other two being Devin Booker and Jalen Brunson and the Brunson one Alex I mean at the time yesterday I'm like that that looked bad bad bad right and then the the Twitter doctors came out and were like well you know maybe bang these there looks like it might be a nerve issue which would certainly be better you know that a meniscus or an ACL but Scotty Barnes left hand fracture you know they're saying yeah they could come back in April I  I don't know Alex I think this is kind of the green light for Toronto to see if they can hang on to I think it's a top six protected pick that they owe they were kind of waffling between pushing for play and spot in falling back anyway and I just I don't really see the Merit this seems not going to win games without Scotty bars and I don't see the Merit and you know bringing him back for a week or a week and a half at the end of the regular season yeah I I agree with you Barnes actually hasn't missed a game all year other than the one emotes miss most recently and so I think you're right that is that pick is protected top one to six to San Antonio you know they kind of been hovering you know there are three losses ahead of behind of everyone a phrase it Memphis  possibly it might be able to catch them I mean Memphis is trying their absolute best to continue to lose games but I think now yes you do you feel like you should at least give it the old College try of not trying  well and you know so part of it is I ideally you know you'd get into that bottom six and you're like all right you know odds are we will pick six but you're also increasing your chances to jump into that top four so I I think that makes that decision which maybe Toronto had been leading that way anyway I think that makes it a little bit easier I think the obvious question is are you dropping Scotty Barnes you know if it's your intention right now you need to fill that spot you can't necessarily afford to wait it out or you're in a head to head league and the playoffs start in a couple weeks are you totally comfortable cutting bait  I would say there's like a 90% chance at least it's just fine to cut Scotty Barnes you know if you're if you're a weekly Waverly just wait and even you know even if you're in a daily waivers League I would maybe just see what they say because you know I there's a chance that within a few days they you know woes or shops or somebody comes out with a with a report about a real time table which doesn't always happen right away but what are the chances you know Scotty Barnes comes back from a broken hand  this late in the season it just doesn't really seem like it's gonna happen yeah  right and it is important to know as the sun comes out here and obscures my vision it is important to note that there isn't a timetable but like you said it's a broken hand it's an injury that we could look back and say all right you know X number of players have suffered this injury you not coming back and two weeks you know it's probably four weeks at the absolute minimum so I don't really see a whole lot outside you know with that and I think you're right 90% chance that you're probably good dropping himself about right beneficiaries in Toronto you know what is the trickle-down effect here you know I suppose we probably see more gradey dick I don't know that that gets me all that much more excited about him you know it's like more minutes in theory equals more production but it's not like a you know they're handing the reins over to him right I think if anything you could have usage boost for RJ Barrett you get a usage boost for a manual quickly you know we probably see a little bit more Oshi who moved into the starting lineup yesterday against Charlotte and actually look pretty good took 20 shots and 33 minutes 13 points nine rebounds two blocks didn't shoot it well was one of seven from three but if we're just looking at that small sample first game all year like he said without Scotty Barnes I think I was actually you know who they got from Utah mid-season he's probably the guy and you know we maybe see a little bit more of Jordan Torah Off the Bench as well but for me he's probably a deeply is only  yeah well no I double checked this Jeff stats on Twitter who was done some work for us in the past tweeted about the Barnes injury and said time lost for broken hand will be determined by the nature of the brake and subsequent treatment average time loss for a third medical that did not need surgery it's 12 games average time for a person who got surgery 18 games so in theory he could come back he also notes that Wendell Carter Miss 20 games earlier in the season with one that required surgery so  maybe Barnes comes back at the end of the year but again we're doing we're dealing with a very different situation at the end of the year than like Wendell Carter at the beginning of the Season or something like yeah remaining for Toronto for what it's worth good note um  yeah I mean they trained for a bhaji you know they got all the Nick in that deal as well but I think they that was really a trade for a bhaji that they that they pulled off so you know getting him in there getting him 33 minutes I think he will be a beneficiary 20 shots is crazy he's been a low usage guy in Utah so look maybe they'll tell him you have the green light you have shooting every time you're open try to make some stuff happen offensively that's possible he mentioned War I got 18 minutes he's not there's been times where he's not been shy about shooting but it never I don't think he's fantasy relevant unless he's getting like 28 minutes a game or something like that and yeah I think gradey dick  again he's he has the potential to be a little bit more than a 3-point shooter I think further on in his career like I think he could end up being kind of a Max screws who cuts and he can make passes and he's got size so we can rebound and stuff like that but as of right now I think he's mostly just a three-point guy so as of yeah like you mentioned abaji seems like the guy from one sample yeah yeah I think with Dick and you know you saw a lot of this when he was at Kansas and through the draft process you know it was a lot of like this is not Kyle Korver all right he may look like kind of but he is not Kyle Korver and yeah I just think this early in his career he kind of just a spot-up guy I'd like to see a little bit more you know expansion of what they offer him down the stretch but between Barron quickly it's like you just don't there's just not that many times where you're asking great dick to do that so I think the spruce cop is really good because you know he's still a shooter first four most and that's what Grady dick is going to be but you know he's not gonna be a guy who's going to struggle to average like one assist per game you know he's got great size you rebounded really well at Kansas he was over five Boards of game you know in about 32 minutes he's got really good size good athleticism you know 44 his age and for his position so  really interested him in Dynasty League's you know I think he's somebody that could could help you tan in three down the stretch but you know for me it's about you that gets the biggest bomb but then just probably bear it and quickly after that Devin Booker out at least seven to 10 days that's per job serrania dealing with an ankle injury he did not play yesterday against OKC tweak that ankle against Houston the night before it just keeps happening for Phoenix man whether it's whether he's been mostly Beale you know Bookers is missed his time you know Duran's missed a few games here and there but here we go again we're you know Bradley Beal's been back in the lineup for two games and he plays one of those with Devin Booker Beal was in on a minutes restriction in that game and you know two nights later Devin Booker's out so nothing too devastating not dropping Devin Booker you're hoping it's just a week absence for him but still a pretty big hit at this point the season  it's a big hit um  I think we for the most part just know what's going to happen I don't think there's a lot of mystery in terms of who benefits more Touches for Bradley Beal we were recommending Royston O'Neill actually because they're so injured all the time that's going to continue Eric Gordon stepson takes more shots crazy I will take some more shots go a while seems like they're interested in giving Saban lease a more run but I it's almost kind of decided what they're you know what's going to happen here yeah it's a three game week for Phoenix this week so that's that's nice it is a four gamer next week so you know this this is a shorter term injury maybe you can get back for that and then they play three games the week of March 18th you know it's one thing for Fantasy it's another thing for for where Phoenix stands in real life right I mean they are currently in the seven spot right now by virtue of not having the tiebreaker over Sacramento both of those teams you know in terms of games behind the one seat sitting at seven and a half they're a game up on Dallas they are two and a half up on Golden State and the Lakers and this is the team that I think is proven certainly more so than the Warriors in the Lakers have that they could survive these injuries they don't completely bottom out you know when they're missing one of those big three but you know they lost two in a row to Houston and OKC coming out of the break they lost a Houston and Dallas and they're at Denver tomorrow night that's a tough game without Booker then they get to know their home against Boston and at Cleveland after that so kind of a bit of a dicey stretch coming up here or four Phoenix you know likely not having Booker for at least a handful of those games and they actually play Boston again next Thursday so you would hope that Booker's back for that but this could this could pretty easily be a stretch you know you could you could see them you know losing to any of those teams even with Devin Booker at Denver Boston Cleveland Boston you know this might be the opportunity here you know if Golden State and the Lakers can straight string something together to at least trim into that that lead that Phoenix has for the seven because I I'm pretty sure at this point that the Warriors of Lakers are going to be played at play in teams I should say but you know you'd much rather be sitting in 7th or 8th and you would 9/10  yeah I agree I mean you have  six teams within three and a half games with each other in the west the five through 10 so that's going to be jumbled up I think the rest of the season and could end up like really in any order because somebody of these teams have are actually veteran teams or got have guys who have been injury probe but I do think you're right it does seem like Warriors and Lakers are almost destined to be playing teams at this point  but yeah it's it's just the West continues to be very jumbled up in the middle yeah tough stretch coming up for the Lakers as well they of course lost to Denver on Saturday the 40,000 Point Lebron game which feels like every game where he's passed some sort of Milestone with the Lakers they find a way to lose that game so that's kind of par for the course but they got okay see Sacramento Milwaukee Minnesota Sacramento Golden State their next six games taking us through the end of next week so that I would like to say that stretch will tell us a lot about the Lakers but you know what we've seen from them this season I expect them to somehow just go three and three and we're back to square one  yeah they're they just I don't know they it's like they pushed a lot of their chips in for the for the in season tournament  and then just have not been able to figure it out since then and I think  window we're gonna almost like a airplane mode and now I think they're trying to ramp it back up again you know as LeBron and AD sort of you know we're nearing the playoffs so they're kind of tough to predict  yeah they are they are but that's saved time they are like I just like the predictably average yeah they have enough sample now and like in years past it was always like well you know they didn't have ad for 15 games so they didn't have LeBron for 15 games like they've had their guys you know and they've they've just shown us time and time again that they're slightly above average team that even with that being the case you still don't want to face it right like if you're if you're Phoenix or you're Sacramento or you're New Orleans and that's your your winning in game to actually make the playoffs like that's still I still scary opponent and I think the one thing with the Lakers no matter how the first 82 games go like I still believe that they're like a top three team in the west and you know we'll be just fine in a play in setting whether that ultimately proves to be true we will see we mentioned Jalen Brunson by the way that was of course the other big injury yesterday if you're listening to this or watching this you probably saw the play you know when you review it you kind of see Bronson did bump knees with heart and Stein kind of look like he shook it off initially came off the screen took a mid-range jumper and like kind of admit are you know released the ball and then started grabbing at the knee I mean this looked really bad at first really really bad he's down in the Heap you know he's getting helped off the floor you are thinking you know 20l meniscus you know at best but then the Twitter doctors came out and you can see you know the I think it was his left foot it's kind of like dragging on the ground and then you get into like this thing called foot drop which I was reading up on last night which would imply potentially that it could be a nerve injury and that  we still don't have anything definitive x-rays came back negative you know they I think they initially said knee soreness and they importantly listed at him as questionable to return instead of just the dreaded like out for game right away so I think there is still a pretty decent degree of optimism here that he's avoided anything serious with that said when you're dealing with you know potential nerve issue or even a bruise to that knee I still think he misses some of the time here you know but got to be at least a couple of games they played a borrow at Atlanta or against Atlanta and then Friday against Orlando and they finish out their three game weeks Sunday against Philly I'd be pretty surprised if he's out there tomorrow but the schedule kind of works in their favor given the timing of the injury  it does and then we saw with Brunson went down we saw 47 minutes of Miles McBride Off the Bench pretty awesome stuff and of course yeah really short bench for for typical they signed Shake Milton  yeah so you know maybe within again within the next week or so he might be useful in fantasy but again at the same time Tibbs hates new guys he likes playing his guys so it's like maybe we will get 40 minutes of Miles McBride and you know 40 to 45 minutes of Josh harder than Milton plays like eight minutes but yeah we ultimately we just we need more info before we make any sort of you know real decisions on the waiver wire yeah I think McBride's the guy I'm most interested in right now and it was interesting I don't believe he was picked up in the stake League you know and I think part of that is just the belief that maybe Brunson doesn't miss that much time and you don't want to you know go all in there the seven games this season in which big bride has played at least 30 minutes he's averaged 15 points three boards for assists one and a half Steals and 2.9 made threes so in just about any size League 12 and up I'm interested in that you know and I'll probably wait until we get an update on Brunson but if you're kind of looking for a weekly streamer for this week or even just a one game streamer for tomorrow great matchup against that Landa I you know like you said we've seen this with tips before I mean this could very easily let's say Bronson Mrs 3 games it would not be shocking at all miles McBride averages like 43 minutes a game in those three  right yeah I mean McBride has really improved his three-point shooting this season it's been huge solid Pastor you know main thing for him at least in the past was his was his steals upside which is continued this season alone August highs last year but yeah someone who if runs and misses a week we could have something like that McBride should should be picked up all right let's go to the chat we'll pull some questions out here keep throwing those in there guys we'll hit those throughout the show Christian says good afternoon fellas thoughts on Taylor Hendricks in Utah should I drop Paul Reed or PJ Washington to pick up Hendrix well if you're talking long term you know we'll see we'll dive in on that if you're looking at a streamer for tonight I'm pretty interested because this is a really great matchup for both sides the Wizards and the and the Utah Jazz I'm pretty interested in kuzma props of John Collins props tonight and the reason for that is we have no Market in and no Walker Kessler Market in dealing with a quad injury and Walker Kessler I'm sorry I'm on Kessler Edwards page that is the one that pops up first for some reason on our site Walker Kessler still dealing with that footage so this will be three absences in a row for him we started to see Taylor Hendricks integrate  into this rotation even when both of those guys are healthy he had 13 boards that was a season High I guess by Emmy over the weekend so I think you taught me is a team that pretty clearly is kind of backing their way out of the plane race  I be monitoring the market in and Kessler situation it's pretty closely because it wouldn't shock me if they did like a soft shut down with either of those guys so along with way of saying yeah I I'm pretty interested in picking up taeler Hendrix I think we have to be realistic about what the ceiling is but I also think he could be a 30 plus minigame pregame guy if we see Marketing in a specialty missed more time I agree I just don't think you should drop Paul Reeder or Washington for him I just you look at Paul Reed's numbers you know over the past you passed months past two weeks same with PJ Washington I just don't know I feel like Hendrix ceiling  is about what these guys are doing so I would not drop what is not a sure thing with Reed in Washington but has been has been pretty stable for a little while now  okay yeah and so Philly has a four game week this week Utah has a three game week so if you're just kind of looking at how do I handle it for the week ahead  you know if you want to say it's comparable I would give the edge to Paul Reed you know especially when you're talking about players of this ilk you know games played really matters and then PJ Washington and Dallas  the maths do have a three game week but you know PJ Washington is playing 30 to 35 minutes a night that's been the case in six straight you know the numbers that pretty decent you know the rebounding has been down a little bit since he left Charlotte 3.2 spent all over the place but he's been taking a time you know he's taking like 263 over the last three games so I like what we've seen there I did see a question in the chat about Daniel Gafford so I want to find that malware on the on the on the Mavericks and I know his minutes have kind of been on the decline of late and I cannot find this question Alex did you see it in there um know maybe all right there we go we got it from Danny Meuse he says anyone know what to do with Daniel Gafford looks like the move to the Mavs isn't gonna be good for him and he's asking about zubats as well he says he's got a few injuries those two not producing much is killing him so we'll start with gaffer  I love the real life move to Dallas for him you know what it meant for the Mavs beefing up their front Court getting rid of Grant Williams initially it looked like it was gonna work out pretty well coming out of the All-Star break I mean it's been a disaster to the point where I think he probably got to drop it right he's averaging 14 and a half minutes per game over the last six so that includes two games where he didn't even get to 10 minutes  I mean I think he's probably a drop unfortunately I mean someone who's rostered gas heard like the entire season and multiple leaks  so this is a problem for me personally okay if he's I mean he again like you said he played single digits in two games over the past six  that's to me just hints at I mean first of all he's got a huge followers he's committed the most shooting fouls in the NBA so you know it's going to be hard for him to play 25 minutes regardless to 30 minutes regardless and to me you know some of this might just be he doesn't have great chemistry with Dodge it and ultimately like he's out there for one thing as is Derek Lively as is Dwight Powell to catch lobs from Luka doncic to roll hard to the rim and have good chemistry on that in that front and if he if if Don's just kind of out on him which is possibly just not gonna play that much so unfortunately I do think he's a drop but we're at the time of the year where there are like you're gonna have a lot of streaming options going forward right so you don't have to feel as bad about it right now as you look at this was like November well I think the big thing with Gafford is yeah the lobs are nice the rebounds are nice but you're in it for the blocks more than anything and if those aren't going to be there I think you have to look into other options here it doesn't have a multi-block game since February 12th and that was against the Wizards who absolutely you know love being blocked they invited invite being blocked every single night I mean before the trade he was basically a 2.2 to 2.5 blocks per game guy for most of the year and now we struggling to get to one game the block rate interestingly enough is basically exactly the same if you look at the percentage of shots he's blocking in Dallas versus Washington but obviously when you're basically cutting the minutes in half that's gonna have a huge effect so I'm fine moving on from him you know baring an injury to Lively or PJ Washington I don't know that a ton changes there in terms of the fantasy relevant portion of the season and then as far as goes just kind of a weird stretch for him like he missed back-to-back games with an illness he came back yesterday against Minnesota maybe he was on some sort of soft restriction like he was not in foul trouble although the going up against Minnesota  unique component like the Clippers were using two bigs you know we saw more Daniel theis so that may have been part of it but prior to the illness you know he was still kind of right where you where you'd expect workload wise you know 23 to 28 minutes most nights I'm not it's rough week for zubac for sure but I don't think I would Panic there yet no I work at Panic there yet I mean your rostering zubats because he's giving you you know roughly 10 and 10 every night  and again you might be able to find you might be able to stream in that production on four game weeks from other guys you know if you got a like like you're mentioning you got guys who are injured  but like Nick said I think this illness thing was a short-term thing you know tough matchup against Minnesota I'm not  you know babe basically on too much like talk to me next week on zubac and let's see what's going on  still 77% rostered in Yahoo League's if you're wondering about that Alan says thoughts on who to drop Ivy or O'Neil or kaminga 9 cat 12 Team league  so my first inclination would be Roi so Neil but you know now we have this Devin Booker news so he'll likely slot in and you know could be a starter for a week plus here  you know he struck together two pretty nice games in the last week you know the 20 point area against the Lakers and other 20 pointers against Houston the steals have been there you know he's blocking some shots lately he's hitting a bunch of Threes so this this is a legit debate  yeah I still think there's a little more upside you know someone like Jane Ivy you're gonna have to live with but down games from him of course but I think you're gonna get more consistent counting stats out of ivy with this being a nine cat League though it depends are you willing to stomach if your goal percentage and you know how badly do you need the threes and the defense of production from O'Neill versus the more consistent points that assist from ivy yeah I would not drop kaminga here um he's still playing too well  O'Neill versus  Ivy is kind of interesting IB is falling off a bit over the past two weeks to a month  especially again really bad shooting 34% you know I just the assists are down he's not giving you anything Steals and blocks I agree with Nick what categories do you need  if you need the stuff O'Neill is giving you like if you need defensive production  if you need rebounds if you need some threes  O'Neill's gonna be the guy go with if you just need raw points  I would just hang on to Ivy  all right Johnny says I'm in first place with a five-game cushion in a 10 team nine cat leaked nice work I just picked up keyonte George from Utah and he just got an injury tag  you think he'll play well tonight if he goes great question you deal with an illness so this will likely be you know game time decision type of thing they're down Kessler their down marketing it's a great matchup against Washington so I will say if he plays even with the illness like I'm probably still comfortable starting him just because this is the best matchup and fantasy basketball right now so yeah I mean tough to say you know what kind of illness is it how was the affected he's coming off of a huge game 31.63 is the other night against a tough Miami team he's been hitting about three threes a game at 40% over the last 15 so he's had this flash games but he's been more consistent overall you know we always say we don't have any more you know injury Insight than that anybody else we just report the news but if he plays I think I'd throw them out there yeah  I would for sure like Nick said this is a cakewalk match up Washington 14 straight losses worst defense in the NBA over the past month  over under on this game is 241 they're gonna be getting up and down the court if he plays again you never know like  yeah we don't have any more insight but that fire mop  the Jazz are five and a half Point favorites in their down like two of their three best players like that speaks to where we're at right now with Washington all right we got a trade question for Paul he says I got offered cutting him in Demon shenzo for my Simons and Kobe white I'm hunting field goal percentage and turnovers so I think Simon's in white ceilings are higher not too sure if you Vincenzo can keep up his production what do you guys think nine cat leaked um you know my first thought is the potential for a shutdown with Simon's right and I think you're right the higher ceiling here might be Simon's plus Kobe white Kobe White had some disaster games recently with the shooting is just completely fallen off a cliff it did Rebound with a decent game against Milwaukee on Friday but you know he's two for five two for 13 oh for five two for nine for three over his last four games so he's still playing a ton of minutes so even like his off nights you know the county stats have been there and you've been able to survive it and if you're putting field goal percentage maybe you don't care about that I guess one way I would look at this is there a potential Cunningham shutdown it Detroit obviously is kind of cinched up a bottom four records I guess I don't personally worry too much about that and then the other point that Paul brings up is you know Devin genzo what he's doing is that sustainable  I would like to say no but now in light of this Bronson situation it might have to be  it's not sustainable in the sense that like Anna is gonna come back and Randall is going to come back and then there's just gonna be a ton fewer shots for even shenzo  but um  yeah if you're planting fuel gold percentage intern overseas  you know you Simon says not gonna kill you in White's not gonna kill you there this is a really interesting trade I mean based on what we've seen on all four of these guys over the past month I it would be Cunningham and divincenzo that like it would be on a saggy wanna be on yeah um  I wouldn't mind doing that yeah the Simons I'd be a little worried about the Simon shut down to but Portland  I don't know I feel like they have other guys that can shut down right like Brogden hasn't played in a long time Jeremy Grant like they got other guys  I don't mind this I think I think if you want to do this you know go right ahead I think you know because even if Steven chenzo  gets pushed back into the role a role that he was in early in the season he still probably gonna be a top  120 player and that role  and  Simon's you know for as good as he is  he is like he's ranked 79th this year you know he's not like he's not ranked like 40th like we hoped he would be  yeah I'm on the cuttingham even chenzo side of this I think I would like to know a little more about Bronson like if you could guarantee me that he misses you know more than a week or two then I think even gentle has a nice Runway like I don't really that much about OG coming back I think he's gonna beat Randall as far as that timetable goes and it's like an adobe yeah they'll probably steal some minutes from divincenzo but he's not like that I used to jump a guy like I still think they're gonna ask Stephen chenzo to be one of the big villains for Brunson so that that would tip it tip the scales of my favorite and then you know the concerns about Simon's being shut down and just just playing it for this terrible Portland team that has like no shooting and they're struggling to get to 90 points half the time I would rather have cutting ham and demons so  all right streaming question for tonight's late herder or Alex Caruso these teams played each other Chicago's on the road at Sacramento tonight her just kind of been doing his usual up and down as a big great the last couple of games but you're obviously looking for the the threes with him some rebounds and assists Caruso questionable tonight with a hamstring he played against Milwaukee on Friday did he missed the previous game against Cleveland  I you know he's been piling up a ton of steals this is a points League I think I would probably play it safe here and go hurt her but you know reasonable question  I would go Caruso I mean Caruso doesn't have the scoring upside is heard her but her is gonna have to deal with Caruso and to soon move defensively and space down for Kings it pays off for Chicago um you know everyone Caruso like yeah Caruso's hurt a lot but when he plays  after being questionable he still plays like 30 minutes for the most part so I'm not worried about the injury necessarily  we got a question about Kelly Olynyk that will hit quickly and Matt and chimed in to the chat says he's holding a Linux right now with the turtle injury and that's yeah that's something I want to know it you know Olynyk played 26 and 28 minutes over the last two games to varied results you know he's been piling up the defensive stats which is nice you know rebounds assists those are going to vary night that night to night for him Yakima portal will miss at least one game believe he's dealing with a finger injury probably not anything that's super long term but I think Toronto in general just kind of has to be on on watch the rest of the season like in light of the Scotty Barnes situation where you know maybe they're looking for excuses to to have guys just a handful of games here puddle dislocated his finger the other night against Charlotte so he will not play tomorrow night against the Pelicans good spot to stream but linik for sure you know need a little bit more info on his portal gonna miss you know significant time here before you know going all in on Olynyk but certainly holding him Yeah you mentioned Olynyk he's had a steal Aura Block in six straight games and even though his minutes are kind of low  you know two games below 20 minutes he's still put up like decent numbers in those games he's basically a little over a Fantasy Point per minute  so if you're you know if he's out there for 24 minutes you can roster them in almost any League  yeah  we got some Jabari Walker chatter in the chat kind of an interesting name to to keep an eye on you know if you're mining for  late season value for a bad team in Portland back-to-back double doubles for him had two assists you know three total Steals and a block in those two games not really much of a shooter you know take a couple every now and then they know hit a couple but not really looking for a whole lot of value from The Arc for him it's really more points and rebounds like the defensive numbers have been very odd and off but you know interested in a minute you need any time a guy you know I was playing 31 Off the Bench like he did against Memphis the other night he kind of have to pay attention and you know part of that is Yadier dealing with a hand injury he's missed the last two games  if Aidan continues to miss time very interested in Jabari Walker if not probably gonna be a little shaky  Walker is a guy who I am I'm like interesting to him from a dog he's still eat perspective and I think he could have some stuff going from this series very unique skill set like excellent offensive rebounder averaging 3.4 per 36 pretty good on the Steals and blocks you know not amazing but solid can hit some threes and has a weirdly High free throw rate like a 33% free throw rate so he's just he just gets after it I really know how to explain it yeah I would keep an eye on him Adam speculative speculatively that's fine for sure  yeah that's good catch by you on the free throw rate even when he's not playing that many minutes usually finds a way to to get the line you know two to four times at night and I take that say that's a metric you always want to look at yeah I do that for for prospects in college you know coming into the draft that was something I loved about Ben and last year it's like it's tough for rookies to get to the line as much as he did and it's kind of come back to earth unfortunately this season but if you're trying to separate you know this brass of like young guys who haven't really heard of like I don't this guy even gonna be in the league in a couple years you know things like that assist rate block rate free throw rate those are some of the numbers to to look into let's see Dave asks is Aaron D Smith a hold coming off of an injury or is it better to drop him for a streaming spot his Playoffs begin in week 20 good question because I feel like before Nesmith went down you know we were getting a lot of questions about him and he was coming on strong has not played well in his two games since returning from injury and you want to give them some benefit of the doubt but he did he did have that 12 game Run you know leading up I think it was right up to the all-star break 16.6 rebounds two and a half assists one steal was shooting it really well for three which is always gonna be his calling card I would  be okay streaming that spot I don't think it's like you have to hold are knee Smith to me it's on the size of your league you know in a 14 or 16 Team league you probably not gonna do a whole lot better in a 1051 each week that you like more  yeah I don't think you're going to lose your league off of this move like I don't think this is a league deciding move necessarily what I will say is I don't think I think is really changed I think he's just kind of bothered by the ankle injury over the past two games since he came back like  so I think the reason you presumably been holding Nesmith since December I think those reasons are still the reasons you would want to hold him now is just see that a couple bad games that was hurt but um again that's someone who's so Elite that you have to hang on to him if you want to stream instead  Johnny asks any info on Mark Williams or Julius Randle unfortunately no you know with Mark Williams we're about two weeks out from the date that they said would get another update  I very little optimism on him I think you know even if he were to come back and let's say two weeks  you know there's probably a ramp up period given how much time he's missed you know by the you know unless your leg goes to game 82 I don't really think it's worth it you know Randall Nixon pretty mom you know we got that updated a little over a week ago that you know he's hoping to avoid surgery that was that was a little scary you know because I kind of thought we were passed that but now there are videos coming out of him you know warming up getting workouts in before games so I guess he's gonna Dodge surgery but I have not the Nixon not put a date out there for potential return  right yeah I mean  I both of these teams are keeping a very quiet on these injuries I mean I think Randall's Gonna Come Back  hopefully soonish mid-march I think is like best case scenario Mark Williams I just would not be surprised if he's out for the year I just know update has all the updates have been getting worse since since since since he was dealt that he was out he was out two weeks and he was out for weeks like it just it's just worse every time all right Travis says Hey guys love the show appreciate you watching man what are your thoughts about Jem ski going forward so he's missed two games in a row with the knee issue doesn't seem to be anything too seriously you know worries are down Andrew Wiggins for the second straight year under mysterious circumstances they're off today they're off tomorrow they play a back-to-back Wednesday Thursday at home against Milwaukee in Chicago and then they finish out their three game week on Saturday so hopefully we get Jim ski back for at least one of those back to backs  I'm I'm pretty up but Jeff ski I mean with Chris Paul back in the mix you know in clay you know kind of do a Better Off the Bench you know he had not really played well and his last three games you have the usage in bed now he's kind of he's taking about 10 to 11 shots per game for a while there and then the return to CP I think is going to cut into that for him so rest of this season I'm not super excited but long term I'm pretty interested yeah you talked about looking into you know some of the metrics for a player like pudgy obviously passes the eye test I think that was clear like right away like when he first started playing for them early in the season you're like it was this random dude like it's just the second coming of Nicole mannion know he immediately looked great how many rebounds per game do you think he averaged in his software year at Santa Clara  this completely blind guess I'm gonna guess like six and a half I don't know 8.8 rebounds per game and his final Collegiate season you know kind of an outlier Subways but those are the type of things you keep an eye on right like somebody his size he's not like a crazy athlete by any means he's averaging almost six boards per game he was averaging almost four assists per game like it doesn't doesn't really have much of a weakness to me which is fairly rare for for a rookie guard and yeah you are used in a good spot and a good system and Golden State but I'm really interested in him long term it's just kind of a question of the rest of this season where is he fit in like there's always been there's always been one missing piece you know as soon as CP3 comes back Wiggins goes out you know Clay is moving to the bench then he's not in the bench and you know it looks like he'll be there permanently so I think it's gonna be very up and down for him for the rest of this year but long term Dynasty I really like the jepsky  yeah jump ski stat line shades of like Stevens oh um for Golden State you know some Josh Hart type stuff going on there but yeah I completely agree with you Nick it's just a guy who he knows our past the ball he can rebound decent defensively and at least in terms of getting steals yes you can see the free throw line a little bit more but like he's 64205 he's a guard like he's just gonna be tough for him in terms of this season yeah I mean the return of Chris Paul is going to significantly impact what page is doing I mean I think pajam ski is a good enough good enough three-point shooter and rebounder where he's gonna just be out there doing stuff like cures just kind of continue to give them 25 to 30 minutes every night  but I think this ceiling is kind of just yeah it kind of gets decimated with Chris Paul back you know I don't hate the idea of dropping him to stream guys in I would just maybe wait another week to see really what is usage looks like  and then the mysterious Wiggins app since it's just it's tough even a evaluate that like who know he could come back tomorrow he could come back never she just don't know  Grace and Allen or buddy hield and a head to head points league so Roto I would be all over buddy hield but points makes us a little more interesting you know especially in light of the booker injury Grayson Allen's actually been a slightly better points League guy this year than heeled obviously in category League you know buddy hield giving you like a minimum of two or three threes every single night is pretty huge but Grayson else not played well of late I think there's been a little bit of a panic there because he had been so good you know early in January and into February but it's got 16 total points in his last three games the shooting is kind of dried up he's like four of 25 for three and that span I guess is a comes back around you know you're kind of buying low here if you're training for him you know maybe somebody throw him out on the waiver wire I I think it's close though I mean it's really close they're they're you know separated by about one Fantasy Point per game in points leagues I think Buddy hield if you want the security Grace and Allen if you want a little bit more upside But ultimately you know I think these guys are in the same general range  yes  you know we still don't this damping injury for Philly is  starting to get worrying like he came back  played 16 18 and then nine minutes and then he's just out again indefinitely you know that that would be my main concern  on the heel side would be like melt coming back but I think I think I'm just gonna lean healed because I I don't know Melton's gonna be alright he has been really aggressive and Philly  he's showing up some more passing lately  and I think if if Maxi misses any time  it would be better for healed than if like Bradley Beal missed time I would be for Grayson Allen like I think he'll can absorb usage better that makes sense  okay we'll hit a few more of these and we'll be out Danny says are you guys still holding on the Desmond Bane in your IR really even played all the rest of the season I'll put it this way I am holding him in one league but it's one where I just haven't really had too many injuries I think I'm in like third or fourth in that league and  dropping him to me that it's a deeply deep rosters there's just to me there's not enough upside there it's like I my only chance to really climb in and like try to win this league is if Desmond Bane comes back and looks like that's what band like there's nobody else out there who I could fill that spot with that would give me enough upside to truly move up to where I need to get so for me personally in that situation I'm holding him and just hoping for the best but  obviously would not be surprised if he doesn't play you know they announced I think about two weeks ago that you know he's progressing well whatever that means and you know is expected to return sometime in mid to late March  again the grizzly season is over he hasn't played since January 12th you know if there's any sort of setback he's not coming back but I'm  I'm a little optimistic and the league where I'm holding him does go through game 82 so that's that's a little different too where if you're famous to playoffs are starting up at a in a week you know then that I would probably handle it differently  yeah I mean I don't I'd be  surprised if he came back let's just let's put it that way am I holding him in my IR if if I have if I don't have to drop anybody like like Nick said he's Nick's holding him because  if Bank comes back and it's gonna help Nick move up the standings but that's only because Nick doesn't really have that many other injuries in his sleep if Nick had three other guys who were hurt and he could put on IR then you would probably just drop pain because he needs production like now so if you need production now you got other guys drop Bane if you don't need production right now your team is healthy regardless of where you are in your league just keep them in your in your IR  Johny says what do you think of Norman Powell with the Westbrook injury yeah maybe we should have mentioned this at the top Russell Westbrook like Scotty Barnes fractured left hand over the weekend looking at probably a similar time table you know I think on our site we rolled him out for about a month could be longer obviously the Clippers are in a much different situation that Toronto but that does that does open things up in La I mean worth donating that Westbrook there's some nights where he's struggling even get to 20 minutes so it's not like he's a 35 minute Tonight guy but it should be about 2022 minutes on both nights that now need to get redistributed I'm interested in Powell I'm holding him and suddenly he's kind of the guy you hold for three weeks you drop them maybe you grab them later look good against Minnesota yesterday but did hit 63s can't necessarily depend on that but yeah I mean by default I like a more now with Russell out yeah Powell is  the ultimate microwave score you know just uh I can't think the right word he's just like a sixth man personified um so he's gotta come in he's gonna fire yeah I like him here you know we saw in the past two games bones Hyland re-entered the rotation 16 minutes in the game before last and then 14 minutes so I think I think bones Hyland a combination of Bones Terrence Mann and Norman Powell will probably take Russ's 20 to 25 minutes  I don't know if any of them are massively better because like Nick said  Russell wasn't seeing that many minutes and he also wasn't taking that many shots so you're kind of Distributing like 10 shots between three guys so you know so they might average like a couple more points a couple more minutes  all right good question here from Matt you're in touch on the Jazz earlier said are you concerned about Laurie marketing and missing more games with the fantasy playoffs starting honestly yes I am I am we talk about some of these injuries that I'm not saying they're fake but it's like you know could you play through it yeah well yeah we kind of wouldn't mind falling down the the draft standings a little bit here you know why don't you take your time I don't think he's gonna get like completely shut down but I could totally see this being a multi game injury you know marketing is always been like a little bit fragile you know sometimes when he misses time a one or two game injury turns into three or four and I believe Utah has three games this week anyways so I know the league where I have marketing I just I kept on my lineup entirely you know you're looking at two games as a best case in a week but a lot of teams have four so I wouldn't drop them at this point but definitely concerned about you  I'm concerned I think he's a guy like Jaron Jackson if you can move off of him and get roughly equal value you just do it you just do it like if you know on the season in eight camping is ranked 27th he hasn't played that well lately he's more of like in the 50 range over the past month  but if you go if someone wants to trade you Chris Stapleton Gus if someone wants to trade you Fred Van Vleet or something like that or someone else in that range you don't think is gonna get shut down maybe Evan Mobley I think you just do that just to be safe all right we are at the point this season now we're being asked the associated meech or Trey man and this is a big question I mean these are these are two guys that are going to swing fantasy leagues so first and foremost you know Cody Martin missed their last game and Seth Curry's missed two of the last five so I think that's been part of the recent uptick for meech obviously no lamelo ball as well that's been the biggest Factor Mitch started against Toronto on Sunday 12.6 assists to steals he had 13 7 and 2 in the previous game against Philly I'm intrigued he's not much of a shooter so you got to keep that in mind you're really looking at the assists and the steals more than anything and Terry Mando's off right I mean I think that one  I had delusions that this was going to be like the the late season waiver pickup that that me out and a couple of League's  and that's about the case you know he's not shooting all that well I mean the biggest thing is you know the three-point shooting tends to come and go he didn't even take a single one because Toronto yesterday that was a little concerning prior to that he was two of nine over the last couple of games still giving you assist still a very good rebounder for a guy who's point guard eligible and still giving you steals so I think these are gonna be really comparable but do you do you have a lean one way or the other I mean I would just lead man because the assists are how I say they're that close I think man just has more upside and he fits the timeline of the Hornets more you know like there's zero chance man get shot down and I think if lamelo does come back um then meech is probably the one who sees this Mega to reduce but if you are in a category League  and I think you could just pick the guy for whatever you need you know if you need assist like desperately just pick me to church if you need a little bit more of a rounded like steals some points some threes upside go with man but if you're asking me just straight up points League everything neutral I'm gonna lean Tre Mann  all right we got a do up wreath question is he a better pickup DeAndre Aiden continues to miss time 8 and as of right now questionable to play in their next game so  we'll see you just never know it DeAndre eight and they played tonight against Minnesota they played Wednesday Friday Saturday so four game week for Portland versus Jabari Walker you know in points Lee's they've been pretty comparable Walker's been a little bit better you know a category leaks I could see why you might lean wreath you know in his 13 starts this season 12 and a half points six and a half rebounds one block one point seven threes I I still think I would probably rather own Jabari Walker  it's closed like Fantasy Point per minute why is a wreath actually has the advantage but we thought so has not really shown that he can play extended minutes partially because he is a foul machine like you look at his game logs 13 minutes three follows 13 minutes three follows 13 minutes three fouls like all the time  and Walker can play multiple positions wreath can only play one  so  no matter who gets hurt or who sits out in Portland's front Court Walker can get more minutes the only way wreath is getting more maintenance is if the Andretti and sits so I would I think I would rather lean Walker even if we have moderately more like per minute upside  okay last thing I want to hit quick Alex before we we jump out of here you know we talked last week about  you know who's going to be the number one pick how you know how much you have to consider Victor webinar off for that number one pick I feel pretty strongly that that he'll be in that mix but looking at the the first round overall you know there's there's not as much turnover in Fantasy Basketball in Route 1 is there is a fantasy football where like you know Austin eclair was going like number three overall this year and he's gonna go like number 70 and in 2024 like that doesn't really happen very often you know in fantasy basketball like  any major changes I'll read you the top 12 picks on average across ESPN CBS Yahoo Underdog and fan tracks or pulling from all those you can go check out our ADP report page on RotoWire you'll catch Giannis Tatum SGA and bead Halliburton Curry sabonis Davis Durant Edwards those would be your top 12 but keep in mind this is kind of a blend of points League the category league so that's that's why Yannis is up there at 3 if we went down was going in the first round I'm going to tell you that right now and you know the probably be one or two other players who maybe work their way into that mix who drops out like is there anybody in that group that you say all right maybe I'm not touching them in that range next year  I think I think so  I think it's a bonus  I look he's really good is floors so high  I just think people are gonna ask themselves what I rather have some bonus or this other guy  who has higher upside and they're a lot of time like would you rather bonus or add rather have adverse or Curry still Curry it's a bonus or one but yeah I'm still one banana I probably just take KD um  so I think to me I got those 12 guys that you listed probably I think it will be some bonus that that does fall out and partially because in category League's  he's just not  he's just only good at like two things right know three things I mean scoring rebounding assist yeah he's giving you nothing defensively that can be a problem you know with centers but  I think it's upside just really capped  I think for me it would be coming to rent and I was kind of beat the drama like I don't know if I'd take him in the first round this year and you know that was not been a great call because he's been the seventh most valuable fantasy player in total value not per game he's always he's always great for game but he stayed pretty healthy this year is like himself I I just the recent history strongly suggests that he's going to miss more time next year you know I mean you could say the same about LeBron and ads and some other guys I get that but you know Durant has not finished in first round so since 2019 in fantasy because of all the time missed and you know one of those you missed a complete season so I think he would be the guy where you look at you probably you know if things finished as they do it'll be a top 10 fantasy guy yet again I just I think that would be the one I would fade where I'm saying look I love the way he plays I don't even think he's gonna like drop off a cliff next year even though he's going to get older I think he could somewhat follow the LeBron path and play really well close to age 40 if he wants to but I just think the health track record  suggests that it might go the other way and in 2024  yeah I think I think that's that's completely fair and I think people will start feeling that way about Curry you know people are gonna be freaked out by him beat next year  yeah I think  you know I think a lot like last year or this year I should say draft season if you can you know somebody's I forget what they call it but you can pick the draft slot that you want nfts like that yeah Kentucky Derby yeah yeah I think this is I think next year is going to be another year where it's like I want to pick at the top five or I want to be on the turn I don't want to deal with pics like six through 11 it's just I feel like I'm always gonna make the wrong choice you know if I pick at 12 and Curry Falls to me oh my God I got Curry at the turn same with Kevin Durant I don't feel bad about Kevin picking Camp Kevin Durant at 12 do I want to pick him up at 7 not really so that's I feel like that's the way fantasy basketball at least within the past year two is starting to trend  yeah I like that call a lot and yeah if you're if you're in a league like the NFC where you could pick your your draft slot that presents another interesting strategy piece all right a couple more messages that will you know read here and then be on our way out nice things at the chat we got acknowledged these Matt says thank you guys have been a big help all season win or lose it's much appreciated appreciate you saying that map we love doing this love helping you guys out hope it's been valuable Christopher says Hey guys great listening to you all year shows been here every week Playoff starts I lost Barnes and Booker and he also adds that he lost Sharon Jackson Who by the way looks like he's gonna miss his third straight game so that one we've seen this coming Alex this may be the beginning of the shutdown there's a reason that I flipped him last week for for Shane and but yeah Christopher condolences that's that's brutal you know Duluth Scotty Barnes and now Devin Booker the week to Playoff starts  it is what it is man and the Jaron Jackson thing you know that's kind of felt like a slow-motion car crash all year and it's tough because he hasn't even played that badly but it's just the context of the season is just not been what we thought it would be for Memphis last thing here Matt chimes in and says whoever gets one next year gets me  I think I think he's going to be the most popular number one pick I really do like barring some sort of injury between now and then  I get the security of yokich I get the security of Dodge it I mean I wouldn't take Tatum number one but you know he's been he's always you know top seven guy feels like every year never misses time SGA started to feel that way  so what do you think would be the share like let's say you have 100 legs how many does weapon you have a go number one  well I will say before I answer that over the past 30 days when but Yamaha is the number one fan I see player in a cat per game  we go above Dodges yogic I think if 100 leagues draft he goes number one  probably in like  60 to 705 partially because I think people not only is he I think a worthy number one pick in like all League formats but it's super fun to roster also um and I think that matters like we're predicting what other people will do to an extent yes you know we're gonna we always do a bunch of mock draft content you know before the season starts  I I I'm gonna go on record right now the first mock draft that we do when banana will go number one it will happen there's no question Whoever has the number one pick will pick one banana  that is a great point and is exactly what I was going to say which is there's a there's like I want to be the first one I want to be the guy that takes a number one factor whereas you know okay it's like if you said like is there a better percentage chance that you'll get like Returns value at number one I would say yes just because you know when I was so young and you know we're still there's still some injury concern I think with his body but there's also a chance that he like lapse the field in the way yogic was a couple years ago and he's averaging four blocks a game and two and a half steals to go with you know 22 and 13 and five assists I mean it's it's crazy to just dream on what the upside is with women Jama and you know the three-point shootings been better lately as well and like yeah you want to be the guy that takes it you want to be in on the ground floor it's more exciting to roster him than it is yolk at this point so yeah well I think you're right I think 70 to 75% of the league so be the number one pick in depending on how this season finishes you know maybe that's even higher by the time we get to next fall last question here from Daniel he says I have Jaren Jackson too would cat be a good trade for him yes if you can get cat Virginia Jackson do this right now you'll probably have to aim lower would be my answer because I think anybody who's paying attention you know kind of knows the risks here right so that's I was trying to trade him before last week I'm glad I stuck it in before this latest absence because this feels like the start of if it's not a complete shutdown they're gonna be very cautious there's no reason for him to be playing every  game and playing 35 minutes tonight the rest of the way  yeah I agree um yeah trade for cat if that's on the table if you want someone who's better defensively oh that's a good question yeah because you'd be losing Jaron Jackson's you know one and a half blocks and his his 1.1 steals I mean it I don't know if there's a great deal but you could maybe try to get Jared Jackson Jared Allen yeah Jerry like a Jared Allen type you know I don't know what you're you're sort of like interesting like a Brook Lopez's Myles Turner if someone's gonna like you know I mean it feels like you're going to lose if you have JJ Triple J and you trade for Myles Turner but  again it's all League dependent  I think you're gonna have to take what feels like a loss and just hope that you make it up in games played and the guy that you're the guy that you're getting plays 20 out of 22 games the rest of the way and Jerry Jackson plays 11 you know you're gonna win that deal even if you're getting the worst player so I think you're right I mean don't be I would be scared off you don't want to go too low like don't trade him for Daniel Gafford we're not saying that but there's a real realistic I would say at least a 50% brisk that he's like borderline Unstoppable somebody's because the status is either out or completely up in the air all right that'll do it today good questions all around guys appreciate the kind words we've enjoyed doing this with everybody all season well of course keep doing it through the end of the regular season and into the playoffs so we are we are not done yet we have we'll do some concept episodes you know we'll do mock drafts we'll do you know what is the first 25 picks look like next year what kind of mix in more of that look ahead content big picture content going forward but we'll still be doing five episodes a week at least through the end of the regular season so you could catch Dre tomorrow you can catch myself and Brandon Kravitz on Wednesday Dr Ray and Rick Campbell on Thursday and then Alex Kennedy Shannon doing the waiver wire on Friday
