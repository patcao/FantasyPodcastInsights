welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy against Friday January 5th 2024 Alex baruta here with Sharon McEwen and Ken k train Crites  all aboard  let's jump right into the news last night we saw Nicole yokich had a last second 40 foot 3 pointer over Kevon Looney for Denver's 1:30 to 127 win at Golden State the Warriors dropped to 16 and 18 with this loss the Western Conference continues to be tight at the top of the standings you have four teams within three games Minnesota OKC Denver and the red hot LA Clippers Aaron Gordon had a 30.9 rebound Game and his second contest back from being attacked by I think it was his dog actually wonder how he's treating his dog doesn't just say he said it's a good boy I believe it's a guy I believe him too we also had some waiver wire Darlings come off the bench for Golden State Steve Kerr was like ever go with this lineup for the foreseeable future and then he's like you know what just kidding I was doing gamesmanship to scare off Mike model yes total BS move try small as we all know coaches Lyle the time teams lie all the time you're going to be just as right not believing them as you are believing them three Gods play pods  yeah this was  just a weird game overall there's just the Warriors rotation is really frustrating because you go and add all these guys off the waiver wire and it's like oh yeah coming is playing well he's got you know how many points and he ends up playing only 19 minutes it's not like he was small trouble or anything no 16 points for good day it's like if he had played 28 minutes I mean I I don't know if there are any major fantasy takeaways from this game and other than just you know the Warriors rotation continues to be a bit frustrating all the allegedly Draymond Green is going to return to the facility in the upcoming days  so we're gonna see another shake up as soon as I'm on does return I'm assuming you know Chris Paul might go back to the bench maybe they go with a smaller lineup and put Looney back in the bench and keep coming in there it would seem to make sense to try to work being a keep coming up in the starting lineup and play Wiggins last yeah minus minus 14 point differential last night get him out of there but I I don't think we're gonna have I think it's going to be a revolving door with that starting lineup and there'll be switches and tell this team gets on the right track I mean 16 and 18 that's where cures worry is so yeah I don't think he's worried too much about what US fantasy basketball players think about it they're 11 in the west they're outside looking in at the plane  they are yeah Not only was Wiggins a minus 14 last night he's a minus 14 on the season it's it's been horrible for him well hey Alex sort of good news kind of bad news the Bucks sneak by the lowly Spurs last night 125 121 Spurs average given up I'm sorry the Spurs average scoring 1111 points per game but put 121 on the defensively challenged boxes and Wendy had a showdown yamas 44 points 14 rebounds seven dimes and three stocks but Wendy on his 20th birthday  27 points 9 boards one assist five blocks also five turnovers ah the Bucks are giving up almost 120 points per game which ranks 24th in the association Alex and Shannon what Kim Milwaukee do to improve their defense  make a trade trade for Grayson Allen back  some don't need that guy we could use them know it's just the Box you know you lose Drew holiday and Grayson Allen who's a very good defensive back court you replace him with Damian Lillard Malik Beasley who are terrible defensive backcourt not only that Chris Middleton's not healthy on the wing the wing Defence is important and he's always he's been over raided Defender for like five years now um so it's there's only two good Defenders on the start and line up and they both play on the back line do they have draft picks they can deal  I don't really think so as I don't know how much they have in the Treasure Trove to make a trade right no one's looking for Malik Beasley  no off the top of my head I don't think I have anything no not much not much to do you know essentially they're just like every other Contender they're going to be on the market for a 3D perimeter player come to trade deadline good luck Landing that with the assets they have maybe in the buyout Market they'll find someone but they're just gonna have to outscore other teams and really other than Indiana they've been doing that against most teams in the NBA so I don't think the Bucks have much to worry about you do you think they're praying then get PJ Tucker in the buyout know get him back  I don't know I only the problems they need they are defense yeah I don't even other people that's true that's true um Alex you know you're the one that's stuck doing the lineups in the injuries and you deal with this the most at RotoWire can you explain the whole khris Middleton back-to-backs thing and why he's sort of sat sort of did not sit last night in the hole and be a rules were trying to stop the city well you know the team knew that Middleton was a good play the second half no one else knew we didn't know see I don't know if the sports actually they were traditionally not playing Middleton in back-to-backs yes and somebody must have told Milwaukee from the head office hey we think he's ready to play or what was going on there well he had been playing 30 minutes I mean he had before that he had played 30 minutes and what is this Seventh Street get six straight games so the Bucks were ramping him up but yeah this was apparently a scheduled second half rest day which only they knew internally and did not report to anybody so I really frustrated I will say they did Adrian Griffin did announce before the game that Chris Middleton and this may be an hour before the game at khris Middleton was going to have his minutes monitored during okay Thursday night's contest what that means obviously you know you have to still the cipher but it did immediately I went and said okay well I'm taking him out of my DFS lineup  so that that is something to watch you know keep an eye out for those type of updates and if it's with the guy like Chris Middleton  yeah I think you have to proceed with caution if you're playing in a daily League or DFS format so it's it feels like they're doing something sneaky to not get fined by the head office and it's weird but that's good advice Joan Alex tell us about news in Chicago  yeah we have Zach Levine is questionable to return tonight for the Bulls we only thought maybe we had seen the last of lovin in a Bulls uniform  but they're gonna bring him back I see it seemingly soon and I don't know if it's just to prove that he's healthy so they can move him but um you know from a fantasy standpoint  you might have a few rough get not rough games but Kobe White's usage Michael down a bit here but I would still hold on you know assuming Levine's getting traded you know what they they're bringing him back  because nobody wants them nobody's like true oh yeah I'd love to pay him 46 million for each of the next three seasons the play terrible defense and pout when he doesn't get to shoot a thousand times a game yeah please give me that on her  yeah he's a he's a hard player to trade for because we know he can't be your number one option he making order money if you're if he's your number two option you're number one probably has to be like borderline MVP so if you're trading for him you have to be a team that's decent right now but that needs a third option and it it's like was that two teams I don't even know like the Kings it's just you know I don't know it's he's a really hard guy to trade  we also have Kevin Durant still questionable  for tonight he's missed two games I would be surprised if he came back tonight no reason to like Rush him back or anything Phoenix is 18 and 16 they're 9th in the West  you know they've been completely on able to get healthy I did look up what their numbers are with Bradley Beal Durant and Booker on the floor together it's like a hundred and twenty under 150 possessions or something like that they're plus 25 per 100 like they're just destroying teams and they're all in the court together but they've played the equivalent of like one and a half full games um so is this lineup ever healthy though you know like I don't know if it feels ever gonna play a 50 Game season Durant's 87 years old or something you know I Shannon what's your optimism or pessimism for this time I mean I do think there were nearing good news for them right like Durant should be returning he's questionable for tonight I think that they're best served keep them out until he's truly a 100% but on the bill side it's actually been pretty encouraging since this five game he sat for five games he's been back for four now and and upon his return they had mentioned again a kind of watch as many as close as and ramped them up accordingly but not just let him go out there and immediately play a full load a minutes but he actually he's already there I mean he played 30 304 413 game on Wednesday well they I mean maybe they did the first game but if they're confident or comfortable enough playing him 41 minutes on Wednesday that's a good indication indic  he's right now he's been north of 30 minutes since it came back at a whopping 41 yeah third  so his inevitable breakdown will come yeah depending on depending on what book you look at in for futures championship odds the suns are still fourth  and in title odds right now behind the Celtics nuggets and bucks and above the 76ers Clippers Lakers wolves Thunder Mavericks heat is how that goes Nick and I have been talking about the Thunder's title odds Before Christmas they were like 45 to one and now they're down to 23 to 1 so people are definitely starting to have some more belief in the Thunder  beat the deals in the Celtics and that's going to get you some attention  it will yeah um okay before we get to Fan feedback let's talk about Underdog fantasy the number one platform for NBA

bonus Choo-Choo can yeah sorry  that's code r w n b a and or just choo choo anyway trying to line up our questions here that's my yeah I got one from presumably a Nick fan  do you guys think McBride is worth a grab and holders he just a streamer miles McBride 23 year old guard did sign a three-year extension with the Knicks  I mean I kind of liked what I saw from McBride last year he's like a steals this guy mostly steals in threes but the fact that he played 18 minutes in that game where and he hadn't played yet and Barrett and quickly were gone and he played seven minutes and 10 minutes  I just I can't I can't hold him it's just  I I again I like them if you're in a really deep Dynasty league and you have like a g League spot or developmental spot yeah throw them in there whatever but I couldn't do it in a redraft league yeah same it's got to be an extremely deep leak because at best what is he the fifth guard on this team right now it certainly encouraging that they view him as a possible long-term asset and that's why they the next signed them to the extension but until I see McBride actually go out there and play 20 plus minutes or produce at a level that's appropriate to Warrant a pickup in in whatever size fantasy you're in then I think he's just just you know keep them on the way for wire and watch and pick them up when the time's right  all right next question is about pickups and maybe too long you know it fits their nice nicely  I wants to know Richards all in it but Patsy Nance Jr on his waiver wire he got any preferences for those four I know we were talking pre-show about Mark Williams or turning for the Hornets  yeah I mean I would say all those guys are fare ads I'm looking at your drop candidates I out of those guys I would probably go with Jackson Davis or or Easton as a drop I'm so I love him so much it'd be hard for me to drop him I don't know she can do you have a preference on either the pickups or the drops yeah I mean right now obviously Drummond will be a drop as soon as much returns in most it'd be tonight by the way it could be tonight um I I'm actually gonna go with a Linux as my favorite of those four Richards has had a couple of good games but he hasn't been consistent enough and also I know Williams has already ruled out for Friday and he's had that doubtful take for so long but it does already I believe so unless yep yep out for Friday so that that's actually for the year  Charlotte Force Charlotte and Utah both have four games next week we'll get a little more in Larry Nance in the pickups we will but I think I'm going with the clinic and I would drop basically I would wait until I have I would hold on to Drummond for as long as possible and then as soon as we know which is returning dropped drum for a one  for what it's worth Carter wimble Carter still having issues in Orlando it Alex didn't you and I tried a few slacks about but tatse going back up the depth chart  yeah we need to push the tape back up because I don't know if Wendell Carter's gonna start again this season he just hasn't he hasn't been playing that well and he's been coming off the bench of past three games and they played so well without him there I just you know I mean he did play so well with him as a starter why would you upset that Mojo for such a mediocre player in Carter and like look I mean moving them up the RotoWire depth chart is one thing but the more the more the more relevant question that we get about Carter is like should I pick him up you know um and I don't think so because his ceiling his absolute ceiling is like top 80 but that's if he plays three that's  no he doesn't and that's if he plays 33 minutes a game and he stays healthy would she has never done so you can't I to me he's not even worth picking up unless you're maybe a 14 team lead well on the way they keep waffling and he's back he's not back makes me think that knee is messy right  yeah all right well hopefully I won't butcher anymore the ad reads dealing with the  feedback so you know I love the fans Alex I'm here for the fans and the sponsors that's a tough choice to make but let's get back to the notes I believe it is now time for the money segment of the Pod the waiver wire take it away Alex the waiver wire if you are new joining us here or just like hearing me say this every week how we do this is we have two regular picks and one long shot regular picks must be roster and 50% or fewer fantasy leagues usually Yahoo and then one long shot roster in about 25% or fewer of Yahoo leagues warning Brooklyn and Cleveland only have one game next week Philly with two games so if you're if you have some guys in your roster that you've been streaming from those teams or you're thinking about picking someone up be careful if it's from the theater of those squads I'm gonna click things off Donte divincenzo of the New York Knicks he was our waiver wire cover guy on our YouTube video two weeks ago but the situation has changed after RJ Barrett and Emmanuel quickly were traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for ogn nobody was opened up some time he had a career high divincenzo did 38 points after the Barrett quickly trade but before OG got there followed that up with two performances where he totaled 26 points nine rebounds seven assists two steals in a block in 51 minutes we'll get looks like from what we've seen the past couple games with this tips rotation is that Steven shenzo probably gonna see about five more six more minutes than he was before but that also comes with a bit higher usage playing a little bit more backup guard he's going to handle some more than he was before because quickly he's not there  this might be more of a 14 team add I understand in 12 team members you know it's it's kind of borderline but he actually ranks 49th and permanent eight cat production this year he's playing really well Fantasy Point per minute so if you're gonna if you're in a points league and you're a 12 team points League it's a it's a fine add New York only has three games next week so he doesn't make for a great streamer but he's more of a long-term I would say longer term 14 Team league option  can take us to our cover guy and I know maybe you know I gotta get the cover guys in early maybe I should a little too much enthusiasm here maybe he should be my dull pick or my long shot of the week but perennial waiver wire at Larry Nance of your New Orleans Pelicans these rostered in 22 percent of Yahoo leaks he's back after a rib injury he does qualify as a forward and Center on both Yahoo Andy ESPN as Alex loves to point out Nance plays better with Zion then you'll notice Allen shoes and we're seeing this as Nance eats in the jv's playing time Pelicans only have three games next week so maybe not ideal to stream this week versus next week but if you need center help I've got one League where I'm desperately looking for a backup center Larry Nance is back and always a solid option good suggestion can my first waiver wire pickup of the week is a guy we've talked about already the season Aaron Nesmith Swingman for the Indiana Pacers 32% rostered on Yahoo you know like I said we've mentioned them before but he continues to play better as roles changed some so I think he warrants consideration again he has started the last five games for the Pacers he's been a top 50 player over the past week with averages a 12.5 points 3.3 3-pointers two Steals and one block in 28 minutes per game Indiana has four games next week nice Smith is never going to you know it's highly unlikely he's gonna go out there and averaged 18 20 points per game but he doesn't enough of the little stuff has some steals some threes mixed in where it's going to provide solid overall value you know the Shane Battier special I always like to call that and I think we're going to see that from him for the remainder of the season as long as he stays in the in the pace of starting lineup you know even before he's promoted to the starter he was finishing a lot of games for the Pacers so it's obvious that Rick Carlisle likes niece Smith and Will Be A Part an important part of the rotation moving forward he is hands down their highest energy guy his minutes are always going to be there whether it's bench or starter because he's their biggest Hustler on defense and the boards which is weird he was kind of drafted to be that three in three Indie Sharpshooter but really he's turned into a high energy guy  it's it's been impressive it's weird that he is a starting power forward in the NBA preseason we were talking about topping we're talking about Walker and expecting one of those guys to break out but no it's nice Smith for the Pacers well and really Jalen Smith's playing power forward and they finally moved Smith to small for you correct now yes that is the case but but nice with does log a lot of minutes at the four Alex tell us about another perennial waiver wire person out in Utah  well it's it's former Celtic former piston Kelly Olynyk Moroccan yeah former rocket former I think that's it oh no Miami oh yeah yeah  they give them the big contract after four former piston I said that yeah yeah um he and Larry Nance could be the same person actually yeah if you dance Kelly Olynyk  if you put them together they make one really good starter Utah plays four times next week so that's that's kind of what's driving a lot of this he's a great Olin is a great streaming option we could say this about Nancy's as well past 14 games for only extended stretch here 9 points five rebounds six assists and a steal  for 27 fantasy points in 23 minutes the minutes fluctuate a lot but you got a four game week so you're kind of insulated from some variants there still one of the best fantasy players in the NBA they can't they can't quit him just like we can't quit him so go ahead and go ahead and stream them in on your 12 teams you know what this really indicates is just how bad John Collins has been playing for the Jazz I really wanted to replace a Linux with John Collins and they were there like no can't do it  yeah it's tough all right Ken who is your who is your second waiver wire pickup another perennial waiver wire person both Shannon and I had them listed Shannon politely deferred to me Kelly oubre of your Philadelphia 76ers only 45% roster on Yahoo this is a longer term Play Because Philly has only two games so do not do this for streaming for next week but Uber is back as a starter has started the last seven games after that car accident that led to a rib injury last five games 14 points four rebounds over two and a half threes two point two stocks while shooting a nice 47% it made sense that he was slow coming back from that rib injury but I think he's finally back you know everybody picked him up 12 game 10 games into the season before that car accident and he's working his way back to maybe passing to buy his Harris is the number three scoring option  on this Sixers team  and anyway that's a long-term move though Kelly oubre don't play him next week I love her Bray as a pickup Ken as you mentioned we both were going to highlight them this week I do I do wonder if he's gonna stake in the starting lineup once the Sixers are healthy because over these seven games and bead missing time Melton Miss some time but the two Miss time you know so I I'm curious if they're gonna keep him moving to a six-man role long term which wouldn't necessarily hurt his overall production or keep them in the starting lineup so that that is one aspect to monitor  if they move them to six man he's gonna be the Vinny Johnson points Off the Bench guys I'm not sure it affects us  his stats that much because they're not particularly deep Kelly I should notice that I also had me Smith so I supported the air in the Smith pick as well as yet Kelly the air fryer Uber all right uh my second pickup is a guy who is just over the 50% Mark but I I think his roles about to change a little bit Jalen Suggs guard for the Orlando Magic 54% rostered on Yahoo or Lando's dealing with some injuries fronds Wagner just left a game because of an angle ankle injury on Wednesday night he's been ruled out for Friday already it's kind of to be determined how long he will sit it's an ankle sprain you know depending on severity of that ankle sprain it could be a week it could be you know a handful week so we just don't know yet how long he's gonna sit and if Wagner sits you know I think we're gonna see  Wagner so I said ooh like I supported like yes oh okay oh I thought we were going back to ubre okay it's Franz if fraud sits I just I like sucks to see an increase in his usage we saw that in the game that that we've early a big all around game from Suggs on January 3rd he had 41 fantasy points played 39 minutes which I believe is a career high 24 points 3 rebounds four assists two steals two blocks and six three-pointers six for 12 from downtown you know it's been rare where sucks would get 18 field goal attempts but that's how many he's seen he saw on Wednesday and I you know if if franczoz Out Franz is Ben the teams number two option behind Bank hero so if they if they need more scoring you've already got folds out for Friday for instance so yeah Wagner out on Friday full South out on Friday Gary Harris out on Friday this shouldn't need more scoring oh yeah oh how could I forget Joe Ingles out on Friday yeah this team's gonna need more scoring and I expect sucks to really step up so if you're looking for a short term streaming option if you're in a shallow League I think Suggs a guy to pick up but he should be rostered in more he should be rostered more than 50% 54% of leaks by now when they were running a lot of the offense through Wagner almost in the Grand Hill point forward capacity with folks out which is been what now three four weeks I don't see things like it's been forever so they'll need yes yeah so just gonna hold the ball a ton he's getting balls going to go through his hands on  my Longshot pick  can or Ken's Shannon's Alec Burks another way for why you're stable she said shaking his head you know Burks come on and I'm not gonna clean that one just 9% roster in Yahoo questionable for tonight so that's just a quick heads up if you're trying to stream them into night beware of that but the past five games for Berks he's averaging 18 2.1 18.2 points 3.43 2.6 boards 1.0 assists in 26 minutes he's had let's say varying fantasy relevance throughout this season but when he's hot uh when Monty Williams is playing him you gotta Adam and 16 team leaks for sure shallower kind of borderline because it should be more than 9% while he's hot  yeah I'll hit that game Tire like they lost an overtime who was that against I forget Utah it was against Utah he had a big game against Utah and he played really well he has backpack really good games I'm not a big fan of the Pistons bench unit but it's hard to argue with Burks as a streaming option in deeply says definitely the case I have three pointers yeah that's true that's true three-pointers I have a similar super deep League long shot but at least he's a starter demonic Kamara of your Portland Trail Blazers only rostered in 3 percentiles but Portland has four games tomorrow the second next week sorry four games next week the second round rookie has started for the Trailblazers since mid-november and last 10 games he's had boring but steady production of 8 points over five rebounds 1.6 stocks one three-pointer while shooting a nice 49% from the field again this is our long shot for deep leagues 16 team leagues the minutes are there you need minutes to be productive in the Trailblazers have four games if you're in a deeply need to stream somebody because you got Brooklyn or Cleveland on your roster to Monica tomorrow I can get you by the next week  you know his it's funny because it's best MBA comp might be on his team will I was just yeah exactly so yeah he's kind of he's kind of minutes  probably not as a high of a sealing on the defense and I will but better shooter a better shooter a lot cheaper for the Trailblazers Camaro but there you go who's your long shot Shannon yeah our final suggestion for the weeks Simone fontecchio starting small forward for the Utah Jazz he's he pressed me I watched him play against the Pistons I've seen him play a handful of times this year but he was he was brilliant against Detroit on Wednesday night he's looked really good so it's returning to the starting lineup three games go over that three games he is averaging 17 points 6.7 rebounds 2.7 assists two Steals and two point three three-pointers 41% downtown 55 from the floor you know as long as if he sticks in the starting lineup I think he's worth a look in most 12 team leaders 12 team leads definitely 14 team leads I'm surprised that the Jazz went back to him but I also was never a big believer of marketing and being a small forward I think he's a better fit at the four so if I take you was  available and you're in a 1214 Team league he is worth a special if you need 3-pointers and probably probably a good hold for as long as he stays in the starting lineup yet another human embodiment of the failure that is John Collins in Utah but yeah he had he's had some huge games they were dinged up a little bit but  they're healthy now I mean they're healthy now and he's playing 30 over 30 minutes per game over that three-game stretch maybe part of their good tanking strategy we'll see but yeah they keep playing them  all right gentlemen it is time for your Friday night DFS advice on a very busy slate and I'll try to answer a few questions Live Well you guys give your awesome DFS advice  there are 14 games today which makes my job at anybody else's job who works at the company and works on MBA content a living nightmare but if you play DFS in a  in a throne like Shannon does this is a really fun night highest over under of the night at Atlanta at Indiana 262 over under we saw this go for what was it over 300 last time these two teams play against each other absolutely ridiculous as always in terms of injuries too many guys out to just sit here and listen nobody wants to listen to that so check the RotoWire daily lineups page check the RotoWire injuries page  read the analysis at cetera  Shannon on this slate where is the first place that you are turning  well it's it's going to be that Atlanta Indiana game basically any any players you can get in your lineup from that contest probably makes sense you know the the Pacers have a lot of guys who have high ceilings coming off the bench like but he healed bathroom there Isaiah Jackson even you know our Optimizer like Isaiah Jackson tonight even though he's going to probably play less than 20 minutes because of that high over under its and absolutely Monster game from a DFS standpoint my favorite play from that game is Jalen Johnson 6900 on DraftKings you know we've talked about Johnson a lot pre-season during the season he is been fantastic since returning from injury over the past three games he has 42 48 and 49 fantasy points it's tough for me to avoid him at in a cushy matchup against the PAC who are horrible against opposing forwards  I looked this up the other day I don't remember the exact stats on it but obviously the Pacers are one of the worst transition teams in the NBA and Jalen Johnson score something like 30 35% of his points in transition so it should be a massive opportunity for him to play so I definitely like that call other guys you can get in that game are good the Pacers just they don't have any backward Defenders either hard for me to really say like don't play Trey off don't play Deontay Murray it's just like  it's it's hard to it's hard to ignore at some point aside from those guys I think you know Nick Richards is going to continue to be a good value it's a little up and down but he's he had like one bad game against Phoenix going up against nerkach that happens nurkic is actually pretty good at stopping opposing Congress from from getting rebounds but he's got a decent floor of about 26 to 30 fantasy points going up against Chicago who are mayor may not be without Nicola Beach um any other any other spots for you Shannon yeah Richard certainly a good solid play he remains under 6000 dollars so in that range he's usually you know a good option and that matchup against Chicago is nice one one Center that I do like more than Richard who is in that same price range is our boy Isaiah hartenstein 6000 for the New York Knicks he is he's starting he's been playing better since the trade past two games 39 minutes 37 minutes 34 and 47 fantasy points and those two outings you know I think two weeks or actually this wasn't on podcast but we talked about it I thought maybe precious to a would eat in to heart and science minutes that hasn't happened yet heart signs only playing more minutes and for as long as that happens I'm Gonna Roll with heart and Stein as long as the discount on DraftKings like he is tonight a couple other discount guys  that I like Cody Martin Charlotte Bobcat why do I always say Bobcats Hornets know they're the bottle yes they'll always be the Bobcats in my heart but Cody Cody Martin certainly 33 minutes can Sacramento on Tuesday night only 17 fantasy points but I love the fact that he's playing 33 minutes this Charlotte team still shorthanded Gordon hayward's out and I think Cody Martin is actually the guy who is the better fit you know you got Bruce McGowan and some other options they've been streaming in and out of their starting lineup but I won't be surprised if Martin even gets the starting out in the near future  yeah I mean Martin he wrote I wrote him up at an article I did about you know risers and fallers over the holiday you know a week and a half and he was in there because it's like well you know he's been a decent guy for like 14 team fantasy league for a while so I like that call we also have this Washington Cleveland game with a 240 over under I think who is a solid option in this game he's going to be guarded by Dean Wade most likely which should lead to some buckets Ken Jazz vs Celtics  what do you what do you Clinic I have been answered frantically answering questions in the message I know I see that yeah so you know I think the fear was just who would Boston bench who are they going to rest even if they say everyone's healthy they have had a healthy injury report the last few games  Al Horford is going to take a snooze I would just be worried that blowout  and we see a lot of Osha sets and Lamar Stevens and Luke Cornett so my fear would just at home to now the you know maybe Boston takes this game for granted but the the fear of a blowout and low minutes for the starters would worry  yeah I mean this 14-point favorites Boston are against Utah so blah potential is there no it's been playing really well I guess I'd lean a little though boy the guard self so awesome so awesome maybe not we have we have the Pistons on the Slate Shannon going up against the Warriors who played a really hard fought game yesterday second night of a back-to-back for that what have you seen out of Detroit lately aside from Alec Burks turning things up so the actually what we have on DraftKings was just a unique thing that they've been doing lately they've they've divvied up their main slate to not include the final two to three games when it special when it's big slate like this so the weight games are actually a separate slate and not a part of the main slate on DraftKings for tonight but I'm not no I it's it's a unique it's a unique twist I kind of like it I think it certainly helps players who aren't the Sharks if you're not you know if you Max entry lineup folks probably would prefer the the full all games be on the Slate but I think this is the benefit for people who like to just kind of play more casually it's tough I think the Golden State side we'll have to see because I won't be surprised if they rest a couple players for Detroit I mean cunning Cape County have spent carrying this team going to have to continue to do so I had a big 58 Point fantasy outing against Utah he had he had one dud against the Rockets where he only had 20 fantasy points but everything else over the past couple weeks 50 60 points at 8,600 Cades still a quality option there I I'm not I'm not confident enough in Berks to go that route 4800 you know he essentially needs to be hot from three when he comes off the bench and have a player like Jade and Ivy not be playing well to be guaranteed to play 25 minutes or more so he's a bit riskier and then same thing with like Isaiah Oliver's could maybe be an option for that late slate if you're looking for a cheap option 4100 he started the game against Utah on played 36 minutes Monty Williams up to his old tricks there it's tough I I do like I do like more players on the Golden State side but I would want to see who they're actually starting so you know does does Looney play and start again or do they go back to Jackson Davis is comingo still on the starting lineup or maybe they rest Wiggins maybe the rest stops and it's all going to change pods would be an option of course as well if the resting some of their veterans but going back to the main slate on DraftKings tonight there are you know we talked about Dante defense Enzo earlier he's solid option 5300 on DraftKings Alex mentioned that big night that he had 61 fantasy points when he scored 38 points he's got that kind of upside which is rare for someone priced at 53 and then my one of my favorite picks for this slate is Karl Anthony towns I hate the matchup he's going against the Rockets but here's listed at 7200 really low on DraftKings I it feels like a mistake I mean just two weeks ago he was 9,000 he was 7,800 in the most recent game usually in the 8000 to Mid 8,000 range yeah he's had I wouldn't even say he's had too many stages he had he had a couple games in late December where he didn't top 30 fantasy points but 41 fans he was hurting you yeah yeah exactly he was he wasn't at full strength so 41 and 32 fantasy points past two games you know still taking a ton of shots 18 field goal attempts 19 field goal Temps  7200 for a player who's averaging essentially 40 fantasy points for game is unheard of and even though I don't like the matchup I have I will be hard-pressed to not have him in my final lineup  I think I think that can probably wrap things up for the DFS segment which me and now it is time for Ken's old man rant  on Wednesday the Indiana Pacers debuted New Jersey patches with QR codes on the add shoulder what can't people just watch the damn game does this mean I can't get a real menu at their Stadium hand me a printed menu damn it I'm against anything that has people on their phones more cell phones are evil no one interacts human to human anymore I have no idea how young people get laid  can I can I get a person old there's not for that Ken yeah can I get a potential old man rant I need your I need you take on this cat the Orlando Magic retiring Shaquille O'Neal's number  how many I look more up his career stats I mean he did get them to a final  he is not to do a final know he did what he bailed for La I mean he played five years there it's a PR stunt right the guy's been on TV now for 20 years after his retirement Orlando needs some good news with the last 20 years I say sure why not at worst he's the third most important player to ever put on a magic Jersey I would argue he's the most important the only other options are Dwight Howard and Tracy McGrady  that's it you don't have anyone else that that falls into it I think Shaq's what put them on the map and I think he deserves it I think he deserves it okay okay I'm looking at the magic all-time top 12 players in terms of win shares right now Dwight Howard number one Nick Anderson number two vouch number three Shack number four followed by T-Mac and checks for with only playing Five Seasons that's insane they were tired Dwight Howard's number over there I rather have Shack than Dwight Howard I don't think he's technically retired he's technically active right I mean he's destroying the time when in a different country now very into the topic that cannot be discussed on  thank you I didn't know how I wanted to maybe spark a second old man rant rare  thank you everybody for joining us on the road to wire fantasy basketball podcast it is presented by Underdog fantasy Ken take us out of here let's go back to San Antonio do you hear Bucs coach Adrian Griffin gosh about when being honest after last night's matchup  Griffin said quote that was a fun game that was a fun game to coach a fun game to watch two of the most unique talented big men I use that big man term loosely because they are very versatile players man that was fun I thought Wendy was great I thought Yana's was phenomenal I'm not sure Griffin so happy if they blow that game but cute to hear coach act like a fan was nice and anyway attention passengers this three car fantasy Trainwreck has hit the end of the line
