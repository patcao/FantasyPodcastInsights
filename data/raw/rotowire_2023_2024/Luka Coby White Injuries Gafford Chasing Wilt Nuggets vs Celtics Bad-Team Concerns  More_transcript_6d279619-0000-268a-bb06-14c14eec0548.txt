hey everybody Welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast sponsored by smart bracket.io it's that time of year to get your brackets ready so we're going to talk about that in a little bit it's Thursday March 14th I'm doc he's Rick we got a lot to talk about let's Dive Right In after this quick Jam so good to have you all with us here on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast we are the ogs Rick Hamlin and fswa Hall of Famer Steve Alexander acha Dr a um and so there's so much to talk about here we are a week away or two weeks away from the fantasy basketball playoffs this is Chip time okay this is where we really got a lock in you know those of us we've been locked in all year but you gotta you gotta pick it up a notch on the Waiver Wires going to be even more important now than it is it's silly season is document has been saying here for a few weeks so doc let's start with a big game last night the best game of the night last night it was Chicago's overtime victory over the Indiana Pacers and DeMar DeRozan had 46 points in this game he's a stud future hall of fame or maybe we Circle back to that maybe we do not I mean you all know what's up with tomorrow Rosen you dropped him you play him you enjoy but doc it looks like we lost Kobe white last night for a minute and I hope that that's speculation is not accurate and so okay cool it's not a knee but it is a hip and and so is it a hip flexor is it a strain did it slightly come out of the socket a little bit because he was he had to run out late in the game passcode this is late and regulation Pascal siakam did the Anthony Edwards thing where he completely sold out and went Ray Lewis ah and just flew in for the member Ant-Man on Nesmith in the Minnesota win over Indiana siakam did that Toby last night and crushed him landed on him all the way and Kobe was kind of in like a splits fashion with all of the weight coming down on his right hip and kind of knee and leg area here so doc um you know I there's not a lot of options here outside of like a crucial outside I would assume but how are you processing what happened with Kobe white last night well I'm not processing it very well as you know I need Kobe white in my 30 team playoff matchup oh yeah every guy we bring up you have in 30  I'm winning right now but I need Kobe white man and Sumo had a good game Caruso is is probably the pickup I I don't know Kobe White it was horrible on Monday in game one for the week he wasn't great last night but he at least played and now now he's hurt so now I don't know how much he's gonna play the rest of the week so um  hey we're gonna we're gonna know more this afternoon right  so  you're muted bro we should know more about Kobe white this afternoon but maybe not I don't think the Bulls are on the schedule here tonight I'm kind of in last night mode a little bit here and they do play tonight then we'll know  yeah the Clippers at bowls at 8  James Harden shoulder questionable quality Leonard back questionable for that game um so doc Alex Caruso last night popped for 23 points five threes seven rebounds and seven assists he is rostered by me in the cam Dynasty because of the stocks he's it right around three stocks a game when you add up  his steals when you out of his Blocks he's probably the best shop blocking guard in the NBA and I say that knowing the Derek white is an awesome shop blocker as well sga's a pretty good shop blocker Caruso might be the best guard shot blocker clearly one of the best perimeter defenders in the game so doc I've been rostering Alex Caruso while he has been giving me nine points three rebounds three assists three stocks 1.7 threes and shooting like 4849.50 percent he does not take bad shots okay now I think we are going to get a bonanza from Alex Caruso because the cupboard has been stripped their Pat Williams is out they got all the other guys heard man um it's gonna be and if Kobe white is out it's kind of sort of going to be DeRozan boots and Caruso with some ice but if I owe or Caruso were out there doc who would you recommend to pick up between those two guys  well first of all Crusoe is 27% rostered in ESPN league so he's available and almost 75% of ESPN league so he sitting out there I think it's Pride that's probably a lower number than the Sumo so you got a better chance to get in crew so at this point I want either one of them if if the Sumo or Caruso's available in my league I'm picking either one of them up I think my priority is the sumo  just because he's last year he his numbers pop a little more but it depends on what you're looking for too if you're looking for Steals and blocks and you're looking for that defense then crew might be the guy but it's pretty close to the way the other thing about Kobe white is Kobe white is in the hunt for uh most improved player  and he's gonna he's also kind of a dog I kind of feel like this is not a guy that's just gonna take a game off of his hip hurts a little bit like he's gonna have to be injured to miss time right now so I I don't I'm hoping this maybe just  me being hopeful because on my team but I'm hoping this is just maybe one game thing for Kobe but either way I'm probably I'm looking at Caruso or to Sumo whichever one is available in my league  well you know me I Dre I am all about the fantasy gold I'm all about the steals the blocks and the threes and I believe is going to be better in those areas then I will I'm more look man I hope that Kobe I don't think he's gonna play tonight I think that's pretty safe they're going to run tests on him they were saying and we got to hope for the best year with Kobe wife but guys run don't walk to get Alex Russo and or I owe to Sumo on your team um doc you have Alpine I'm not sure if you're aware of this but you have helping on your roster in the cam Dynasty and so I hope you all understand that the sarcasm going on there  or anything like that he's got a severe ankle sprain he's got a knee bruise you know and all that kind of stuff so there's probably going to be out for the year um jock landale I want to talk with you about Jack Landau and congratulate you on helping out blowing out his ACL but Jacqueline Dale in the first game after Alfie went out did not start they started Jabari Smith they brought I'm in Thompson into the starting lineup and I did what who don't get is doing landale still played starters minutes 26 he won 11 points four rebounds five assists one block two Steals and one three and doc I think it's important to note that he was with the finishing group for the Houston Rockets in this basketball game what are you doing with landale here  well it's interesting I wrote a column for RotoWire today it's a male bag column and I said on Twitter something like you know hopefully Jacqueline Lando can stay relevant in Houston and a guy with Twitter handle kemosabe 73 came back at me and said why are you worried about landale there's nobody else to play Center in Houston and he should be fine for the rest of year right and my point is I'm all for picking up landale rolling with him until we see what happens but the Rockets can easily play a small lineup and not really mess with landale if they don't want to there's also a lot of kind of semi hot Sinners out there on Waiver Wires right now that Derek Lively and and Daniel Gafford actually gonna play together in Dallas so I don't know that landale is a must-have guy um you also the fact of Rockets played three games next week or there yeah the three games next week they're in three game week this week  so  I think if if I'm sitting out there and I need a center I'm picking up landale I'm rolling him out there I'm seeing what's happening but I'm not like locked in to him and I'm not going to be totally bummed if I don't get him and I don't know that he's a seasoned Championship Game Changer and fantasy I agree with all of that um I've got them in the cam Dynasty and he is on the cut line right like if he comes back in the next game and he maybe it's foul trouble maybe you don't get to see something and landale plays 18 minutes and he has seven points and five rebounds and two assists with no then I'm going to cut them okay but right now he's on my roster and we're gonna see how that goes so who would you rather have doc right now I'm not even gonna ask you about Daniel Gafford I think we'd all rather have Daniel Gafford as we transition here into these Dallas centers Daniel Gafford guys was five of five from the field again last night and he has made 303 consecutive field goals 33 in a row Will Chamberlain is in heaven going damn dude that's impressive Gafford last night 10 points six rebounds seven blocks two steals nine stocks guys in 26 minutes Lively was bouncy 12.8 rebounds two blocks in 20 minutes so doc let's add that up 22 points 14 rebounds uh nine blocks two Steals and 46 combined minutes and Knicks fans thought they had something with Robin Stein right I mean what do we call it uh live forward Gaffey I don't know like let's merge their names here because look Doc in reality I believe that these two guys make the Dallas Mavericks very dangerous in the playoffs because we know Luka we know Kyrie these guys are badasses but they love passing to for lively who are tremendous finishers around the rim so who would you rather have right now landale or Lively on your team  well  I have  Lively  I do not have landale I picked up Lively in two different leaks but like I said Houston plays three games in the current week we're in they have what one or two left prior to and then they play three games next week Dallas only plays two times next week so I've got Lively mmm in round one of the playoffs only playing two games but I built that roster around guys who play four games next week so I figure I could get away with that one but it's it's kind of a toss-up I like the way Lively's playing right now Luka is throwing lives to that dude every chance he gets even when Lively misses or doesn't catch the ball he had an opportunity to throw it down you watched the game last night with Dallas we're Lucas  already got hurt at the end calls him a triple double  but Lively afford both look great right now and I think Luke is finally figured out that he's got these tools he needs to use them and they look a lot better than they did a couple weeks ago but I'd still rather have lively than landale personally um so Luca to Lively is the top lob combination in the entire NBA Luka did leave last night with the sore left hamstring um and he did not return Jason Kidd said afterward he was unsure if not she would travel with the team for Thursday's game to Oklahoma City Dodgers has a missed a game since January 31st and so you know he might miss a game or two I don't know guys he's got a hamstring injury uh you know Dallas needs to play their guys so there is urgency and hunger here with them you know trying to get up above the top six line in the Western Conference I'm not I'm not sniffing like long-term here I am not cover your ears I am kind of sniffing long term here with Kobe white but I'm not getting those vibrations here with Luca so that's all we know right now on Luca  I will tell you what the line the opening line when I was looking at it last night on the maps game tonight is ridiculous the points spread Oh Come assist cities favored by I think like nine and a half or something that tells me right there Luke 8 playing tonight ah they that's a good reading of the points spread right there docs that's exactly what's happening here it's the second of a back-to-back Andy's coming off of an injury he ain't playing tonight it's probably a dub for OKC um all right it's the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Rick kamla and fswa Hall of Famer duck Dr a Steve Alexander here let's talk Corey kispert doc um court case for the wing for the Washington Wizards is a thing and if he is on waivers in your league you need to look strongly into picking this man up I got some stats for you on Quarry for I have some basic stats and then I've got some cam stats for you over the last month and anybody can look this up 15 points 3 rebounds three assists okay you had me at the 15th he's not a big you know block steel guy two point eight threes guys over the last month Pittsburgh is at 15 points basically three threes that does not belong on waivers that belongs on a team 48% field  goal percentage doc here's the thing if like Tim Hardaway Jr his smacked into some kind of a wall and he sucks now and he's playing 17 18 games used to be the front runner for six man of the year and what's happening here is just weird okay so if you still have Tim Hardaway Jr waiting on him to bounce back and kiss for his own waivers go get into some kiss for he's giving you the Tim Hardaway Jr stuff but he's actually doing it and he's not a myth who's lost his game here mid-season here's the cam stat doctor I went back and looked at Corey kispert game log for the entire season  he has played 30 minutes nine times  30 plus minutes nine times in eight of those games he's been a rock star and I'm talking about 20 plus points five six threes maybe five rebounds maybe five assists like when he plays 30 plus the counting numbers start to come into play a little bit and in the threes are like Mega okay and so right now you don't have Bagley you don't have homes uh you know cool about his in the starting lineup so when Holmes gets healthy I don't know he may go back in the starting lineup for may go back to the bench just for me go back to being a 27 minute guy not a 30 guy and inconsistent but he might stand that starting lineup doc this was a first round pick a couple of years ago for Washington but I am pretty hot on Corey kiss for right now  yeah I mean it's silly season and we all you know the Washington Wizards are going nowhere and they are terrible and I'm surprised that you're not a little fired up about Kula Bali either and you may be you we were talking about Corey Kinston butt kiss words numbers he's been hot over the last couple games I think he's a hot pick up looking at the schedule which is sort of my stick Washington goes three games next week and then four games the two weeks after that they're in the middle of a four game week right now so that's that's all pretty standard stuff nothing nothing or shattering their butt back to Kula Bali for a second this is a stock Guy this is a fantasy gold Guy this is a hamlet type of guy 11 points in three straight games  at least one block in five straight games  at least one Steel in four straight games and 73 pointers over his last three so it was last three is averaging 11 points like five boards couple of sis couple blocks couple Steals and and a couple threes that's your kind of guy this is silly season I think it's about Kula ballet and kisses for season in Washington I'm not worried about I'm not worried about Rashawn Holmes coming back in ruining them um I kind of am because the Holmes started played well picked up an injury in that game it was a toe Sprain and hasn't played since and in that game where home started kisper came off the bench Kula Bali was starting in that game so that's where my head is at with that um doc I would rather have cool a bali than kisper okay cool of Bali is on Jamie oppenheim's team in the cam Dynasty he was drafted and in Kula Bali is a is a foundation piece for that team can't have cooler Bali but I could have kissed and I picked him up off waivers of Adam for about a week now and I'm pretty psed with the activity he's giving me but for the people listening here on the road of wire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by smart bracket um I would recommend kulae he's not going to score as much stock I think his bird has a lot more scoring upside here but kiss for does not help you unblock some steals at all um cooler ball is going three stocks four stocks two stocks two stocks over the last four  games um he's got seven threes in the last three games including the last he started all of these games so there's more of an anchor for Kula Bali in that starting lineup then there is for Corey kisper so yeah I would rather have a below cool ball cool of Bali who was Victor wembanyama his teammate and France last year and and cool about a was kind of a hot he's got him a hot name at the start of the season I think a lot of us were drafting him at the very end of our drafts like this kid is a Steals and blocks machine he could start for Washington all year like there was a there was a little hype building around him and I think now that we're into mid-march and we got one month left and it's officially Silly Season it could also officially be cool about a balls out for the next month season Rick you mentioned smart acted smart bracket hey March Madness fans before we dive

doc I am going to go to smart bracket.io dot IO dot Isle not I owe to sumu but smart bracket dot IO and and get hey Doc or have you been watching a lot of college basketball this year  no  ask me the same question Rick have even watching college hoops no we don't have time I do a five-day a week show on NBA Radio okay I'm here with Dre I gotta stay on these goodies man um so the point is we're not trying to shame or slam college basketball will we watch college basketball now yes and well and when we fill out brackets and do we want to win these brackets yes and yes so I don't know Jack about a lot of these teams I know UConn's good I know Duke and North Carolina are good I know Houston's good I know some of those Purdue Purdue's good Purdue is good but they're joking but they're joking I wonder if smart bracket.io inputs the choke factor with Matt Painter in the Purdue boiler man I love is that a party right I technology so but I mean all kidding aside I'm literally gonna hit him up here because Mike Babcock of Mad Dog Sports Radio he's got a big bracket it's like 20 bucks a person is like hundreds of people in itself like if you win it you could really pop and make  a nice number um and I been like I screwed the boundaries of competitiveness stock on my own just doing a little bit of research and just kind of throwing darts and I like I do okay but I never win right so I'm gonna look up smart bracket.io man maybe get a dub this year let's go let's do it I'm sure they're happy to hear that right now I'm just saying like I think that's a really really good idea because a lot of us just parachute in right for the NCAA tournament we don't talk about these you and I literally really good idea I think you and I literally wake up on Monday morning print off some brackets  sit down and start guessing because we don't I mean I'm like you man I know who the good the better teams are I can look at a at a you know two versus 15 matchup and have an idea that the two's probably gonna win but to say I know what I'm doing when I'm feeling how to bracket I mean it's Preposterous right literally right now I my strategy is take all the favorites and just see what happens that's literally my strategy right now I can't tell you oh Furman who won the Southwest whack what whatever conference oh there are a hot sleeper they could go to the Sweet 16 I do not have that knowledge but we have fantasy basketball knowledge and we've got it for days and we're the ogs we've got ffw a Hall of Famer Steve Alexander Rick kamla he's Dre I'm the fantasy freak we've been doing this basically basically since dinosaurs were roaming planet Earth so let's get back to work here I know you want to talk about Kelly Olynyk know we're not dinosaurs I'm saying like the dinosaurs that were roaming the Earth  um and if we are dinosaurs well damn it we're still effective dinosaurs Kelly Olynyk here doc okay and and look he should be on everybody's team at this point I don't know what is rostered numbers are doc but over the last week Kelly o 19 six and eight two blocks two steals okay  no part of me this is last night my bad my bad I had a w that look like an end last night 196 and 8 2 and 2 8/11 shooting two threes okay that was against Detroit over the last week Kelly O's gone 16 five and five one block once deal pardon me one block one and a half deals and two threes fantasy gold baby from Kelly yo I've always been a big fan of Kelly yo doc when he gets the minutes and he's getting them right now and I think last week we talked about could Kelly obey a League winner these numbers kind of look like League winners like tilt the balance kind of thing for a team  they do he's 27% rostered  ESPN  are you serious right now 27  so go pick this guy up my God and that's up 6% so the he was at 21 and we've been talking about him for a couple weeks he's back home again and in Canada he's the only healthy big man in Toronto  he's playing massive minutes I think he's really excited to be in a new spot with new teammates doing new things and you read the numbers dude I mean he's he's killing it right now and he's a game changer I mean it that's the center I want to go pick up right now more so than Jacqueline Dale more so than Derek Lively and his week two game schedule I want Kelly oh um and Kelly oh man in the middle of a four game week and then Toronto goes three three the next two so again not ideal but then a lot of teams are only playing three games next week so I don't need you're losing anything but Kelly o linik has looked good enough for two weeks that he should be rostered everywhere if you need a big man that's that's the one you should be that should be at the top of your list not a great rebounder okay if you're looking for 10 boards a game you're not gonna get it here but you're gonna get five six seven eight and you're gonna get all the other goodies that we talked about just know that now if you want rebounds well he's not on waivers but DeAndre ate my goodness last night 33 in 19 against the Atlanta Hawks made 15 of 20 shots um the previous game 22 and 15 the previous game 30 and 19 the previous games well he was hurt and he's back now last three games Doc he's averaging 28 points 18 rebounds on 803% from the field again Will Chamberlain is looking down from heaven and going damn dude so duck I'm not getting a lot of shutdown vibrations from a lot of these teams man Memphis is talking about bringing Desmond Bane and branded Clark back Portland uh just brought Jeremy Grant back I thought maybe we'd get a shot down there Aiden has come back here these are guys that we thought might be shut down we thought we might have seen the last of them this year in their back um and so look man DeAndre I don't know how long this is gonna last guys he's not on waivers but I know doc wanted to talk about this and it's just nice to see DeAndre ayton playing with a damn motor okay and getting the most out of his god-given gifts this is an extremely athletic guy like a 40-inch vertical 38 something like that is a seven footer blessed by God dang it cranked it up go put up some massive stat line lines I don't know why it's happening late in the season why didn't happen in November but it's happening this is the most DeAndre ayton move ever like last week you and I sat here and I was like Rick is is DeAndre Aiden done you're like yes he he's done and I was like I'm with you he's done like what it if he can't get out of his house when it snows to make it to an NBA basketball game he's being paid a bazillion dollars to play in why is he gonna show up when they're 50 games on a first place the seasons over no one cares they're playing the Hawks late night in Portland nobody's watching and all of a sudden it ever since we said he's done last week he's just like coming out to fight us and just go off like DeAndre ayton looks like the best big man in basketball right now and he's waiting until Silly Season when nothing matters to do it like it's such an 8 movie  and I I'm not getting shut down Vibes either but  I can't imagine Desmond Bane coming back for more than just a handful of games  I can't imagine Jeremy Grant finishing out the season for the Blazers can't imagine a lot of things Brandon Clark like what what's happening with the Grizzlies and the Blazers night tonight you you can't really afford to mess with any of them  I I don't even know I just know that DeAndre ayton is on fire right now and why can't he do this in November or December when it matters and and people are still fired up about it  he can but he's got he's got like the lowest motor in the league and and I'm not sure whether the motor's cranked up right now maybe because he's like three two one can't come in and he's like he can see the light at the end of the tunnel here ah Joe Dumars is the ruling arm of the MBA and he said at the top of the Season that we want to stress this is an 82-game schedule to the teams and I think this sent a memo out or something like that and you know a lot of teams oh man we'll just do I think the league has taken note of that doc um and you merge that sort of this theme like we got to get guys back on the court this shutdown bull crap it ain't it man it creates a lot of unwatchable games it's bad for the product it's bad for your home fanbases even if you win a few games at the end of the year it's really not going to disturb where you draft guys okay and this is not a wimpy draft nobody knows who the number one overall pick is going to be in this trap maybe Alexandre sarr from Australia maybe Okay Juno much about him this is not a wimpy draft after a LeBron draft with a whole league is like oh my God I want to suck just so I can get this guy so I don't know man um do you talk thing is weird very weird to me I am getting shut down by from them but Portland to me and it's weird and it's ironic they've had to shut down by the last two years and now this year they're not going to do the shutdown thing um that would take me back to what you want Joe Dumar said and with Washington right they shut dudes down last year I'm not getting those vibrations right now I'm not worried about Ty Jones getting shut down I'm not worried about who's been getting shot down because they've got an interim coach they've got a new nonsense way of playing with kuzma center and it kind of like how that's going and you know they suck but for them they've got the new car smell so I this isn't going to be a shutdown of a stretch run as it has been um props to you by the way on Laurie marking and  he has been MIA I've got him on an injured list somewhere I remember maybe one of the very first one of these shows we did this year you were like you tall and Lori marking and I'm not touching him they shut him down every single year they're going to shut him down again this year I'm not doing it and so far you've been spot on appreciate that um I'm also I'm not a fan of guys that don't specially a big that doesn't help me in either blocks or Steals and I understand the efficiency the threes the scoring he's about eight nine rebounds a game I mean he's a good player man but um not you know like Nicola vujevich is another guy right not much in the blocks and steals I have a hard time with that doctor a and so it is Rick kamla it is Steve Alexander we are the ogs here on the road a wire fantasy basketball podcast um so look so again doc we said this last week but we need to bring it back for the people okay there's a guy in Charlotte I know you're not watching but hopefully you're looking at box scores at least named Vasily meech all right but sealing mechanic is not a thing um he's doing some big things right now last night as the point guard of the Charlotte Hornets 25 points 8 assists five threes two steals pop pop fizz fizz oh what a relief it is to have  me to John my team in the cam Dynasty I'm stoked about this um over the last week he's going 15 3 and 7 2.3 Steals and 0.83 the three game is a work in progress he didn't shoot threes very much in the Euro league he was a rock star in the Euro league okay and so the 5-3 game is some real progress here and he's getting more comfy at our three-point line um the Steels have been there the assists have been there he's scoring between 15 and 20 of Doc and last night like I said pop for 25 Trey man came back last night and had a small game and doc I have since traded trade man right because I had Mitch and man I'm like I can't have two Charlotte garments I don't want that okay I'm trying to win the cam Dynasty Title Here train man was hurt so I shipped him out for a high second round pick and in Scott Messina um took the deal and so I got into a high second round pick for train man who I might have ended up dropping had that trade not materialized and boom  now I got ceiling mechanic that's how you do it folks  wow not to burst your bubble but he only plays two games next week I've got him everywhere as well I you know once once we started to figure out what was happening with this 31 year old rookie or whatever he is he's 30 years old and 30 yes correct and once we figured out that  lamelo ball probably is it coming through that door Trey man  barely came back through that door like it's meaty time it's me season and it's time to pick him up he's in the middle of a four game week he's balling out if you get through the two game week next week then they go 444 to finish it up so pretty good shape there it's just gonna be a rough week next week but man that kid is that that man I should say is kind of on fire and I think if you if you were able to pick him up that's that's another Silly Season type of game-changing player six point four percent rostered ESPN  I guess we got to keep bringing him up week after week after week for the people the Sealy meshes don't worry about how to say his dang name just look for m i c i c and pick him up okay and tell him cam in Doc sent you we are the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast what's up doc no I just laughing dude that's funny tell him Doc and Camp sent you tell him we sent you the waiver wire can't communicate back and it's kind of a weird reference but we're rolling on here um I want to shut the door on Sam Merrill and Georges niang  I know they had big games last night the New Orleans Pelicans just decided for a game that we're not going to guard the three line watching that it was I'm gonna go on the air in a little bit later on today on NBA radio with Antonio Daniels he is the TV analyst for the New Orleans Pelicans on Bally's Sports  I mean what was that they got beat it one point the game they showed the three-point they got beat by at least 45 points on the three-point line last night so Sam Merrill hit five three said 15 points 9 assists that'll never happen again in five threes okay and so Sam Merrill has been dog I I like to cuss ever I'm not gonna do it he's been dog crap okay literally one of he had a game against Atlanta recently he did not make a shot he was like oh of nine against Atlanta they suck defensively okay so Sam Merrill finally busted out last night why I watch a lot of Cavs basketball because teams have gotten the word on Sam Merrill he is a knockdown deadly three-point shooter so guys are fighting over screens on him guys are closing out on him they're not leaving him buck naked out there anymore okay and so last night he got left buck naked and he made five threes that ain't gonna happen every night guys George niang doc he had two or three good games picked him up in the cam Dynasty cuz I needed a forward for one spot whatever whatever right so then I keep him for one more game because he did have three good games in a row it was the Phoenix game when Devin Booker came back three nights ago or whatever it was oh my god did he suck he was a foul waiting to happen could not make a shot of his brick brick brick brick and JB Krista was like bruh come on over here man what was that tonight so of course George niang last night pops for 16 and 6 with 4 threes it's Fool's Gold okay George niang cannot defend at all at all alright in Heavenly hopefully he's coming back here pretty soon if I had to have one of them it would be niang although the way he did me the other night with the bagel against Phoenix I was like dude I caught him doc mid-game I was so pissed at George niang I caught him mid-game I didn't even wait to see if he  had like in half to reclaim it I just oh my God I got to get rid of this guy man and he did not recover so to me that's Fool's Gold are you feeling Samara Georges niang in any kind of way well I got fired up about Merrell a couple weeks ago because on Friday March 1st he had 12 points and four three-pointers against Detroit and he back that up Sunday with 21 points and seven triples against New York and I was like back-to-back double-digit games Diamond Mitchell's hurt which is the key to this whole thing Mitchell and I was like man I'm I'm gonna recommend Merrill to people I'm gonna pick him up and roll with him his next five games six points one point six points Five Points three points then boom last night 15 with nine dimes like you said five triples against Herbert Jones the most dominating defensive player in maybe the whole league like I love and Jose Alvarado and Naji Marshall and all these dogs they didn't defend last night I love watching herb Jones play defense when herb Jones decides that you're not going to score on him tonight you're done it doesn't matter if you're Jalen Brown it doesn't matter who you are when he decides that you are not going to do anything you are toast let me ask you a question me and Antonio are going to talk about this today on NBA Radio who's the best perimeter defender in the NBA is it herb is it Derek white is it drew holiday is it subs is a car so who do you think's the best perimeter Defender I think they're all really good but I think herb Jones is the guy like herb Jones is guy that I don't want guarding me like when I got a parking rack when I go to park and rec on my buddy Chris Kennedy decides he's gonna shut me down dude he gets right up in my face and I'm old and fat and slow I can't I can't even I can't even get the ball do you even get cardio at that point or you just standing around and it's a complete waste of time not just get back in the car and go home I'm done but that's what it's like when herb Jones people I in my opinion and reminds me come back in the day when LeBron we get guarded by Kauai and you kind of see LeBron like why is this guy got to do do me like this just why is really good defendant defensive player too but all those guys you said man Drew and Derek White and the reason that I still think the Celtics are going to win it all is because the Drew and they're quite strong perimeter defense but I think just just a one-on-one defense a dog I mean it's her herb for me  Doc I think you're wrong dude I think you're wrong Jamal Murray is carving up Drew holiday and Derek white like their Thanksgiving turkey man yeah they have no answer for yokich I mean they do the seven foot three crystals porzingis and you could just like  I passed ball we get to buckets we win I mean it doesn't matter it does not matter you put Dillon Brooks on it it doesn't matter you put herb Jones on doesn't matter okay you'll just going to put your team in the fry cooker where the Wendy's people put the fries and your team is going to be done and devour with some Tasty Freeze in the mouth okay I think Denver's got this stop I think Denver's got this I can't believe that the Vegas odds right now are so heavily tilted in favor of Boston are we not watching the games are we know what do we not watch Denver go into Boston and beat them at TD Garden with Jamal Murray scoring 35 freaking points going 15 to 21 have we not watched these games one game what do you mean I mean you can say one game but we see Boston played Denver twice all year these are two of the most important games of the entire regular season and so if Boston cannot be Denver in the regular season how are they going to Win 4 out of seven in the playoffs because think about this stock  um you have to find some way to disturb Nicola yokich nobody in the league is able to do that until somebody is able to disturb maybe when B is the only guy that can actually disturb Nicola yokich but you know I Wendy's on the Spurs they saw we you know that's not gonna be a factor this year um until somebody consult the riddle of Nicole yokich and you know oh you double team him okay it's like double teaming Pat Mahomes you double team have a home you'll lose every time oh so what do I do I just stand back and up in a covered two yes you stay back in a covered too deep defense and you just hope for the best that's all you got well Boston is sleepwalking through this season they're like oh kristaps porzingis is he still on our roster just keep him over there on the bench until the playoffs get here we don't need him oh Drew holidays not feeling great tonight throw them on the bench we're good  we don't need him right now like they are just cruising dude they're like oh how Horford's 48 years old just throw them out there for 40 minutes we it doesn't matter he's healthy he's gonna be good together in the season playoff basketball is different  Celtics are just trying to get to the Finish Line healthy ready to go and  I still think I still think so the best team League at but you were right man the fact that joking is so unflappable and so like nobody can get to him like  he's moving slower than everybody on the court he's making better passes than most of the point guards to play basketball and he's making smarter decisions in a more calm and timely manner than any other player in the league so you're you're right it all goes through yogic but um I think the Celtics are going to game plan for him and they've got they've got enough big guys and enough depth that I think they can I think they can do it we'll find out it should be just so put your house on a man just you got you got money on Boston or I just don't don't put don't put I'm just been on them all year I did I think their best team  they're at best team they are the best team they have the best record they have the best combination of offense and defensive rating they are the best team but they're not going to be Denver so I'm out with that um what do you guys think well what do you guys think out here on the road of our fantasy basketball podcast who's winning this thing Denver or Boston hit us up with some comments doc let's go to the streets Let's help these people win some chips man  okay reader questions let's take it out  I'll find them you take the lead on them  um Matt starts it off with ESF must have a lot of dead legs I don't think ESPN has deadly I think ESPN we talked about this before here I've been told ESPN's League's  for some reason are smaller 8 to 10 League a 8 to 10 team leagues over there whereas Yahoo's primarily 12 so but even if you look at you know if the Yahoo  percentage of a player roster ship is at 50 it's going to be like 40 on ESPN but some of these guys meet you I guarantee you is not roster than enough in Yahoo League's either sorry we'll keep moving here What I'm Living Legends you think user Rick I'm gonna let you handle this one because I looked at is a Sarah Thompson  going to be back from he's got a long illness thing right he I he is listed right here I just looked him up Oscar has been ruled out for last night's game he's got asthma problems um so I don't know guys I don't know I don't know if you told me he's got a metacarpal issue in his hand and say it's four to six weeks um if I saw ankle in red be able to tell you that looked like a week that look like a day-to-day look like a week to week I'm pretty good with all that kind of stuff um hyper extension you know usually leads to a torn ACL pardon me saddiq Bey but you know he fell into that trap once again God bless him um but but I'll start Thomson I don't know I mean he's got an asthma issue here and so I don't know if it's asthma but he's actually got like a more serious lung issue that they're putting asthma on you know just kind of soften it up and sugar-coated a little bit I don't know um it's the second straight dnp um this sounds honestly like a complicated type of thing and it's Detroit right you're not like trying to make the pit trying to get above into the top six and so okay like let's really go for it here I just it's a big I don't know I wish I had more for you but I know you um with him out um Simone fontecchio is going to be the beneficiary of that  yeah I think fintech is a strong pick up right now he should be rostered everywhere and I would say this I don't like the word asthma attached to a guy that runs up and then the court for a living and plays basketball you see people suffer from asthma there sucking on that that inhaler thing and then you're dealing with lungs and breathing and and lack of oxygen to the brain and yada yada yada like I I think before I'm running my potential Superstar youngster  out on the court he's not going to be suffering from asthma problems when I do that so I could see this potentially shutting him down until they get it figured out which could mean the season it could mean he plays two days now I'm with Rick I don't know but I don't like the sound of any of that simply because of what I said here is a great question from Matt Carmody Rick would you drop buddy hield the once on fire buddy yield for Mecca or scoot Henderson Head that point sleep so definitely not definitely not scoot Henderson who believed in her I mean Sean Cibola what is wrong he is starting Delano Banton over scoot Henderson right now School Henderson should be going off in these games right now I mean literally what are we doing here Delano Banton needs to start over scoot Henderson School played 17 minutes  I don't know where we're going with the scoot Henderson thing I've hated how they have deployed scoot all year remember that little stretched stock where they were playing Brogden over him and to that makes sense to anybody on any Planet they held on to Brodin through the trade deadline and now he's at you know a dead player is not going to come back at all um hopefully they traded him before his contract expires next year to what you know legitimate team is a six-man well healed has hit the skids man and it's pretty predictable he got to Philly new car smell changes scenery pop pop pop pop all right then all star break then reality said send you don't have a bead okay you don't have the spacing you don't have the comfortability of all the gravity that he creates and so now he's gone 13 15 8 16 9 in his last five games he has 12 threes over his last five games which is like two point two which is not buddy heeled either um in the shooting has been pretty abysmal a six to 17 a two for ten a four for 11 I'm not telling you to drop buddy Heald but um but but when we juxtaposed him to Vasily meet you  I mean doc I'd rather have meet you here's the thing you can get buddy hield stuff on waivers Corey kispert does buddy hield stuff but he's a little better in the stocks area but you know what I'm saying like buddy hield is kind of sort of Corey kissper um and so but the Difference Maker is  is Mitch because the assess you doc we'd say this all the time you very rarely can find 789 and says per game off of waivers we are right now with me she literally can find seven eight nine says and this isn't some Scotty Pippen Jr fly by net bull crap on Taylor Jenkins and that yo-yo down in Memphis this is actually something you can count on that's awesome so yeah I would I would do that as well and as for my guy what's his name who's the guy I can't Blanton in Portland I've got him on a roster and he's actually kind of fun I'm kind of enjoying that experiment not the last two games though I got I got right here  doc yet 25 against Toronto we popped for 30 against Houston the fantasy world is all rushing to get him he followed that up with a 22-point game against Boston with low goodies and then last night 12 5 and 2 in 19 minutes well I mean welcome to the Chauncey Billups blender what the eff you do with that  are we thinking the 3025 to this coming back are we thinking he's now right around a 20 minute per game player which is where he should be Doc with scoot Henderson playing 30 minutes a game well it was one game and Portland actually got a win so that was weird  against you know who the Hawks  Johnson Murray hit last night I don't know that dude they're missing Jalen Johnson so bad I mean obviously Trey young but they're missing that juice to Jill and John Johnson brings man are the Nets going are the Nets going to catch the Hawks and knocked the Hawks out of the playoffs probably not last I looked it was like a three-game separation it is a three and a half game separation no sir I don't believe they're going to catch the Hawks how can Brooklyn be that bad they're pretty sort of healthy  now they are but I mean they just got cam Johnson back last night came off the bench um I mean look I  to me the Brooklyn Nets have more Talent than the record says they do I like Claxton a lot I like McKell Bridges a lot I love me some cam Thomas Dennis Schroder is Balin for them at center right now cam Johnson is a good player Dorian Finney Smith is a good player you know what I mean Dennis Smith Jr is a nice backup point guard I like him in a backup point guard spot I that their coaching to me is not been good this year doc I feel like they're talented more wins than this  would you drop Tyler hero to pick up Desmond Bane hey we're going to figure out where you really stand with Desmond Bane at this point why I just don't understand why we have to drop Tyler hero what how can we not just put them in an IR spot and then you have an open spot and then you just go scoop up Desmond Bane I don't understand why you've got to cut Tyler hero unless you're in one of these lame eight or ten team ESPN League's I mean that is so stupid to me by the way like it's so easy like that's like the kitty version of it you know what I mean like Dr if you're in a video game and you've got like difficult extremely difficult PhD level and then at the bottom you've got like kindergarten level great school level right like no what why that's grade school level man that's entry level bull crap  eight Ten teams I know you got an 18 is it 14 or 18 teams that team you this loaded with all stars you talk about from time to time well that is an 18 League that we drafted like a month and a half ago to help help these kids these sick kids oh shit kids all right thumbs up thumbs up yeah it's a charity it's a charity thing and dude I've got that team is just stupid it's wimby and MB and hardened and why and it's it's so so funny oh so doc back to this man I mean I don't freaking know if I had to go to my head backed into a corner I'd go get Bane because I'm really that when was the last time what was the last time hero played  what was a minute it was a New Orleans game two or three Friday nights ago whatever whatever so he's got last us a foot injury and a knee injury Tyler hero the often injured maybe the biggest teasing fantasy basketball has not one but two leg injuries okay and he's soft he's very soft doc his Tyler hero been able to complete the last two seasons for the Miami Heat  um well  the answer is no  I was gonna talk about I was gonna add pile on Malcolm Brogden a minute ago why you were talking about him you just kind of iced over him like he gets a free pass never finishes a season never plays more than half the game's world that he lives in but man I don't know how you can ever rely on Malcolm Brogden for anything and I feel like Tyler Heroes sort of headed down that down that same path  um I just made a trade in the cam Dynasty tell me what you think of this I traded a Brogdon right in my in one of my IR spots not coming back this year and a third round pick to get into khris Middleton who's return is right around the corner um what what do you think of that little move it's been a rough two years for Chris Middleton but I I don't know why he would not come back  the Old khris Middleton next year like I have way more faith in Middleton than I do Brogden so I like that deal Rick you know who Tristan Duke of itches  yeah he's the cat that a Washington just scooped up  well let's let's close the book on Desmond Maine how many games do you think Desmond Bane is going to play for Memphis  they probably got about 17 left he's going to come back in another game or two so they say um  I don't know I would say I maybe 13 or 14 of those games you know probably know back-to-backs if you're going to bring him back  then play hymn to the end  and if I'm Brandon Clark doc I want to come back I'm paid to do this I love ball right don't I love playing basketball is now why I'm here originally is Love of the Game bouncing that ball going to the park playing until Mama screamed at me because Dinners Ready and I got to come home now the Sun is going down isn't that what this is about no oh one reason to the end these are not you doc but a lot of these like whiny media members right like Tom Thibodeau what are you play your guys so much you're running it shut up shut up those guys are a big part of the problem with load management so they're like well what good is it to bring him back it's a month left in the season yeah there's a month left in this season that means popcorn is popping beer is being sold TV cameras are rolling let's play I don't dock in the NFL they don't shut guys down if a guy comes back from injury for week 18 they freaking play him okay because there's a game and because there's fans in the stands because TV cameras are rolling why not play and so again shout out to  Joe Dumars beginning of the Season same we're changing this shit up this is no longer a 55 Game season for these lazy bumps this is an 82 Game season okay you need to order it as such and I really think teams have taken that to heart doctor I really do and that is to our benefit over here in fantasy basketball end of rant that was a fantastic rant I have marked down the time it took place I'm going to tell the people  at RotoWire that should be cut into a two-minute clip and just let it rip that was good stuff um no because I'm I'm the old guy over here in the corner like why is Desmond Bane coming back to play  in meaningless games for Memphis when he could get hurt again like something bad could happen and mess up next year  I I'm more of a protect my assets guy but you're right popcorn's popping there's beer to be sold and there's basketball to be played Marlo Marlo Ram once to know your thoughts on Tristan Duke of itch as a pickup I'm gonna be honest I don't know anybody I didn't know this question was coming I am not checked him out so let you handle this one and then no he is a euro big who was stashed and now Washington who is without a center Bagley out Holmes out Gafford traded and so they're going to bring him in will he play I don't know how much will he play I don't know they've got a small ball look right now with Kyle kuzma Center they kind of like it I kind of like it too and and so I can see this vukovich guy getting 15 to 18 Off the Bench this is a wait and see for me I am not this isn't like a doc I'm trying like remember when Pete Alonso  I believe the he left spring training didn't quite have the job and then like early in the season the Mets promoted him or something everybody globed on to Petal on so right and rightly so hot shot Prospect boom pop 50 home runs blah blah blah blah blah this kind of stuff um I don't know Jack about this guy this is not some Buzz Guy this is not a hype God do you know what I'm saying doc you don't like a pedal on so or you know some of the other prospects in baseball that have hype about them they come up like if Jackson holiday starts the year in the miters and the Orioles bring them up to the bill it's going to be huge news Jackson holiday season this year right there's no Tristan vukovich season hahaha nobody is tweeting out Tristan vukovich szn unless I missed that tweet on Twitter or pardon me X doc  the worst name change in the history of the world we had to go from Twitter one of the great names in America in the world and we had to go to this doc we had to go to x  what yeah it's it's not easy man it's not easy and it took my blue dot they changed it to X I'm frankly over it  did take when I lost my blue check mark I lost  all the cool points with my children and all of their friends because they used to be like your dad's verified on Twitter what like it was such a big deal for the kids and like the I live in a college town and you know my buddies and we'll be hanging out at Johnny B's talking to people and they'll be a group of girls around my buddy he'll be like hey this dude's verified on Twitter and they're like why no way and I was always it was always a fun thing to have as my calling card and then he got taken away everybody's verified on tour now if they want to be it and it's sucks Rick I've won last question for you before we wrap it before we get out and we are getting out putting on the spot here what is your favorite part of this time of year is it the NCAA tournament is it the Masters  is it started the NBA playoffs  or is it Baseball opening day which which one do you get most fired up about wow  uh wow that's a really good question definitely not the Master's um what if tiger was still relevant yeah maybe probably all right I'm not I like playing golf I'm not huge on watching golf I love playing golf do you are all about watching the Masters when you lived at this house about 15 years ago that was you were all about it that was 15 years ago so that's 15 years ago oh many years 15 years ago I would have cared a lot more about the NCAA tournament then I do right now so it comes down to the basketball playoffs and Major League Baseball opening day and Doc I'm gonna throw fastball at you here you would think with my background and my identity that I would say the best basketball playoffs which I am psyched about but doc I am in one  I'm already in 11 Fantasy Baseball League's I have a dynasty draft tonight at 9:00 eastern time you know I I don't know if you all know but I'm a goat not sport too okay I literally print championships in fantasy baseball I have a formula I have a method it is not an algorithm it's just me being a goat okay and I know how to do this I wouldn't chips 40% of the time doc I do not win ships 40% of the time in fantasy basketball I don't I because there's their injuries and stuff happens right in baseball there's a formula and if you follow that formula you will win 40% of the time and you will be literally final for guaranteed if you follow my formula I know I sound like Tony Robbins in an infomercial you all the riddle of fantasy baseball you sound like the antenna or whatever his name is from Anchorman 40% of the time yeah every time yeah so just quickly for the people who maybe playing some fantasy baseball here's what you do like the first eight picks are spent on offense okay offense offense offense offense offense this year I would recommend waiting on catcher I found that Salvador Perez Gilbert Ruiz um and what's his name Jonah Heim or really slip in Logan Ohio with the angels are really slipping okay you don't need one of the big boy catchers this year but go offense offense offense then go closer okay now you three closers all right and then you're good get the like firm guys not the fly-by-night guys like a Finnegan from Washington go get the firm guys DS from Cincinnati um who else am I messing around with the Holmes from New York guys like that then guys you go a little bit of offense to round out the utils and stuff and you're really where are the starting pitchers cam where are they starting pitchers you don't need them okay you need them but not at the top of the draft so doc then the rest of the draft is all starting pitchers okay so you know who I'm getting I'm getting hunter green I'm getting cruciate Cristian Javier I'm getting Hunter Brown I'm getting maybe a Chris bassitt but he's usually around away from me and like I look at my I'm getting Tristan McKenzie I'm getting Mackenzie Gore I'm looking at my pitching staff and I'm going I freaking love this pitching staff and I got it at the back end of the draft and then you look at my offense stop and it's Rockstar Rockstar Rockstar Rockstar rockstar I got homers I got steals I got ribs I got everything that's the formula for winning Fantasy Baseball these people that think you got  to go take to Graham Insurance I mean they're all hurt right so not this year but to go get the Gerrit Cole already got an elbow guys already got an elbow okay you are to me silly and foolish if you spend High picks on pictures and fantasy baseball you are silly okay well thank you to you're welcome  thank you to Smart bracket.io Rick go check that out right now and get ready for March Madness I'm gonna my answer to that question is I think I get most jacked about opening day because I've got fantasy  teams  baseball teams where the first game of the day affects my my fancy basketball team whereas March Madness I still get fired up about that but you gotta wait like three hours before results start coming in and brackets start being impacted so so that immediate return on opening day of baseball it's probably the thing it gets me almost fired up this time of year Rick have a great weekend we will be back here Thursday to do this and again we'll be talking more smart bracket not IO and fantasy Hoops then y'all have a great weekend peaches
