welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy and Vivid Seats it's Friday December 1st 2023 I have to pay rent pay rent everybody Alex barutha here with Shannon McEwen and Ken k train crates  is there's all aboard is there some sort of activity involved to pay the rent  Scary Terry Rozier puts up 37 points with 13 assists in a 129 128 loss to the Nets might be taking over a little bit with lamelo ball out really helping my 16 team stake League where he was out for a long time this game was there was a lot to talk about in this game fantasy wise  cam Thomas also make his return for the Nets yeah another one of my teams came off the bench just scored 26 points in 25 minutes you also had Bryce McGowan start for the Hornets who scored 14 points know Brandon Miller in this game so probably just a spot star from a gallon doesn't seem like a long term thing for Miller that's what the fourth straight appearance off the bench for PJ Washington with Myles Bridges back in the fold Bridges playing wildlife uh the Nets the Nets are back to health Ken I just say yeah the Nets are finally healthy look out for Brooklyn Claxton Nic Claxton is on fire lately at 20 points 14 boards in two blocks love the blocks he gets you out of Center Nets are Nine and Nine I'd say they're arrows pointing up now they finally got cam Johnson back they got cam Thomas back coming off the bench like they've always planned  so I I kind of like I like the outlook for the Nets yeah they'll be a good position to add some Veterans as well you have plenty of teams in the Eastern Conference alone Pistons Wizards Bulls who are essentially done so there'll be they'll be good veterans to be had via trades if that's when I add to their pieces too  Shannon are you concerned about Spencer Dinwiddie now that camp Thomas is back because he is but also been saving me and plenty of League's after a slow start yeah dinwiddie's been really solid for the past week plus he started the year off I in a good good way as well but like you mentioned as soon as cam Thomas comes back then when he goes from from averaging 40 plus fantasy points per game in the four previous games he was at 45.4 fantasy points per game to last night and a 1-point loss play 30 34 minutes still but his fancy production dipped down 24.8 fantasy points it's nine shot attempts yep yep only 9 shots I'm so I I think I think this is just in with you and this is the way he's been even when he's playing those big roles for teams like it's it's super encouraging they still played 38 minutes in the game last night so that's a positive I think the minutes probably still be there but his his play his production is always going to be up and down he's a roller coaster always has been  yeah we should also note from that game Gordon Hayward had a pretty nice outing 22 points six rebound six assists he had been playing like crap lately yeah I had really struggled but partially due to Rozier coming back in Miles Bridges coming back this is a big bounce back game for him if you if you were not able to sell high after the first like six games of the Season at least now you can feel good that maybe he saw her back with lamelo expected to miss probably a month plus it's still unclear one other take from the Charlotte side is PJ Washington coming off the bench now miles Bridges and Mark Williams starting in the front door for the bot the Bobcats the Hornets may as well but Bobcats exactly exactly but PJ Washington you know even though he's in that six-man role 33 minutes last night and it's very encouraging if his usage was 20% had a productive game be yeah even though he was only two left two from a two furry 11 from the floor he still hit for free throws had eight rebounds five assists two blocks three steals still a productive guys still getting minutes he'll get you three pointers box steals that rare combination that you're always looking for so I think he's a hole in mostly even in with the ventral  let's go to San Antonio where Wendy is a game time decision tonight versus the Pelicans with a hip issue this is the second of a back-to-back games for the Spurs when be played 29 minutes in Thursdays lost to Atlanta last night  Spurs are now three and 15 so you gotta wonder why would they push Wendy if there's any kind of health risk this is what I was worried about preseason with Wendy is Spurs aren't gonna compete this season they're playing for the future give him credit he's played in all 18 games so far but my Temptation here is to trade high does that seem silly or wise to you guys  um  I don't mind a sell high on one bin Llama it's it's a I mean it's a really tough conversation people are you know this is sort of emblematic of all like the rookie that your conversation between him and shet it's like women Yamaha his shooting percentage is a little bit low like can mention you worried about his minutes  you have to wonder like does the does this performance you know the shooting get better with the way they're playing offense with Sohan out there are they going to change that at some point I think I can I think you're fine if he wants to sell High the you know obviously the question when you talk about like selling high buying low anything like that is who are you getting in return what sort of targets are you trying to get and I think one bananas what like a third round value right now maybe um double checking  Here regular 19 yeah he ranks depending from site to say it's different there are numerous operator commission sites where he ranks his top 10 player right now he's probably more in that 15 to 20 range if you look at solid rankings I would 100% trade went be for a top 10 player if I can get it and I think you would be able to get a top 10 player for him the game Count from here on out worries me so as the Spurs you know really have nothing to play for we saw point out the last that game so on they career tying 33 points career high tying 33 points eight boards and six dimes on 12 of 14 shooting I don't think he's going to shoot 12 or 14 again for a while and Trey Young on The Winning Side of Things 405 points and 14 dimes he had 16 free throw attempts the Hawks are now at 500 they're Nine and Nine Alex you excited about to play your favorite Charles Bassey tonight in DFS if Wendy's out yeah if one piece out I think you know Charles Bassey and Zach Collins are good options you know Collins is safer gonna be a higher price on the on the daily fantasy sites bassy's a little more of a value high-risk high-reward option  but yeah I mean Sohan  amazing performance from him obviously I think everybody has been fairly critical of Sohan not because he's we think he's a bad player but because he acknowledged he's playing Augusta position yeah so this is obviously a really big step in the right direction for him you can stash him for the second half I think he's gonna have a great second half once he's adapted to the position Alex take us to news out of Miami uh Miami bam out of Bio leaves Thursday's game first the Pacers after re-injuring this hip issue which is kind of been bothering for a while bothering him for a while he laughing about again I'm laughing at you with me on this the Sigh when you go ah by a big is the man that's had to write so many injury updates so the Miami Heat roster well so it's not only that but it's also it's also being a bucks fan and you're like this team man I hate this team yes so on Mi been dealing with a hip injury left the game versus the Pacers after I took his over on points of course because that's how things work Miami still did work against the Pacers beat them 142 to 1:30 to my goodness Halliburton scores a career high 44 points it was August due with the way they pulled up numbers at this point how many Hawkins Junior we will talk about more later without a bio going out 24 points five rebounds in one steal and 33 minutes Butler took 20 free throw attempts because there's absolutely nobody on the Indiana who can guard him Josh Richardson in 19 points in 32 minutes Sharon what do you make of you know how to bio is maybe out Butlers kind of been in and out of the lineup you still have hero out I mean if you're playing DFS if you're in season long how you approach just kind of what you're seeing with the Miami Heat yeah I know you're gonna talk about a couple Miami Heat players in our waiver wire section we talked about a couple two weeks ago I think we've had a Miami Heat player featured in our waiver wire almost every yeah almost every segment this season for me I mean with  you know the one guy Josh and who we won't talk about later he's been very solid for him I think he's an option he's a streaming option and tell this team tells he basically tell hero returns stuck in Robinson also solid Caleb Martin kind of for he's kind of been forgotten about but he had that big playoff run last year and he's he's coming off the bench but doing solid over the past three games 27 minutes per 25 fancy points per game in those performances for the front core I mean if Bam's out you've got Tam Thomas Bryant and or Lando Robinson one of those two will probably step up I think comes Brian's the guy out give first look too yeah and you mentioned like if you're in a deeply Caleb Martin and Josh Richardson like those are great options so the heat the heat are chock-full options who are a lot of them are very under rostered and I don't know why because the heater actually talked about a lot and I can I hate to say it but you have to take us to the Bulls Bucks game  yeah yeah Bulls upset the Box 120 113 and overtime bucks at one eighth of nine before that lost so I wouldn't get too down there Alex but really weird know Zach Levine no DeMar DeRozan for Chicago Illinois product I owe to Sumo and Alex Caruso started but Chicago got 31 points Off the Bench from Torrey Craig Andre Drummond and former boxing Carter  Alex what are you reading into this  man you well you've written our Google doc here am I worried about the bench I'm worried about the whole damn team I'm worried Adrian Griffin is like David Blatt it's just not going to work they're gonna have to fire him yeah look I mean this is a troll shit it's losing you know without the rose and Levine you like on one hand you understand how this happens because and you know Levine especially is kind of bringing the team down lately all these guys who are not in the trade rumors are hyped to get the extra minutes they want to beat the box that bucks are especially vulnerable in the back court you know Kobe white goes for 23 the soon mu has the game of his of his season against Lillard and Beasley Lillard has seven turnovers scores only 18 points they give up five they give up 14 rebounds to Andre Drummond in 13 minutes my god um you mentioned it like this and Drew holiday already you know I look we need khris Middleton a lot and the Bucks would be lacking in their depth with or without holiday you know it's not like they gave up a bunch of pieces to Andrew Holliday it's they would still lacked up with him Alex doesn't Miss Grayson Allen  is actually been good I tried to tell people like Chris Young's not bad player um yeah I mean a lot of this is Middleton like Middleton is just not himself obviously the issues and for you he's never gonna be himself well don't worry that that knee ain't coming back yeah at this point it's definitely concerned and it's just as much of a concern defensively as offensively you know Middleton was a fine Defender when he was in his prime but he's not a great athlete and so when you lose that like I said he's on the wing he's trying to guard like these Athletics 30 to 32 years old getting a little up there can't do it and you mention not to panic the box also have the how would you phrase this the most the fakest record in the NBA according to garbage time net rating or non garbage time netting they have two and a half more wins real wins than they should so you're actually looking at more of like in 11 and 18 and stuck with a 13 and 16 but that  that's that's enough of my ice on the role this was exact Lavina update oh does that Levina update yeah he's out for at least a week you know we saw in this game Kobe white played really well I think that can you know I mean he should be rostered so there's not necessarily a lot you can do there I'm interested in like the soon moves stuff you know he's showing an ability to play fine the thing is he need he needs 30 minutes like you it's not like the first guy he's a defense first guy certainly was coming out of Illinois yeah and it's Alex overly concerned about the Bucks  I mean the Bucs record is hard to complain about but I will say for a team with that get of a record it's amazing how bad they've looked at first stretches this season yeah I mean barely barely beating Washington barely beating the biggest comeback of the year against Portland what are we doing you've got two top 10 players that I I've preached this every time a new super team arises the Miami Heat Big 3 started 10 and 10 so do you have nothing to worry about it'll be fine  I will Alex weak seven is kind of the in season tournament week can you walk folks through the details yeah I mean like Shannon was mentioning there's nothing to worry about the Bucks were four and in season tournament games they win one accounts they know they know how to be clutch they step up to the moment them on the Lakers both undefeated in season tournament games yes this is an interesting week for Fantasy the first time this is ever happened so we need to talk about it Monday and Tuesday are the quarter finals if you don't know those games I can remember those games off the top of my head it's box Nicks Celtics Pacers Lakers Suns and Jazz no not Jazz Pelicans Kings and that's still in the NBA arenas the usual yeah areas still on the usual MBA Arenas then on Thursday we get the semi-finals which is in Vegas and then the finals will be on Saturday as Ken notes 8:30 p.m. Eastern on ESPN slash fubo  doesn't count for Fantasy that's an important thing to note Saturday games those games do not count for fairies so keep that in mind other than that every team plays two times next week between Monday and Friday those are the only games that count for Fantasy the semi-final and I could be wrong here I'm literally asking the semi-final game's that are in Vegas the semis not the final the semis still count towards their NBA 82 Game season record it's just final that is on its own not in fantasy and not in the seasonal long records right  yes I'm pretty sure the knockout teams play another game that's how they get their second game that week oh if I'm not mistaken that doesn't have any value either other than they might do that on Friday I just double check I'm fairly certain only the finals the championship game does not count as a regular season game and fantasy stats  it's also important to note I forgot which games it is terrible podcasting there are two a lot of the days have two games and there's like I think it's Wednesday and Tuesday and Thursday can't remember one of the days has like 13 games and the other day as like 11 games so if you're one of those daily transactions and you want to like streaming on low volume days if you're one of those people keep that in mind because some days have like two games some days have like 13 so keep that in mind if you are a daily League streamer  back to basketball though okay yeah good news Trey Murphy finally returning for the New Orleans Pelicans  Murphy 67% roster on Yahoo but only 10% on ESPN so check your waiver wire for Murphy Murphy announced you took an old video of himself as a kid  and reposted on Twitter where as a kid he says I think it's straight says hi my name is Trey and I have a basketball game tomorrow it's very cute video look that looks on Twitter Alex you got some other player news yes Kelly oubre expected to return next week from the car accident that happened a lot of questions surrounding that but he is expected to return next week and we also have Shannon's pistons in the news the same oh yeah Bob zdanowicz hit I don't need both yeah baby oh yeah is he the first of the second I don't really know where he is in the bow yeah he's the only boy on so keep that in mind when when checking out games for the Pistons see who gets minutes see who loses minutes obviously Shannon and us will be talking about that a lot more you got a good question for fan feedback after about the Pistons and buy one of itch after Alex tells us about our good friends at Underdog we love we love Underdog

Shannon prepare yourself to give fabulous wisdom to the loyal loyal fans of the show first question from Ben mckinstry my apologies if I mispronounced that hey guys love the show watch from Australia hello Australia  my question should we buy low now on our store Thompson  you're Pistons rookie Shannon how worried are we about the Detroit rotation we just mentioned by Anna Vic's coming back I think it's a great one what do you say chef yeah I I think Azar Thompson is absolutely a Bi-Lo candidate he came off the bench last night in the Pistons lost to the Knicks I would not read into that too much essentially Isaiah livers received this the start over us our tops and it's not great that he only played 13 minutes off the bench but I don't expect that to stake I think it's our tops and we'll be back in the starting lineup or a much more pivotal part of the rotation in the near future it might take a couple games the Pistons are obviously throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks but if our tops and is not a guy I'm too worried about I'm holding him I'm stashing him if I own him anywhere and re-draft Lee's if I roster and Dynasty obviously I'm stashing in there and then for Dynasty and redraft I also do believe he's a great Buy Low candidate the other fantastic especially from a guard for his position and  he can't hit threes inconsistent that that's to be expected with the with a rookie who shot his shot was his big question mark coming into the league but I I think he's a absolutely a hold or Bilo option Alex anything to add to that or should we go to question two I think I think Sharon covered it excellent let's go to question two from Ian solace  he asked Brogdon and John columns  Collins sorry or spicy Pascal siakam  I would rather take seacom here rather than the combo of Brockton and John Collins partially because John Collins  depends on your league size and format you know you said nine cat if we're just gonna assume 12 team you should roster Collins but he don't have to start him necessarily you know on three game weeks anyway I would rather have siakam because I think you can stream in Collins value for the most part  I mean brockton's game counts I was gonna be a problem with his right history also see yakim qualified Center on Yahoo that's on Yahoo that's where you're playing and columns is not blocking shots like you used to and  Castle coming back no I columns is gonna fade with Kessler coming back to yeah I mean maybe we buried the lead a little bit brockton's been playing extremely well like Bronson's having a amazing season partially because he's walking the only like functional Playmakers with experience on that on that roster but of course you know scoots gonna get more playing time Simon's is going to come back and mention the game Count he's a lower body injury breast so yeah takes you outcome yeah I we're three-way agreeance on seacom here Brogden I have to worry about you know just fragments of long-term Outlook with that team I think it's at some point this season it's gonna be criminal if they don't get skew Henderson into the starting lineup they sold their future and you know with Dame Lillard selling him off to Miami and opening the door for skew to take over the steam they need to get him in the starting lineup events as a showcase they're gonna trade frog and Brogden could land a starting gig elsewhere with a contender but even if it's a starting gig he's gonna you know not gonna be the best player on the floor or the second best player on the floor for that team he'll likely be a more of a couple mattress role any also could revert back to six Men role like it was with Boston last year so I don't I body can handle starting role I don't think he can handle that  yeah 30 minutes a night and college I like Collins is player he's doing fine but you know really other than yeah like defensively not doing nearly as well he's hitting more three-pointers than he ever has but that's it pretty much everything else is down oh all right Alex take us to the waiver wire  the waiver wire it is time uh basically how this works if you haven't been here before we each Ken Shannon and I have two regular waiver wire picks players who are roster and fewer than 50% of usually Yahoo leagues and then we each have one long shot usually roster in 25% or fewer of Yahoo leagues as we talked about schedule wise earlier in the show in case you missed it or got confused because it is confusing only game Monday through Friday will count next week the Saturday game the n Season tournament championship this is Saturday well not count towards fantasy so if you have a you know if it's Celtics Suns and the N seasons in tournament Championship you don't get those Tatum games you don't get the booker games in some ways this is nice everyone plays twice just play your best players don't worry about game Count yeah chill right chill a lot more like fantasy football that way don't think as much about like adding up somebody's you know if you think about adding up  bismack Beyond those rebounds like a four game week to compare like Myles Turner  okay what's your first who's your first pick it looks like you double in down in Miami I'm doubling down in Miami I'm going with Jaime Hawkes and Kyle Lowry they're both about 50% roster please roster these people like I am begging you to add these players to your team Hawkins past 12 games 16 points five rebounds three assists on 55 48 87 shooting he looks awesome bam out of Bio is now dealing with this hip injury but I will give endorsed it anyway I wrote this down before the game last night  yes Tyler hero will come back I still think Hawkes will probably be worth rostering on that team would hero is back Kyle Lowry he's ranked 83rd on the entire season he should be on rosters past 11 games specifically 12 points four rebounds four assists 1.2 steals shooting 48% from the field and hanging 2.73 these guys just have to be on 12th jerseys I don't even think there's an exception  all right well said  well said I I'm gonna go  to Milwaukee for my first pick and look this is much better player I think in fantasy that in real life but Malik Beasley who's 45% rostered for for the bucks over the last four games listen to this 14 and a half points here's what shocked me seven and a half rebounds plus a steel and a half he's always going to hit three pointers he's at three and a half triples playing over 35 minutes a game over the last four games maybe he's finally comfortable in his offensive role from Milwaukee we know they have depth issues so I think is going to keep getting a ton of minutes and as you said earlier I'm a little worried Middleton's Never Gonna return to All Star production that leaves a lot of scoring opportunities frankly a lot of catch and shoots for Beasley and if he plays terrible defense it doesn't affect your fantasies Squad so dive in and enjoy some Malik beastly  nice Pig can't my my first free agent suggestion for the week is Derek Lively rookie center for the Dallas  Mavericks 43% roster I am  stunned a flabbergasted Bamboozled I don't know any any kind of word you want to toss out there I cannot believe that he's only 43% roster Derek Lively has been up and down this year he just missed one game on the 25th of November due to an ankle injury but he quickly returned I'm sorry a back injury quickly returned and played Tuesday against the Rockets 28 minutes 23 fantasy points 8 points five rebounds two blocks there's there's going to be some ups and downs here there's going to be a roller coaster but he's a rookie I believe it will get better as the season goes on he's ranked high right now on the season and guy we talked about earlier John Collins Frank hired then Collins is Fox yeah those blocks are very valuable he's averaging 1.1 on the season right now again I think the best is yet to come with their Lively so even though there's some inconsistencies and there's going to be stretches where he might not be good he's locked into that starting role he started every game he's been healthy since you know after since the second game of the season I'm really since the second half of the first game of the season and I don't think that's gonna change unless the Mavericks trade for like an All-Star caliber Center they're probably and even if they do look at pieces this year via trade probably be more at the three in the four than the five they you have to assume they view Lively as a nice building block and the potential long-term fixture at the five form it's weird and yet good to see them not give minutes to Dwight Powell they're finally moving Powell to a rolled gig you know a specific Off the Bench role which they should have done years ago big upside for lively love that pic Alex who's your number two free agent crap  if it's a deak bay of the Atlanta Hawks former piston of Shannon's he's 49% rostered he has Jalen Johnson is out which is our fortunate you know he's one of the breakout players this year he's not expected to return He Johnson will probably be back in the January a bay has started the past three games hasn't done a lot extra as a starter continues just to play his game  but he's ranked 131st on the whole season we know he can get hot past nine games 14.6 rebounds one assist with 1.4 steals shooting 55 38 72 just someone who I think should be rostered when Jalen Johnson is out you know someone you can you can move in on four game weeks after he Hunter was in that oh you can go ahead and cut them territory and then Johnson got hurt and suddenly had a few good games he was mediocre last night  it'll be interested in Stevens Bay or Hunter like benefits more from the Johnson apps and absence yeah I'd say bass slate Edge in receiving a bigger benefit but hunter Bay even by zdanowicz all three of them playing more and playing well with Johnson out  my number two pick admittedly pretty boring but Josh Hart with the New York Knicks he's 49% roster got off to a very slow start oddly for the Knicks this season because his roles seem pretty uh cemented in their playoff run last season but hey we're just remember this last season Josh Hart was ranked 65th in total game production in eighth category League's rebounds a lot for a guard qualifies as a guard and forward on Yahoo and hey last nine games now he's back up to over 30 minutes of contests over 9 points six rebounds almost three dimes almost one and a half stocks while shooting 53% from the field and more than one trade per game I think Josh Hart is back to that role he had last year with the Nicks we know tibeto loves to give his guys big minutes so I think after a slow start heart could be a nice boring but reliable at especially if you need rebounds  you know this this also comes you know RJ Barrett very quietly averaging 27 minutes a game over the past five games hasn't been shooting very well is kind of turned back into RJ Barrett while you have Josh Hart stepping up so yeah Hearts definitely someone who like you mentioned we've seen it before he's a nice start on a four game week for sure probably deserves to be on a roster Shannon someone we saw a play last night yeah and this goes in along the line of thinking the Bulls are eventually just gonna throw in the towel but Patrick Williams fourth year wingman for the Chicago Bulls number four overall pick in the 2020 draft we're starting to see kind of what life might look like for Patrick Williams if the Bulls move on from Zach LaVine and DeRozan as well over the past three games all starts for Patrick Williams he's averaging 33 minutes 15 points 4.3 rebounds one steal one block and 1.73 pointers made he's been solid for that team at you know again is guy who you know solid lately but up and down inconsistent production but he looked absolutely terrible in that blowout loss to the Celtics where the Celtics had to get into the tournament ugly Geo's shop blocked at The Rim multiple times couldn't get past Al Horford  but opportunity could be enormous when the Bulls finally give up on this roster yeah he's 30 35% roster right now on Yahoo he is more of you know more of a stash you know you could play him while while the Bulls are short-handed right now I think it's worth what do you like better to Sumo or Patrick Williams guys to Sumo or Williams  are you talking real life or I guess fantasy over the next month uh well over the next month maybe it's two weeks I should probably Patrick Williams I mean if you're asking me long-term like if Levine and DeRozan were to get traded personally I prefer to soon move  but I have different games you know just when we would definitely be a better points League player I can tell you that much at least yeah I think Pat Williams has more short-term upside slightly higher floor so I've leaned that way  okay we're going to my first long shot or my first my only long shot our first long shot which is Derek Rose I can't believe I'm saying this name what I know on 9% rostered Whiteley available started versus the Jazz the other night we got 14 points nine assistance for rebounds and 27 minutes when seeing at least 20 minutes a game this season 15 points and four assists per game they switched up their starting lineup to put him in the to make him a starter and they I mean they're they need an exorcism kind of like the kind of like the Pistons and the Wizards so Rosie's look fine the season every time I watch a jazz game or excuse me a Grizzlies game or see some highlights uh maybe you know deeper than that a little bit I  just Adam why not  Shannon without cheating how old do you think Derrick Rose's who  uh 33 35 actually thought it was older I was 36 I was yeah I thought it was trick question so I tried to go younger I say sorry he was 31 when he played with your Pistons  oh I forgot about that that did happen  it's kind of like how I got reminded DeAndre Jordan played for the Knicks I was like what yeah okay yeah go get your long shot Ken I'm repeating along shot from earlier because he still on roster and plane even better I love leeks maybe this is more of a deeper League pick but he is instant offense out off the bench for the funder great outside shooter helps with the floor spacing and I'll throw in here we don't really know what's going on with Josh giddey if you know what I'm saying get up get up get up so let's say I could open up a ton of playing time for Joe if giddy has some legal issues last seven games for Joe over 14 points over three and a half triples shooting 55% from the field his field goal percentage considering it's almost all three Z's shooting is amazing 90% from the line but doesn't get go to the line too often even got I had a three steel block a three block night the other night but he's averaging just under one block and one steal a game he ranks 48th in nine category League's per game over the last 14 days Isaiah Joe is a solid deeply at  I agree he's very good deeply God need those threes for sure  yeah my long shot of the week David Roddy Ford Memphis Grizzlies four percent rostered definitely more of a deeper League option for teen Plus  Rowdy Roddy Piper he came here to chew bubble gum and get Buckets and he's all out of bubble gum over the past three games he is averaging 14.7 points 4.7 rebounds and one no I'm sorry three three-pointers made per game taking six per game as well from downtown he started the most recent game for Memphis Memphis can be kind of playing around with their starting lineup especially at the small forward spot you've had Khan Target plugged in there Zaire Williams a bunch of different options and Rowdy could get a pro you know prolonged look at the small forward spot they did win against Utah in in Rowdy start I don't expect them to go out there and have huge production but you can get you some threes and get you some points and you know if you're in a 14 16 Team league and you're desperate he's going to be a streaming option especially on weeks where they have the Grizzlies have four games  get better Rowdy nickname  what it's not a Rottie nickname it's a Kenny Loft in junior nickname which is snack Randolph big body Rowdy is the other Nick I think they got you can you're always talking about the beef Brothers watching Washington start those two just for giggles just for I just wiggle wiggle oh  all right camera we're going to our drop segment right we have some drops questions I don't know yeah well Azure Thompson already came up  Jade Ivy she dropped territory  I think so yeah yeah  it's tough he was like he wasn't player to touch the floor for the Pistons last night I don't believe he entered the game until the second quarter against the Knicks I don't you know also killing Hayes had a great performance back in the starting lineup and playing alongside Cade I think Ivy is gonna be one of the scapegoats here it's gonna be hard for him Thompson I'm more confident we'll see the starting rotation starting lineup again mainly because I say livers is horrible and Thompson is actually showing some upside and has long term value for the Pistons but Ivy it's getting harder and harder by the day to to think to Envision him as a long-term piece with this team of Monty is locked in as coach for yeah multiple Seasons I apologize for suggesting DeAndre Hunter is a drop a few weeks ago but did not see the Johnson injury so I would say he's not a drop looking for the comments about other drops and we come to mind for you all you know I'm scrolling through some you know poor performing players with high roster for Saturday just right now  Isaiah Stewart 61% roster unbelievable is that is that necessary  no no you don't need to do that that's a drops question Andrew Wiggins is still 71% roster he had a big game the other day I get it but if you have big day was hollow points it was just points yeah foxy was yeah 10 team points League you know you don't have to do that Kevin herder 60% 66% roster I don't think we need to play that game on sleep monk is just straight up better than him its highest Jones is a guy we always get questions about um I it would if I don't have a monarchy of my rosters I would hate to drop them probably because I gave up like a seventh round pick for him  but he's but it and honestly it's not like he's gonna get more opportunity he's been playing terrible getting 30 plus minutes a night you know like  and a fast pace like I I don't see what can happen where Jones turns it around  no and any of those guys that Alex mentioned in that 60% range in 10 team leads I think you're better off streaming a player you know whoever the hot pick up is whoever is for games that weak 12 team and deeper that's another story most of those players are still gonna have some value outside of Kevin heard in Isaiah Stewart please  for the love of everything just fine a different option well Shannon prepared for his special appearance in the old man rant section I have a fan question for Alex Alex Duncan Robinson  or Hawkes for the Miami Heat that's actually that's  that's a good question I I would lean what I lean actually Robinson I worry Robinson is mostly doing this because hero is out you could also make the argument that like Hawk has is doing a lot of this because hero is out yeah I think Hawk has is better  I would lean Hawk as um could be a what you need question right you need threes Robinson's obviously yeah you need your rebounds  right if you yes especially if you're in a category League that's the argument I need threes that go Robinson if you're like a points League or you're in a neutral environment in terms of value I think has like the guy  is it is a time for our Vivid Seats read before our Friday yes please tell us about our good friends a Vivid Seats I would love to uh let's see here I'd be of our

that is tonight yeah it's actually a pretty ho-hum slate there are some injuries to keep an eye on bangkero with the magic is a game time decision looks like he's leaning towards likely playing definitely check that before lineup's lock Booker with Phoenix Jamal Murray Aaron Gordon with Denver whimby for the Spurs Wendy's the big one that's the one I really want to keep a close eye on because it'd be interesting to see what the Spurs do do they go with a smaller lineup and maybe reinsert Devon vessel into the the starting lineup or do they have someone like Charles Bassey play minutes at the four  yeah it's it's gonna give a boost to basically everyone on that team Kelvin Johnson vessel so Han who's coming off that gigantic game that we mentioned earlier and all of those guys specially so high on and vicel 5600 on FanDuel for so high in versaille 65 Zach Collins who was mentioned earlier awesome very attractive salary for tonight's late I like all those guys and if Bassy somehow is named the starter of course he'll be a solid option as well yeah how about this Washington Orlando game it's a 237 and a half I kind of like Jalen Suggs after you put up 22 against the Wizards a couple nights ago  yeah this is a rematch um which to me those games are always interesting I think the team that lost generally has more of an advantage because they're they're game planning but we're also talking about the Washington Wizards here and this this game this game you know has earned the over-under excuse me 139 120 was the final score of the last game  yeah I mean Suggs I think sucks is a fine place got me steals upside Cole Anthony will fall to popped off for 25 6 and 5 I just don't think they have anybody the Wizards don't have anybody to really check anybody or Lando's back on right for the Wizards write all their defense is gone yeah yeah their defense isn't there um you know and on the wizard side I mean do you trust anybody on this team besides Daniel and Kyle kuzma and do you even really trust audio so  I mean I would I would think about who is mud just because he I think who's supposed to have a really really nice season this year like he has looked awesome I wish he was on a winning team because I think he would look great for them but that's that's what a ton of those only decent player on a horrible team points that someone's got to shoot and  he wouldn't be getting those shots I mean from a DFS standpoint as well like on FanDuel kuzma 7900 so he's under 8,000 dollars for tonight's late he's had some monster games I mean just looking at the past six outings three of those he's top 50 points 52 60 57 fantasy points he's had some gigantic games he's one of the only players on that roster if not the only one who's averaging well over 30 minutes for game most these other guys like Jones and pool Gafford who we all expected to break out you know one of the reasons why they're not breaking out is because they routinely play under 30 minutes in these games kuzma is the guy who still getting all the Run he can handle averaging even he is only at 31 minutes per game but very very productive best best season of his career by far averaging a career high 4.8 assist not doing anything on defense but you got to stay on brand if you're the coos how cheap is D Rose tonight on FanDuel he's getting ready again yeah under 5000 48 or 49 so both Derrick Rose and our boy rowdy rowdy Piper What's the the Rowdy body or whatever that is body Rowdy big body Rowdy the snack brother you know  either one 406 100 for variety and 48 or 49 for Derrick Rose so both of those guys are options as well I I am interested to see if Derek Rose maybe has the night off because it is the second day of a back-to-back but I think both are worthy of consideration if you're looking for value options  we all have that look on his face like can someone help me please someone  we have we have Orlando Washington we mentioned it with the highest over under but New Orleans San Antonio is not that far behind at 2:36 New Orleans expected to score the same amount of points as Orlando so I think that's worth looking into Zion is coming off a monster game the other night against the Joel embiid's late scratch 76ers and be an illness mccollum's return was that game are you looking anywhere on the Pelicans Shannon or you a little worried about the McCallum return cutting into guys usage rates  yeah with with mccallum's return I do worry a little bit about Ingram and McCallum looked great in his return as well you know 39 fantasy points and only 28 minutes you gotta assume those minutes will go up a little bit and game two like he mentioned Zion head a gigantic game Valentine's have a solid game as well but but Ingram you know 15 points for Rebound six assists only 38 33.8 fantasy points in 35 minutes you know he had seen a nice increase in usage and production with CJ out but Ingram's the guy I worry about more just because he  he thrives most when he has the ball in his hands more and when CJ mccollum's playing obviously that doesn't happen as much  we have a really low over on her two 17 and a half Toronto versus the Knicks when I mean when you see an over under that low chairman is that almost a complete stay away for you and less there's like just crazy injury value or something like that it's it's not completely I mean one because I think this team I think this game could blow past that over considerably I mean with the you had the next play last night they gave up you know that game was a 230 point total 112 to 118 win over the Pistons you gotta assume the Knicks are going to be somewhat tired they're traveling to write from New York to Toronto for that second half of a back-to-back so I you know I could go either way right it's either the both teams it's a slow pace game and both teams fall you know fall Dead Fall Fall flat and don't really explode but I I'm getting the hint that this game will be a little bit different than that I have liked it to go well past that over and as a result I like some of the next and Raptors I think Randall who is really picked up his play Lately he's back to back 50 e-plus Point fantasy outings Bronson just a gigantic game last night against the Pistons that that also after D'Angelo Russell and Brunson put up back-to-back monster performances against the Pistons I would say please target those those scoring point guards that play against Detroit moving forward if you want to get some some big performance is in your DFS lineups but you know I like I like the New York side with Randall and Brunson again tonight even though it is a second game of back-to-back and then Schroeder Anna nobe even siakam and Barnes those guys are for how productive they've been and what they're sealing is for an individual game they're they're prices their salaries on FanDuel are pretty discounted so I like any of them if you're just looking for that extra roster filler  buddy else you want to highlight or low light Shack and before we move on let's move on and wrap this up  well we are we are wrapping it up with old man rant we'll get to not from Ken  it's from you Shannon the Detroit Pistons just completed  the most worthless month of NBA basketball ever they redefined no not November  zero wins  for the month 16 straight losses this team is now two and 17 on the season  since the All-Star break last year for and 40 it was cute it was cute at that time you know last year yeah kids City now he was out with injury by by post All Star Break by zdanowicz was shut down Stewart was shut down so like oh great we get to see Ivy enduring get some extra run  get excited about the future once all the other piece is our healthy there is no future  there is no future Monty Williams highest paid coach in NBA history he is a worthless bum you know who his you know who his assistant coaches  Stephen Silas Rockets  so even if they decide to move on from Monty Williams in an unprecedented move after tossing him 70 or 80 million dollars they're gonna fall back to Steve and Silas as the interim coach know that's not gonna happen and in all of this this exercise  yeah anything man bring back SVG bring back dwane Casey  thing is better than what we have right now but it's worse it goes above Monty Williams  he's a nut he doesn't know what he's doing but above him Troy Weaver  just an absolute clown aren't tell him former former NBA player agent who somehow Works in a free agent in a NBA front office and guess who works underneath those two guys they're children their son running this team none of them know a damn thing Burn It to the Ground  it's at the point where we're going to be close to  trading Cade as the only option to do anything at all he was supposed to be the Savior number one overall pick get lucky one year with those Lotto balls this is a  historically  a proud franchise one of the better franchises in NBA history 7th most playoff wins in NBA history one of 17s with three or more NBA championships this hat my entire body plastered and piston swag I got Pistons sweatpants got it all this hats older than Alex I remember not  not an exaggeration this hat is older than Alex and it's from the mid-80s I remember Kelly troupe is mustache who I remember the bad boys I remember the going to work Pistons  John nowadays we have Pistons fans who are only a handful of years younger than Alex  who think this team is just always been garbage yeah he's always been the the drags of the NBA I was mocked in a in a neighborhood fantasy football text thread by some of my neighbors one of them one of whom is that Washington Wizards fan claiming the NBA needs to  meet today retract get rid of teams starting with the Pistons oh it's time to burn it down please I was a that was a nice concise Pistons red thank you Ryan says you forgot the r and otherwise genius genius genius rant can a real real depression is quiet so yeah that's true it's not it's it's beyond depression it's sadness on a whole another level all right guys did we miss pronounce any names today's episode  I don't think so there's a little rowdy rowdy confusion but you know it's we're talking about players four percent roster get double-digit roster before we pronounce your name  okay thank you everybody for joining us on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast I guess presented by Underdog Vivid Seats Ken take us out of here  well let's go back to Detroit and New York we're Pistons head coach Bonnie Williams said this about third last night's 118 112 Road loss to the Knicks quote I saw the fight and resiliency we can build on like to point out the Pistons with the first team to lose an entire full month in the last eight years be seeing more of Isaiah livers and Killian Hayes on the starting lineup hmm anyway attention passengers this three car fantasy Trainwreck has hit the end of the line
