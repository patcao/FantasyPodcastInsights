hey everybody Welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast  it is Thursday January 18th  and I am Dr a Steve Alexander that is Rick kamla  the Fantasy legend also known as the freak we got a lot to break down including big Pascal siakam trade  Dr intros are everything my brother everybody come on in here it's the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy and and Aunt FanDuel um and so we're excited about about that I'm excited to bring some news to you guys that you may or may not know if you follow at Dre you know this but Dre is going into the fs w a Hall of Fame this is enormous news it is way overdue and Doc is going in man um so have you talked to the first of all Doc congratulations man and we texted about this and put some stuff out on Twitter about this I'm super happy for you man how's this feel bro it feels good it feels good Rick I feel like you should be there with me you probably should have been in before me you know I was I was on a Legends  podcast yesterday with brewski and Dan best Breeze we were talking about it and  dude I mean we've we've said it before but you had a fantasy basketball show on television  like 10 years before the big boys were even talking about fantasy on television you know ESPN and and all that and it really was a inspiration in my career so um you know I put it out there on Twitter we got to get camel and the Hall of Fame but as far as how it feels it's pretty cool like you know I've had a kind of a tough year getting laid off at NBC and Lucy that family that I had for 20 years and all that um so this was a nice  a nice  good icing on a crappy cake for my year and you know  not being verified on Twitter losing that because Elon took it away and give it to everybody if they want to pay for it that was kind of painful but now it's like oh I don't care I'm in the Hall of Fame well doc I'm super happy for you man and you'll have this forever you know what I'm saying you're in and it's a huge deal those of us who've been in the fantasy industry you know would like to get that nod at some point and be appreciated for the body of work and I appreciate your kind words you know about me and and you know what I've done and get me into the hall and all that kind of stuff so I appreciate that man so let's give the folks out here people are already filing in Doc some Hall of Fame analysis all right from you and maybe eventually one day me I'm so like you said let's start with the Paschal sea and trade here and some of the Fallout let's go to the Toronto side first they played last night a Miami what was were they out kicking it until 5 a.m. in Toronto the night before Toronto is a very very fun city and ball players love the city of Toronto what was that how do you get destroyed by a shorthanded Toronto team but the big beneficiary here was Gary Trent Jr season 9 28 points get them off waivers right now if you can because he's been very weird this year and kind of Iced Out Schroeder's been more of their six-man special after the RJ Barrett and Emmanuel quickly trade but now shoot they need Gary Trent to take I think he was 10 of 13 last night and do this um and Doc one more thought to kind of launch you into this um we're all kind of looking at that Center spot right portal is heard Pascal Seahawks been traded like who can we bang here okay no one John came Porter Chris Boucher and Thaddeus Young it's a wasteland he uh Darko reactive is not going with anybody specifically here that is youngest  that is Young's really dark almost never been a good fantasy player even when he was starting to playing 30 minutes again what did we get doc 11 points seven rebounds to assist close to a block maybe a steal zero point eight three this guy's never been a good fantasy guy and he's still packed Manning minutes from these younger players I would love to Green like Chris Boucher but I can't I mean some of some of the thoughts that run through my head is why did Chris boucher's career have to be in Toronto I mean just wasted the whole thing he's 30 now  hey ship of sales he's not 30 are you kidding me is he 30 years old are you just making that up no I think he's 30 years old he might be he's pushing 31 bro look it up as you talk here you know I'm with that uh Jalen McDaniels gets two minutes for no Skeleton Crew yes why is he on the roster why are you always steam this guy throw him in the deal  oh my God Christmas yes 31 years old oh my God  yeah I would have said 27 legit I cannot believe he's 31 years old what is up with that wasted Tire career sitting behind me nurse  is John pay Porter good at basketball like he's Michael's brother I don't know she's got that going for him I mean that's the guy I picked him up in League I mean somebody has to play center for this team um and it looks like it's probably gonna be 50 year old Daddy's young know he's not really 50 but he's closed and you're calling Boucher by the way that was a good call man you got me with that one dude Gary Trent it was he not on the trade block two weeks ago like he still may be traded to your and my thing about these trades both of them in the has all these forwards stacked up on top of each other and then Toronto still needs bigs because now they all they have is guards like I think both of these teams are still probably looking to make another deal  um Toronto I mean we'll see we'll we'll see what what they have going on I think personally I think Indiana is good they got Bruce Brown out they got their guy Pascal siakam I guess buddy hield could be moved out of Indiana here doc expiring deal he could be traded before the deadline frankly I would recommend that um Indiana is a very well-built team by Kevin Pritchard they are Beyond deep guys they've got third unit guys the camp find the floor jarris Walker they dusted him off the other night he was out there making plays I think that was the blowout lost to Utah off memory serves um but they've got docs right they got they got all these guys Jackson I'm gonna say Jackson guy okay I want to see Isaiah Jackson doc all I'm asking for is half the game half the game 24 minutes he's going he's flirting with a double-double with two blocks a game in 24 minutes um so but but this has Ripple effects to a lot of guys in Indiana doc um Ben matheran but he healed will be topping I think this is horrible news for Obi topping right he was already kind of on that Rick Carlisle yo-yo you're in starting lineup you're off the bench and now see him his completely Bogard at his spot that's not good news for him I do think doc this is good news for Aaron Neese Smith um look he's already a Carlisle favorite they've already paid him frankly Ernie Smith one of my favorite role players in the league I love the motor I love the hustle I love the three indeed um he just kind of got an IT factor to him I'm into it okay but I think this is that this getting Bruce Brown is out is actually good news for a nice Smith I think he's going to be the starting three I don't know who they're starting to is going to be it could be neb hard it could be healed it could be math Arin and then one more thought I think this is bad news for math there and Doc because when you had Halle and you had Turner a lot of nights he could be that Robin he could be that second guy now siakam is definitely going to be the Robin and now you're trying to be the Alfred and I don't know like like I see him floating more with 15 than I do him flirting with 20 going forward here so your thoughts on the pace or side of this  well I think the key for me with niece Smith are the words you said he's a role player I'm not expecting big fantasy numbers I do think he'll be a big role player for a very good team that's trying to win right now obviously like they are not bringing Seahawk in as a rental they're going to sign him this is real he wants to play with Thai Halliburton I mean who doesn't want to play with tie Halliburton who can't play with that Albert speaking which is supposedly he's gonna play against the Kings tonight he was supposed to be out for almost another week so that's exciting I think it's bad news for Matthew and it's bad news for Obama and it's bad news for Jaylen Smith it's bad news for Isaiah Jackson all those guys um you know buddy hield has been rumored to be all but out of Indy all year he still hanging around he may be starting and shooting guard we don't know yet I'm hanging on the heel right now these Smith is probably worth a look I have bathroom on a couple teams I'm probably gonna hang on to him for a minute see what shakes out but man Rick Carlisle has a lot of toys to play with in the garage and he is not afraid to push all kinds of different buttons on any night okay it's not worried about hurting your feelings he does not care he wants to win and he's an OG that way we're the ogs Rick Camilla and

so doc let's move on here and talk about my new favorite player in the NBA his name is Gigi Jackson the second and it's really worthy and clunky I think we can just go GG at this point and everybody knows shout out to Gigi up in heaven my mom but we're talking about GG Jackson right here he plays basketball today people I'm stoked about this he has given me reason to watch the Memphis Grizzlies  Jamaica gave me a reason to watch the Memphis Grizzlies and then John Moran went back out and I done went from not having a reason to watch the Memphis Grizzlies and now I have a reason to watch the Memphis Grizzlies GG Jackson is he a thing I believe he is  last two games the MLK Day game against Golden State 23 points six boards one assist um two blocks two steals five threes what nine in the fantasy gold are you kidding me this is like we have struck gold here the New York Knicks the game before he hit him for 20 six and one two blocks no steals into threes my man has 13  elements of fantasy gold here with the threes the blocks to steals in two games okay check this out guys it's because you're like well it's a fluke it's a one hit wonder let's dig a Little Deeper here let's go to the G League okay he played six games in the G League  the Memphis hustle whatever the hell their name is six games document 198 and two one and one in the blacks and Steeles and one point five threes all right so we've got  like what in fantasy baseball doc all right I'm big on on your minor league track record your your foreign International track record right because you got a header come up he's got a few home runs and you know he sizzling and is it real like is this guy good like what you got to go to the back of the baseball card and if I see that this guy was a macho in the Minor's and cranking 28 homers 32 home runs 24 home runs 18 home runs all right this guy's a Basher boom I pick him up so that's why the G League stats matter here um he was the top player in high school they were saying on the on the TNT broadcast the other night and Doc I want to take you to my scouting lab here um I know a million dollar I know a million dollar stroke when I see a million dollar stroke okay when I saw Jordan Hawkins it was tough last year with UConn right but when I saw him in the preseason with New Orleans and even in bad shooting games that goes like that guy could shoot  that guy's a boring shooter right there that guy's got a million dollar stroke and watching GG play here in two games the Knick game and the dub game he's got a million dollar stroke the ball just feathers off his hand and pours into the rim man he's got great sized stocks six foot nine 200 and 215 pounds that's perfect power forward size in today's game I think he's a must pick up here doc talk to the people  I mean he was picked up so fast on MLK day that I didn't even get a chance at him in in my League's my buddy mark from explosions in the sky picked him up after I think it like half-time of that game on Monday because he was balling out he looked good and then his interview with the TNT guys after the next game was super fun and as as Yuri and I said in Tuesday's podcast he was just cute like just a good dude you know just a year a young 19 year old kid they can't really believe what's happening to him right now and I wish you was in a two-way player I wish you was full-time grids but look Steven Adams gone Desmond Bane Gone John Moran gone Marcus Smart gone guess what that means GG Allin  Vince Williams my guy those two guys should be rostered everywhere possible in every League imaginable right now  um so I agree with that here here's the thing and do you know this team's a lot of times they they have a guy in a two-way contract they're like um yeah okay boom and they they take them up to a standard contract and to do that you got to cut somebody and you got to make roster moves and all this kind of stuff but um I believe GG Jackson is going to get to the point where they're like yeah the Memphis hustle thing no no let's groom this guy and develop this guy um I'll tell you what if they do send him down for minor league stint with the hustle down there in Memphis I will be screaming about it here on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast just make his contract standard happens all the time you see so and so contract upgraded to a standard contract off the two-way happens all the time all right it's a perfect storm too because Memphis is not gonna make the playoffs like it's it's over Bain's gone for six weeks jobs gone it's over bringing in JJ's going to get shot down now two don't you think I'm very worried about Triple J and Yuri said Tuesday she traded him for Brook Lopez and she was fired up about it and I was like Triple J for Brooke Lopez just doesn't sound right it doesn't feel right  but in it is kind of right and she got and she got Brooke Wright Lopez well he's gonna be playing it out and Triple J I mean he's won oh my back it hurts okay go sit down for a month  exactly that kid on the head man that's a that's why  that's why GG's a thing  exactly what doc said like if they had Miranda if they we wouldn't be talking about this right now guys the Grizzlies are a Barren Wasteland of like top and talent but a turtle ground for Fantasy goodies doc I'll tell you right now um I want to see more minutes for Jacob Gilyard um their point guard man these got the most steals in the history of college basketball this guy's a little Muggsy Bogues out there man he's a great dime guy um not a great shooter and you know he's like a eight nine ten point per game guy if he got the minutes but I'm really curious to see because I thought he was gonna start that game the other day and they started Canard and they kind of went zyre Williams and they kind of went position so it's like this is a buzzkill um I had them in my lineup in the cam Dynasty and I just picked Gilyard back up because it's a light night tonight so Gilyard will be in my lineup tonight for the cam Dynasty and I'm hoping he goes back into the starting lineup I mean 28 minutes a game this guy's gonna flirt with a double-double and give you like one three and like two or three steals if he gets 28 minutes keep your eye on Gilyard he's not like pounce on them right now but just to give you an idea um you know these are the guys you need to be looking at because of the available playing time there and I got to give you dapp on Vince Williams doc I do last two games he's gone 24/7 and 4 three stocks three threes 17 8 and 8 three stocks won three um and and watching him more dock over the last week he's got some skills man he's got some dog to his game he's got some versatility to his game he died he rebounds he comes up with defensive plays that's a good find by you do well and the difference between Memphis  and Toronto is they both have these skeleton crews out there but in Memphis  Gilyard Santee old dama Vince Williams GG Jackson I keep one calling GG Allin the guy that all the crazy stuff on them on rocks stage like gross stuff but GG Jackson anyway the hell is GG Allin I'm a rock guy I've never heard of GG Allin what are we doing here look it up dude you'll be like whoa this dude's crazy DJ Alan was nuts  uh anyway in Memphis there is a lot of lot of gems you can mine like picking up Gilyard right now I don't think it's a bad idea and I like the fact you picked him up because he placed tonight but if he balls out tonight you're probably not going to cut it thank God because there's no one left to play in Memphis except triple  J and he's one who I heard my finger away from from being out for a while so um I like I I'm thinking about picking all these up and  if it feels weird right you don't really know that much about him but it's all about playing time and you fantasy heads know that it is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast with Rick Camilla and Hall of Famer Steve Alexander brought to you by Underdog and FanDuel let's shout out to John Tay Murray right here doc hit a buzzer beater last night against the magic my Orleans old magic Paula Bank Carroll hit a ballsy three ball to tie the game oh and and then to John Tim Murray had other ideas against Mark L folds good defense little pullback left elbow extended jumper WAP Place goes crazy magic bombed out um and he just gifted the Hawks on his way out of Atlanta  with that buzzer beating win last night 265 and 5 two steals one three 11 18 vintage to John Tay Murray line several teams have been mentioned for Murray in trade rooms doc the Knicks the Warriors the Lakers the Spurs um and so talk to me about Atlanta all right in Hawks fans are they bombed that the John literally the the Win horse in the woes there like he is gone he absolutely will be traded at the deadline okay so the sweepstakes are kind of on there are way on so how is it land a feeling about the John Terry Murray being moved after about 18 months ago you guys gave up four first round picks to get him in Atlanta  remember when the Braves got the Upton brothers and everybody was like updating here and everybody was fired up and then we're like BJ's not very good oh this this isn't really working out and Justin would give you a hot month and then go ice cold for the next six weeks and have like two homers so we're kind of in the same boat with Deontay and Trey exception is a really good player and I wouldn't be surprised if there's 10 other teams that you didn't mention who are calling the Hawks about the jaunty in fact every team league is probably calling the Hawks about the Shantae and I just look at it as it was a fail the experiment you know Trey got hounded so hard in the playoffs two years ago and we're like we need somebody else striking give the ball to when he's got double triple team the shot they seemed like a good fit seemed like it might work like let's see what happens putting two point guards together some nights at work some nights at didn't I think it really took away from what trade does trade needs the ball in his hands so I think getting the Jonathan out of Atlanta is going to be good for Trey it's gonna be good for Jaylen Johnson man I cannot wait for second half Jalen Johnson in the  Hawks this year I don't know that anybody's bumed about it and the thing is just jumping is a good enough name and a good enough player that they should be able to get one or two studs back for him so I that trade is very exciting should be very exciting for land I think it really opens up the door for Atlanta to get good um I think that's an incredibly optimistic way of looking at this in terms of the reality in Atlanta hitting a heater and being good at you know I doc I am I'm out  I'm out and you know that I have caca you know that I have taken my fam to State Farm and watch the Hawks and kind of low-key sort of kind of cheered for the Hawks  Trae young has turned me off on the hawk stock  Trey young is turned me off um he's not mentally tough uh we have problems with coaches I mean how long until there's a budding of a heads with Quin Snyder um at the end of games you know the stock gets to try young show and no matter what takes all kinds of bad shots doesn't share the rock doesn't utilize bogey or Deontay or Jalen it's just him coming downhill you know 10 eyes on him and you're going to live and die with like a 37% shot from the logo okay I mean that's that's cool he makes it every once in a while he's not even like knocked down um anyway so I I just I got a tray young issue man I don't think you can win big with him I don't Dock and so you know they tried to Johnson they bring this guy they get picks they do this I just as long as straight young as your top guy and as long as that top guy insists Trails more about his stats than he is about winning to me Doc because if you were more about winning you would sacrifice your adds to win that's what's sacrifice looks like look at Boston guys they're all down every one of them KP is down Tatum is down Brown is down white kind of not but Drew holidays that's a falling off the table Al Horford stats a following up the table is anybody complaining know they have the best record in the NBA that's what sacrifice looks like that's what winning looks like so I just random take right there doc but I I don't have hope or optimism for this Hawks team even if they like win a John Tate trade well it's funny that you call me out not call me out but give me props for my positive outlook on this because around my town that I live in I'm known as a tray hater because I'm still mad at the Hawks for for drafting Lucas and trading for trade like I'm still on never get over that as long as I live and I'm still not over and I'm still mad about it but you know at least with Trey and Jalen Jackson and and  a con Wu as a foundation you trade Deontay you get a couple of kind of stud guys back at least you know people who are laying a hawks fans will have something to cheer for all right doc I hope that works out for you guys but did John oh by the way doc I want to see him go to San Antonio right the year before he was traded to Atlanta he was an All-Star I think I don't have like 22 8 and 9 two steals per game like tilted the machine statistically had a bunch of triple doubles and I would like to see um obviously Troy Jones is not a starting point guard in this league right he's a back a good backup point guard he's not a starting point guard bring back to johnte um please for the love of God find some minutes and find a role for Kelvin Johnson and maybe they got to send Kelvin Johnson to Atlanta in a deal for John Tate Murray and I know Atlanta already has a lot of killed in Johnson's but killed in Johnson's on the vine off the Spurs bench right now oh I want to see John take go to San Antonio Dr you feel about that would you rather see him in La would rather see him with the Knicks he welcomed back in San Antonio I don't I don't know how that I don't know what what terms he left on he's kind of a cocky guy you know Deontay Johnson feels dejounte so I don't know if he's welcome back there but I mean to watch deshante and wimby play together would be super fun by the way last time wimby sat out which is happening tomorrow night on Friday he's not gonna play because he's still not playing him back to backs because Gregg Popovich hates me but the last time when we didn't play Kelvin had 26 and I think Trey Jones had 30  trade Jones has had 11 assists and nine assists I think is his last couple games no I had nine rebounds the one he had 11 like trade Jones is still  treading water and hanging around in fantasy circles out there but I kind of want to see desante go to the Lakers and play with LeBron and AD I think that would be an excellent place for him to be done take some of the pressure LeBron having the ball up it would solve the D'Angelo problem I'm sure D'Angelo would get moved in that deal I kind of want to see LeBron and AD play with the John Day um I like it I mean that would be that would really be I like if the John say went to the Knicks I'd be like all right you already got a lot of guys like that if the jaunty went to the Lakers I'd be like whoa that is a paradigm shifting move in the west um and yeah obviously if he goes to San Antonio it's more like selfish for us the fantasy freaks because he's not going to help San Antonio win right away and he's just gonna be getting really good stats on this downtrodden Team all right it's Rick Campbell its Hall of Famer Steve Alexander we are the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog and FanDuel and Doc let's talk Malcolm Brogden here the people need to go out and pick him up immediately okay I see you put in a note here 64% roster on Yahoo shame on you like he's not a guy you drop especially on this team with the ins and the outs and the prospect of maybe being traded to a team where he's going to get 24 to 30 minutes a game I I'm whole I've held him Doc in my League's and I would have recommended people to hold him okay anyway  so shaedon Sharpe now is out at least two weeks with a lower abdominal strain which has me thinking  if we ever see him again this year okay Brogdon started over scoot Henderson last night which I don't understand I think scoot needs to start every game at point guard right now for Portland  okay whatever he started Brockton he went 16 five and six one steal two threes six of 12 from the field and 30 minutes very typical Malcolm Brogden line um you know I mean just efficient we're getting some threes we get one stealing can you give you two steals he's not we'll give you one okay and he's gonna be good with the with the pra as well um and more good news from Malcolm Brogden uh sucks from a tie Ball but he left with an ankle last night did not return and he played 20 minutes last night that probably ensures minutes from Malcolm Brogden even more I think the people need to go up and get him right now Doc  well 61% uh well 64% rostered that means if you're in a competitive league he's probably gone if you're in a 10 Team league he might be sitting out there if you're in a league where people aren't really paying attention he might be out there but yeah Broadway should be rostered everywhere until he gets hurting and you know he's kind of famous for being injured and it's he he's been healthy here for a minute so little nervous about that but important for Portland man there the star power is gone they play late at night they're not on TV you don't really even know what's happening I'm DeAndre ayton plays for them does he though will we ever see DeAndre ayton again okay you hear about did you hear about the reason for his dnp last night doc  I heard that he was clear to play I put him in my lineup took him off the ill and then I heard  that he was catching a lot of heat for the decision I assume he just said he didn't he wasn't ready  no Deandre ayton  okay there was a snowstorm and icy and all this kind of stuff apparently the roads around his home or his driveway was two iced over for him to make the game  okay so doc this is up there was some of the weirdest dmps of all time and I've been playing fantasy so long and so it's dark I remember a Derrick Coleman dnp back in the 1990s okay with General soreness and they do that now which is lame but like back in the day that they didn't do that but they put General sort of not I just how about that like and Derrick Coleman was off injured and not in great shape but hell of a player there was another one doc Marcus can be one night in his hotel slept wrong on his back wrenched his back and we know Marcus Camby was a dnp waiting to happen throughout his career right he was Fool's Gold all the way when he played you're like oh my God 12 points 18 rebounds four blocks three steals oh my God Marcus Camby and then he'd missed the next two months right um and and this dnp Doc is up there with the greatest and weirdest emps of all time this is the DeAndre ayton the dog ate my homework excuse what about the time pass will Perez drove around 285 for three hours couldn't find the exit to the stadium and missed the start for the brave that was that was a pretty good one but yeah dude I mean I live in the woods you've been down my driveway if my driveway I said is over I'm not getting a car out of out of this driveway it's just not happening I'm not getting the trash can up to the street right without ice skates or golf cleats or something that will dig in but you know what I could do  I could hike my ass up the hill  I could get to the street I could go to my neighbor's house he's got a four-wheel drive truck and build look bro I'm in the Hall of Fame I got to be in Atlanta in two hours can you get me there and I would find a way to get there that that's me or I would I'd be said you hike he's an athlete right okay it's a little bit more cardio for you you hike maybe a mile maybe to a gas station or whatever maybe you have a convenience store but the corner of your little neighborhood bloop Uber they will come and get you and they will take you to the game how about this stock he is a Max Player NBA player how about you just call the team and go yo send somebody out to a meeting point and right to that spot and play the game yeah I am so out on DeAndre 8 and Doc and I regret ever being in on DeAndre ayton or oh my God ah snowstorms coming and I have the worst driveway in the history of driveways I'm gonna go stay at the Holiday Inn Express tonight thank you so that I made sure I don't miss this freaking basketball game that everyone in this city has been waiting for me to show up to for the last four weeks I know it's just it's it's crazy dude it's crazy uh speaking of that my boss at a 92.9 The Game in Atlanta when I did local radio in Atlanta Terry Fox the great Terry Fox doc he would he did what you just said right there and by the way this created quite the party in downtown Atlanta okay so he would bring all of the shows into a hotel that in Atlanta right so you know the weather's coming you know it's going to shut down the city and it doesn't last long but you got to prepare for it right so these like blizzard and stormy Atlanta situation she would put me up at the W and and all of us at the wet where were we do we were all at the bar at the wanking and we were not prepping on our show the next day okay so he doctors right there's and I'm I I can't wait to see what Antonio Daniels says about this today I'm giving go because we're gonna talk about this like you've got to try to find a way to make this basketball and I know they suck and all this kind of stuff this is your job man this is just a complete lack of responsibility in my opinion come on everybody sees the weather coming a mile away all right doc let's get into Jade and Ivy here and kind of pay off the conversations we've had a little bit this is what we've been talking about people okay last night against Ant-Man and the Wolves 324 and 6 over the last five games 23 5 and 6 one and one in the blocks and steals just like Wade okay you're saying wait yeah wait okay Donovan Mitchell and Dwayne Wade were the cops for me and others for Jayden and Ivy when he came out of college and Purdue and he was a Player of the Year candidate doc here it is this is what it is and will he have six times a game when Kate Cunningham returns I don't know about that but I do know this he is at least 17 and 5 with a propriate minutes at least  yeah and I'm saying it's sad that to Kate Cunningham going down for Jade and Ivy to finally be free but at least Jade and Ivy is back and he looks great like you said he's an elite scorer he's Elite athletes Elite basketball player he needs to be in their plane so yeah I I could not be happier about it and if you have Jaden Ivy or somebody dropped him and

five leg Underdog parlay last night all right had Jalen Duren goin' off he hit and I'll Sarah Thompson who suddenly is kind of relevant again I had him scoring like 8  points he did it I had Anthony Edwards balling out he hit I had Jade and Ivy balling out he hit all I need  is a fourth quarter Bucket from all right second half of the fourth quarterback from Alec Burks burst got hot bang a couple shots I'm sitting here watching this I'm like I need two points two points  and he hits a three right I'm like there it is and they're like blow the whistle wave it off somebody got out bohem back down of its got hit in the face as Ivy was shooting it they waive off the three give the Pistons ball next possession now it works fouled shooting  review it  overruled take his free throws away  and then he gets pulled out of game and I lose by by a point just a bust is the just an underdog buzzkill but it was still fun it kept me in the game I lost a dollar who cares um yeah why a dollar that that's a that's a sad bad beat story right there though I mean you just needed two points from Alec Burks um I started him last night in the cam Dynasty and I looked at the line like in the first half I wasn't watching Minnesota to try that other games on um it's Minnesota Detroit and and I like I'm so and I'm checking the scoreboard in a second half and it's just stuck on 12 points like the whole game it was frustrating but clearly not as frustrating what you just dealt with right there um another payoff here ociana Obi is who we thought he was they are who we thought they were Dennis green stuff right oh John and Obey is officially back the Knicks are seven and two in the nine games though Gianna and Obi by the way  he's going 15 and 1  standard it's what you expect um 541.89 he's almost a 5490 guy and for me it's all about me the return of the defense right that's why we like Gogi on and Obi in Toronto half of a block per game in New York one block per game in Toronto one steal per game in New York 1.3 steals per game and I think that number is going to go up a little bit here doc so um just to pay that off and then one more thing here before we go to the to the people and start answering their questions I want to make a point here about Jordan Hawkins of the New Orleans Pelicans I think you should be picked up immediately um Hawkins won their game at Saturday me on Saturday at Dallas won the game this was the second of a brutal back to back there rested Zion and CJ and bi and Hawkins is like cool back in the rotation wow wow wow wow 34 points career high six threes okay and I talked to a little birdie who told me that because of that game now the Pelicans don't have a chance don't have a choice and Willie Green doesn't have a choice and not and Jordan Hawkins because he was bawling when guys were hurt and then got you know Trey Murphy and Jose Alvarado they came back and Jordan Hawkins went to the bench um and so I've been told that that's not going to be the case anymore that literally his shooting is so good that they can't keep them off the floor so over the last three games and you're not gonna find that like that's that's proprietary Intel right there okay so use it and um and and go here and pick up Jordan Hawkins um last three games his minutes have gone 37 21 24 and all he needs is have to game guys he has 13 threes over those three games four steals over those three games and his points have gone 34 at 9:21 he's an elite shooter we talked about guys with the million dollar stroke this guy clearly has that and so I think he is a must add off the waiver wire doc where you have a Jordan Hawkins AKA Hawk  well I'll tell you what he played two minutes against Denver  four games ago  and then he played 37 minutes that day that New Orleans rested everybody Ingram  McCallum Zion all out he balled out in the 37 minutes then he played 20 21 minutes against Dallas had nine points then he played 24 minutes last night against Charlotte played well that was also kind of a blowout so when when he had that big game with all the big big three out I wrote about it and I was like there's no need to go pick hawk Hawkins up um but I will tell you this having here sat and talked to you right now  talking about your little birdie I mean obviously you know something um somebody in connected to the league or connected to the Pelicans has told you something you're an OG Your Fantasy legend if you're saying that he's gonna replace these guys in the rotation I believe it and I'm with you he's 4% roster in Yahoo which means he's probably 2% at ESPN like he's available everywhere I think you guys probably run out and pick up Jordan Hawkins right now because I have a feeling this is the start of a hot streak especially giving that he that too many game is now three games in the rearview mirror and he's had three in a row where he's been seeing meaningful minutes and Rick before we go to the people  can we talk about on Sarah real quick Sarah Thompson  you're on mute  so Sarah  his last three games four points 8 boards 14 points 8 boards 7 points 9 boards 22 minutes and 27 minutes in his last two games  he somehow still rostered in 44% of Yahoo leagues  you know Yuri and I were talking on Tuesday she's like no I can't I'm trying to win my fantasy league I can't have a Sarah Thompson anchoring the thing down I can't afford to roster him as a luxury stash because Detroit's never going to turn him loose  the 22 and 27 minutes are a little bit encouraging but we got to remember Cades not back yet like  would you pick up on stereotypes and on a fly right now or are you focused more I mean you've rather roll with Jacob Gilyard I said no I don't know about that I would rather Rock a Malcolm Brogden or a Jordan Hawkins I would rather go that route do you know I am obsessed with threes and defense I'm obsessed and also tomson brings the D he brings no threes that's a problem I I usually  I almost always don't do business with wings who don't Bang three so Ben Simmons Jimmy Butler guys like that they're just not on my list they don't hit threes they're dead to me um and so that's just that's just a rule that I have because I'm going to have bigs that don't hit threes for me okay that's fine but I can't have wings that don't hit threes for me I feel like I'm gonna rears at that point all right I'm cool with that I I just think  this is a doctor a  walk do not run to the waiver wire and just keep an eye on a Sarah Thompson in case this becomes a trend  that's all I'm saying um you were talking about who did you cite a minute ago that was talking about Oscar  oh Yuri I like Yuri's analysis on that a lot because I agree with Yuri I really questioned whether they're going to turn him loose um this year and I love all star Thompson I think you should be playing 30 minutes a game but Monty Williams says other ideas so do you want to you want to go here and pull up some comments so let's get into this man there's James Chan  gotta offer Jimmy Butler for my JJ Jared Jackson Jr  well this is a pick your poison right here I Jimmy Butler with the Miss games drives me crazy doc but jjj's probably gonna get shot down um  I if this was a dynasty it's a hell no because Jimmy's like mid-30s but I would do this in a redraft the doc because look Miami's going to be um in a very competitive spot down the stretch right they're going to try to be get to that four spot so they have home court advantage in the first round and you know there's only like a two-game separation from four to seven so trying to stand out of the plant tournament so Miami is going to be going for it and playing down the stretches long as he's healthy I would do that I would bang that um I would trade Jaron Jackson Jr for whatever I can get right now but I probably would not be targeting Jimmy Butler I mean like having wimby and watching him miss one game every single week is killing me haven't Jimmy Butler he missed what 11 or 12 in a row and finally came back and played through a toe injury that tows probably still jacked up he's gonna he's gonna miss a game a week  I mean I'm all for moving JJJ right now I think it's a good idea but I want to do it for some one else  um let's find another one here  Rozier and cam Johnson for saieko yeah let's put that up there  no manila's Most Wanted  to know  would you trade Terry River here in Camp Johnson to get Seahawk that's once tough this one's tough it does I like to bring this back to see Aquaman a point that I forgot that I want to make I think saieko means a 22 right now I think that may go up to 24 but Shaka will really make some special to me is the assist right the the pra combination and I see the assist coming down for him with Indiana they're very like diverse with who handles the ball up in Toronto and run a lot of offense through Pascal or they did and we know that it's the Haley show in Indiana so pasco's probably going to drop down to a three assists per game guy I don't you know last year he was historic I think he was six and a half a sis a game or whatever it was that's gonna dry up guys that is not going to be the case here in Indiana so  I don't know roses shut down candidate and Charlotte candidate um but if he's traded his numbers are coming down because like it's he's Uncharted of course he's gonna take a million shots he goes traded you know to a good team he's going to be a role player and not one of the main players so there's a lot of downside there with Rozier um you know cam Johnson gonna be I'm not a big cam Johnson guy it's three he's still bring defense to the table he's got a lot of miles to feed to compete with and Brooklyn I kind of don't like either side of this trade I don't know what to tell you man um I guess I would turn Rosier and Camden to see Occam I guess I would do that doc but we're yeah with that I would do it  like you said Rosie was too much of a shutdown can it in Charlotte camps just cam see how come it see how come is gonna show up in Indy with the best attitude and the biggest smile on his face he's gonna get paid he's gonna play with Ty  he's gonna like Rick Carlisle I just I think see how come I think the siakam arrow is pointing up rather than down and yeah he's not gonna have the ball in his hands as much as he did but I think that's that's okay Neil queue once to know this is this is gonna hurt your head Rick would you trade lamelo ball and Alpine Shen goon for yolk  um he says punching free throws points and threes  you can't do that Neil Q you can't wait oh my God I'm in the Twilight Zone Neil Q we play Fantasy Basketball to win to win money to win bragging rights just to feel good about yourself that you got the win in your league okay um when we can't I I could understand punting like okay I got I got a bunch of Smalls right I'm gonna punt um field goal percentage because you know I just got too many Smalls they're gonna dry okay I'm pointing like I understand punting one category I can tell you right now two categories that you cannot punch our points in threes okay doc we gotta go old school five cat Okay um this is what when when I came up with fantasy basketball back in the day it was not a cat it was not nine cat it was five cat Okay points rebounds assists block steals very simple that's all that was in the newspaper because that's all that was in the newspaper we didn't know how many threes guys were hitting okay um and so all right that's five cat okay so you could punch  points in five cap and I do still like the five cat because it's old school it's almost like fantasy football without PPR I love PPR but okay like in one League let's go old school and just yards and touchdowns right Just for kicks um But but so you could go you could punt points I want a championship in League freak doing this a while ago um funny story doc so I punched points and picked up guys like Rondo do I not I had Dwight Howard picked up a guy like Kendrick Perkins um won the league so you when you put points you're going for blocks rebounds me blocks steals rebounds and assists a guy like Jason Kidd got like dick Kim been tumble they were big for that right if you got Jason Kidd you were in it right put points in your good with those other four categories it was a proven strategy doc there was do you remember when Joey Crawford through Tim Duncan out of the game for laughing do you remember that yes we all do right I want to Fantasy Championship because of that don't was on the other team he had like two blocks in the first half it all came down to blocks and I picked up Kendrick Perkins for a game against Orlando and Dwight Howard Kurt gave me three blocks stock  gave me three blocks and one me that Championship off the waiver wire punching points and winning the chip that way but if Tim Duncan had played that whole game he would have had more blocks and I would have lost Joey I literally if I see Joey Crawford I'm going to thank him for that fantasy Championship um doc I know like a son a little story right there hope the people appreciate it um but you can't punch these three categories real cute meal Hugh says he did it last year and it worked out he won but I mean trying to do that twice in a row would be very very difficult to do so I'm kind of with you putting putting one category I get it pointing to okay once you get three categories and one of them's points like that's that's difficult to overcome so the fact you did it last year Neil good job but I don't know as far as this trade goes I would trade lamelo and shengwen for yogic is going to play every night lamelo if Terry Rose here's a shut down candidate so little mellow I love Alpine good enough so  but you know to get yolk on your team you gotta give up a lot  I do it  I struggle with this man I mean  lamelo and Shen are putting up nutty stat line just juicing nutty delicious stat line so I'm giving a both of those guys  I feel like it's giving up too much doc I I do I mean you could just phenomenal but he's not as good as you was last year the efficiency is down the a sister down the defense is down a little bit um I don't know man I don't know depends on your team build depends on who else you already have yeah I mean if you've got just a Beyond loaded team where you actually need to make a move like this to consolidate because you're always like not starting studs okay maybe you do the consolidation trade but you know if if you're not an illegal like that I would I would sit tight I understand what you're saying about lamellas a shutdown candidate but  I I kind of disagree with that doc because of a couple of things Steve Clifford is their head coach Steve Clifford is an old school go for it head coach um and also he's missed so many damn games like why shut him down you know what I'm saying he's already missed a zillion games play him if for nothing else your home fans don't they matter doc don't the fans matter don't your fans and your Arena matter we're just gonna show we're gonna Rob our fan base of lamelo ball of the last month of the Season what well man his ankles are made of Pringles dude so I mean if he's out there running around Eagles are amazing dude Anything could happen if he's out there running around okay I'm gonna put up a very easy question in my opinion  and then one that's not as easy you ready and this is from your favorite guy blank Scott Foster ah you want Jimmy Butler or Derek white on your roster for the rest of the season for me that is a 100% Derek White  answer  100%  no my God this one I let me I I know Derek White's numbers probably not the top of my head but let me just take a quick look here let me give you the most educated response that possibly can here whether you like 15 5 and 5 one and one okay we're at 16 four and five one point one point one one point one two point six threes ah 4741.90 God bless that's a stat line man I can't believe I'm about to tell somebody I would rather have Derek white for the second half of a season then Jimmy Butler Derek don't play every day but I'd rather have white than Jimmy Butler doc just the just and Jimmy Butler's a great steal guy right but he's not one point one blocks per game and you what is Jimmy Butler point eight threes I don't even know what it is I'm Giving Up on Jimmy with the three ball but 2.63 per game is is nearing Elite status for Derek white so ironically Doc and I can't believe I'm saying this but I would do that Jimmy Butler right now is at 0.4 oh my God all right this is a no-brainer he said 0.4 I told you that one steals I'm sorry I'm rolling here I didn't hear it oh and I nailed it I literally nailed it Point 83 from Jimmy Butler that was a random out of my butt gas and I got point eight threes that boy yeah I was  just saying I'd rather have Derek white every day of the week I I just don't trust Jimmy Butler I don't I hate when guys miss games and he's gonna miss I mean already missed a ton he's already missed as many games for the season as we thought he would from the entire season and we're only we're only halfway there so he's gonna play he's gonna miss one game a week they're White's gonna play every day like to me that that's just that's a no-brainer Lester says who am I picking up off the waiver wire I desperately need a big man  and I'm interested to see what you're taking is on this because I know Xavier Tillman is hit or miss with santiel dom out there when the cards Junior played very well last night against the Hawks Mason Plumlee started  over what's his face  yeah yeah she started over Zubaz hurt but the other oh Alex Lin I think Daniel theis I think Daniel Tiger's so Mason Plumlee is back in play and then there's Bagley who got moved I don't eat where did Bagley get moved to Washington Siberia he got Siberia I blocked Marvin Bagley out of my brain I don't even know where he is who he played for Fantasy Basketball podcast who are you picking up out of this group or somebody else I'm picking up Mason Plumlee oh GG Jackson yeah I mean if he's out there I'd go get GiGi but he's talking about a big right um and Gigi's PF eligible he is not Center eligible uh which I think is appropriate by the way fan tracks thank you for adding PG to Austin Reeves thank you I really really appreciate that he's now pgsg and SF that was very very helpful for me filling up my lineup last night thank you um all right so back to our story here Mason Plumlee guys Mason Plumlee is a solid fantasy player okay the other night he had like 13 points five rebounds like three assists three blocks very very good field goal shooting might have made all of his field goals I think he's not a good free throw shooter he doesn't give you threes um it but Doc is I he played 20 minutes the other night he is going to flirt with double-doubles with like like here's a here's a plumblee line nine nine and three two blocks one steal for of six from the field okay  and I know I'm going to get that guys zubats in this breaks my heart I just traded for zubats in the cam Dynasty and I picked up Mason Plumlee who will now be in his place but not as good but I like made some plumblee Doc I do and Lou trust him already I saw in that game the other night Harden and plumblee vibing in the pick-and-roll with the roles and the lobster the rim and put back jams by me some plumblee he's healthy and I think he's the guy out of that group uh every time I think about Mason Plumlee whenever I hear his name I just this a five assists just kind of pops up because I feel like a couple years ago every game he played he had five assists like he's a good passer really good pastor and he's a good rebounder and he holds it down in the middle I kind of I like that too I'm I'm going to agree with you we're going back to bleep Scott Foster  good question Mikhail Bridges or Jalen Williams who'd you rather  and probably probably McHale and I need to check the three ball line for Jalen Williams Because I know he's such a slasher I love Jalen Williams I do who would I rather have  oh I president future that may still be a mikal Bridges um yeah we're at one point four threes for Jalen Williams that that's a pretty easy McKell bridges for me.com how about you  um I think mikal Bridges  is probably the right answer but I'm a Jalen Williams guy  so I'm gonna say Jalen but I think fantasy only looking at the numbers which is what you should be looking at and not not like me it's it's mikal Bridges I think it's a better fantasy player but right now anyway but I like Jalen Williams um I don't have another one pulled up here let's see if we got anything else  we're well we're in an hour Rick we got to go that's it we're shutting it down yeah just lastly here Neil Q says lamelo badly hurts my field goal and turnovers in my build though um is that is that 20 something for an ocular for setting a lot I don't know Neil Q on messing around with you um I get that  man I just Shen goon is yokich light you know what I'm saying he doesn't do yolk but he's joking it's light I call him diet yolk itch and lamelo hi  I'm not comfortable with that trade even with that last little note there from from Neil doc anything else you want to tell the people about before we bid them a dude us click like click subscribe  I'll see you next Tuesday with another special guest I think it's rough my old cohort from NBC and then Rick and I'll be back here on Thursday I think we got you and I are not involved but there's a NBA podcast every day of the week on this channel somebody in here was complaining that we only talked fantasy for about half the show it's a basketball show man I mean we're gonna talk about DeAndre ayton not getting out of his driveway for 20 minutes if we feel like we need to but we'll also hit the fantasy goodies we'll do everything else we need to do I'll keep blowing the the introductions and all because it's fun  Rick anything you got  oh yeah I mean we were here for feedback and all that kind of stuff but if you think that the ogs aren't talking in a fantasy basketball on the road to wire fantasy basketball podcast I would very respectfully and very friendly disagree with that okay well we appreciate all of you for watching us and giving the comments and hopefully we're hoping you well when your league so for Steve Alexander the Hall of Famer AKA Dre I am Rick Campbell we'll see you next time on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast be well everybody
