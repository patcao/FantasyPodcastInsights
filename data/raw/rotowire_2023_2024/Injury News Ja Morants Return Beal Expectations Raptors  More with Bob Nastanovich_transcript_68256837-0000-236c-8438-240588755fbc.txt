hey everybody I am Steve Alexander Dr a this is the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast sponsored by Underdog fantasy  I'm doc that's Bob the stanovich of pavement all around good guy fantasy Hoops head and  one of my buddies he's absolutely man and I've never been on an award-winning podcast but you are now and we're gonna talk about basketball and Brokers tip records right after this  all right Bob here we are thanks for coming on  thanks for coming on it's been a while  tell me the first of all I'm gonna tell the people you were in a in a band called Pavements so I'm technically for a few more months  the two I will be forever Steve but yet I'm a forever associated with pavement  and pavement for your listeners purposes actually has some pretty sick  fantasy sports fans in general especially sort of the main guy that wrote all the songs he's not only hardcore but I would consider him like a proper fantasy champion  and I think he sees one more somebody leagues yeah you know people call me a fantasy expert but  I consider Malcolm is to be more of a fantasy expert than myself because yeah I do it for my job but I mean that dude wins every league and I have a question for you he's lucky he is lucky did he show up for our draft in the rock and roll League this year no he did not in fact I didn't either last year and I just looked at the draft results which  obviously he's been a desperate season for my team you know you know kind of your classic story of like bad pics and injury riddles but nobody was not there he did not but last year I wasn't a part of it and I I lost in the finals so  you know really it's the kind of year where Auto picking didn't really hurt you that badly well and I have a feeling he's probably set his cue but it's funny because Brian Rosen we're still and I were talking yesterday and he goes dude how was Malcolm is not even at our draft and his team is like running away with our rock and roll leak so Malcolm's is easily in first I was in second I got I beat you like three weeks ago and then I got you welcome I got smoke last week and or the week before last and I got beat again the following week on that two game week with the in season tournament kind of kind of took away some of the momentum I had going when he only played one game that week that kind of Killed Me by dude that rock and rolly we've been doing that for probably 15 16 years that's a good League that there's  I mean people in that there's no money involved everybody's just doesn't For the Love of the Game but they're just all about it it's all about the honor it's all about the classic the I mean really if you look at um now listen to pick he got Terry Rozier in the 9th round I mean you know so  sometimes it works out I mean yeah he had the number one pick so he yeah he did the one he got Yo good and then he got Kyrie on the way back which it's a great it's sort of you know whatever he's got a Target on his back  you will take him down in fact like right now you know my my whole team's gonna kick into high gear  in 2024 because I  guess we'll get into it but I'm expecting a healthy bam who I just  sort of an ill-advised manner I traded dome for bam  really what it was is when you know your team's bad and you sort of you lean towards being  you sort of throw your hands in the air and and you realize you're just gonna like have a lot of two two and seven and three and six weeks you decided you decide to leave build a very cool team  and I watched a game or Doma was Mike up and I didn't like the way he was bossing around his fellow King's  and  so I immediately traded him for bam and I had been watching the heat a lot and they're very fun watch a lot of lovable guys including of course  a guy yeah I mean he's basically in the Rookie of the Year conversation I mean he's he'd be a big number from an odds perspective but really what's amazing about him is a rookie is he's kind of reminds me  a lot of Malcolm brogden's rookie season and that  he's every bit very much a man he's not a rookie and eat many plays forth quarter crunch time he's just he's basically become an incredibly valuable piece on a very deep and good team  and he delivers almost every night so he's been a surprise  so I watched them a lot and I thought I didn't realize that Bam's hip contusion was going to develop and I must be at one heck of a bruise I mean he might not play until next year  yeah out and definitely that that's just bad  that's kind of scary since you traded dumbass I mean I expected to be out for three games yeah I thought so too so anyways bummer but  you know  he was talking about building a fun team when when all hope is lost that's sort of the philosophy I've taken in fantasy Hoops for the last five years I just want the most fun team that I can have out on the court I know that I've not I mean I just have all I try to always have all the fun guys and I don't even I you know if I win I win if I if I lose I lose but at least I'm gonna have a hell of a lot of fun watching my guys out there on the court yeah no same on my team is just like guys that I that I just kind of think are awesome to watch and and seemed like that they're you know thoroughly cool I mean and you know keep in mind this is what the biggest mistake I made in the draft is I was unaware and I should have asked you because you're actually an active  commissioner who actually pays attention because a lot of Commissioners are like don't I mean they log in once a month  but I didn't realize when I took jaw I thought he would be IRL hmm and then when I found out the day after the draft that he was just the Big O for out I couldn't do anything with him  I couldn't really dumped him and he's my local Superstar I live two hours away and I go to a handful of Grizzlies games a year and one thing about the Grizzlies being  Dreadful and just you couldn't really handpicked worse injuries for the Grizzlies in that  Steven Adams was really playing incredibly well when he got hurt I mean I've got a buddy who's just a sick Grizzly fan and we thought that atoms at that point related to be the team's MVP even with jaw and beIN on the team so he went and then I was at the game where Brandon Clark heard himself and there's no time table for his return it's been it's an endless Achilles that's an incredibly athletic player he's a pain to play against and  the loss of those two Giants and then of course sitting around having to wait for jaw has been a bit of a disaster and don't forget Marcus Smart Joshua smart will come back I think really I think the key of that team I don't I wouldn't rule them entirely out of the bottom end of the playoffs  and that I can see them winning like 10 out of 15 or 15 out of 20  if smart and Jog it along  I think it will  I think they will I mean I think just like  I mean I think of like the ultimate teammate for a guy like Jaw I think of like Russell Westbrook you know  I you know who knows I mean obviously I mean he went to Murray State which is 20 miles up the road  you know it's been  it's almost been a personal blow all the chaos that's going on with job because I you know one of my best friends is just really an over the top almost kind of a delightful way like a child like Jaw family like has his rookie Jersey has tons of so like when John got all that trouble it was like truly heartbreaking you know for my buddy Josh I mean so  we'll hope for the best but as you know and there's so many kind of blood curdling  news reports about  you know NBA veterans who are in media now like worrying for his life and like you know suicide watches and stuff like that anyways it starts a game before we thought we thought that he was going to start up here in Atlanta  but because of the play in tournament and the rules I guess it they're gonna play he's first game against the Pelicans I think on the 21st but  we'll see what nice we'll see what happens but yeah I expect my team my fantasy team which system 12th of 12th of 12  to sort of Roar in the 24th the  like the Memphis Grizzly so expect some shocking turnarounds well I'll tell you what why were talking about Memphis  people worry about Jared Jackson Jr getting off to slow start this season and his his fantasy ranking has been kind of low December 1st he had a four point four point game with 5000 14 minutes but since that game he scored 37 24 21 41 points last night six triples um he's blocking he's stealing he starting to look like Jared Jackson Jr again just in time for John to come back and I kind of think when John does come back it's gonna open up lanes for Jaron Jackson Jr and Desmond Bane to not have to work so hard for everything they get because those guys those two guys are carrying that team on their back right now and it's that's not easy easy thing to do especially if you weren't ready to do that coming into the season  people are worried about him but I think when John comes back he's going to clear you know a lot of lanes for Jaron Jackson Jr and Desmond Bane to not have to work so hard for everything to get and carry that team on their back like they have been yeah I mean they could be good if they're anywhere close to healthy not obviously they're not going to get back those two big pieces  Adams and Clark but there's enough there I think the I think they'll trade  I think that they will trade counard I mean Canard has you know value to a lot of teams that are definitely in the playoffs so I've heard that rumor for a few months and  really one trade I'm excited about the love to see happen as of you know I'm a Hawks fan and  I've been following them very closely this year and been to a couple of games and  they I mean they're not right and I hate to say it I went to UVA  and he's currently got a minor injuries that DeAndre Hunters continues to be a source of frustration and  I feel like he would benefit from being dealt and then I've heard  them wanting to get to see Occam who I love and he's on my team and you know the Raptors  are kind of are struggling more than I thought they'd be  and I it would be wonderful I could see Occam being a fantastic fit on the Hawks kind of like exactly one thing that they need so  yeah what are your thoughts on that I mean that would be that would be amazing now I know you and Stephen went to University of Virginia and as we're DeAndre Hunter Wayne DeAndre Hunter has been a  source of frustration for Hawks fans worldwide since he came on board he looked really good there for about a three game stretch early in the season I thought we had turned the corner the whole city Bay thing him being in the middle of it was making it weird he's good he can be good I mean about and I saw one game where they scored 86 in the first half of salt live against the Pacers which was the franchise record and they had I think it was 83 86/73 at halftime yeah and the Pacers scored 87 in the second half 85 so and whatever it was 157 152 in the end and bogie did the same thing that he did last last night he just  he just went on some sort of barrage of Threes but that's you know that's gonna happen twice a month you know and they still didn't win last night I mean you've got one guy  just completely going off and they've lost both games lost both games were boogies gone nuts they've lost both games yeah Bowie hit 103's last night scored 40 points but they don't they lose with a healthy young a healthy Murray and Boogie going for 40 they lost I mean that that's just that's well Trey got ejected I think and then the third quarter he got a checked it and then  the whole tray does jaunty thing  I mean  they they never seemed to both ball out on the same night they do yes the other don't feel like people love playing with Trey yes I'm not doing it yeah I'm not saying trays trace the problem or the answer but the dejounte tray thing is not really working out and I'm with you dude they could add Pascal Sioux into that team  and then we get just  shoot his name is Jalen Johnson yeah I'm not a fan but you don't like Jalen  I mean the skills are there but  I just said yeah at this point I mean I think he can't he can be great the raw potentials there I think they should definitely keep him  and  he's the kind of guy that you watch him play to do worry about his hell  just the way he plays  I think he's I think he's he'll be he'll be a very good NBA player  yeah I think why am I struggling he's a no D guy at a team with no D guys I mean there's not a whole lot of D going on  well deante plays Steve the shout a place to see so we do so yeah basically you know DeAndre went to  the most successful defensive basketball program programs of the last of my lifetime I mean  and almost disturbingly so like you know  college basketball lead us particularly those that played for Duke like to to equate watching Virginia basketball to watching paint dry  you know perhaps because we beat them you know 61 to 52 to often but I mean I can't yeah DeAndre Hunter I mean you obviously one of the reasons why he was an attractive threat pick and the middle of the first round was for d  I don't know I just think he clearly needs a change of scenery and then he just might not ever be anything but but a  NBA ship that keeps getting new moved because the tools are there  but he just not he doesn't seem to perform well at least for the Hawks and more disconcertingly the current current edition of the Hawks  well I'm going to go ahead and disagree with you I think Jalen Johnson is going to be a monster I'm really sad he got hurt I feel like he was just getting ready to turn it on all though getting him out of the way did clear up the city Bay the DeAndre Hunter thing that I'm with you let's let's try to move on her and get us see how come in here that would be that would be incredible I'm gonna do this Underdog add real quick and then we're gonna talk

Asian basketball game you know what I mean like he's gotten his his pet team that he's obsessed with his young boys I believe they're the Swiss Champions League entry you know yeah yeah it's I mean I saw the name like two months ago when I was  I think they played today actually I think it might be the first started know it's the last of the  of the first round part before the elimination of Champions League but yeah he's I saw a young boys like six weeks ago and I was like oh weird like that's kind of a strange name for a soccer team comprised of adults and and of course then you know 10 days later Guthrie's like young boys are my guys that's all right dude and and week after week he somehow gets lucky with them you know definitely look up Underdog fantasy.com thank you  because I'm sick Steve I'm very sick  I have been I've been fighting this  I've had the three-month cough and it result no not that kind of sick I'm Underdog fantasy sick now okay well I've been drinking  fighting off this cough and lost my voice full blown like two days ago it's barely back whoa I'm just yeah I suffer from coffee shop addiction I recommend it  I should probably look into that what cough drops should I be I mean my name Jam is the recolor sugar free ones that are herb and something else that like actually in screaming at yeah yeah  the sugar free ones are great you can get them anywhere and  but I was in pavement I'm really sort of even this morning that is strange to be  somebody who's most known for screaming and I thought that I could parlay that into  maybe some sort of thing where I could get a deal recla sponsorship like yeah I mean wouldn't it be like a dream come true to be like just screaming in a Ricola commercial than like you know because sometimes I have two to four recalls in my mouth during those concerts  and  alas I made several opportunities throughout the year to drum up my Adoration of Ricola and their products  and even had one guy that I didn't ask like sending recall of stuff  and unfortunately that dream did not come true but otherwise I'd be sending you a case of recollection products all right are you like a chipmunk like do you were you hiding were you talking the recluse just like they used to do with like tobacco packets like you know hidden between the cheek and gum you know and several would fly out you know  but yeah they're dark brown yeah they'd be in basically  like when you entered Europe in the 90s and you had to stash small packets of hashish and various parts of your mouth in order to get into certain countries I was doing the same thing in a very legal fashion with Ricola okay all right sorry surely you've carried illegal drugs in the countries and in your mouth and other aurify I if I went to other countries maybe but I try not to leave the lawn again at this you stay in the basement because that's your safety zone yeah or the attic you're in the Attic you're in the I mean I'm in my mom's attic and that's leading never signed on shirts Jersey  it was not signed but it is a luka Jersey  this is a  Dominique Wilkins he's badass uh this is one of my one of my most prized possessions in the entire oh yes see that before yes the autographed pavement yeah like he got hold that up for a second because I have to forge a lot of these guys signatures  well you got I that might be the best Mountain missing I've ever seen him in my life  standard Westie I mean that's that's  proper effort he doesn't even do an em anymore it's just like I mean he's whatever you wrote you wrote Cindy Anna yes those are particularly good mood that was in Atlanta when we saw each other in 2010  which I'd like to add was the best show that year  because you know to get a pep talk from Doctor a pregame it's all you need  I'll tell you that was that was one of the that was one of the best nights ever for me talk about like little kids  your buddy being like a little kid with this whole job ranting which reminds me like if your buddy is that devastated about John Moran like how to actual little kids feel about it like it it's pretty I mean a badly because you know this is a is one of those unique players  sort of in a you know Barry Sanders and Detroit kind of way years ago that  is so beloved in the city that that he you know positively affected the economy of them I mean  you know he's  he so hopefully who I mean I'm not giving up on him yeah I mean I don't think he can I mean he's been away from the game for so long he's got so much money like there's no reason for him to to be messing around with any of that stuff ya know it's crazy you from a logistics standpoint you you can't really nobody can really began to understand it but  I think it's just like I mean I'm not really sure if you have but you know it's I just think  it seems like his his uh his dad is part of the is part is an issue  so I mean that's you know that's personals there's some sort of personal  thing you know to kind of want to  be attracted to this sort of Thug vibe  I can't really figure it out but  it obviously is doing him no favors in any way shape or form in the main thing  is that I mean I was present for  his game when he scored 52 or 53 against the Spurs which is just a franchise record  and I've seen him several times he loves basketball you know so I think if you know a lot of guys like that we've seen it in NBA history  you take away their basketball and it's it's just equals bad news you know so hopefully I mean I don't think everybody routes for John in fact a lot of people I think  have a very negative impression of him but I think that hopefully I know Memphis and their fans will Embrace him and hopefully at least at the start he's 75% of what we're used to seeing and then you know over the course of a handful of games it doesn't game starts starts to really click because he is spectacular to watch  and it is a good team and a fun team and the coach you know Taylor Jenkins is excellent coach so hopefully you know  he'll move in the right direction we talked a lot about them though they are there  Bradley Beal  is Yes actually going to play basketball this evening yes he's gonna Dane to play  it'll be I think that that's can only bet he's fantastic  I was just thinking as I saw the Wizards score scroll through  so several times last night that the Wizards are sort of like my beloved Pirates and in baseball  they're almost like a farm team for other teams in the league like a farm team that plays in the league and I mean Bradley Beal  is freed from the binds of the Wizards and  that team which  makes little no appeal to me even though I recognize that they're great  they obviously can be a  weird and Wild Force in the West  if Booker stays healthy of course  they're good I mean the suns are good with you like it or not  is Eric Gordon still gonna be relevant with people always relevant because he's one of those guys like a lot of guys  that comes in for stents sort of an a Reggie Jackson kind of wait for the Nuggets obviously chords a different type of player but if you're hot you're hot and if you're not eager back to the bench I mean he can come in at any point score 15 to 25 if he's on fire so we always going to get his test drive  and you know he's he's a solid and be a veteran he has a role and he understands it I think he'll be a factor I don't in fact I think you know where he is in his career  he'll benefit from Bradley Beal playing 35 minutes tonight you know because he should be you know he should be playing lesson every way shape and form yeah um Reggie Jackson that one game brother the most simply leading performance I saw this year kind of mind blowing when it he's single-handedly  took over a game against  the Hall of Fame late player laid in Clippers and single-handedly  led a heavily injured nuggets team to Victory and that came still blows my mind is  that was just  a mind-altering performance by that guy it was beautiful to watch because like I mean you know the guy that loved Jamal Crawford  he could do that sort of thing you know  and then  who's the guy that played for the clippers for years that would do that all the time  um  it's not Jamal Crawford  it's not Eric Gordon  you may have Frozen up again Bob um I'll tell you the that Reggie Jackson game was a big game it was against his former team and I was very excited about it because I was touting him for some time leading up to that and now we've all kind of moved on from Reggie Jackson but up  are you back are you yeah yeah back yes thankfully they're only like about five second parade second put it in another Cog job hey did you did you see what Julian strawther did last night no but I've been waiting for that to happen I wasn't really the game of the main game I watched last night was the heat holding off the Hornets  because I like to watch the very unappealing aesthetic that is the Charlotte Hornets so strong  yes roster's got the tools playing against your Atlanta Hawks  okay and I saw the stats but I didn't that I guess I skipped over the strawberry thing what a fun easy team to have a best career game against well the Pacers are easier but yeah the Hawks are pretty easy six three pointers and five Steals and 22 points Off the Bench first Rook first first rookie I think ever to have six three-pointers in five steals in one game  that's pretty amazing I mean  what he was a first round guy from Guns a great I believe so yeah I mean he's gotten a lot of playing time you know  in the first half of the season last one great benefit of  being a great team like the nuggets and being able to afford to injury or two and still win and get valuable time for your young players I mean I think like that we seem the same for Hawkins like  guys that start playing  regular rotations 20 25 minutes a game instead of garbage time  because you know one or two  guys that play a lot of minutes are gone and straw there's a guy  that over the last month I've seen on the floor a lot  yeah I don't think I'm picking him up anywhere just yet but I think he at least needs to be on radar screens I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and throw them in my FanDuel lineup tonight and see what happens yeah he's hot I mean they make a lot of playing time and  you know the next one of those tricky teams from a fantasy perspective that when you get past the guys the guys that are automatically picked  it's hard to engage playing time I mean they are they are very deep team  and yeah some unpredictable it's guesswork and who's gonna have a game like strawberry hat game you know last night he can do absolutely nothing tonight but then again I like the fact that they're playing on the second night of a back-to-back he's hot they might want to go they might want to get some guys some rest Michael Porter Jr was terrible last night like one of 11 or something ridiculous what is it with him like I've noticed that he's way incredibly he's amazing at home and pat on the road  it's weird I mean that's that's the rule I apply to him  you know when I draft lineups he likes sleeping in his own bed I guess I guess so I mean that is a thing but like it's pretty drastic I'd have to look at the numbers but I just for my own personal experience I've seen him play some awful games on the road  and I think he's if he's one of those guys too that  if yolk hitches out he seems right he he's joking stupendously is a shark or more for you  bennedict mathurin for the paces last night my favorite players in League baby 30.7 boards 8 assists love him love hi played well in the previous game before that he's kind of he's kind of been up and down all season is he a guy you're picking up in all leaves this point I am yes I think he's I think I think and then unfortunately doesn't show up investment is insane he's a great he's a great player to watch live but he's you know he's finishing values always going to be low but he's a you know the Pacers don't play a lot of Defense but they do have guys that can play defense I think we saw how good  Nesmith was in the last few games in the End season tournament  on the defensive and he is their best one-on-one Defender and of course Bruce Brown plays defense which to me that's more defense than the Hawks play  but ya know math and is incredibly versatile inside outside guy and the main reason sort of pick him up at this point is healed to me has been in an extended cold streak I saw him  play live  at when he was just on one of his sick hot streaks so I'd keep an eye on him  right now I think he's ice cold  and has been for a few weeks  but yeah no I love Nathan's an incredible athlete  he can give you some I think he's the kind of guy that would be useful on just about every team in the league  and there's not there's not that many guys that aren't household names you can say that about I can't see Benedict Matthew and not having a significant role on just about any team in the league lightening up the Sixers but for the Celtics or something like teams that are just so deep but he's great yeah and I mean I think I'm convinced after last night it's time to to pick him back up I wish the Buddy hield and Bruce Brown things weren't there that to kind of slow him down as they do they do stuff on each other's toes a lot night tonight I think and it's kind of held math run back from just going off every night but the potentials there and be a good player down yeah awesome Sarah oh go ahead no you  I'll serotonin last night started for the Pistons he's back  at 20 points had a full stat line the difference between the Pistons played a good game I mean the Pistons are are better than the record  they're I wouldn't say the ready to have like a 500 second half  but there  there I want to go see them and a few days  I love to see that game with the Hawks  but yeah I know they are  I think that even one of the is it a 16 game losing streak number two and twenty and they've lost 19 in a row last night in a row I think last night was 20 20 in a row yeah I think they're gonna I think that they are  well I mean it's the easiest thing in the world to say they're going to play better basketball but I think yeah it's again that team  is like where the Rockets were  they'll get there they'll turn the corner they're one no matter when or lose I mean I don't have to say winter lose they're still a very fun watch are you picking up oh Sarah Thompson  I would consider it very strongly  yeah I mean you should be rostered everywhere I think you should be rostered everywhere because he's on a team that obviously can afford to play him as much as needed and I think he's got  all certainly all rookie potential and yeah I mean I love that the teams like that  you know obviously  you were young guys are gonna get a huge change he's been waiting  the Pistons fans that exists or waiting on him with baited breath and he showed last night that showed last night if that's going to be a close to a typical performance he should be on your team yeah and the Pistons are making me mad because Jade and ivy should be a star also Thompson should be playing 35 minutes a night absolutely no hand bogdanovich we know what he does he played 34 minutes last night I started scored 17 points like  all that's doing is you're not winning games anyway so why are we playing  the this veteran guy that like he's not gonna be with Detroit for very long yeah that's the kids let the kids play Man  I mean it's you've lost 19 in a row I mean and that's what their fans want to see  you know I mean sat how many minutes is Sasser play last night I don't have he was really bad yeah he is very Hit or Miss but he's just typical rookie  he's going to be great yeah I couldn't agree more and yes Jaden Ivy who actually considered picking up this morning  he needs to play more but I mean  yeah definitely yeah but it's if also their Thompson still available in your league its time because he's not gonna be for much longer supposedly if they finally leave him in the starting lineup Bob we do this thing on this podcast called the Panic meter every week like who is scaring us right now and I've got a I've got a little list some of this we've already talked about but the Raptors  like I think you said earlier there they were worse than you thought they were going to be or you didn't think they were going to be this big of a mess um  last night like I've noticed like Scotty Barnes is bawling out almost every night but OG and a nobby is not nearly the player we saw last year Sea comes kind of been up and down roller coaster  and Dennis Schroder is sort of like the  the key to the whole thing because he's the only point guard they have but last night they played at the Garden against the Knicks everybody all four of those guys actually played well and they still lost so what I'm concerned about OG from a fantasy perspective I think siakam needs to get moved as soon as possible I think Schroeder is better in fantasy than he is in real life and I love what Scotty Barton's doing this year I mean I agree with every point that you made and I mean  it's interesting because Turtle went to that team  and I was like wow I had seen fertile play in a few NBA games and I thought that  that it was good for the Spurs to move him and and but then he he was he came to Toronto and was completely rejuvenated and was fantastic the last part of the season  and I think he's back to just being a very average big  and that's part of the problem and you talked about how they're only true point guard is Schroeder I think Schroeder is is playing just fine he's as advertised and  yeah I mean the consistence the inconsistency of any nobody is a big problem really I thought a shoe would be better I had a chew at very high times last year and he was very useful he hasn't been up worthy and on at all he's had really just a handful of games I mean I love the guy I want him to be great and then what's the other guys named Boucher is that easy he's a Boucher um he's he's a great athlete too so they do have  if they can figure it's an interesting GM position  in that  whatever's going on from a chemistry perspective whether it's a offense we're in a night like last night when the next couldn't miss or a defensive struggle because they play both they play games that you know total points are 200 and total points or two 60 like last night there's no Rhyme or Reason to it and there's got to be some sort of chemistry probably going on there and I think I'm gonna hate to say it  but I just  it's the thing that sticks out to me and I'll say that could be completely wrong because I'm just a viewer is the turtle problem  I mean turtle eats up a lot of space and he just he slows and athletic team like that down but I'm just being you know I'm just going from from what I see and I've only seen him play a handful of times this year but I love them and that teams loaded with them I've got I've got siaka and Scotty Barnes so I've got the best of it so obviously I root for the Raptors every night dude that's a pretty good Insight on Pearl I was on a Raptors podcast the day before yesterday and we spent an hour talking about basically the Raptors and Pearl's name never came up one single time good or bad and now that you mention it I mean he's just sort of like a forgotten guy like I I don't think about him in terms of fantasy and now I don't think of him in terms of reality and I he's just sort of he's just sort of there I don't even know what he's doing he's there and he plays a lot I mean lastly played 24 but usually pays high 20s low 30s  and  I mean when he was on these bad Spurs teams  you know when they had  they had some really good players including Murray and white  and you could see when you watched them live I'll watch one game I was in in the end zone and you could see that I mean it was actually the night that job quite famously posterized him  and  I mean he's a big guy  but he just on highly athletic teams like you know where those that bad Spurs whatever it is he  it's he's one of those guys that When the Smoke Clears  he always ends up on a losing team and I'm you know I'm not  I hope I'm not hating on the poor guys probably a perfectly nice man he's got the word word game named after him yeah yeah exactly um he he just frustrates me and when he went to the Raptors last year was like oh how weird like  almost like why would you want that guy and then his numbers the first month he was with Toronto where insane  insanely good and now he's I think he's just back to being fertile and I think that  that would be my theory  if I was you know that was a season ticket holder to the Raptors that would be the guy where I'd be you know holding my head in my hands and being like  I mean I was I just think I just think he needs fewer minutes you've got a lot of very interesting athletic big he's obviously the only like space heater and proper big on the team but to me is the problem  Switching gears over to Dallas Hot players that I'm excited about Derek Lively had a monster Double-Double last night with a couple blocks great rookie definitely should be on the all rookie team having a fantastic in fact this will be a really they still do that at the All-Star break where they do the second year against the first year game  we're gonna find out because they're supposedly going old school with the all-star weekend  okay because I love her that's a game that that's usually the night before the All-Star Game alright I'll start Saturday yeah  yeah I would like I would love to go to that game this year I think it's an incredibly entertaining rookie class and obviously we've got guys like  math and at all it's a very interesting second year class I think they're in Indianapolis this year yeah that's that's tribal  yeah Derek Lively  he is great he's been well he huge double double last night he looked really good and he qualified for enough shot attempts to be among considered for the league leaders in field goal percentage and now he's the number one field goal percentage guy in the entire league as well because all he does is dunk  all these talk I think he should be picked up and and rostered everywhere I don't I don't  if they're gladly is out there on a waiver wire somewhere he should not be so go go I wish I had him I mean everybody could use a double-double guy he's got incredibly High field goal percentage and anything does he blocked shots yes he bucks us with some regularity yes he's yeah he's he's ticking a lot of boxes  did you see keonte George scored 30 last night was seven assists no but I think you can expect more of that yeah time to pick him up everywhere like we've been saying that for three weeks around here so yeah absolutely great with another great watch just a fantastic a fun guy to watch a lot of people have been panicking on Josh giddey with his legal troubles and his lack of production he had 12 points 10 boards eight assists last night if somebody Panic dropped Josh get in your league I think you should probably pick him up um  any thoughts on giddy or well Gideon Victor women Yama what is your Takeaway on on the winless you guys well it's amazing um  one of the best little pocket pets in in the NBA of notice over the last  several weeks is and I included a lot of my parlays is  and I'd have to look up the stats but the Spurs  are a great first half team  and I have no idea what's going on but  there's been so many times where they've been  in the lead at half-time or a few points down  and just got blown out the second half  so I've almost made it to have it regardless of who they're playing against to  play the Spurs plus the points of the Spurs straight up to win first halves  which is odd I don't know  as you know obviously it's not it can't be the that's one thing we always think about the Spurs there's no way it could be the coach  so I don't know why they're playing so poorly in the second half but they are and I mean  whimbys  I've he just when I've seen him play I've seen  I saw I've seen him play two hole games  and he's obviously going to be  in you know and Incredibly hopefully I mean as long as he doesn't have  you know some sort of  unforeseen circumstance in the injury Department he's going to be he's gonna be incredible but to me he just he does have a very image you see he's one of those guys you see it really in all sports when they're young  you know who sort of you know kind of a growing into their frame certainly it's a very big thing in horse racing which is the sport of closely for 40 years  you'll see a lot of 2 year old young race horses that  are large framed  and very athletic and you see a tremendous amount of scope is what we call a horse race racing and he seems like he just needs to fill out  it's not only logical things like weight and muscle and stuff like that it's just physical maturity so um he's just  he's  pretty close to becoming a man and I expect that sooner or later  I just think that  everything about this year and him and the Spurs is a trial run I think they actually start to build  I think towards the end of the season when you see him string together games  you know very good performance is that then they'll start to build but this is this whole year this whole vibe of the first seems to be like a trial running a trial run it's very much off and on national TV  so whatever I mean he's exciting and cool  and who's the other one wimpy and who else he could win be put  shengwen on a poster last night that was that was pretty fun Jenkins been great I mean just just getting was the other yeah Kitty I mean  kitties a guy that I mean only heard of and I saw playing handful of times the second half of the Season he's very very unique player very stylish and very skilled guy and it's whatever's going on with them off the floor  to make I mean whatever it it makes me uncomfortable from the standpoint I'm just for what we're talking about it is on the core performance is  regardless of sport that kind of circus whatever's going on that kind of  it takes your focus away from your job doesn't it I mean so I don't know what's going on but he's got unusual gifts on the basketball floor which is  you know over talking about and yeah if you was on my team I would keep a very close eye on him and his minutes  and  he seems like the kind of guy if things were really going badly off the court you would see  you know one of those many injuries that we don't really know what they are like a subluxation of your pinky and he would be out for two weeks I mean it I'm not I'm not that worried about getting I mean they're Oklahoma cities in second place in the west behind Minnesota great it's really weird and and not everybody can score 30 tonight for that team and you know Jalen and SGA are gonna do that again he's a true point guard just over everything down in the you know he's holding it down so yeah he's a great passer and yes certainly if you  you need a assist if he's on your team and he can steal he said you know unique unique young player he is he's walking triple-double against if he gets enough man it's an opportunity all right Bob I know that during the during the pandemic I bought some stuff from Brokers tip records and I  used all right but I did something and you you sent me a briefcase a broken tip briefcase and that yeah Fishel Alexander trivia material that's that's first of all that's a very very difficult or very entertaining trivia  so we used that bag every every Thursday night when we go host our trivia but those are you gonna see useful bag of it it's pretty oh you can use a backpack yeah that was probably the best news that broke his ship of her maid he was I mean essentially Brokers tip is just a little tiny record label that I run out of my  guest room  and it's completely unofficial business it's just a non-profit and  what it is is there's certain bands that  rub me the right way that I think are really awesome that they really great music that really have never made much of an effort  to  be kind of part of the music business that just enjoy playing and making songs and don't really ever think about  wanting to be more than that and the idea sort of started in the early 90s when I lived in Louisville when there was a bunch of bands like that  and that was just when these bands tour regionally or some cases were nationally or just play local gigs that they have a piece of vinyl  to sell and I think I often thought when I was in a band  in the 90s like particularly Silver Jews like when our first record came out our first seven inch it's called dime map of the reef I felt like that kind of made us feel like we were a real band like I've got a racehorse actually called rangelife who trains in Arkansas and she had her first published work yesterday and that made her like a real like in some ways like real so I just feel like if you when that first silver cheese record came out of kind of felt like well this is like actually a real venture  so Brokers tip essentially what I do is a put the money up I've got a guy in Wisconsin super duper records that'll make you know make you three or five hundred miles a real sheep and then make covid killed us because  we're talking about the kind of bands that  when they sell products  they sell  90 80 to 90% of their products from the stage or t-shirts at their live shows and like 10% on band camp you know so covid was a disaster for Brokers tip I have I mean actually have a website that I was sorted right now we're in a state of flops and we're not releasing anything but we went on a run for about five or six years and and I thought it was going to be easier but I just needed to vote more time to it but um yeah no piranha Rama Lucia now infidels I mean  I love all the music and most of its music that  people will never you know hear but in the bottom line is it's like it spans that I love and dig their music and dig their live show and you know I want them to have something to sell so if somebody like you know if you and you and I went and saw a band that we  that we never heard of and we thought they were really awesome and you and I would walk up to the merch booth and spend five bucks on a seven inch record so that's that's the whole concept you know give him something physical that  somebody could have because you're not going to take the like you're not you'd have to really love something or love the design to spend 20,500 show but you'll spend five on a seven if you've got a band was really cool you know very cool very cool sad that covid slowed it down so much so kind of sucks maybe even touring and stuff like that yeah we'll be back in 2024 maybe with an actual office some kind of in a  I'm a little bit of a state of flux at the moment myself but the smoke will clear at some point my friend all right Bible thank you for coming on stick around for just a second one
