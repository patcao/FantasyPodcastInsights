welcome to the award-winning Roto wire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog Vivid Seats and rival fantasy  it's Tuesday November 21st I am Dr a that is my friend Keelan mark my longtime fantasy Hoops nemesis  he refers to himself as a local celebrity in the Indianapolis area let's get to this but first we gotta listen to this sweet Jam  hello you know everybody format today we're going to go over some news from assorted busy Monday night in the NBA we're gonna hit the Panic meter talk about some hot players  we got a little Draymond Green get off my lawn from a couple old guys maybe a bet or two from the evening but first of all  coach Kaylee mark one of my one of my longest best friends is on the show today he has some coaching experience that's what we call him Coach K he's not the real Coach K uh we probably won't get into some of the specifics of his coaching's basketball coaching from back in the day because it was it's not something he finally remembers at times but  kelan you are a principal at Park Tudor Middle School correct in Indianapolis  I am this is a  year number one here at part tutor we pretty famous for a few guys that have made their way to college and the NBA and it's pretty cool place Jaron Jackson Jr for one Jaren Jackson Jr Yogi Ferrell two in particular people may have heard of and yeah both attended part two there and so I am here on Thanksgiving break  okay and your son KJ's practicing right now and and he plays for part two and we we may see him in college in a couple years playing yeah and the world of fantasy sports KJ's probably a third or fourth rounder combo guard he'll give you some steals give you some assists give you some points so yep KJ's practicing getting ready for their first game of the year tomorrow against I think the number one ranked School in three a and so hopefully he's ready to go but I'm ready good to see my man good to see you what year do you think we started playing fantasy basketball together  um  that is a really good question I  I would think probably in the 90s we started with  how we made trades was via email  we started with doing stats on the with the USA Today  we started with everything was on paper a legal pad and so that was it had to be the 90s I'm being generous there well I know it was a 90s I don't know whether it was 90 I don't know whether it was 92 93 or 94 but it was one of those one of those three years so regardless it's been a long time right it's been a long time we've we've witnessed someone take Glenn Big Dog Robinson with the number one overall pick in our fantasy yeah we've we've banned Michael Jordan from our league and certain times because he was too good Eddie Jones is one of my favorite all-time fantasy players from from that era but yeah anyway yes so can you and I've been doing this a long time so you you may not be in the industry but I feel like you know as much about fantasy basketball and real basketball as anybody does she played in college you got a kid that is going to play in college and we've spent a lot of time talking Hoops so  let's get into last night thanks for coming on by the way last night  I think the game of the night was the Celtics and the Hornets right and Jayson Tatum and lamelo ball just went at each other Tatum had 4513 and 6 mellow had 39 36 nine eight five triples um miles Bridges hit a huge 3 pointer and over time we had a double-double with five assists Mark Williams was big with 18 and 16 he also had a stealing three blocks  and then Payton Pritchard Off the Bench out of nowhere with no Derek white in uniform 21 points 53642 steals quite a game I had Peyton Richards somehow in my DFS lineup and it allowed me to just walk over walk over the guys that we play with kilo  yeah I think it's good it's always fine when you get lucky you find those guys like Payton Pritchard and they have one of those nights for you I know this is what I want Jayson Tatum to do this every single night this is who he has to be for his team but I just think he can put up these type of numbers every night if he felt like it  well you can tell you look different last night like he was very comfortable against Charlotte he was  wanting to put on a show he went off in the first quarter you get he was hot right from the get-go and it just looked like certain like sometimes if I go to the golf course I'm playing against somebody I don't think is as good as I am like I get this like I get kind of cocky and I'm like oh feeling so confident there's no way this person is going to be me that's sort of this why he had going last night  like these guys can't hang with me but they did and they beat him which is crazy that Boston is my favorite to win at all this year and they got paid by the Charlotte Hornets so but  the miles Bridges pick up if you picked him up I think so far so good it looks like he's  I mean he started over PJ  last night he's putting up numbers and he's gonna play if you drafted Mark Williams I think you're sight and if you're thinking about picking up Payton Pritchard I don't know the you need to I've got him in my starting lineup for my 30 Team league  but as soon as Derek white comes back Richard should go back to  anonymity again I would think  Nicole yokich got ejected along with his coach early yesterday that allowed my man  Reggie Jackson to go off 21 points six assists stealing a block  I've been on the Reggie Jackson bandwagon because  the Nuggets play four times this week they played four times next week they're one of only three teams that had that schedule Jamal Murray's out for a while I thought Reggie Jackson was automatic pickup Ivy he did better last time because there's no Joker's you have any faith in Old Man read this is what Reggie does and he'll be solid  for about two weeks for you and then he'll disappear and then roughly in late January you'll pick Reggie up again he's just he's solid but he's solid for a short period of time but he'll consistently give you you know numbers like this like he did last night in the absence of someone getting injected or Murray being injured this is who Reggie is but don't expect you know Reggie don't expect the Mr October Reggie through the entire season this is Reggie Jackson for two weeks and you enjoy it and have fun with them well and all I want is Reggie Jackson because Jamal Murray's not playing in and in November so I mean Jackson's going to play all eight of these games when I was down to seven and all I want is six  solid games I want two Duds six solids we've already got one good one so now we're now we're at one good one  five solids and then two Duds I'm good at that happens so I know what I'm getting myself into Reggie Jackson's and everybody else probably does as well uh Giannis in the Bucks Giannis had 42 points 13 boards eight assists  news flash stopped the presses Jordan Poole for the Washington Wizards scored 30 points  finally he scored 30 he had only scored in the 20s twice a lot of us thought he was going to leave early and scoring obviously that was foolish that was not not a good way to think apparently you don't score two games in the 20s this year he's been more like 14 to 17  kind of doesn't look great him and his Jones both have been hugely disappointing the Wizards are gonna win like five games this year any thoughts on on Jordan Poole I actually having a good game yeah he's been a disappointment yes like you and everyone else thought he would probably lead the league in scoring and then it's just one dud after another and so hopefully this is a Breakout game for him do not expect 35 and 6 he may have had an assist last night I'm not sure what is other stats were but I think I saw maybe one or two assists or whatever but um  yeah Jordan Poole has to get out of this funk it is his team whether he likes it or not and just lower those expectations for other stuff I personally and this is how I do fantasy I would be in someone's message box email text message I would try to trade Jordan Poole like yesterday right now if I moaning only him in a fantasy league  good point good point now that was a good time to try to move Jordan Poole if you've been wanting to move Jordan Poole  kind of the opposite that we're seeing with Bradley Beal  now it's a terrible time to try to move Bradley Beal but then again if you tried to move Bradley Beal when it wasn't a terrible time nobody wanted him anyway so right at least Jordan Poole he has another good game or two and then he'll actually have a straight value go up  a couple more than the Miami Heat I'm a yakis and Duncan Robinson have both been going off with Tyler hero out of the way Duncan Robinson City out there in your league I think you should go pick him up um  Keelan this is something they'll probably interest you  Paul George James Harden and Kawhi Leonard all showed up to the same dance last night against Victor wimby  ran that horrible Spurs team into the ground and they all played well on the same night did you think you were going to see that happen  I know I know it was coming and we'll get into PG and harden a little bit more I knew it was coming they're going to figure it out I liked tyloo as a coach  and they were playing the Spurs so it was bound to happen but it was coming sooner rather than later  um lastly Donald Mitchell will be out tonight missing his third straight game with a hamstring injury  are you worried about Donald Mitchell coming back at full strength and not aggravating the sting at some point soon and are you a careless Levert or a Max Spruce believer  um not worried about Donovan Mitchell they've got a little bit of depth on that team with strews Levert I would personally go for Levert because I think he does more I think he plays well starting he plays well off the bench and so I would hottel it to Levert more than anyone I have to pick between those two but Mitchell will be fine he's young he'll come back he'll be just fine I had one worry about him at all Levert is one of the hot plays in DFS tonight according to my my people my sources a lot of the optimizers that looked at have got Levert going tonight so he's gonna be really popular DFS play and he should he should be although he burned me what what game what night did he sit out like Saturday Friday or Saturday sat out  that was kind of a plated tonight  Underdog fantasy is the number one platform for NBA best ball in DFS player Pick'em contest if you haven't tried Underdog yet new Underdog users receive a

least I think we're not going that day I don't know if we're doing a podcast this week or not but we're going to figure that out later today all right  into the Panic meter Keelan I'm Gonna Let You Go first who are some guys  and I this not necessarily scary and you right now but who are some guys you're leery of the rest of the way long term  yeah so right  Steve you know me I I love a good trade I love a good if you're in the league and there's 10 12 30 guys there's always one or two um that you can make some trades with and but you got to do that a good time and so the first one on my list Viktor wynd binata I would try to trade him ASAP now you might think that's crazy and insane he's putting up good numbers he's playing well he's eventually gonna get popped you know they're going to be cautious with him  you know Popovich's eventually gonna randomly sit him down his 29 minutes a game it's good it's not going to be 35 and 40 the Spurs are awful and so I wait to he does one of those 2211 and four blocks and then I I try to move Victor to get something that's more stable and someone that's going to help you later in the season without question  yeah that's not it's not really a bad call I think  part of me as a wimpy manager  and a wimby lover even though he's very inconsistent and very good game here bad game there  I am a little concerned about what you said  the Spurs are three and 11 his coach is Gregg Popovich  I think pop is kind of lulled us to sleep with Wendy because he's played every game he has not come close to  sitting out a game he hasn't come close to getting injured he looks like he's gonna be  a healthy strong young kid that's going to be able to play the whole season and I think  if you stop right there it's easy to think I'm going to be able to rely on wimby all the way through the rest of the season but  I think you're right when the Spurs are  you know six and 25 and  back to back start piling up and next year's Lottery starts coming in the focus again  he's gonna get pop some I just don't I just  have this weird feeling that we're not going to shut him all the way down so if we do  if he plays a little season my 30 team a team is going to be great but if he doesn't it's not going to be great all right who else you got on your list see I see if I put check homegrown  closed in that same category as wimpy they're going to be cautious with him Chet is absolutely killing it right now putting up great numbers but okay see they've got a lot of depth there going to be  at worse a play in seven eight seed they're going to be in a hunt for the playoffs I think in the west but they're going to be cautious with Chet because he is he's that guy and so I would I'd watch I see if test the waters if you can trade him for  you know a couple of guys or something like that I'd be careful there porzingis this is every year Chris stopped starts out good I think it was 17 and 8 last night but remember since 2020 he's played 43 34 17 and 65 games porzingis is going to porzingis at some point the Celtics I'm sure they're happy they have them but porzingis he's fine now two three weeks from now he may be okay but at some point he's gonna come up missing and he's won as another person I would just consider moving moving on from if you can just see what you can get but he's fine right now  I'm gonna have to disagree with you on chat homework  Oklahoma City is number three in the west right now they're 10 and 4 they have one of the best players in the league in SGA they have one of the best starting five in the league won the most fun teams to watch they've been shutting guys down for last five years trying to get to this moment that we're in right now I'm a little concerned about Chet just because he didn't play last year and he's a big man that had a foot problem but man he looks awesome this year I I just I think Oklahoma City's going for it I don't think anybody's gonna want to play Oklahoma City in the playoffs I'm a lot less worried about shit than I am wimpy I'm actually more worried about Chet like suffering an actual injury that I am Wendy but as far as just being shut down I don't I don't think okay see they get out is is thinking about shutting  or even slowing shut down at this point we think about that  yeah I think for that reason  they they will eventually maybe after Christmas I think it's just going to slow him down watch some of his minutes because they don't want you know like you said a big man with the foot injury and recovering from and he's back he's doing great I just think they want to get to the playoffs  with a good seat but they want to be everyone fully healthy and they're not gonna run check into the ground so that's from Coach K there buddy all right and then what about Zach Levine he wants out of Chicago right Zach wants out of Chicago probably wants to get rid of Zach I don't know where he would go I've heard there's some interests with Miami but I don't know if Zach is going to be Zach anywhere else other than Chicago so you know he's he's having a good season but he is not happy he wants out and it wouldn't surprise me if the Bulls sooner rather than later have a fire sale and just start moving you know Zach and DeRozan and you name it  all right well guys I'm worried about  include Klay Thompson who actually played well last night  20 points five triples  but the five threes he missed were all pretty bad he had are ball and I don't know could you says hasn't looked right he hasn't met my eye test  this year  he was a lot better last night but I I'm worried about clay long term I don't know that we're ever going to see the Old Clay again  I I don't worry about clay if the expectations are threes the clay is going to shoot he goes oh for seven he's gonna take the next five or six so if you're if you need threes I would worry about clay if you wanting you know some of the things Old Clay used to do a still here or you know it feels this yeah you should worry but I think Clay's gonna be fine all right and for those of you just tuning in this is my one of my longtime fantasy Nemesis Nemesis that's why I don't know how you say plural Nemesis but  he's one of my Arch enemies in fantasy Hoops we've been playing Fancy artists like 1994  we got a lot of time in the game together it's coach Keenan mark my buddy principal where Jaron Jackson Jr went to high school actually so another guy I'm concerned about is Jalen Greene of the Houston Rockets I feel like  Dillon Brooks being there is oddly working for them he's playing good defense he's hitting wide open threes Fred Van Fleet  one of the holiday Brothers is there I don't is it just in I don't even know it's just an erroring it's not true I think it's just Justin he's banging open threes last night and then Jalen green hit six of 15 shots had 16 points but  I feel like in Jabari Smith played very well yesterday all so for Houston feel like Houston moves the ball around so much and has so many guys involved including Alpine shooting who was a monster last night I just think Jalen Green's kind of getting left in the dust yeah he's still trying to figure out dare I say being on a pretty decent okay team with vently there it helps I like their team it's a good mixture of some some that some guys who know how to play and so Jalen green coming from you know his last season where it was pretty much him still trying to figure it out I wouldn't Panic too much but is not Jalen green of last year we know that  and then my last the guys got married about when she I think he's been on this list every week I'm not gonna get into it Brad Bradley Beal all I know is Eric Gordon Grayson Allen tonight look good in DFS they look good on my roster  in regular fantasy I'm rolling with those guys until Bill comes back  NBA season is here on behalf of our friends at Vivid Seats let's get one thing clear nothing beats senior favorite team Crush it on the court

experiencing it live the heart throbbing action on the court do you remember what the police officer asked me on our way to that game and I was driving my car through the streets of downtown Indianapolis as you were driving your car through the streets of downtown Indianapolis excited probably for your first final four I assume and think we happened to go down a wrong way one way street and the officer told you to pull down your window and asked you did you take your stupid pill today and with all the composure you had and you he's totally officer absolutely sir and I apologized and he let us go so yes I recommend everyone daily take your stupid pill it'll keep you probably have a few situations yeah dude that was pretty funny because yeah the car was full who wasn't you and muha and me and my brother maybe yep Gary went it was the four of us comes running up the car roll down your windows I mean he's like did you take a stupid pill today my bad dude I'm just trying to get to the game I don't that's all for trying to do is get to the final four yeah we made it though it was Michigan who see Michigan State and I was a UCLA  Florida was a Florida it was Florida I remember magic was there yep yep had good seats thanks coach Randy Lambert my college coach for hooking us up and it was sweet okay um you would you like to talk about some Draymond Green in the get off my lawn segment yeah so I'm 52 years old and I've learned more and more these days Dr a that people get butt hurt about stuff and they have short term memory one of the best fights I've seen I'm a big Sugar Ray Leonard fan Leonard versus Tommy Hearns was a great fight but it was not as good as Darryl Dawkins and my Reese Lucas and those guys went at it I remember Dr Jay giving Larry Bird a three piece and I remember driving home on a bus after basketball game my coach ironically and the brawl in Detroit happened uh Draymond  choking grabbing both Rudy gobert it is not that deep people need to relax Draymond  can be a little bit of a dream on but it wasn't that deep for me I don't think I don't see why people make a big deal because we literally have seen NBA players punch fans children running for their lives in Detroit we've seen our beloved Dr J punch Larry Bird three or four times so nothing more was going to happen from it people just need to relax and just chill out a little bit  I think it was the Optics of Draymond getting him and then sort of like dragging him across the court that it just didn't look  didn't look all that cool and then what you didn't even mention Latrell Sprewell choking PJ Carlos you didn't mention bob Knight choking Neil  Neil Neil Reed yeah I mean you've missed a couple of the bigger choking incidents in history he also didn't mention Reggie Miller choking himself in the garden right looking at Spike Lee but yeah I well I just over the Draymond  thing I mean he's not a very good fantasy player anymore and he doesn't score  and he's better in real life than he is in fantasy and I'm just I'm just done yeah I've been over Draymond for a few years now plays hard decent leader but fantasy wise don't don't waste your time q and I needed I needed one thing to happen last night to hit my Underdog 5 leg parlay which I don't have them all written down here I don't even know what they were by hit the first four  I need a mere 18 points from Freddie Van vleek he scores that in his sleep  normally  he had 14 assists last night but he could only score 10 points he just never really got involved in the offense he was feeding everybody else  and  I be rich today if if Fred Van Lee was scored 18 points  so I know and he's playing for the Rockets should have happened  oh what are your thoughts about you were involved in a long text thread  between two grumpy angry old men and in the middle of the night arguing about the in season NBA tournament  what are your thoughts on it are you you know you're a big Pacers fan right you're right there I'm right here in Indy yeah and I kind of love the team they're putting on the floor right now I love the the mix of Youth and and Veterans and the Tyreese Halliburton move is one of the greatest in team history where are you on the tournament I the tournament is completely unnecessary  I don't know what the point of it is  the thing is when you make these changes in sports  who are you making it for you making it for the fans are you making it for the players owners who exactly I don't know who this is even for because as a fan  if I turn turn on the Bucks and  Pacers I am just watching a game now the court looks cool  the uniforms are nice but I don't think it is added  anything at all to the regular season and so it's fine I'm not sure it's a is a buzz about it with  you know fans or anything like that the courts would be honest I worry about because they're painted and guys are slipping everywhere but you know that's a basketball thing but I don't think it was even necessary to be very honest with you well I think what I'll say this it's not doing a lot to enhance it for me I'm gonna watch that game regardless of whether it is a playing a pool game or not like I don't care if it's a playoff playing in season game or not I'm gonna watch the games I'm gonna watch anyway the fact that there's a little more on the line I guess that's kind of cool I do think though that once we get out of pool play and and we're in to the actual playoff part of it  that it could be it's gonna become more interesting and more exciting I think for fans the whole reason it's there is because the average sports fan is like oh I don't watch the NBA until Christmas like Christmas is the Christmas Christmas Day is when the NBA season starts and I think  the NBA was like what can we possibly do to change that let's have an in-season tournament that makes people possibly watch it before before Christmas gets here I think that's the whole point and I don't think it's anything that would make somebody mad and makes somebody like not watch a game they were gonna watch  so I don't see that there's harm in it I just it's just seems like I'm being manipulated  so why are they building are they building a Santa's Workshop next door to your office yes Santa is here he is here at 11:30 in the morning building I think it's a PS5 probably outside my door here so uh that is probably what you hear in the background Coach K tell me some players you're excited about  so Circle this December 19th John Morant is eligible  to return of course John last year was 26 6 and 8 Jah of course it's gotten into some trouble and The Grizzlies are currently terrible and I think Josh is going to come back and I don't know if he's even eligible based on the new rules John's going to have an MVP season when he returns and I am I will be there what whatever's happening I'm watching John Morant when he returns number two James Harden Paul George they're gonna figure it out they are going to figure out how to co-exist and play together I think PG is having hell of a year there's some similarities with Paul George and Kevin Durant as far as style of play Kevin Durant with hard and was 287 and 4 I think Paul George will continue to play as he is currently playing and I think Harden is going to figure out his role interesting is since hardin's been on the team they've given up 115 points a game  which is terrible and so I think they're going to try and outscore people which benefits hardened I think his assist numbers will be good I think he'll tap out around 19 to 22 points a game so  you're going to be fine with the hardened you're going to be fine with Paul George my last person that I absolutely love is Jalen Williams another OKC guy he's 174 and 4 now and the thing I really like he's had  I think maybe four games he's taking 10 shots a more and shot 60% from the field that's a guy if I'm going to Target a trade of someone he's one that I would go after because he just does a lot of stuff assist Stills blocks his percentages are good but I absolutely love Jalen Williams I drafted Jalen Williams everywhere he was one on my guys coming into this draft season so obviously that means I reached for him in every draft I had because that's what I do so I'm very excited about the way Jay will is playing um let me ask you let's go back to John Moran for a second Coach K Memphis is 3 and 10  they look terrible  I don't know that Jack can turn them around  and I don't know that their season can be saved if they're like three and  say they're four and 16 by the time jaw comes back like are you a little concerned about how that's going to go and at some point are they just gonna bag it and play for a draft pick or  you think they can come back you think Jaws good enough that he can lead them back from this  awful start yeah I think John is good enough to lead them back at minimum to fight and for that play in or that final seed and the West I think his energy I think John just brings a lot to that organization and I think he has you know something to prove he's been out trying to you know get himself together he's going to come back trying to redeem His Image and so I think they will get it together I think he's their Difference Maker as as everyone sees how they are without him so now I think the Grizzlies they're going to be in good shape and I think when he returns you're going to see I'm  guessing  a guy that's putting up 26 to 28 I think it's a six numbers going to go up I think it's rebound numbers will stay the same John Moran I think is going to have an MVP season whether he is eligible to be an MVP or not  remains to be seen you would you be mad if you were a Memphis Grizzlies season ticket holder that you spent thousands of dollars on those tickets and you your team is 0 and 6 at home this season there's three and four on the road and only six at home  I'd be pretty pretty upset to say the least and I be as patient as possible but I would hope they get it together but as a season ticket holder I would not be very happy right now  um  I'm gonna throw a question up on the screen  healing because you said you were gonna mention this gentleman  Luma I guess what to know about Brandon Miller the rest of the season yes good question I put Brandon Miller and a sore Thompson in the same boat good rookies on bad teams two guys I would hang on to I think upside our sewer he's averaging a double-double right now I think that's going to continue the guys are getting good minutes with about 30 minutes a game Brandon Miller 144 and 2 he's still figuring out the NBA don't bail on him yet the plus side would Brandon Miller is he is playing with a point guard that loves to pass and will find ways to get him involved so I won Bell on him I love Brandon Miller love assured Thompson hang on to him the season is Young they're rookies but they're going to get better I think Brandon Miller will finish  I'd say with about maybe 16 a game  five rebounds I think he's on a play 75 to 82 games I believe he saw it a Sean Kirkland wants to know Walker Kessler Jalandhar during the rest of the season I'm going Jalen Duren all day I think Kessler  played a little bit over his head last year he hasn't looked that good this year he's been injured for a while during has been out too but I during during looked like I monster for the first couple weeks of Seasons until he got hurt I'm I'm All About Jill and they're  yeah I agree Jalen Dern is solid has been a pro before becoming a pro so I really like him he's had a good year  all right back to the schedule here I'm gonna go with a couple of my hot players Darius Arch  18 points last night three triples and stealing a block he's getting lots of run off the Warriors bench we've been waiting for this version of homie Dario for years it's finally here  I think sorry just pretty much go out and grab him wherever you can in this point he thoughts on that  I agree I think he's carved out a role with the Warrior's of course Draymond is Draymond dings so I like Dario he's just a solid player he's not gonna hurt you too much be good good pick up heated George is playing tonight for the Jazz none of my DFS optimizers have told me to play keyonte George and I put in I've  I've looked at like 10 to 12 different lineups now one of them is saying keonte George is going to have a big game tonight I haven't even looked to see  who the Jazz are playing but um regardless I am still down with keonte even though I was late to the bandwagon as you guys know but I'm hearing now so I'm kind of excited about they're playing the Lakers  on TNT tonight I don't know why  can't they would not have a decent game in that scenario but  yeah we are down with keonte George I watched him think versus Phoenix the other nights and interesting thing I saw with him the Jazz are looking at him as a go-to guy he's taking shots late they're encouraging him to be a playmaker so there's some belief in keonte George and the Jazz absolutely love him yes we're on the same boat there okay Lebron vs Jordan Magic versus bird Barkley

arena  tonight the Sixers  are at home hosting the Donovan Mitchell's Cavaliers  this is a play in game or not why do I keep seeing playing this is an in season Tournament game as all the games are tonight a Sixers or minus seven and a half at home against the Cavs with no Mitchell are you thinking the Sixers are going to run the calves out of the gym or is this a sucker sucker bet  um the Sixers thanks to Tyrese Maxey will run the calves out of the gym he is been on a chair Philadelphia has moved on from James Harden I think indeed is happy I think the Sixers will run them out of the gym I don't think the Cavs can score with them minus Mitchell not playing so yeah I like to say pictures  all right and then let's take a look at one of my  one of my DFS teams that I kind of went rogue with this one and it's not really  it's not really optimized I'm it's more just what my thinking is if I can find it even oh here we go  my DFS team as of right now for the evening that I like the most is D'Angelo Russell hey Chianti George at point guard  Austin Reeves and Eric Gordon at shooting guard Laurie Markin and Buddy hield small forward  Obi topping and Toby Tobias Harris the power forward and then Joel embiid  Center I think I like this Eric Gordon against Portland thing I just think he's gonna go off marking in against the Lakers should be fun MB  is embiid and the diesel Russell and cannot take George I feel like those are both very solid not super expensive point guards Austin reasons maybe the key to this whole thing he's kind of been hit or miss the season  I like I like where you have Obi he's been solid for the Pacers the pace for they score points and they are fun to watch and he is a great fit and a great fantasy fit playing with that team way better than you know when he played for the Knicks so I like your object there they don't play defense do they those Pacers nope not interested  okay hey Keelan without looking this is this is gonna be our wrap-up  who's in first place in the Western Conference  without looking um  in my head I say  Denver but all right that is my guess but the top of my head there's  I guess it's Denver  that's a pretty good guess because  um they technically are in  second place but they have the same amount of wins as the team in first they just have one more loss so there the nuggets are a half game behind your first place  Minnesota Timberwolves  right Jinx who would have done it Timberwolves six and over at home for an away four and three away  they're 10 and 3 on the season  it's hard to believe but you know we I said before the season started the Anthony Edwards was getting ready to take over the league it's like Anthony Edwards SGA and Tyreese Halliburton like those are the big three not named Luca whenb Chad like that crowd and and aunt is is really turning it on I think Rudy gobert is playing much better this season alongside Karl Anthony towns than he did last year and that whole vibe in Minnesota man I'm I'm surprised I haven't heard more  Minnesota fans chirping about how incredible their team is  yeah I think Ant-Man sends the summer world team you saw it coming his confidence he's number one he's my favorite interview in the NBA he is he is damn good with his confidence in himself in anything from football to baseball to basketball and so what he's doing this year with that team I think is is outstanding and I hope  I hope the Timberwolves keep it going and be good to see some new  faces some new blood that are at the top of the NBA rankings with OKC doing well with even Houston not doing too bad at all and then Minnesota so I'm looking forward to seeing how this turns out all right man well thanks for coming on the show tell Glenda and KJ I said happy holidays and
