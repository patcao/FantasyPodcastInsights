hey everyone it's Tuesday March 5th welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you today our new sponsor smart bracket just in time for March Madness I'm Dr a that is curion we are going to break down  a slowish  six game night in the NBA on Monday we're gonna do it right after this  hey Karen let's Dive Right In Here we got good news  on Monday write that out friendship goons injury is not  career threatening or a torn ACL or anything like that however  he does have a severely sprained right ankle  what do you think the chance is are we see him  come back and play again the regular season  I'd probably go 25% um like you said it's not a career threatening injury but obviously the Rockets are like three and a half games out right now of the Tennessee to that play in spot the Lakers and the Warriors are playing really well so I don't imagine them the Rockets reaching that spot by the time he's like ready to come back I think more likely than not they shut him down for the rest of the season and just have a good healthy off-season and prepare for next year  yeah I'm closer to 0% that he comes back because it not only is it the ankle it's also the knee the guy's a mini yokich like this is not a this is a franchise player  that you do not want to mess with and  what's the difference really between me and the 10  or a nine play in and then getting out in the playoffs they're just not making the playoffs I mean it's really not that big of a deal they I think used to pretty  clearly exceeded expectations this year they were way better than I thought they were going to be very entertaining one of the better young teams in the league  and they've got some some Scrappy veterans throwing in there now and in the mix so I if I'm Houston I'm just shutting him down and saying thanks for everything and moving on to next year but what  is there a pickup there is jock landale really somebody you're comfortable adding to your roster your teams trying to make the playoffs or is this a good thing for amen Thompson I know Kim Whitmore is not playing tonight um so maybe it's Amen time what do you think  if I in like a deeper League I would think about adding jock if and like a 12 team League that I'm fighting for a playoff spot I don't think that's a move that is gonna be turning any needles for me  like you said cams out tonight so I do think that means a lot more aiming I really I mean Jabari Smith's gonna be owned in a majority of leaks anything anyways but I really think he's gonna play a lot of small ball 5 Jeff Green make its some run to but all of these but like bench guys other than aiming like I don't see jock or Jeff Green really playing like 20 25 minutes and could get up there but um I like I said I think they go a lot of small ball 5 Fenley green get more shots up Smith gets a lot more like looks from outside like with the stretch floor but I don't think there's really like a league winning move here in like 12 teams No One's Gonna replace sengen-sama it's going to be those core guys that are already owned and majority of leaks that just get a slight a slight upgrade for me  yeah I made a mistake and let Derek Lively go the other day and after I did it  because I wanted to pick up there's so many guards that are hot right now and I was like planning for I was looking at all the four game weeks coming up and I was playing eggs I'm already locked in the playoffs so I made all these moves I was like oh now I only have one Center and a two Center league and weirdly we'll talk about in a minute you know that both Dallas centers played well last night which we never see happen but now I'm like if I don't get  Lively back I may end up having to grab Jacqueline Dale so I think if you're desperate for a sinner and and their art a lot sitting out there and a 12 team two Center League I think like land deals at least worth  a flyer until we see what Houston's going to do because I can see Houston going small like you just said or I can see them playing Lansdale 25 minutes and maybe having him making him back but in a two Center League absolutely he's worth a look I I'll give that stipulation there for sure yeah um so anyway that's where we are with that part of the Houston rotation the news was not quite as promising on saddiq Bey he's out for the season he'll have left knee surgery is ACL  are you a bogey bogdanovich guy or DeAndre Hunter guy in this situation I personally  like McDonald's but I think Hunters probably more available in more leads yeah I would agree with that statement on I've been a bit big bogey guy his entire career even when he was gay chucking up shots in Sacramento on I just love the way he plays incident offense can make a impact right away um Hunters been playing really well recently on there the biggest issue with him was always like consistency right with the jumper like more than anything else and he's put together a stretch of like really solid scoring performances  double-digit points in 14 straight averaging 17 like 17.3 points shooting over 50% from the field so he's got something figured out right now I don't think he's gonna like explode to be like some 25 Point score for the rest of the season because of City Base injury but I think there's a real chance that he is a steady producer for a team that goes far in the playoffs he's all that stretch that I just mentioned was all Off the Bench right so even if he doesn't get added to the starting lineup we've seen fit added to the starting lineup and Hunter still come off the bench even if he doesn't get added to the starting lineup punter still like a really solid play for me I think can you hear me right now I can't I saw you out there for a minute yeah my videos gone but  apparently my audio is still here right yeah okay so yeah and I agree that played much better of late than  well I feel like he's had kind of a good year for Atlanta better than  and has been in the past but it's gonna be some weird sledding next year of DeAndre Hunter bug zdanowicz  Bay and Jaylen Johnson are all still around because there's only so many miles to feed him the one that really needs to eat is Jaylen Johnson so absolutely absolutely he's hurt as we as We Know  the Golden State Warriors beat the Spurs last night Victor woman came back and graced us with his presence um  he only hit 10 of 25 shots  which was painful  he had 27 points 14 rebounds three assists still two blocks three three-pointers  I've got this dude I've got wimby in my lineup going against yokich they're they both play four games this week do you think  let me know is gonna play tonight and is that news already out there and I just haven't seen it  the news last night before game  Popovich used the phrasing uncertain for his status today and there has not been an update yet on so that would you know maybe playing some some games there Popovich's but I would assume that that means he's kind of trending more towards not playing today and like kind of like the same situation was sent going right is there a reason for him to be playing this money minutes he's all but got the Rookie of the Year locked up he's played in 57 games already so you know he's on Pace to hit all those thresholds right and you know from all of like the press conferences and stuff when we wants to play man he wants to be out there every night he wants to be the reason his team is winning every night but at this point in his career and in with the state of the Spurs that just is not really like what needs to happen right he needs to like stay healthy this year so he has a good off-season and he can build off of his Rookie of the Year campaign so I think this person is going to protect him from himself if sit him out to die if you even if he plays he'll probably be limited and I was looking at his shot attempts that was last night was only the third time he has taken more than 25 shots or 25 or more shots in the game so if you like him taking that many shots last night was kind of an indication he's not going to play today like if I'm not gonna be playing tomorrow Michael get on my shots up today you know and so I think when he's when he will play for the next couple weeks he's gonna be full go play over 30 minutes taking  as many shots as he can being really aggressive but I do think there's going to be some limitations and there's going to be some some rest days they're in the fancy playoffs which is tragic well he's got a matchup against a non-gun tonight and I was really hoping that he was just gonna play and go off and I got lucky last week because I played against Andre the professor snellings who I work with at ESPN and he lost Maxi for the week I only had whenb for one game so we had a we had our own problems but if  you know I'm plenty of Matt Smith this week if he gets four games out of yoke and should I get two or three out of wimpy and I'm gonna associate after what yolk is did last night it's not gonna be it's not gonna be fun for me but we'll see what happens um Devin vassell was back he was hot early struggled late um glad to have him back he's a baller man I love Devin vassell and then did you catch Trace  Jackson Davis's dunk on Wendy  yeah man that was awesome  you got it I'm a Big Ten guy know you said you're in charge of but I'm almost constant boy so I've been I've followed Chase Jackson Davis at Indiana for a long time and he terrified terrorized a lot of badger teams and thinking about him as a pro is kind of like you know there's no jump shot there's no whatever well better what better fit for him in the NBA then playing with Chris Paul I mean you know I know Curry wasn't playing last night but playing with like two Hall of Fame point guards just dude is just a rebound offensive rebounding defensive rebounding roll screen and Roll King and he fits perfectly with those guys so I I've kind of enjoyed his his like little hot stretch here in the NBA I don't I don't know how much of a ceiling he has in the NBA but he can play this role for a couple years at least well I am from Indianapolis Indiana and my parents my my mom went to Indiana and I grew up in Bloomington  on down there near Lake Monroe so trayce Jackson Davis I watched most of his games as last year in Indiana and I was surprised you felt that far in the draft on the I thought he was better player than that but I get it no jump shot but the donkey had on one me last night was pretty pretty fun oh yeah  did you notice that Klay Thompson started over Brandon  yeah pods and Chase Jackson both moved to the bench after a couple starts on I was happy with the production from those young guys off the bench I am I don't want to be that guy but I am a little worried about pods you know over his he's over his last seven appearances he's missed two games during that stretch he's averaging seven points shooting 39% from the field 60% from the free-throw line that's not great he's obviously one of the best rebounding guards in the league already right so there's always going to be that aspect that boosts his fantasy appeal great defense Lee for a young guy too but that offense really needs to be there if he's going to be a difference-maker in the playoffs I'm a little worried I'm not ready to pull the plug on it for sure but if there's a better option out I might be looking to replace him and 12 team leads  in the story not not like replacement on my roster but like move him out of the starting lineup  yeah I feel like Lee Corso on the on the show on ESPN like not so fast because Golden State plays four times  next week the week after the week after the week after so they're locked into four games every week from here on out I picked up pods  off waivers in 12 team Yahoo League then I'm trying to win on on Monday and I think the only reason he was cut is because he missed those two games so I'm kind of glad he says games made him available to me now I did see I didn't see a thing on Twitter before we came on the air today where A Wiggins and pods were running a fast break together and Wiggins kept the ball  and and got fouled on the rack and pauses like dude I'm wide open throw me the ball he's like waiting talk about dude not throwing you the ball and it was like oh well maybe maybe Wiggins and pods are not not the best of buddies not that I'm not that I think that really matters that much bottom line is I think I think the Warriors really like the hustle of pajam ski and  yeah he's going through a little  little wall right now but there's plenty of time for him to get a turn around I'm not too worried about it yeah he he's a very high floor guy because of those rebounds in the defense of production right on just the offense a little bit and like you said like that that's a nice little clicky Twitter poster exposed or whatever it is nowadays in reality I think that's just too like hungry guys guys competing trying to win barking at each other a little bit they probably laughed about it on the plane or like I'm in the locker room afterwards I did see that in chuckled a little bit though maybe they left about it maybe they didn't I don't ya but either way they're professionals and they'll move on well yeah at least Wiggins is showing signs of life again that was a that was a rough first half of the Season yeah for that dude hey hey March Madness fans before we dive into the madness we wanted the loop you in on one of our sponsors supported

enjoying the madness and making smarter choices along the way thank you supported and intelligence here in my my voice barely made it through that but we're still here you did a great I've got audio back I've got video back I'm back Dallas Mavericks last night ran these Chicago Bulls out of the gym  ruining a chance for my guy Luca my man  to get his what night tenth I don't even know how many straight 30 point triple double in a row because it was such a blowout he didn't really play much in the fourth quarter so he finished with 27 12 and 14  like I mentioned earlier Danny Gafford and Derek Lively both went off in the same game I don't know that we've seen that happen yet in Dallas  so I thought that was weird and then also Kobe White  he's been carrying one of my teams and his entire team we're sort of a disaster last night so  any takeaway from that oh yeah I think the biggest takeaway is you can trust lab Runners against her voice of it anytime I you know I think Andre Drummond got a lot of PT off the benches he has been but that's just a tough matchup for booster right two guys who are freak athletes and Luca dont just being the floor General that he is I I agree I don't think we have seen Gafford and Lively both have that big of games at the same time and I don't think that that's probably sustainable if we haven't seen in like that probably think that that was a little bit of an outlier they've the way that that rotation has been working it has has kind of scared me away from it once in the lineup ones out of lineup I know Lively was just he was injured for a little bit and then he took a personality like a day off so there's like a lot of interesting things going on that rotation I think they're both capable and they've shown that all throughout the  year putting up big numbers but I don't think there's like a major takeaway where we can go they got two headed monster or anything you gotta start both of these guys every day Kobe white I think if if you've been playing if you've had him on your team he's carried you this far you're not like you just got to keep throwing them out there and the tides will turn eventually the Bulls  the bulls are the Bulls man they're the as perutha likes to call Alex Bruce of the main editor at RotoWire he calls them the mid 3 obviously Levine hasn't been playing much but it will be in DeRozan boost is the mid three and I couldn't agree with that more on I think  the Bulls like Ayo and Kobe white are bright spots but there's nothing like major here to take away from one bad game no no Kobe's been awesome man like I drafted Kobe  I don't know 100 and something  in that 30 Team league and he literally carried that team I was back from most a year and he's gotten off he's had some really bad first halves where he's bounced back in the second half of the game and still put up a monster line but I mean that game was such a blowout last night it was just sort of a lost cause all the way around so I'm not really too worried about I wish Dallas would figure out  I mean I love Derek Lively but you wouldn't trade it for Daniel Gafford Daniel Gafford is a ring protector he's a veteran he's experienced he knows he knows what he's doing and I wish they would just turn the keys over to him and try to win games and try to move up in the standings and try to get Luke and MVP here because  if they don't start winning and if they don't get past New Orleans they're and when their division he has no shot at winning MVP I don't think so  um  I don't know I don't I don't love what Dallas is doing right now they they should be they played better than I think I expected them to like all season long until the last three weeks  they've been kind of worse than I thought they would they would be right I totally agree with that assessment they've let a couple like winnable games this like last couple weeks slip and then you know when you're when you're not winning the games you should be and you're still losing the game against the better teams it's gonna be tough I think I think like you said if the Mavericks  were higher up in the standings Luca would be the favorite at almost every sports book for MVP but he just can't win it with them that low  agreed  although he still he might it's gonna be a weird MVP vote I think I think there's gonna be a lot of people voting for Tatum and give me a lot of people voting for yoga I think Luke is gonna give votes I think SGA sga's gonna give votes while we're on this topic of for RotoWire we did like a preseason Futures bets and I had I took Anthony Edwards at +3000 for MVP and my rationale was hey man the Timberwolves played really well against the nuggets in the postseason last year  Timberwolves could be like a top three four seed and he's gonna be their best player now they're flirting with the one seed and I'm not getting any love for MVP all I wanted was it to be at some conversations man he's not even on the chart you know I know I was like it went perfectly everything happened and he still not even I don't understand I don't understand why he's not getting  similar love to SGA sga's numbers pop more but  I mean these these defensive plays that that Anthony Edwards has been making lately like that game saving blocking his Pacers is literally one of the best basketball plays I've ever seen in my entire life I would 100% agree I mean it was  reminiscent of LeBron's blocking Iguodala and those in that final series you know like chip game on the line they just an incredible play and when I you know when I'm trying to like justify him not being in the MVP conversation I look back at like the Donovan Mitchell years in Utah with Rudy gobert and he was winning defensive player of the years and they were  flirting with the number one seed in the west a lot of the time and Mitchell wasn't getting any of that love so I probably should have looked back at that history and seeing that like when you have a defensive player like go bare and you're he kind of gets a lot of credit for those winning for winning um but I just want him to Edwards to be in the conversation a little bit man he's been phenomenal and one of my favorite players to watch all you he's awesome I love him too and you know he went to Georgia and I I don't I mean I get go bare and Cat both are there and haven't been years but I mean it's not like SGA not dealing with Chet homegrown and Jalen Williams like  I I honestly don't get it it's just the oh it's Minnesota nobody's gonna win MVP in Minnesota unless it's Kevin Garnett I guess so um yeah that's kind of that's kind of sad and now I'm now I'm sad I'm sorry little side track you're really brought you really brought the whole mood down um Detroit the Charlotte in a game that maybe seven people watched on television last night there may have been nine or 10 people actually in the arena  but this was Sealy meech guy  have you been painted attention to what he's been doing yeah man ever since the like trade deadline he's just been absolutely phenomenal so many injuries to that back court and he's just Paving his way um you know obviously I think it has to be said that he's not like your typical rookie right he is going to be he is like 31 yeah he's already 30 so you know guys and keep your legs or whatever he he's not the rookie stash that you might think he is but it's awesome to watch him on this run  Charlotte  kind of been competing I I hate to admit it you know maybe this gives me some credit as a die-hard but I have Kate Cunningham and a lot of League this year so I've been tuning into those six six pm Central with Detroit versus whoever and you know I regret my life at halftime most of the time but so I was watching a little bit of that game and you know it's awesome to see what he's doing he's floor genitals knocking down shots he's the only reason why Charlotte is like really competitive I know there I know Brandon Miller and Miles bridges are putting up good numbers but Misha to run in that floor General and like keeping them competent  well the Sealy meet you in case you missed it has scored in double figures and all six of his March games he's solid and steals he solid and Boards he saw it in blocks he hits threes  um I I think he's a great pick up right there now trained man  and lamelo ball could come back at any minute and destroy all the Vibes but  I mean if they were going to bring mellow back I think that would have already happened and the fact that trade me and  has been invisible is also of concern and I'm fine with him just running meat shop there I picked him up and some League I think their schedules really good let's look at that real quick Charlotte  to games next week  so meet you she's gonna be dropped next week probably but then 444 after that so they play for this week have any miles roster this week dropping in for next week and then it'll be a free for all to see who gets them for those last three weeks yeah like you said I don't think lamelo is coming back if he would have been they would have brought him back and even if Trey man does come back I still think Mitch gets  a lot of Ron  of finicky of  went crazy last night for Detroit for your Detroit Pistons 17.8 boards three assists or three rebounds two is two steals a block and three three four pointers he's seven alone 11 shots austere was out I think but fantasy check is had a good year man and he for both Utah and Detroit I had him in a in a FanDuel lineup last night that worked out real real nice for me what are you thoughts on him I love it I love everything about him I do have one tragic personal story real quick so over the trade deadline I went on vacation right and that ensuing Sunday so one year supposed to make waiver claims it's like I was on vacation from like Thursday to Sunday and or Thursday to Monday and that Thursday was the trade deadline and he got there was a bunch of Trades going down whatever and so I'm making moves on the plane ride right I'm like oh well I'm gonna drop fontecchio because he's getting traded he's not gonna have a starting spot anymore and this was before bogdanovich got traded out of Detroit right so it's like he's getting traded he's gonna be stuck behind bogdanovich there's like I was only at Ross rostering him cuz he started in Utah and then I go on vacation and I totally forget that I had made all of those preliminary paper moves and so like that's Sunday I'm like oh I don't need to make any moves like like I look at my lineup like contact he was like the only like really droppable guy in my team I don't need to make that move I actually inserted him into the starting lineup because I heard the bad news and then I wake up Monday morning expecting him to be a starter and I had dropped it from that Thursday movement I just never got back to it and I've regretted that decision ever since man he in that I need three pointers and he would just be the three-pointers in steals and he would have just been literally the perfect fit I probably would have started him every single week since then so you know he it hurts it hurts me to see him going off because I deep down I don't want him to succeed so I don't feel as bad about that terrible blunder that I made but I feel connected to him for the rest of the season because of that one move and if I dropped out of the the payment in that League I'm currently fighting for like third place probably could have pushed then pushing for like second place if I would have kept him but he's been phenomenal man and I wish I still wish I would have had him on my lineup  yeah I'm pretty famous for over managing my rosters and then like baseball season gets here  and I I'm like a squirrel or you know like I have the attention span I'm not a dog that sees a squirrel over there and I forget about what I was doing over here now I'm running over there after baseball and like I'll stop managing my teams but I'm so I want to win this 30 Team league so bad then I'm I want to win my rock and roll so bad both of them have Wendy on them  so they both could win and so I'm I'm staying as hyper focused as I can on basketball I'm trying trying not to do anything stupid like that yeah it's not easy for like drafting really good team and then like making terrible weak decisions and  silly blunders on the waiver wire being like oh this is gonna be the best pickup but so where we all make mistakes that's that's part of the farthest of the deals for the fun of it too oh yeah absolutely the Suns beat calves I don't know there's a lot there Devin Booker was back  Katie at 37 Bill had 24  Booker scored 27 even with those three going off Grace and Alice Alan had another good game I mean  who knew the Grayson Allen was gonna be like the MVP of the sun's this year right crazy I so going into the season I did like a little  like best under the radar pickups are like you know draft guys at the end of the at the end of your draft and I highlighted Grayson and Malik Beasley as just guys that  play with stars are great 3-point shooters and they're just going to be sitting in the corner wide open all the time Malik Beasley that's came true but Grayson is just taking that to another level man he's getting Blocks he's ridiculous games at the from Beyond The Arc it he's been a revelation and really the only reason the Suns have been able to like keep up with all these injuries and I think yeah like you said Booker returned and they had their big three and they won surprise surprise I feel like if they have those guys available they're gonna be pretty good the rest of the season yeah and I mean it has helped Grayson Allen that Bradley Beal only has one leg yeah oh yeah absolutely and I mean Bookers missed time too that's helped Alan play a bunch too so he said he said help but man Grace and Allen  unsung fantasy hero this season I would say the nuggets beat the Raptors they were down 22 in the third quarter I was like oh or half-time maybe I was like oh man nuggets might finally lose a game hopefully this means yoga isn't going crazy no joke it's actually absolutely went crazy about 3517 and 12 Jamal Murray had 26 and 12  mpj and Aaron Gordon both scored 19 Michael Ward Jr by the way has been looking very good for the Nuggets that's just in time for their playoff run  so nothing really surprising there from the Nuggets they're good we know this RJ Barrett was back from one game illness  he had a good game with 26/7 and 9 Kelly Olynyk  somebody we probably need to talk about because y'all can turtles done  I got kind of excited about Linux  when I realized that the turtle was done some people give me Flack about that some people think it's fine but I like Kelly Olynyk when he's getting minutes he hit 93 shots  had 24.6 boards a curing is it Kelly Olynyk season  yes I I think if there ever was a time it would be now I know you mentioned pearl is out but so is Scotty Barnes last night there without Gary Trent and a manual quickly I Envision a lot of raptors not playing it towards the end of the season again Scotty Kelly Olynyk just got paid a bunch of money so they're gonna want him to be out not a bunch of money a bunch of money for Kelly Olynyk standard um but you know he's gonna be out there he's gonna be facilitating grabbing boards hitting threes authors if he's available on waivers there's not many guys that have that kind of skill set right now you know so I think it's Kelly Olynyk season and roll with them if you got him yeah I mean he's a guy that I'm gonna be looking at to replace Lively yeah when I pick up that center it's one of those League dude where you  waivers only happened like every four days so you got to put it in and sit there and wait three or four days to go by before it drives me nuts I just open up waivers let us pick up let us pick up guys upgrad dick was in my idea ffs lineup last night as well it sounds like we're talking about something other than fantasy basketball  gradey Dick had 17 points for Rebound seven assists two steals two triples Gary Trent Jr was out a manual quickly was out I'm smart enough to know that means somebody is going to step up  in their place and I figured it might be gradey dick and I rolled with it and he had a great night so I think I saw in the world of war news feed that  quickly he's gonna be out again  and I think like you said a lot of these Raptors are going to missing time so I don't I don't know that I hate gradey dick is an actual just pick up right now  no so a couple like a when he first started getting playing time I think this was a bottom month ago like almost two months ago so like mid-January he started seeing like 15 minutes a game and I'm in like a 16 team keeper League where you keep nine players every year and this was my first year in it and I completely destroyed the team that I took over right I the only guy that I kept was Tyrese Maxey on like a five dollar salary and then I had honest and I ended up flipping the honest Midway through the season because I my team is in competing but I drafted all top five the top five picks in the draft 1B scoot Brandon Miller and the Thompson brothers and so my team has been like  exceeding expectations for rebuild right and I still have like one spot filled and so in that like mid January when he started seeing 15 minutes I picked him up right away as like a potential keeper for next year because you know he hits threes and who knows what the Raptors are going to be like and that I've just felt more and more confidence sliding him into my 9th or spot in that league and now he's like generating relevance and Standard 12 teams this dude like I know a lot of people are going to give them flag for just being like a shooter but I think there's a lot more to his game um than people think and with all of these injuries like I I would be fine rolling with them I think I think it's a risky play he's gonna probably be a little Hit or Miss but he can definitely put up points in a hurry multiple three-pointers in  one two three  in 12 of his last 16  shooting over 51% from the field during that stretch I think he's worth keeping an eye on and standards  all right let's move on to the Celtics and Blazers we'll run through these last few notes I've gotten down here and then maybe answer a few questions before we get out of here  Celtics crushed the Blazer not surprisingly the Blazers and the Grizzlies man I mean I don't even know what you do with them as far as setting lineups or trying to plan in advance or what's going to happen I think you just kind of have to wait and see who who's gonna be out there for them each night because it's it's it's it's something else Jalen Brown and 27 Jayson Tatum at 26 I rolled a dice put in my 30 team lineup because of all the injuries Drew holiday set out Pritchard started his first start of the Season he had 11 points 8 boards ate assist  Al Horford had a full fun stat line because porzingis was out  the Celtics are so good they could just  they could just  put porzingis in the house and holiday if you don't need either one of them they can win both on the bench  so the playoffs  and not lose his step or a game or anything else your guy you're high school was a teammate or rival teammate  teammate  Houser Sam Houser right yes sir 22 points last night sharp shooter let's go yeah  he's been awesome I mean there's a there's a lot of funny stats with him having like the best plus minus the last couple years you know because he plays limited minutes at the end of and they bring out the shooters so his stats get a little bit inflated when they're rolling out that small lineup and he said in threes I think like last year and this year there's been points where he's like led the MBA and plus minus so that I was gives me a good chuckle but he's just such a steady player and a luxury to have Off the Bench like he said when you got two starters out and you can have a guy like that who can just knock down open shots yeah we're talking about Sam Houser you know somebody that like man who are they talking about it sounds awesome I need to go pick him up but no I mean if the Celtics are going to rest rest a bunch of guys how's it going to have he's gonna have a good game he's like gradey dick for for the Raptors sort of Blaze there's got 22 and 15 from DeAndre ayton and I last  Thursday had pretty much determined and was done for the year but man he he is looking good again Simon's had seven teams back I thought might be done um what what's going on in Portland  I don't know I don't like you said I don't know if you can trust any of this but DeAndre Aiden has 52 points and 34 rebounds over his last two games that's pretty good I don't know if this is sustainable I this might just be like one last charge before they're all get shut down again he's only played in 42 games this year so he's not chasing any awards or anything not like you would be in contention maybe there's just some Chauncey Billups old school mentality maybe we want to build something for the future see Scoot and eighteen on the floor together with with Simon's but I  I don't I would obviously if he's healthy and he's available and you're throwing Aiden in the lineup after these last two performance but I don't know if I can trust that I don't I don't I don't trust him  hey when you were talking about Wendy um  did you did you mention the games played thresholds for the awards because the Rookie of the Year does not have  games played okay I did mention that I I just said that he had played in 60 or 57 games or whatever it was I wasn't sure if that was I was over here last week blabbing all about how he's how he's going to get 65 games he's gonna get the word and people are like dude it doesn't matter for Rookie of the Year Rookie of the Year and six man I think I don't think those you need a minimum number of games to win those those awards that I think there's also like if Victor was completely shut down right now and chat went on to play all 82 I think there might be like a even if there wasn't like a rule about it I think that might like sway some voters you know oh yeah I personally I think Wendy's done enough to lock it up right now but like chat on Pace for 82 giving all of the injury concerns and missing last season and even the injury Insurance coming in would be a remarkable feat  I really wouldn't be and I got some teens I did a mock with RotoWire with you guys  that mock draft we did and I I drafted Luka  shit and windy on the same team and then you guys like now we're not gonna play it out it's just that team just sits out there wasting away and I'm it's it's so beautiful and there's somebody else I think Jalen Williams is on that team it's the most beautiful fancy basketball team I've ever seen and it's all for nothing um was that a fan tracks mock  no it was a I think we did it on maybe it was yeah I think it was a ESPN  yeah I tweeted about it a couple weeks ago and I was like oh man this makes me so sad right now um  what's that  Bengals trading joe Mixon to Texans okay  oh by the way we're all very excited here in  in Atlanta to have your boy Kirk Cousins coming over that's fantastic  actually it's better than what we didn't Desmond Ritter but so along with my MBA Duty as I'm also the Atlanta Falcons beat reporter for roadways I do a lot of Falcons updates for them I think it's obviously a huge upgrade over the last couple years but I'm kind of you guys passed on Lamar Jackson last Lamar Jackson dude 20 on the bar last time he's giving Kurt cuz it's also so stupid so most of Falcons e thing ever I call it Falcon Z all right OG Anna nobe comes back for the next tonight hasn't played since January 27th good news for the next and fantasy managers Tyrese Maxey  clears concussion protocol he was out last week which saved me  how big is the hit gonna be on Kelly oubre and and Buddy hield you think um I if I had to guess I think healed was in the starting lineup on the last time they had the lottery Maxi backcourt healthy so they had healed at the three  I think he'll probably stays in the starting lineup he'll get some looks Uber is just kind of one of those guys that doesn't matter what his situation is he could be started in played in 40 minutes and go two for ten and he could place 18 minutes off the bench and scored 25 you know he's just that hit or miss guy on so I think his his value kind of stays the same Uber's value stays the same heels probably drops just a little bit because he's kind of more of a trucker on Maxie was out but I don't think I nothing too major for Uber any thoughts on Donovan Mitchell Paul George and Kawhi Leonard's injuries I have not  had a chance to scour the  injury report this morning so George so George and Kawaii said out the second game of a back-to-back and now they're listed questionable for this next game if they're upgraded to available I think we can just chop those absences up as like maintenance um if they're ruled out I'm gonna get a little concerned Donovan Mitchell is concerning that PRP injection I feel like every time a player gets one of those that's just gonna be a thing he's gonna have to deal with for the rest of the season right like he's getting that immediate immediate relief right now to feel better but as soon as he gets back on the court there's still going to be like that little bit of thing and I think he'll he'll play and he'll play through it I think they're just might be some usual struggles they're there was an ESPN broadcast last time there on I think it was the Cavs and the Nicks and the broadcast was talking about how before he got the injection Mitchell was like nine out of 10 times I would try to jump or I would try to shoot and I would feel totally fine and then that tenth time I would just get no lift and for a guy that explosive that's like really concerning  yeah it is um I kind of think George and choir are gonna play in the next one but yeah I don't know I I mean it's Paul George and quite Leonard I mean  yeah they've been great this year as far as playing through injuries but that history is there and we're pretty deep into the season I don't know man they miss another game I start to panic a little bit the Lakers and the Timberwolves  have two games this week what about skill what a we really need to talk to the NBA about not scheduling these two game weeks in the middle of playoff pushes in fantasy because I know they care a lot about a fantasy managers but and also Rudy gobert mysteriously quietly absent right now after he did the Johnny Manziel money signed of Scott Foster  picked up a massive fine  and now he's he's just disappeared I mean is he secretly suspended I don't I don't know but everybody in the game um everybody for the Wolves right now is kind of iffy cats out the regular season go Bears hurt Kiana since her  your guy your MVP and Edwards is if he was a shoulder injury  so Nas read nazri has been super fun  Silly Season waiver wire pickup of the year maybe  absolutely I'm sorry I had to mute myself my cat was going a little crazy on a scratching post that listeners um but yeah not read his is phenomenal um I feel like there's always just kind of been that long Jam since go bare got there where he liked his production is like a little bit limited and now we get to the full Nigerian experience I'm here for it  um  last thing we're gonna then we're answering a couple questions  came and I got into this last Tuesday last Thursday  if you get the number one number one pick in your fantasy draft and let's say you only have one league so you only get to make  make the number one pick one time  who are you taking number one next year I'm thinking wimpy I know I was on the Serious XM RotoWire show a couple months ago and this was kind of what like when Wendy was still being limited to like 27 minutes after his first ankle injury and I was like I would say top three right I think you got yolk and you got Shea as the one and two and then um there's a couple injury concerns with like and with Anthony Davis and whatever but I'm taking Wendy number one overall man look he his he is played over 35 minutes until it's only three times this year if he ever gets to averaging 33 34 minutes a game they're the numbers are going to go through the roof  five the potential for five plus three pointers and five plus blogs every game is just ridiculous and five deals yeah there's it's it's ridiculous he can do everything um obviously like there's probably a little more safety net with a guy like yolk or um Shea but you know it's called it's fantasy fantasy sports it's gambling and he there's a reason you do it you gotta swing big you gotta win it all right oh yeah and I mean I took wimby everywhere I could get him this year because I was like I don't care if he's as thin as a bean pole I don't care if he plays for pop I'm taking homerun and I'm taking Wendy every chance I get and I'm gonna run him out there and and I'm doing I'm having a really good year and I don't usually roll with rookies but Wendy's different man and I've been telling people about Wendy  you know people who don't really know anything about basketball and telling them about this guy for like two or three years and they're like oh man that kid you told me about this really good in the end like yeah and I mean if I get the number one pick I'm taking me as well now having said that after last night when Matt Smith and his Nicole yokich Squad ran over me and my guys and that holds a 6-3 lead after Monday  I'm having some second thoughts with me doesn't play tonight but  by the time next year gets here like you said  all he needs is 30 minutes a night and to play every every night and it's it's gonna be over yeah and nobody can guard him he doesn't have to jump to block shots he doesn't have to move to steal the ball I mean everything he does he just sort of yeah just goes and gets it he doesn't really even need to the athletic with it it's just nuts well and one sengun had that 45 piece against them the other day everyone's like oh sanguine was dominating him down low but let me had seven blocks in that game and like I get the sengun probably got the better of the matchup that night but for to say that it was like all one sided like Wendy was still getting his like and like you said it's  it's like a dad it's like won the NBA players have those camps and there's like the five year olds and they're like oh I got a crossover just kidding get out of here right when he was the guard it looks like a dad against them three year old and then he's up against Shin it looks like a big brother against a little brother and he was blocking she didn't shots without even jumping so yeah whatever all right  Jeff Martin wants to know  is our Evan Mobley and Vince Williams drops I dropped Vince Williams reluctantly because I want all these four game guys for the playoffs  so I was I was picking up  you know some of the players that we've talked about on this podcast today and making moves and I dropped Vince Williams Mobley I know some people were fired up about him coming back I don't know man I mean  I don't know much I don't know that much about Mobley's injury um so yesterday there was an update that he was  like took off the walking boot and he wasn't in like on crutches anymore which is like a really good sign but like that also means that he's probably still multiple weeks away so if you like you know the playoffs are starting next week um  if you are like need to like I mean it's playoffs for next week you need to win on I think if there's a player that you think can start for you and perform for you a four game player or something like that mobile is definitely droppable Williams like he said would be a little more reluctant just because of his production recently but you can't trust the Grizzlies at all so if there's a now he's hurt Yeah Yeah well yeah and I that's what I'm saying is I think like  is he really hurt like all of those Grizzlies hurt what are the what are they feeding them if they're all hurt like he can be shut down for the rest of the season no matter what and if he's playing like I would be fine having him but you know there's like a back-to-back set and you have him on a four game we can only place three like there's probably another better option out there and 10 or 12 team Lakes yeah there are teams that are being competitive and trying to do things where you can get players from where you don't have to mess with this Portland Memphis thing because it's it's it sucks frankly  dub Force Ones know amen Thompson Gigi accent or Paul Reed needing and replacement for trade man which one of those four guys do you like best  oh it depends on what kind of League this is you're dropping  Trey man on so I would have liked and you're gonna try to pick up Paul Reed that would be kind of interesting um  like we talked about amen earlier he might be getting some more run with sanguine out as soon as like starting now but then he had this illness that he should be back Gigi Jackson we've been talking about Memphis I'll see can you trust him when he's in I would probably I think Paul reads probably the safest move here I don't know how that would work with like your roster or what kind of league but I think Paul Reed  is like he's kind of a hit or miss player but I think he's the safest among these because all four of these are Hit or Miss guys I had pretty big concerns about Paul Reed a couple weeks ago but he sort of eased my fears he's playing better we know him he's not coming back anytime soon I mean in my opinion it's it's Paul Reed b-ball Paul all day right there yeah Delroy Scarlett should I drop Julius Randle and shingun if so what are possible Replacements care and I don't know about you but super open-ended questions like this driving nuts well sure you want to you want to pick up Larry Bird and and Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant I mean it all depends on who's available in your league obviously but I mean I think it's safe to drop shengwen at this point  I don't know I looked at Randall lately  but there was a Shams had a on his like little running back FanDuel show he said oh Janel he was going to be coming back tonight but then he also said Julius Randle was a couple still quite a ways away so I think you find a job both of these guys and for potential pickups we talked about like Kelly Olynyk that that's the guy if he's available in that League I think he would be a perfect replacement for either of those guys for this for the playoffs  Lynnette meet you  yeah and really go out there and look at that the the game scheduler like how many games Everybody Plays per week like put gemski like we talked about place four games every week the rest of the season yeah um figure out what works best in your league and figure out who's hot figure out who's positions not in the most  you know danger and then make moves but and go back and listen to the podcast the gigs I can't tell you everybody we talked about on top of my head but we talked about a lot of pickups today and guys you can help your team so yeah I think we both agree based on the update from Carrie and I just got on you this Randall that you can drop both of those dudes and pick somebody else up  Michael James says thoughts on Evan Mobley coming back by next week or so we talked about that  train man where is tree man is he alive  it is free man alive all right well he plays first Charlotte so I don't know if he's gonna be coming back at all I think I'm just looking to see how many games she's missed at this point he's missed three games I  that's not like a huge like shut down factor or whatever but like we said with meech Plainwell there's just no reason to like really like mess up a good thing  obviously like I know that guys like liked his like immediate production right away when he after the trade deadline when he like came but over over his like last six appearances he's only averaging like 10 points and four assists so he wasn't straight man wasn't like this guy that's like gonna come back and like save you I meet you just putting up better numbers over these last three games so like I don't think you got to be like holding on tight to trade man coming back and saving your fantasy team last one Michael Jane who asked that question about Evan Mobley he's at a bye week next week oh before when the playoffs start in that case I think I would be hanging on to Heavenly yeah definitely yeah the rest of this week he had all the next week and then you'll have news by the end of next week so you'll know something yeah I think that's perfect you two weeks and you know you'll get an update and then you know he might still be limited when he comes back but I  think you'll at least have an update before then and then red Swing juice says a cute Henderson worth pickup and Yahoo points League I don't know man it's Portland  like and like I said Sean's I feel like Chauncey Billups might want to just like  see what they got in these this the young core for a 10 game stretch because they really haven't been able to get it out I'm a huge scooter I followed the G League really closely and he was just such a baller and the jiggly glass year I had really high hopes for him obviously it's been sporadic so I'm a little biased I I would I think scoot could be a guy that like makes a huge impact in the playoffs but he could also be a guy that  loses it fails miserably yeah I don't think he's a must-have player right now but I think you certainly worth keeping an eye on me I'm kind of surprised he's back yeah um and I think we were all kind of jiggly watches last year at least I watched two two games when skew I guess that wasn't g-league but when Scoot and when he played each other I was like oh I'm actually gonna watch off season basketball this is weird so I had an auntie Glee guy that that was really that was like the summer league yeah we were doing like our Vegas Roto wire goes to Vegas during like the MLB All-Star break for like a little convention sort of deal and I was on the I was on my plane to Vegas during that game and we had a TV on our flight and my monitor wasn't working so I'm like leaning over this old lady next to me trying to watch when we in school play because that was like the highlight of the whole summer oh that's a great way to end the show dude that's funny all right well Kyrie and thanks for being here  your last name is Fred your right yes sir and  you are the road to wire guy you and Alex and Nick I'm just I'm just a guy you guys are the guys and this was fun man thanks for doing with me thanks to our sponsor smart bracket Rick Hamlin
