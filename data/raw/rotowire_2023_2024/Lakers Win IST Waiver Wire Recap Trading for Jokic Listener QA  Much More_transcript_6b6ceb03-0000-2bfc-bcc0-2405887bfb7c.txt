welcome into the RotoWire fantasy basketball pod Nick Whalen Alex Borussia here with you on Monday afternoon as we are every week Alex big weekend to recap we got some waiver wire claims to discuss the players that we added drops attempted to add weren't able to add we'll recap the in season tournaments fun conclusion to that on Saturday and then look ahead now to what should be a fairly normal rest of the NBA regular season we won't have confusion over which games count which games don't the NCAA tournament is now behind us but let's start with that I mean how much were you able to watch I know both you and I were a little under the weather last week so you know as a bipartisan significant time on the couch watching a lot of basketball a lot of football took in the Wisconsin Badgers women's volleyball Elite eight win on Saturday but you know Lakers  winning the NCAA tournament outlasting the Indiana Pacers  obviously we had Indiana knocking off Milwaukee we'll talk about all that but let's just do kind of a general you know now that the NCAA tournament is behind us we've tried to check it out on this weekly just to kind of see what the vibe is I think this is going to go down as on balance a smashing success for the NBA at least relative to buy expectations yeah I think I think overall it is a success I was able to watch the bull or excuse me the Bucks Pacers game live I caught the actual Finals game between the the Lakers and the Pacers after the fact and like you know that that 2 p.m. crowd in Vegas for bucks Pacers was pretty sad you know it ended up say I think they ended up saying 15,000 people were there I don't think they were 15,000 people there and you know they dimmed the lights all around the yeah look I I still think they're mostly selling it as a TV product though though and I think it was fine as a TV product I get like you mentioned I think a general success but I have some things that I I think would just it would would be better for them to do well that's what I want to get into in a moment and I want to talk about The Games first and then you know kind of do a what would we change if we were in charge and maybe we will be someday of the NBA in-season tournament I know Tim bontemps from ESPN you know if you're looking a Long Live you could pull up you wrote a good piece this morning just kind of noting some of the tweaks most of which were fairly predictable that we could see in future years but after we've talked about I mean the MBA seems very open as far as talking with teams players sponsors fans to try to maximize this thing well let's start with the final on Saturday and we can do any lingering notes from Thursday 12:23 109 in favor of the Lakers a game that got a little bit dice here that it should have at least to me you know La fell like they were really in control and I think through the first three quarters I could never push the lead above 11 or 12 or forget which number it was but it felt it had the feel of a game that the Lakers were like comfortably up 15 to 20 and then you know all the sudden you know TJ McConnell starts recent sub Havoc he stealing passes in the backcourt and the Pacers had this down  to a one possession game at one point but man I you know it was interesting when they did the  NCAA tournament MVP Trophy presentation you kind of forget that it encompasses the group play games as well I didn't know who was gonna be like Anthony Davis played so well on Saturday that I thought there was at least like a 40% chance that he could have he could have taken home that Award of course it did go to LeBron was that to you the best game that Anthony Davis has played in the Lakers uniform I think to me it's it's in the top three uh it's up there yeah I mean he looked awesome um was obviously great defensively was focused on I mean he still has his shots where he would like inexplicably fade away and like fall down instead of just like he would like spin move and then be open for a dunk and he was like fade which was kind of confusing but yeah 4125 and 4 is and isn't insane stat line  we saw some intensity out of Anthony Davis too we did in the game which you almost never see he was kind of like a home type of thing this weekend you know seeing him freaking out after the game like I don't see this or Patrick was a Davis was I mean especially defensively man you know only had only four blocks felt like more honestly he was all over the place defensively sick excuse me 16 of 24 from the field nine of 13 at the line both teams got to the line to tan it was a pretty slow game Indiana part of the reason they were able to hang around is that I believe that one point they were like 26 of their first 27 from the line so even though the Lakers ended up getting there two more times on balance just some of those came late in the game when they were following but the Lakers were missing a decent chunk of free throws were making them I thought you know the defense for La that's the thing like the Lakers go through these stretches where they just look like an average team but when they have their guys and I don't know who has convinced Camrys to become a good Defender but man I mean the size that the Lakers have I mean it's not only Anthony Davis you know at seven feet LeBron at 6 800 didn't barely even played in this game you know coming back from injury Jarred Vanderbilt like this is this is a team that has some some big big wings to throw it a team like Indiana and I think the you know the biggest accomplishment for the Lakers was not letting Tyrese Albert and control this game which he had done it virtually every other in season tournament Game dating back to group play  yeah I think the Lakers made a concerned effort to Hailey let's trap Halliburton let's make his life as difficult as possible and we'll let other guys beat us which I think more teams May emulate going forward is the Pacers continue to to look good I think  this happens sometimes with teams when they start to have a come up and other teams don't like still don't respect them on The Scouting Report or don't like prep or they don't want it they don't want to like waste all their energy trapping Tyreese Halliburton when they have to play like Yanez the next day or something like that but yeah and a game that is supposed to have a playoff setting this is what you do and and the Lakers are really well I think you're muted  I think this is a blueprint type of game for how the Lakers want to win in the playoffs I mean the defensive intensity intensity was notable it felt like a playoff game I think it was a win for the league that the Lakers and LeBron and everybody else kind of followed suit taking these games seriously I mean it really it didn't feel like the NBA finals I'm not gonna say that I mean even after the game Anthony Davis was like well it's not the real thing but it was still cool to win this which is you know I think about the best attitude the league could expect here but you know again the defensive intensity from the Lakers you know closing out on Shooters they won the rebounding battle 55 to 32 now part of that was you know they held in Indiana the 37% shooting so they were just a lot more defensive rebounds available for the Lakers but even keeping Indy off the offensive glass like TJ McConnell had three offensive rebounds no other Pacer add more than one you know Myles Turner fouled out in the second half and he was completely took him out of the game and he had been somebody who was a big reason why the Pacers even made it this far just a really impressive effort overall from the Lakers you know the PAC  did go 1041 from 3 yeah that's about as bad as it's gonna go for the Pacers they've had some hot shooting nights but on the other side I mean very weird game for the Lakers and that they put up 123 points felt like they played really well they were two of 13 for three 13 three points yeah it's a that's a that's a really bizarre game I mean that's some of that's like Anthony Davis going inside so much LeBron was really focused on getting to the rim that's where those guys Thrive and I think you sort of you see this sometimes depending on the player but during the regular season it's called the opposite of Jimmy Butler Jimmy Butler doesn't take threes are in the regular season and then during the playoffs he starts launching them but like LeBron and AD I think take a lot of Threes in the regular season just because the possessions busted and they don't want to necessarily like recklessly drive to the rack all the time but yeah I thought it was interesting you know the Lakers  to me I mean they played their what is presumably like their playoff rotation yes because Austin Reeves at 28 minutes off the bench but only two other guys saw a double-digits Max Christie would 19 and then Vanderbilt at 16 and hachimura had just nine  yeah I do wonder how much that's going to change and you know I would imagine they they extend Reeves minutes a little bit they've been pretty cautious within you know since moving back to the bench and she's mostly played in the 20s this was not a good D'Angelo Russell game by any means hit a couple big shots you know one of them kind of ended a Pacers run in the third quarter but that's a bad turnovers you started off really slowly I was surprised he actually ended up playing as much as he did down the stretch I thought we might see a little more Reeves reefs that 22 points in the first half by the way I took the over on one and a half made threes for Reeves a over three from Beyond The Arc by putting up 28 that would have been a big one to complete a parlay but you know I think Hatcher probably plays a little bit more in the postseason you know Vanderbilt is somebody that they always they always talk about like he's this Ace Defender and he's a good Defender and then they'll play him we even saw this in the playoffs last year you know the play like 14 minutes in a big game which I think is just kind of who he is and then well the other thing too is you know Gabe Vincent could be back at some point this week in this rotation he was terrible to begin the year I wouldn't be surprised if he's just not in the rotation for now I also don't think we see that much Max Christie and high leverage games like he's fine they trust him on defense he can hit you know Corner threes he had some pretty big mistakes he threw a ball for a backcourt violation at a key spot Anthony Davis who was very upset like it got to the point that on the broadcaster like yeah that's probably gonna get a polled and they actually kept him in the game after that but I'll be interested to see how they mix in Gabe Vincent I for Fantasy purposes I mean even if Vincent comes back this week like unless  you're in a really deep League because they're really anything to worry about their  no I don't think it affects anybody I don't think I don't think gave Vincent coming back is he's not gonna add and I don't think it affects anybody who is fantasy relevant I mean I could see maybe a situation where  Cam registry is going to take a small decline or like Tori and prints or something but  I don't think it's gonna be a big fan of C implication  now they seem to like Taurean Prince as well even when he's not hitting threes they've you know they played him a ton of minutes I think what they like what he brings on defense and they certainly could have used more of that you know player like him last season we'll talk waiver wire in just a moment after that we will hit the live listener question so if you're new here give us a question to the chat we will get to them we'll hit as many as we can at the end so keep those coming we're not ignoring you by any

for me in the RotoWire stake League the RotoWire staff League I made a couple of additions as well but I tell you what man I am in I am in dire straits in my NFP Casey League I despite sitting I think I'm in like 9th right now I absolutely love my team like I really think I have the best team in the league and you know take that with a grain of salt  six of my first nine draft picks are currently injured and will miss at least one game this week like I and another these guys are drawable right I mean maybe maybe yeah talk about whether or not you know Mitchell Robinson or like Marcus Smart like I don't want to drop Marcus Martin he might be back in a week I I can't really drop any of these guys like what's so what do you do in a situation like this in a competitive league where I'll give you the names lamelo ball Marcus Smart Laurie marketing Jeremy Grant Mitchell Robinson Walker Kessler all six of those guys are injured right now and you know the nice thing about the NFP KC's you could you set a Monday to Thursday and then a Friday Saturday Sunday lineup so there's you know some workability there but do I have any other choice but to just kind of eat it for a week I I don't think you do because I don't I don't think Kessler has droppable he's been playing so much better lately I don't think Mitchell Robinson has droppable so yeah I think you just gotta eat it unfortunately it's just it's one of those things in fantasy where every year you know you someone someone posts on Twitter regardless of sport like this is my lineup for this week or like look at this like it's like every player on their roster is heard it one year it's just gonna be you  yeah well and competitive league like that there's just nobody out there you know it's like I  in retrospect I regret not going a little bit higher for someone like you know Dillon Brooks you know I just be psyched to roster right now give it my situation but other than that it's like killing Hayes you know kaminga Drew Eubanks like these are these are considered the top waiver wire options of the week so I think I've just gonna kind of have to wait it out and hope those guys come back sooner than later specifying who's been day-to-day now for like two weeks but did you make any any notable adds any notable drops across your leaks  I really I really didn't you know I didn't I didn't I think the most notable add that I probably should have  tried harder for but I was a little wary of Asia hartenstein he got added for about 10% of the Fab Budget Inn Miami pkc league but you know in the past like Thibodeau has they like Jeremy excuse me Jericho Sims yeah so  like yes I think hardstyle is a must add but don't be shocked if he ends up playing like 26 or 27 minutes a game instead of like 33 minutes a game  yeah I agree they've been pretty hesitant to extend him I think he's just not the type of guy who you know is that effective once he gets above that 25 minute threshold so you know we had a question in the chat about this as well as he must add in points League's like depending on the size of your league probably just because I mean Mitchell Robinson if you haven't seen the news is out what eight to 10 weeks so you know if Mitchell Robinson was out one to two weeks I would say no probably not don't really bother but you got a good two months here where we know for a fact hard science could see more minutes it's just a question of how many more I still think with how dry the waiver wire is in deeper League he's probably a mustad for me I want him I went and got him and in the road wire staff League which is 16 teams I know in the stake leak he went for you know that that's a hundred dollar waiver wire budget I think what you went for north of 20 I believe it might have been even higher than that let me try to find it 29.00 that's too rich for my blood I offered significantly less than that I wouldn't put in yeah I wouldn't give up a third of my fab budget necessarily for hartenstein but again if you're in a deep competitive league I think this is somebody you should definitely add well um  yeah I will mention you know in the in the comments here Christopher Scott says I think Robinson has droppable he's out two months there are a lot of leagues where he has drawable I think if you are in like a 10 teams points League it's completely fine to drop him depends who's on your IR even a 10 team category League I don't hate the idea of dropping him again depends who's on your IR if you have IR space so that's that's a good point to bring up I you know when you mentioned you had Robinson I told you not to drop them but that's a deeper nfkc league and I ah you I mean maybe you end up dropping him I would like to see where you get without dropping them yeah I'm waiting it out for this week you know if I because you know Jeremy Grant Laurie barking in those guys could be back later in the week Walker Kessler could even be back you know later in the week so I might get bailed out of this and I just have to eat it for half of the week which I could live with the problem is in illegal like that he's gonna get snapped up and there's no way our spots but like if you're a good team and you're healthy why not just add Mitchell Robinson to play keep away right and that's that's what worries me it's not like I could just go grab them again in two months so there's just there's not a lot out there on the waiver wire in that league and he's been he's been so valuable for rebounds this specialty that I just I don't feel comfortable right now but you're right it's only depends on the size of your league what about Derek Jones Junior were you rushing out to grab him anywhere I think he was my highest priority at in stake yeah I thought about it um partially you know right now Josh Green is out Grant Williams is out Kyrie Irving is out it's doesn't really have a time table  right now I thought about Derek Jones to be out on his and I just I couldn't pull the trigger it was sort of League specific  I didn't feel really strongly about dropping somebody for him and ultimately at the end of the day he's kind of a specialist who I think might be over his head I think he's out over his skis in terms of like his three-point shooting percentage  and um so I wasn't I wasn't rushing to add him  yeah you're definitely right about the three-point shooting you would expect that to come around at some point I mean is that is that about 40% for the year and he's never shot better than 34% so chances are that over progress I mean he's two of nine over his last two games so maybe that's happening already but again in a 16 Team league where you know waivers are super competitive I feel like I had to grab them especially with Josh Green being out for a week and I think I think there's some longer term viability I'm not saying I'm gonna hold him and start him every week the rest of the year but in this league specifically you know most teams unless you absolutely nailed the auction you got probably two guys you're starting each week that you don't feel good about you know so to me I had I had space to play with you know I was just kind of I was holding Luke Kennard on IR for a little bit I was like whatever else I'll put Market in there all open up a spot so it's not like I I was an easy drop is what I'm saying to add him and Dallas also plays four games in each week for the next four weeks so you know pretty much every team except for like five I think play Four this coming week but pretty big schedule Advantage for him over the next month so I don't I don't anticipate him still being on my roster in March that means he's either playing really well or my team is terrible but I do think there's a good three or four weeks here where he's going to continue to be valuable  I don't think he's a points League guy he's he's point eight fantasy points per minute yeah it's just not going to do it unless he's seeing like 39 which is not I've actually have a start sick question for you can I lob your way and a 16 team or absolutely Al Horford or Andrew Wiggins  man well let me let me pull up the the great schedule tool that we have over at RotoWire did to both teams are both teams have four games this week they both have four games both teams have a back-to-back so I assume Horford's only playing three Wiggins is probably gonna play four  well we'll see if he if he can avoid you know slamming his finger in any car doors this week that's the number one thing to monitor just based on that I would lean Wiggins I just want the extra game even if he only gives you like 12 and 5 in that game you know I think the chances that Horford exceeds that with porzingis back probably not great so I was leading Wiggins but which way are you leaving I think I have to do Wiggins even though I don't want to  yeah I'm happy to get Anthony Simons back in that League let me tell you that much at least yeah he's a great so far Christopher says if you're a Ninth Place you have more to worry about than Robinson you're not wrong about that yeah I do I have like five other injuries that are even bigger than Mitchell Robinson so thank you for that but you are you are correct yeah I'm trying to think who else I added this I mean again a lot of them come on the margins I picked up heart and Stein in the in the staff League I went out and grabbed Derek Jones and that league as well as Isaiah Joe and if you spots just look at some threes and then I do this probably twice a year in the stake league but I did grab a tea Bible and a couple other people that made me feel a little bit better yeah I thought and in the keeper League he's completely fine to have I think a 14 Team league at a four game week he's very startable I'm looking at the added and dropped Trends on ESPN right now we have three guys with double digit percentage ads  Bowie on bogdanovich Kobe white and Anthony Simons I'm not sure how much we have to talk about white or Simon's White's been awesome each he should be agenda and literally 100% League's bouillon is interesting to me I also think he should be roster in 100% a League's given how bad Detroit's playing and the fact that he is their best scorer um right now and Azhar Thompson 11% down and he has not played more than 21 minutes in five games I saw we had a question about him in the chat earlier where are you with a Sara Thompson at this point  yeah Johnny tourbar said picked up a men Thompson what are your thoughts  yeah I mean speaking about a sar first first of all I don't have a problem grabbing a men if you're in a deeper League or you have a you know roster spot just because we didn't really see anything out of him early on Rockets are crowded depth chart but you know I think based on what we saw from usar you'd like to think that he could kind of replicate that  I mean we we talked about a star last week Alex and we've I think we've had two more games since then where the minutes of continued to be limited he's now come off the bench for four straight and even his last started he only played 21 minutes  you know if I'm in a 16 Team league I wouldn't say I'm comfortable dropping him because he showed enough early on that you always worry about the Pistons rotation just changing on a whim because that's what happens they've already done it like four times the season but I don't know how many more you know four points four rebounds one Steel games you can really stop by yeah I agree I think I think if you're in a 12 you have to drop him if you're I mean if you need the spot again you can hold anybody you want if you don't need the spot but yeah 16 team or it's it's  it is really starting to push it um and I wouldn't blame anybody for dropping him I think if you're near the balcony you're standing you have to drop them and try to stream someone else in  that's unfortunate and it's as far as a man I mean I don't mind grabbing a man um as a flyer but to start the year you know he was barely seeing I mean he's only seeing 17 minutes a game to start the year and they're playing so well right now I don't know exactly who he dislodges for playing time yeah um maybe Aaron holiday you know he's been seeing more minutes but I don't know he seemed like it's because he's playing well so it's hard to say if I'm grabbing a man it's got to be a deeper league and I'm not playing on starting him right away he should play by the way tonight he's off the injury report so at least be available I think that'll tell us a lot right away right you know did they do they even throw them out there is even part of the rotation initially you know Houston is home for the Spurs so that yeah that actually could play in his favor if that turns into a blowout one way or the other likely in favor of Houston we could see him in the second half and for what it's worth me he played in the G League last week 29 Points on 26 shots 16 boards 11 assists three Steals and two blocks and 40 minutes  he's really good man I mean he is supposed to be the better Prospect than a sar so I think that's why you have to consider picking them up and like you said he played really well in the G League  all right I still want to talk more in season tournament well we'll hit that later in the Pod but let's get some questions here Jordi asks do I drop scoot Henderson in a 12 team league with eight categories  I've been pretty Pro you don't need to roster scoot this whole time you know there will I think there will be a time that a place when he's seeing enough minutes you know maybe they trade Malcolm Brogden you know he did play 30 minutes against Dallas the other night that's encouraging  still I still don't know quite how much you can read into that you know Simon's being back and looking like himself right away you know I think that's not going to help him and Brockton obviously did not play against Dallas in their last game so that's a big part of the reason he saw that and it's booze  you know eight category leaks I feel a little bit better because you don't have to worry about the turnovers he's been you know very high turnovers permitted you know the fouls are still an issue for him which is just doesn't happen to rookie cards it's very strange but I like if your roster Henderson like what are you hoping for like what's the category that you're like this is why I need you  probably assists I would assume right assists I think so I think so yeah 4.1 game in limited minutes so if you're like that's really need assistance I could see it  he's not giving you consistency deals you know the rebounds have been about what you'd expect and you're eating a pretty bad field goal percentage as well I mean on the year he's down to 34% I mean that's keyate George range yeah I think I think your base I think you're almost literally hoping for keyonte George by holding scoot Henderson and people have asked like should I drop keyonte George for scoot Henderson and it's like  I think scoot Henderson again it's probably like screw Henderson's upside might be out today George the season so you know yeah I I think you're fine dropping him honestly it's I don't if it's not happening now maybe it happens later in the year but at some point you can't plan for later in the year all the time I just I don't know you know in a 12 team league is anybody immediately snatching him up you know it's like I think I think there's a you never want to play this game it's you know Roulette in some ways but you could probably just pick them up later right I don't know I just I think right now there's just not a whole lot of upside maybe if you want to if you want to wait and see on Malcolm Brogdon you know hopefully we get something a little bit more definitive on him you know there's they're saying he's day-to-day going into tonight's game against the Clippers they do have a four game week but after that they have a three game weeks you got to think about that as well and I believe it's a three game week the following week as well so  you know if you're using them this week you could potentially justify it on four games just misses two of those but after that you're not starting about two back-to-back three game weeks anyways so we probably talked too much about this one but I would be comfortable dropping him all things considered is what would be my final answer  let's see who should I put in my utility spot for the game later tonight a star a man or Sohan  probably so on right  I think so you know I'm not so hot guy but I think a man is way too risky right now not just yeah knowing like again he might not even play we don't know yeah I'm on his way too risky I saw her hasn't played more than 21 minutes and five games and Sohan came off the bench two games ago but then they put him back in the starting line if you play 34 minutes is he playing that well no but he's still a good chance he's gonna play 30 minutes so do that  yeah last 15 games were so on 12 and a half points five boards four assists really not giving me anything on defense 46% from the field 44% from three 83 at the line so he's not he's not killing it but he's not harming you in any category either and I think he's gonna give you the highest floor you know if that's what your you're looking for  Paul asks should I rush and try to move the players on possibly taking teams this is a good question very pressing question one that I've had to deal with you know you're talking about Utah Portland Detroit's San Antonio teams like that  you know is there any specific team or rotation that's worried you most so far Alex like I want to say we're early enough on that it shouldn't matter but I mean all those teams I just named I've already pulled some hijinks  if they're veterans  I think you have to think about it like if you're if you're rostering Jeremy Grant like I am I would maybe try to move off for that um you know the Jazz have talked about like marketing maybe is available I don't know if I would I won't necessarily mind moving off of him  the Wizards guys I don't know they're all pretty young relatively speaking I want to be as worried about that  I'm always gonna have to kick a moving off of Gorgon Hayward in Charlotte  as far as the Pistons go like I think you need to squeeze what you can out of Bowie on bogdanovich and then try to move them I sell High Point  but if the yeah the overall question is like yes but don't  don't take like 60 cents on the dollar you know try to get like 80 or 90 seconds on the dollar for these guys right and don't yeah like you said don't accept a bad trade if we're still we're what 23 games into the season you know it's like if we were at the 60 game Mark yeah then I think you might you almost might be to your benefit to accept a lesser deal because you worry about that shut down coming I think we also have to keep in mind and I'll be interested to see how much you think the spiders Alex not a great draft like there's not there's not a weapon Yama that teams are shutting it down for right we have there's like six guys right now that could be the number one pick I mean this might I think at this juncture right now this is probably the worst draft since the Anthony Bennett draft and I'm always up the mind that players emerge yeah we'll feel a lot differently come April May June so I'm not saying it's just gonna be a terrible draft with no talent but there's not a prize and there's not there's certainly not two or three prizes where you know you're like oh great we got the third pick that's awesome we'll just we'll take our pick of the three good prospects like as of right now it's a total crapshoot do you think that really matters does that affect tanking at all  um I mean I can't I can't really speak to the class I haven't heard great things about it you would know more than me but like you mentioned I haven't heard anything great does it affect things  sort of I mean there's still because they're still a point where you know they flattened the draft odds but teams are still I think gonna jockey to get within that lowest  draft odds if that makes sense like they want to get over the threshold but once they're in that and once they're locked in that I want to be surprised if they start playing more they're young guys again and like don't like sort of like revert don't tank at some point but um yeah it's not as it may not be as dramatic as in years past  got offer Julius Randle for the Unicorn Chris Staples porzingis what are your thoughts  that's an interesting trade Randall over the past  two weeks  and I had a double check this is ranked 14th and 8 cat  after starting the year like complete garbage  I mean while President well first thing is only played one game  over that stretching on the year he ranks 40th  um you got offered was that you you got offered Randall well I guess it doesn't matter I believe that was the wording yes so you'd be giving up KP to get Randall  I  I'm fine with having Randall to me that's fairly even because Randall is less of an injury wrist he basically never gets hurt and I think he has top 50 upside this season he's after his really slow start I think he's he's fine now  and Forza ranked 40th and I think that's pretty accurate in terms of why I think he'll do the rest of the year  so  I think it's it's personal preference but I'd be fine taking Randall for sure  yeah I want the Randall side of this we've already seen porzingis have his first injury of the Year kind of feel like there's a second one coming at some point and you said it with Randall first 10 games of the year 34 percent for the field 70% from the line 25% for three I mean it was worst case scenario shooting wise but he's still he's still giving me counting stats you know 18 ten and five every night with the steel since that that 10 game start last 11 games 51% from the field 75% at the line 37% from three so maybe he settled somewhere in the middle I'm not saying he's going to be 51% the rest of the way but I think he's shaking off that started and you know the numbers have been fantastic just the raw numbers 25 nine and six over the last 11 he still playing a ton of minutes you know the Nixa team that yeah you don't worry about that tanking you know they're kind of have to scratch a closet to get where they want to be in the Eastern Conference and you know to me that the biggest tiebreakers just one guy misses 30 plus games every year at the other guy plays 70 plus every year so I would take Randall  Nicholas asks 14 team 9 cat League I have Keegan Murray my IR is it worth dropping either scoot Wiggins or Dinwiddie in order to activate Keegan Murray Alex I know you have didn't witty too so how do you feel about his back tragically I've become the din Wiki guy even though like I don't even really like Den Woody but I do have him yes but you know he's actually been fine with with Camp Thomas back which has been interesting you know his sister down a little bit  but I was shooting is always up and down I would rather look all of these three  I'm definitely not dropping in Woody I think you're fine to drop either scoot or Wiggins  and I wouldn't think too hard about which one to drop  its a 9 cat League depends how sense like if you are to turn over is I guess and how badly you want to assist I think you so here's what I'll say unless you have a strong opinion on this nickel well say is just like  look at your categories look at look at how you're doing in each category what do you want do you want assists are you low on assist if so keep Scoot and drop Wiggins do you need just points if so you know drop keep Wiggins that kind of a thing but yeah yeah I think you said it right the other thing I would consider is vehicle percentage you know are you right are you struggling in that category is your team shooting like 44% of the field Scott's not gonna help you there any time soon so that you know if you're looking for a tiebreaker that's maybe where I would I would check into Paul asks should I Rush Oh no we already talked about that one psyche that one as well Dave asks got offered Jimmy Butler and DeAndre ayton for Karl Anthony towns should I take it interesting two for one year  um  Butler and for cat I think I would take that  I think yeah I think so I I love cat I also think we you know we saw kind of an extended version of cat when Anthony Edwards missed a couple of games  the scoring upside is just not the same when Edwards is there I mean obviously go bare as just you know taking his rebounding back to Utah levels like I think that's her towns a little bit and that category I'm not a big eight guy you know we just talked about the risk of you know bringing in somebody out of bad team like Portland  I also don't I don't have a hard time seeing eight and get really shut down until the very end of the year like it's not a team that you know they don't have like a I don't know I don't want to say the name James Wiseman but some like young Center behind it but they want to get a look at like Aiden is still kind of that guy right he's like he's still young like I think you still want to see what you have him I think this is a good enough deal I mean Butler and Cat are comparable fantasy players right and I think Aiden is enough of a sweetener even though I prefer cat over Butler I would take the two side of this one yeah I think that what makes this tough is like cat has been awesome lately past month he's ranked 9th and 8 cat and Butler's ranked like 40th and 8 and 90th right so I'm I think on paper like what they're doing right now it makes it seem like the cat sides a win but the two for one is like when you're getting guys again Butler does have some I think similar upside on a week to week or month-to-month basis is cat and  eight minutes been solid so yeah I think I would take the two for one  all right we got another scoot Henderson and Jason's question JJ Stylez with a z asks do I drop Santi aldama for heart and Stein other potential drops would be scoot or keyonte George  not bald Dahmer um maybe yeah I'll Thomas so weird man I I wish I could make sense of Santi aldama he almost won the most confounding players in fantasy  but they need him because they're rotation sucks and you know I  without knowing exactly what kind of League you're in  I think I would  man I mean do you have a do you have a strong lead on this I think you should pick up hartenstein  I I would worry actually probably the most about dropping aldama I don't think I would we talked about Scoot a lot  I might prefer to drop scoot to be honest with you but yeah that's right lean as well I'm also not the biggest George guy I mean the minutes are going to be there with him so that's scares me but again field goal percentage is terrible High turnovers I would want harvesting  with Alma it's like does does jaw and Marcus Smart returning in the next week or two does that matter for him at all you know positional overlap but just adding two guys into the rotation who are gonna play 30 to 35 minutes  um I don't know because if anything I think that's just like I mean I'm looking at their minutes over the last five games David Riley's playing 25 minutes Jalen Noel who's not a 10 day is playing 25 minutes Vince Williams is 24 minutes like these guys don't he's guys are not NBA players like they should not be an MBA rotation for a good team so I would be more worried about those guys losing bets I think Alamo is relatively safe  they should be getting Jake later if you back this week as well so that might be a more you know one to one comparison he was playing about 15 minutes a game I mean it was like one week and then he got hurt so tough to say but yeah in general I would say try to so what are we agreeing on key part-time and keep bellama oh yeah I think yeah yeah all right another hard side follow-up do you Adam and attend team category League  I think you have to add him and then just see what happens yeah um but again so to for reference  last year he started how many games is this eight he started eight games last year and only played 24 minutes a game in those starts  um and was averaging six seven and one with like a stealing a half a stock and a half  so  some of this depends on again how much do they how much does Tibbs want to play Jericho Sims how much you know how many minutes because  you know New York has this  they have this backcourt Log Jam right like we've heard we've heard Grimes complaining about his role we've heard Josh Hart complaining about not getting enough touches you know my concern would be either Sims gets those makers so they start playing Julius Randle at backup center so they can more minutes for heart and more minutes for demon chenzo more minutes for quickly more minutes for like the back court I still think you add heart and shine just to see because we know he's like a permanent monster but  don't  don't drop  like a known 10 lead 10 team commodity for him don't do that if there's a fringe guy sure yeah  the other thing I'll say about heart Stein is a lot of the reason that we liked him during his Clipper stays was he was a very good passer you know two and a half assists in like 17 minutes a game  the assist raid is way down so it's coming to New York right and it's down like 5% Edge points he's basically cut his assist production in half the last two years in about the same and it load and I think that's just by virtue of you know playing it with Randall Barrett Brunson heart like he just got other options quickly they don't really they don't run things through him right not that the Clippers that's really were but you know the assists were a big part of his staff profile and it was always like if you could play 30 minutes you know he might be four assists the game on top of a block and you know 0.8 Steals and ten points at 10 boards but yeah the assistant just aren't really aren't really there for him so I would stop stop short of saying he's a mustad in a 10-team league but if you have the roster spot like if you're the guy who lost special Robinson then yeah absolutely  yeah all right long one here from Johnny should I drop Jeremy Sohan in a 10 team nine cat League I have Halliburton dejounte Murray Rozier kuning DeAngelo Russell Jimmy Butler kuzma herb Jones saddiq Bey amen Thompson Derek Lively Brook Lopez porzingis Anthony Davis Marc Williams so it's basically it's so hot the drop out of all those guys  I think a man is the drop  personally yeah and attend Team league you don't really need to be rostering men you know I don't I guess like what are the chance is that two weeks from now we're like oh man we gave some really bad advice like he's playing a ton of minutes like I don't know I think Houston be an injury or they need to take a downturn because I think they're pretty happy with where they're at and I don't know that playing a rookie 25 plus minutes at night is gonna get them where they want  yeah I mean  yeah another thing without men who even if he does see let's say Amen sees 28 minutes a game you know because they like him  the ball is still going to be in Fred Van Vleet hands Jalen Green's touches Shane goon like the usage might not necessarily be there maybe you'll be Steals and blocks guys you can get assistance transition all that stuff but um you know Sohan I think is that a lot as a lot higher floor yeah and you know Json Tate is in the mix for this team as well like he's still getting 15 minutes a night off the bench like yeah I think it says a lot that even with a mint Thompson out for a month and a half like can't Whitmore didn't sniff the rotation you know a guy who looked really good in some religion as a pedigree so you know I meant Thompson hasn't even bigger draft pedigree they have an investment in him I'm not saying that he's just gonna sit the G League all year like that's not gonna happen but I don't I think there's a there's a big gap between showing some flashes now and then and you know being fantasy viable in a tent or a 12 team League  used to have says hi guys what's up Yusuf I got an offer  Butler ayton PJ Washington for McCall Bridges Derek Lively and Austin Reeves 12 team 9 category League  what let's put the Butler and eight in packages their second second one of the everyone's trying to move off of those guys  I think I  prefer the  butler 8 and PJ's side  but yeah  I think I want that side of it you know as always depends what you need McCall Bridges is heated up lately yeah that's certainly somebody I want on my teams but I think  you know McCall Butler and eaten are pretty clearly the three best fantasy players in the deal so if you can get two of those that's fine with me and you know Butler and bridges are pretty comparable  yeah the to me this one feels like assess your roster like why are you doing this trade like why would you are you do you need two big men you know because you're basically giving up a forward and a guarding a big man for two players who should qualify three players you should qualify it forward so sort of assess your roster needs their okay we have a request to just talk about TJ McConnell no sweat says I just love that dude with a little smiley face emoji look I'm still holding him in the stake League I tried to drop him three weeks in a row and with the way that the waivers waterfalls has fallen he's still on my roster I you know there's always like a week or two throughout the season where it feels like everybody roster's in you try to capitalize on the Steels you know whenever whenever Halbert is out which is not going to be very often he's gonna have a chance to be like you know 15 7 and 7 because he gets you the assist he rebounds very well for his size and obviously the steals are the main thing I don't really like TJ McConnell just because he was on that Arizona team that was in played two years in a row both years they went to the final four won both of those games but I developed a hatred for baseball everybody on that Arizona team but with that said I respect him I mean the fact that he's hung around this long and the NBA and is a guy that every team would want you know I can't say I have too much against him  he's a very good player always makes his presence felt on the court for sure very good pastor a good hands on defense Yeah Yeah you mentioned it and a 16 Team league he is hard to drop because if Halliburton does get injured for two weeks McConnell's gonna pick up like top 16 numbers for sure a board today realistic expectations for hartenstein I think we covered that thank you for the question either way talked a lot about hardenstein you know I think we cited a lot of the numbers from last year assist being down just no guarantee you know that he's a 30-minute guy someone related question here and we'll do this one quickly because we've talked about both these guys a ton someone just dropped Mitchell Robinson something I need to consider do you think it's worth picking him up and dropping scoot to do so  that's a really interesting question well there's an IR spot  yeah  I mean Robinson this year is he's playing well but he's ranked like one Sixteen on the whole year so  I mean  it would be fine to do that but  let me know can you can you wait two or three weeks or is there a fear that somebody else grabs it  I think someone else might have that's not for a couple weeks yeah again always 14 Team league I think somebody probably grabs him right I mean if if he was dropped in the stake league would you pick him up today he was dropped in the stake leak in a 16 Team league  with an IRS  yeah I think I would but my team is I might be a bad person to ask because I built this really balanced team so I don't I don't have like a clear drop for him although I could drop Wiggins for him I would do that probably so I guess if you Wiggins and Scoot equally which I think we may be talked about on a previous  question then  it's probably fine to drop scoot for for Robinson but I don't think it's like a league winning move or legal losing move either way  thoughts on Harrison Barnes rest of season 16 team 9 category League  I would type in Harrison Barnes gotta be rostered in just about every 16 Team league yeah yeah he's too he exactly and a 12 team or he's a streamer in a 14 team or maybe a streamer 16 team you have to roster him yeah yeah I mean even if he's kind of not somebody or excited to start four game week he's gonna give you know 13 points four or five boards you hope maybe you steal a couple of Threes like you he's become like the super streaky player like he'll have he'll have weeks where you know earlier in November he had a five-game run where he was like close to 20 points per game he's reigning in a bunch of Threes he's getting to the line and you know then the next night he'll take three shots in 34 minutes like he did against warlands in the NC's tournament so you know it's it's going to be a little bit back and forth with Harrison Barnes but yes 16 Team league you gotta have them  just as we speak Johnny says I got offered Klay Thompson and Myles Turner for Deonte Murray and Chris Staples for zingus I'm not a fan of this trade offer but I'd like to hear your thoughts  don't do that  absolutely do not do that Klay Thompson might be  you could drop Klay Thompson I mean like there there in 10 Team league you don't even have to roster Klay Thompson so you're basically being traded Turner for John Murray and KP no that's awful tray offer  all right Marvin osai says I'm playing a 12 team category League I got offered Giannis for sabonis lamelo and Kauai do I do it LOL ah no absolutely not a cat lady and you know you're waiting for the Kauai injury labellos out who knows how long in a category League I wouldn't do it I mean this is a monster but we know about the pitfalls there would you do this at a point sleek  no no maybe that's too much too much  don't do that if somebody if you're on the other side of this and somebody's offering you that trade then yes do it  is Malcolm Brogden a drop 12 team category league for context Brockton missed the last game he's kind of day-to-day  I still probably wouldn't drop him in a 12 team or in if I would do it in like a 40 I mean  10 Team league maybe maybe I don't know I still wouldn't drop them I mean maybe I mean he's ranked 113th right now he's averaging 1.1 fantasy points per minute like that's like a 10 team guy no don't drop him but sell High when he comes back and plays well we always preach sell high on Malcolm Brockton I will stick to that yeah now's not the time Henry appreciate the Super Chat by the way that was a part of the heart attack question happy to help there hopefully we gave you some actionable advice uh let's see we talked about the Tank teams  I traded Jaren Jackson Jr for Rudy gobert well I regret this trade later in the season very good question  you might you also might not  yes these are the two options  look I don't blame you for that I think Nick and I talked about last week how  I think he's I think Triple J's going to start playing better offensively when Jaws back I I think it's too easy for defenses to focus on on Jaren Jackson right now which is part of why I think he's struggling offensively I think that will get better he's also blocked the fair among his shots lately too  I don't think let's look at this way you might regret it I don't think you're losing your league because of it if that makes sense like I don't I don't think you would be like you might you might have won the league and now you're taking like fourth I don't think it's working those situations  I do think part of the question is like all right let's start it from today who who plays better at the rest of the season I still would put my bunny on Jaron Jackson like I want to see him with John Morant and you know this whole theory that not having jaw for 25 games like you know Jared Jackson's gonna be going crazy he's like the code number one with Desmond Bane  I think we were reminded that Jared Jackson is just not a Premiere offensive player that was clear like a weekend of the Season he has been much better of late I will say that as someone who has them on a couple pretty important teams like I've always he's somebody on monitoring as closely as anybody and you know he scored a lot better of late you know if you over his last 10 games and this includes a 4-point game against Dallas when they just got or you have five fouls and like barely played you still 20 five and two blocks you know the field goal percentage to me is the biggest killer though in category League's he's never been like a great field goal percentage guy by Center standards but he's at 50% last year he's at 43% this season part of that is a 3-point shooting being down and you can live with that if he's giving you three blocks a game if it's only 1.5 to 1.8 that feels like a stands out a lot more  yeah I think  I understand why both people did that trade so we'll see that's gonna be interesting I go Bears been a monster by the way this is been like what my very few like early season Victory laps is that I I got gobert in a ton of leagues because nobody wanted him I got I think I got up for like seven dollars or something in the stake League after buying him for like 20 dollars a year ago that's looking pretty good you know that he had like a six block game the other night the blocks have still not been  I don't think he's ever getting back to Utah level in that regard but just you know the scoring spent better the efficiency has been better and the rebounds especially have been huge for gobert were you are you surprised by what you've seen from him so far  um yeah I'm relatively surprised I don't think I'm rostering him anywhere so I suppose I was I was a little bit in the group where I wasn't  assuming a huge bounce back I was certainly willing to draft him like a discount book it just never happened but yeah he looks amazing  Jose asks he got yokich  in a category League that's good I was like that but did he give up too much out he got him for Anthony Edwards Jaron Jackson and Jordan Poole  oh um look pool has been so bad I almost don't even want like register him as part of the trade  man  is it fair I think it is fair  because if we are assuming Jaren Jackson plays a little better maybe he's more like a 30 or 40 Frank guy Aunt man's like a 25 to 30 guy yoga just amazing it's it's really hard for me to drive to like value three for one trade it's like this but my gut tells me it's relatively fair for both sides  when you factor in that you have to overpay for yokich  it becomes more palatable like to me you know Edwards plus here in Jackson you're like man that's a lot but there's a tax on yogic you know it's like you almost can't trade for you okay or you know and bead or SGA I think Albert's almost reaching that point as well you know like you have to you have to overwhelm somebody if you want that guy in a trade so considering that you had to do that and you know you're almost never going to get through the fair value for a player like that yeah it's kind of mirrors the real MBA and so in some ways right when you see these like four future draft picks and two young players it's like if you want one of those guys you got to pay up so I don't think you take your season there and you know you could just have like the worst week of his his fantasy career and still you know obviously a God so yeah I think it'll be all right there I think the only thing I would hurt you is if Jaren Jackson goes back to be in the guy that he was last year you know maybe you would regret it but I don't think it's gonna change the direction of your season  would you bench giddy or monk for today in a points League bunk has a GTD tag I would just wait if you can I mean we don't like we have no games starting until 6 oclock obviously okay see plays at 8 p.m. Eastern and mug plays at 10 p.m. Eastern so I guess you have to I would just wait until you have a status update on monk I would rather play him than giddy at this point you know monk is kind of its kind of in that Jordan Clarkson mode now where like the points are reliable is giving you some assists so get some steals some threes and kitty man I I'm glad we could just talk about him the basketball player and it seems like nothing's gonna happen at least for now with all the off the court stuff  and what do you think with him I mean the minutes have been a little concerning of Lady he's still starting every night but he's under 25 minutes a game over the last 10  you know he's still like  producing relatively speaking within his minutes but yeah I mean the way Houston guarded him that other that that game um where they put sengun on them and they just dropped off of them and pretended he didn't exist I think I think other teams are gonna start doing that because Oklahoma City is a general really good basketball team and people have to start game planing against them obviously you know I for tonight I wouldn't necessarily mind playing giddy because they played the trash Utah Jazz and monk is ill so it's possible he he's not feeling 100% Brooklyn's better than you thought it's a tougher matchup so I think tonight I wouldn't mind getting but going forward I assume you'll probably want to play monk more monks playing really well right now yeah it's just for tonight maybe lean giddy if you have to lock it in for the week I would I would still probably lean monk Dynasty question  12 team had to head category Dynasty League should I trade Aaron Gordon for Draymond Green or Brooke Lopez  if you're making that trade you're probably trying to go go in this season I mean Lopez is 35 gorgeous 28  I don't know if I really want Raymond right now Warriors are just not really a good basketball team at this point and you know his fantasy value as dropped off quite a bit the last few years Lopez has been awesome you know if you're trying to push for it this year I think that's that's the guy I would try to get I I would absolutely trade Aaron Gorgon for Brooke Lopez honestly I won't even think I would just do it because Gordon is a borderline 12 team roster Bowl player flat out like and I don't think he's getting any better through August career he's pretty locked into his role and we've seen what Lopez's upside is like I wasn't worried about the ages here I would just do it  okay fun one from Skeeter 12 team 9 category League he asked us to pick a side  Halliburton and Barrett or Maxi and Garland  Maxie and Garland  yeah I don't think Barrett's a must roster player  I think the question is how Burton that much better than Maxi that it made it more of it yeah that is the question but if you're talking about two guys who are like top 40 upside and Maxi has like top 25 upside if not higher than I I would just rather have those two guys yeah yeah I feel like I feel like Garland has become a little underrated like there's just been no no Darius Garland talk this year the cows or this fun team last season up and coming and they're fine they're kind of doing what they were last year in some ways but you should be barely been talked about Donovan Mitchell is that player so far the season Garland barely inside the top 50 right now in eight cat I I still I would be buying him right now rather than trying to sell yeah I think I think so I think an important thing to note with these you know with the  these two for one but not for one trade but like  still it is category League's and um  rankings matter to an extent but really what we're still talking about is like adding up numbers like you're with Halliburton you're trading you know you're trading 25 points and 12 assists and with Garland you're getting back like 20 points and eight assists and then with Max so you're also getting back like you know 25 points and so like it's still is like a numbers game at the end of the day and so you're you're getting just a ton of extra points against us with Max and Garland and um yeah so I would I was just lean at you do this one quickly hold Wiggins points League  I don't know probably not probably not necessary I just  I actually was a sucker and thought that Wiggins would be a value this year because he was going so late too I thought you know people are reading into the end of last year he had that weird we still don't really know what was fully going on off the court just all that time but he's he's been a shell of himself and there was that ESPN story a couple weeks ago that said you know people within the Warriors are frustrated at his lack of conditioning like that's that's kind of a red flight tickets that's never been something that you question with him and yeah this this Warrior scene  I'm not write him off you can't you can't write off the Warriors but it's just yeah not good vibes right now and we can certainly isn't helping let's see  who should I consider picking up  Jaime Hawkins Junior the real Triple J or Caleb Martin very interesting question I I don't know if there's an answer here because the heat are just constantly in flux with this rotation Caleb Martin's been awesome I already regret not I think I fell a dollar short of getting him and in steak last week and on waivers you know he's  he's kind of looking like he wasn't in the finals last year I mean I don't think we're ever going to get back to to that level but last six games for him 18 points five and a half boards three assists one combined steel block you know shooting well from three Am I Wrong to still kind of want hakas I don't the question is like who has more staying power right because I think I think the fantasy Rank and the value is going to be pretty comparable it's just who's playing 28 minutes versus who's playing 20 minutes  I'm with you I think if they played an even amount of minutes for the rest of the year that hakkas would be better  jaquez ranks better from a per minute standpoint so note that  border yeah part of me does want hot guys I but  Caleb Martin has played well lately I wish I could I wish I could waffle waiver less but I think I would lean Hawkes  I love it it's a close one it's a close one that's closed  its Trey Jones a pickup now that Sohan is the longer the starting point guard  you know I mean  so so on started the last game I don't think I don't think we can say he's no longer the starter the Spurs are just kind of weird team right now and yeah everything could could kind of change on a whim  I  I don't know I I have been of the belief that Trey Jones is a better point guard for this team  you know I think the women now the thing is like he would just clearly benefit from playing with a true point guard and I think doing this so hot experiment along with tried to development is just a really tough combination so let's just put it this way if you're if you had to roster one of these two guys for the next month who would you rather would you rather have  I think  I think I would rather have  dohon maybe  I don't know actually  I think I take Trey Jones I just I'm not so on guy I can't do it  I don't know I mean just in the framework of this question I trade Jones I think is a soft add I think he is a 16 team roster player and probably has been almost all year to be honest with you just from like a upside standpoint and I would consider him like a soft add a 14 Team league yeah  okay good question for court Del I was hoping we would address this today I said I'm six and one I've managed to keep Russell Westbrook at the Battle of my roster do I drop or hold how long can the big three remain healthy in LA  that's a big question right because I think if you if you take Health out of the equation  I'm pretty comfortable dropping Westbrook you know he I was blocked some shots lately that's nice but the assists are way way down the minutes obviously our way down he's played under 20 in three straight I would lean toward drop here but again you know if I'm not really worried about hurting getting hurt like you know for his first much as we accused of being out of shape he actually is not really missed a whole lot of time you had the hamstring but that was about it I guess you know if Paul George are quite let her go down how much does that directly impact Russell Westbrook  I think it does um I think he would get more minutes but they could also try to throw more minutes the way of like Terrence Mann and Norman Powell and who knows about bones Hyland maybe he gets back in it's funny at first I read this question as I'm six foot one and I'm like oh is this like real basketball question like should you should you work on your post game no problem I mean maybe if you're playing pick up at the why well I will say if you if you want to report you know like the Russillo pod you want to you want to give your height and weight with each question that's totally fine you know if you want to do an MBA cop we're good with that  it points League I'm actually okay holding because his points fantasy points per minute are still pretty high and since he started coming off the bench he's actually still averaging 25 points fantasy points per game which to me is like a you can have that guy on your bench maybe in a 12 team or ten team or it's borderline and a category League  I think he's probably a hole in like I'm okay holding him in 14 teams honestly I am just for that upside but deeper than that I think you're probably gonna get similar value streaming just don't be shocked if someone picks him up and you drop them at 16 team or because people love Westbrook all right we're at we're past the one hour mark so we'll do a few more of these we'll try to go quickly and then we'll be out of here  good question though it's just fun trade question would you do fox and Brockton for Trey Young  box and Brogden for Trey  um wow  yeah because the Brogden you know we always talk about selling high on Brogden and this would be this would be the one  he's just playing so well right now like he  I'm okay with this trade I'm okay I'm okay getting Trey young I will say in nine cat fox actually ranks ahead of Trey Yuen  the turnovers flip it interesting so something to note you know kind of depends how you're doing in that category trees at 3.8 turnovers per game foxes at 2.3  pretty sizeable difference  yeah I this this ultimately you know these trade questions are hard a lot because it kind of depends on your league settings um you know Trey young is 48 fantasy points per game and I'm checking on Fox right now 49 fantasy points per game so if you're a points League don't do this you know keep Fox and Brockton if you're an eighth cat or don't care about turnovers I'm okay with it but yeah yeah I think the other the other big comparison is feel free throw percentage you know Trey young great free throw shooter gets to the line of tan Jared Fox 73% um but in general I think I prefer if you're if we're just kind of taking leaks out of it in general I like Trey young over Darren Fox  all right would you trade healed Jabari Smith and a star Thompson for Anthony Simons Cole Anthony and Bruce Brown  this is well  yeah and for me so if this is Amber and he Simmons you have to do it because I think amphi Simon's projects like a top 50 player  right  yeah I think so yeah I mean I think we have to consider a sar just got kind of a fringe asset right now I actually like to borrow Smith I don't mind buying him right now Cole Anthony we'll see I mean the folk is very concerning I mean there's no time table tendonitis who knows and you know I think jailed suggested a major injury thank that looked that looked so bad I thought that was going to be a season Ender to be honest so that's something considered with Anthony but yeah I would just kind of blindly take the Simon side of this as much as I love rostering buddy hield  if I putting points go bear or Jaron Jackson  if you're punting points  you probably want to lean go bare right  I guess I mean field goal percentage massive Edge to go bare rebounding huge Edge to go there shop blocking has been comparable  yeah yeah probably yeah I mean depends if you care about threes I guess but it's not like Jerry Jackson's lighting it up there either  all right let's see  again we'll try to go quickly here  so this is a follow-up to the question about you know the orchids trade says he also has SGA and Paul George that's why I gave up that much for yolk second place at 12 team cat League do you think I could win it with those three  and less the rest of your roster is a disaster yeah I mean he got two of the top three guys  yeah you should you should be able to you again  your roster is going to be thin now obviously that you try to get some of those guys just stay active on the waiver wire stream a lot get those four game weeks in just be really active I think he'll be fine um we'll try to sum up this question quickly okay see has three games this week and next week after today this was with regard to you know giddy versus monk for just kind of a one game slot should I drop Giddy and use that spot for streaming kind of taking OKC's schedule into account 10 Team league  10 team Yahoo points League I am  okay with dropping giddey  I'm okay with it  um my  I at the same time if you were to ask like let's say Josh Getty was on your waiver wire and you were like should I pick up Josh Kennedy to stream I'd be like yeah sure so is he fine to drop yes but is he fine to keep all so yes I mean he's you know he's like a fantasy point for me and he's playing 25  against per game lately that's just a very back end roster guy  all right and this is another callback to the it was Halbert and Barrett for Maxie and Garland  he says how about Halliburton and Kobe white or vessel or Jalen Williams instead for Maxie and Garland  in a category the guy I think I still might rather give up I mean the sell not like the biggest fan of I don't know I don't know what do you think are you still on the Maxi Garland side regardless um  I probably am on the Maxi Garland side but Halliburton and Kobe white is at least I think Halliburton Kobe white for Maxine Garland is the fairest offer  okay yeah  all right Dante Exum thoughts  just open-ended question yeah  just wax poetic on Exum yeah I mean with with Kyrie Irving out  yeah I mean he you know seven assistant back to back games  look I there is a reason he was not in the NBA let's put it that way um I think he's an interesting add to see if the assist can stick and we know he's a good Defender as well the steel numbers haven't really reflected that but he is a good Defender  don't expect the scoring to continue that's not who Dante exam is that's why he flamed by the league is because he couldn't score  yeah his previous start Five Points on two of nine shooting next game 23 on 9 to 15 so  without having a timetable for Kyrie it's a little bit tough to say you know he'll confusion we haven't really received anything on that yet deeply yeah maybe maybe grab them but be be very cautious and be prepared to drop them again all right this is a good one to end on can you please rate these teams Pistons Spurs Wizards Blazers  let's do the most disastrous to the least disasters  most disastrous to the least disaster I think the most disasterous team is the Pistons got to be the distance It's gotta be because they have kid Cunningham and you know they have like they have like actual stuff to be worried about like or is Kate happy the Wizards for example are like well yeah we saw but like who are we trying to keep happy nobody told you we were gonna suck yeah we told you yeah exactly everybody do her guys so like um  yeah Pistons most disaster and then I think honestly the rest is kind I  Spurs  I don't know do you have a do you have a preference between these teams the Spurs are at least have Webbie so they're like that's great so maybe they are the least disastrous by default yeah I mean the Spurs are like the 03 calves they're they're living life man when he looks great I think they're they're the least disastrous and like I still like a lot of the pieces in Portland honestly I mean obviously scoot look at terrible so far is a glaring minus but they have maneuverability right I mean not only do you have do you have picks you know as part of the Dame trade you have Brogden to flip you have a young guy and eaten who still has plenty of value you know Simon's looks awesome sharp looks like a hit yeah they've even some of these random like plug-and-play guys if I've looked okay for them I I'm still probably Blazers and this is another team that didn't like what makes the Pistons one they're terrible and they're the worst team in the league what makes them the most is asterisk is they they're not trying to be this bad like I think they probably knew they were you know they were winning the finals they were making the playoffs but I think the Pistons coming into the years thought that they could push for like 35 wins and now they're pushing for like 11 wins  yeah I think so I think I think my final answer in terms of disaster rating pistons number one  Wizards number two Blazers number three Spurs number four even though the Blazers look more competent than the Spurs the Spurs have women Yamaha and that kind of Trumps it  okay we do have one that just snuck in under the wire here Henry says I'm regretting majorly trading Kobe white for Jordan Poole a few weeks ago is pool now a drop ten Team league can you turn it around he's in fifth place for what it's worth yeah not a good trade sorry dude I mean you know the Levine situation you know I don't think anybody saw him he's basically shut down like I think you played his last game as a bowl so you couldn't you couldn't necessarily seen that coming and at the time you know buying low and Jordan Poole whatever not the end of the world  the question is is he a drop in attempt Team league  first of all I will say I this is a very understandable trade I think a lot of people would have made this trade is he a drop I would hold him but I would hate it every day  I mean the scoring is at least  come back a little bit alright last eight games he's almost 20 points per game over 40% from the field we'll take it 42% 3-point shooting still disasterous that's really what's holding him back still not getting to the line a ton but he's been getting there a little bit more lately I mean he had he's had a couple of like nine for you throw games over the last couple weeks you know we'll see if that continues I don't I don't think it's gonna be any worse for pool I'll say that I think you know it's not the Wizards have any other options right I think is you know the first three weeks of the year are gonna be as bad as it could be so you know it always depends who's out there and before you drop somebody like pool always try to trade him just try like get somebody back like I wouldn't just straight up to 10 Team league there's somebody will probably take him yeah maybe you can sort of yeah flip him but pool pool needs like he needs some sort of exorcism is not the right word he needs to like go do like an Ayahuasca trip or something and like come back a new man I actually think exorcism might be the right word okay yeah yeah okay first I will keep him but yeah last note here I just got an alert that the Los Angeles Lakers will raise an in-season tournament Championship Banner oh man
