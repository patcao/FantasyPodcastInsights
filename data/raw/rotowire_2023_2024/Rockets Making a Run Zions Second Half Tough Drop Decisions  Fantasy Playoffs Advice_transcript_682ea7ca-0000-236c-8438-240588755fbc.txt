welcome welcome to a Monday Edition the roadwire fantasy basketball Rutha here with you as we are every Monday Alex want to get out of the narrative I am sick that's why my eyes look terrible why my voice sounds terrible I don't want to hear about it in the comments we will push through you know getting to the end now of the fantasy basketball season some League's rapid up I know the roadwire steak League finishes up after this week still some leaks out there that do go through game 82 but you know certainly entering a slower Parts I suppose of the fantasy season but  a lot going on in the real life NBA including the Golden State Warriors suddenly losing their foothold on what could be the final play in spot in the Western Conference  yeah I mean it's it's pretty surprising me when when Albert and shangoo and got hurt we sort of like wrote off Houston it's like oh they're they're gone yeah Shen's not coming back it almost started Houston can't lose a game and Jabari Smith at Center is working out for them I think it's opening up the well it is opening up the floor a little bit more and Jalen greens able to operate with some space and they're they're pushing up the standings and Golden State's been  you know I would say like under average recently during this stretch  yeah I mean Houston for one we kind of forget they got off to a good start right I mean this team was six and three early on we were talking about them as you know maybe this surprise team out west I mean they were essentially 500 at the halfway mark and then you know really hit a rough patch in February going into the All-Star break they've had a somebody easy schedule here like they're they're winds during this streak of come over Portland Sacramento San Antonio Washington Cleveland Washington Chicago Utah so that's that's definitely part of it but they've they've won a lot of these games handling I mean they just housed the Utah Jazz at home on Saturday they get another pretty appealing matchup tonight against a Portland Trail Blazers team that started all rookies in one game over the weekend that's where we're at with Portland after that they're at OKC on Wednesday another good matchup on Friday at Utah they do have a slightly harder schedule the rest of the way then golden state does but it's not it's you know it's not complete my field yeah I think you take the Warriors experience you take their schedule you take their players obviously over what we have in Houston here but I don't think it's just decided that Golden State can necessarily flip a switch here I do think the Warriors end up making it I would be I mean this would be one of the stories of the season if the Warriors somehow find a way to back out of the plan but concurrent with all this is that you know the Lakers have been playing fairly well you know they now are as many games above 500 as they've been at any point this season you know they're looking like they're going to have a pretty good chance to maybe you know maybe stag the the seven or the eighth in the west I wouldn't count on it I mean they're two and a half back of Sacramento and Dallas but at the very least you know what have home courts in what would be the nine 10 play in matchup against Golden State or Houston  yeah what is going out with the warrior side of this I think it's kind of obvious with Houston right it's like soft schedule Court opening up Jalen green playing well maybe we didn't see this coming but the Golden State side of it is is very interesting to me you know Steph Curry was a little miffed I think as far as how many minutes he played last night in their loss you know they made the move earlier in the season with Klay Thompson coming off the bench comingo continues to play pretty well you know they're getting good minutes out of trayce Jackson Davis Chris Paul's back in the mix like it's it's hard for me to find a reason you know why Golden State would be seemingly I would say full on collapsing but play some of its shakiest basketball the season right now yeah it's hard to say because you know they had a hot stretch earlier coming out of the All-Star break and  I just think sometimes it happens where a team is they're really up back against a wall they get her they get their guy back and Draymond they're all they're firing on all cylinders  but then I think it's a lot they just they've kind of regressed like Wiggins is shooting a little bit better but he's still only giving you like 12 points a game yeah you know he's not really doing much for you clay you know clay shooting better from three and everything but again like that's all he's doing for you Chris Paul has this game but I at this point it's like he's just out there to pass and commit like no turnovers like he's just holding down the fort so um you know it's I I think what they experienced before was just like unreasonable hot stretch and now they've sort of regressed to the mean a little bit with with their play so we always check in on the play in odds at the DraftKings sports book I mean everybody you know loves that loves hearing about that Warriors are -2500 to participate in the play in and Houston is six to one which is interesting to me so the books aren't really books aren't really backing off the Lakers are minus 50,000 I mean they're essentially locked in at this point Atlanta's minus 10,000 you know to make the play in in the East so we kind of know in general what group of teens were looking at here but surprisingly a little bit that golden state is still holding firm at such a strong number at 2500 because you know undoubtedly the Rockets have looked like the better team over these last couple of weeks I will ask you what unfortunately I feel like is an impossible question  do we buy in on what we've seen from jail and green Sunshine went down he's had these stretches before you know including I think he's at the end of his rookie year you know had a pretty shaky like first 70 games and then you know at the end like oh okay here we go this is maybe more what we expected is just kind of like volume equation you know beating up on some bad defenses and as your opinion on Jalen green been shape it all over the last few weeks  um  I mean it's partially a volume equation because he is taking 21 shots a game over the past 12 but he's shooting you know officially 54880 it's still really not doing anything from a CIS perspective but I think  I don't want to say he doesn't necessarily mesh with Sheng goon but there are  greens athleticism is so high that if you just give them all the floor space in the world with you know Jabari Smith spacing at the five and I'm in Thompson you know just kind of doing out utility stuff setting screens rolling hanging out by the basket running really hard and transition you know they're gonna be a better transition team like this too it does allow green some more room to operate and get some free get some better looks I guess for for his shot diet yeah I you know I still think they're Jalen green has a lot to prove as far as not being a good stats bad team guy but at you know you'll take it right I mean it's certainly not a negative to see somebody putting up like 35 game over his last four like we've kind of known that he's capable of this and you still want to see it even if it's coming against Portland and Washington and San Antonio and obviously would be a hell of a story if he's able to keep this up over a tougher schedule the rest of the way we don't have a ton in terms of news this week which is mostly a good thing because news tends to be injury news you know the big one would be Brandon Ingram that was late last week we found out he's gonna miss some time at least another week and a half you dealing with a bone bruise in his left knee you know wouldn't be surprised if that lingers a bit longer you know that's when they'll reevaluate him was that two week time table not when he'll necessarily be back pelicans have been just fine without him so far they've taken down Miami and Detroit both of those wins coming by double digit Pals 11 and 5 with a plus 9.4 net rating  since the All-Star break third best net rating behind only Boston and Denver talked about this a little bit on the roadwire NBA show hopefully you listened last week but you know how seriously we have to take the pills at this point because they are they're only half game back of the LA Clippers for the force and the Clippers now have basically been a 500 outfit since the All Star break yeah to me to me this is also more it's almost more like I'm yeah the Clippers are becoming concerning while the Pelicans are like on a hot streak and they're sort of colliding like you mentioned I mean I I've always been of the belief that we should take the Pelican seriously as long as they're healthy now you mention Ingram it's gonna be out for a while so we'll see kind of what happens but you know the thing that makes the Pelicans I think  intimidating as a potential playoff opponent is not only like the explosive scoring ability of Zion Williamson and everything branding Ingram can do as like a All-Star caliber player  McCollum being a veteran point guard and all that but they have so many different looks they can go to you know I think I think they're getting this far in terms of being a great offense and defense by having a ton of different lineups that they can throw out there they can go Larry Nance Center they could go Zion at Center they can play herb Jones and Trey Murphy at the same time if they need a quick scoring punch against a small team they can Jordan hockey games if there's a point guard giving them trouble you throw off in there and being able to sort of form to the matchup at hand while keeping most like most of your best players on the court the whole time is it's really powerful I mean we started at the beginning of the year right they have as much depth if not more than any team in the league and I think for Fantasy it was almost a bad thing at times because when they are fully healthy you know you're playing the well do I start Trey Murphy do I start herb Jones like there were only so many sure things in that rotation but this is one of the few teams in the NBA that can sustain you know the loss of someone like Brandon Ingram for a couple of weeks I will say we're going to find out if this team is for Real in the next week and a half because their next five games come again okay see tomorrow Milwaukee Thursday Boston Saturday next Monday Phoenix next Wednesday or Lando that is about this tough of a five-game stretches again so they do get all five of those at home  that is nice yeah that's gonna be tough without Ingram I think that's maybe where we start to see the the sort of drain of Ingram not being there but again you know they're just gonna get more minutes to the guys they are already are comfortable play and I think you just rode more points Zion  and they can work out  all right we got a couple questions in the chat here feel free to throw those in there guys I know you know fantasy playoffs on going some leaks of wrapped up but will dish out as much advice as we can Johnny says what's up fellas what's up man Holmes or Bagley or roster both he's in the semifinals of a nine cat league first of all the schedule this week it's about it's like 60/40 four games versus three games we don't have any five game weeks we don't have any two game weeks thankfully the Wizards are on a four game week they play at Chicago Brooklyn Detroit and then Miami so pretty decent schedule for this week with that in mind you know I don't necessarily  don't really hate rostering both of those guys I mean it depends how big your league is who else is available as we always say are you starting both of them are you kind of playing the matchup night tonight I assume you're just gonna blindly say Marvin Bagley out  well you forgot how much I loved her shot all so yeah  I can't believe Holmes is already 30 I I think you can roster both because I am not 100% sure what Washington plans on doing now that bagley's healthy you know vaguely came back for their most recent game played 16 minutes off the bench almost minutes I couldn't move it all he started played 28 more for 15 and 14 with two blocks so it's like okay are they going to bring Marvin Bagley Off the Bench now or they gonna could they just start Marvin Bagley and then Rachelle Holmes is getting like dmps or like 12 minutes of game again yes that's possible I would prefer if you can to hold both and just see what Washington does yeah I think if you have to hold one of the other it probably has to be homes right now just because Bagley missed so much time he's only played one game you know maybe those minutes do rise likely they would I would imagine but I think if you're choosing between one of the other I would go homes you know in terms of other potential pickups in your average League it's like it's maybe Paul Reed sitting out there you know Taylor Hendricks perhaps you know both of those guys are on four game weeks this week but again without knowing the league size you know it's kind of hard to say if you could do better but you know we all the other thing with Washington is like either those guys are liable to miss any games the rest of the way right like you might you might want to have one of the other because it's totally possible that but both are not available for all four games this week yeah I mean it wasn't as bad as it was like a week or we got a half ago but you look at the sort of reason game logs of Washington and it's like over the past five games who's must too obvious missed three I was gonna say this like it mattered but kind of does Anthony Gilbert the game because he was  like 20 minutes I know  like Johnny Davis is out there getting rotten and stuff so it's like it's it's hard at Tice Jones so remains out so it's Washington is going to be I think as tough to predict the rotation of going forward as any team really in the bottom six or seven  is Johnny Davis going to be in the NBA next year by the way I mean this is this is rough this the opportunities have been there is back to the bench now I made that one glorious starred against Houston last week I mean he's probably the worst lottery pick of the last five to ten years without doing deep research here  I think well look I mean they got him they got the team option for another two years um basically five million and then six million  I think if you're watching 10  look I think from an Optics perspective you should probably just hang on to him because it's like what are you gonna do with that five million or six million dollars anyway  and if your team is going to continue to be bad it's like you may as well just  may as well just see if you can like Killian Hayes it like can we just really can we force this guy to get 15 minutes a game  no matter what and just make them you know make it work and whether or not we give him a second contract there's another story  yeah things are things are Bleak right now Johnny follows up and asked is she met to a solid stream it well unfortunately that's a very fair question because I mean Detroit they're like 17-point dogs tonight and you know there are a lot of reasons for that one of them is they're down during their down Cade they're down fontecchio they're down Isaiah Stewart for the rest of the season they're down Taj Gibson so they're basically running out of depth up front which means that will like we see a lot of met you as we did in their last game but 38 minutes probably see a lot of James Wiseman as well my first thing would be that Detroit's on a three game week so it kind of depends if you're in a daily lineup League yeah I don't mind throwing them out there  could you do better with somebody you know if it's weekly probably what the four games  yeah probably I mean look I don't mind Matt too I think that he has been he was a solid backup and maybe even sometimes I don't under utilize backup and and Sacramento for a few years just very capable of giving you like that you know basically 15 and 10 with a blocker steel sort of classic big man could also give you a three here and there so like is he a solid stream yeah I guess they're gonna say no no not really well he's played more than 20 minutes seven times this season between Phoenix and Detroit and in those games he's averaging 13 and a half points 7 boards one assist one and a half steals one and a half three so I think that's a reasonable Baseline and you know if it really comes down to Duran right like if during misses the entire week then yeah I think he becomes really viable  yeah you're hoping during remains out and again with the team like this there's no reason to rush during back  all right Don sicario says he's debating dropping Anthony Simons and picking up a pelican for the week yeah interesting concept here I mean Portland for one is on a three-game week and amphi Simon's is already ruled out for the first of those which is tonight against Houston so you're looking at two game week for Simon's he got injured against the Clippers you know a couple nights ago prior to that you know they were they were blown out by the Clippers played only 28 minutes before that I mean we need still been playing a full workload like 38 to 42 minutes most nights but in what now mounts to a two game week at best  I don't really have a problem with it  you know as far as like do you have to pick up a pelican specifically they're on a three-game week so like you know if somebody good is out there yeah of course if you're in a shallow League I don't mind it but again if you're if you're looking to you know basically stream for a week in in the fantasy playoffs I'm still prioritizing games played so I wouldn't I wouldn't go too deep on the Pelicans specifically especially like we said I mean with these these tough matchups coming up it yeah I think it's tough with Simon's  it's listed as 10 tonight is that's like a rest injury like you have to rest it to recover it and of course yeah we know about Portland is I mean Nick mentioned they started all rookies the other night um picking up a pelican yeah I mean if you want to pick up a pelican  in the in the wake of the Ingraham news yeah that makes sense I mean I don't know 100% who is available in your league but Larry Nance Naji Marshall um our guys who could be available depending on your leak size I I that to me that's a little too much risk because Simon's could come back and average like 25 and five and a game so he plays but I understand if you're in if you're in a must win like you have to win this matchup situation I understand the move  all right Tori Thompson says I have a bye this week is it worth it to pick up Trey young or Tyler hero in case we get positive news in the coming days don't really need them but I'm greedy LOL Head to Head category League  now I this is not greedy I think this is gave me ship here I think the question is which of these guys do we feel you know more strongly about I  to me it would be Trey Young And we haven't really gotten much of a positive update on either of them you know hero  I don't know what's going on with hero man I mean he hasn't played since February 23rd we haven't received an update on him in almost 10 days now we had a PRP injection in his foot my guess is Miami is you know they're in playoff mode with hero right they just need him back for when it matters Atlanta's banged up all over the place right now you know the trade young thing is strange because you give him you know his profile as a player you think we'd have something over the last couple of weeks this could just be one of those classic like Shams you know tweets at 5:30 p.m. is now questionable for tonight you know he could be back at some point in the next couple of weeks  I would say if you have the roster space  sure right if you're on a buy this weekend if you don't have to drop somebody of consequence I think Trey young would be the guy for me they announced on February 25th that he would undergo surgery and they gave him you know kind of a four week evaluation time line which would be hitting like now  yeah the hero thing is I mean Miami's kind of dodgy with their injury reporting anyway  it's a foot injury which very tough to come back from you know last year they did they kind of proved they didn't need them that much I'm still I'm still like a Tyler hero like Optimist I think it's I don't think it's a situation where it's like they're better without hero or they should they should trade him because he's useless I'm not that kind of a guy but Trey young I mean yeah I wish we had more updates on him but it's a left hand injury  if they really wanted to become back I think you would be it could be sooner I was it could be sooner than hero but it'd be easier to sort of force Trae young to come back for the playoffs then hero yeah that makes sense and Atlanta's come back but he's like it's easier to play through just comfort with your offhand and it is your right yeah 100% edit you know it's it's hard to say like a one of them  there's incentive for one of them to stick out longer than the other one I don't know I mean maybe Miami really wants to get into the six seed  to have the play and Atlanta is just locked into the Tennessee I mean they're not gonna slip over a clit so there's that there's that too  yeah I again I was saying if you have the roster space just go grab Trae young you know if you're not dropping somebody who you're playing on using next week I don't really see why not Michael says I'm facing Zion and Trey Murphy this week any strategies to counter or am I just totally screwed LOL I'm nervous as hell so I assume this is you know like I had to head you know points are probably categories league if you're talking about countering hi Trey Murphy's coming off of one of the all-time weirdest lines ever yesterday eight points eight boards four blocks oh of 9 from 3 1 of 12 from the field and yet still gave you a decent line in terms of countering I mean  obviously with Trey Murphy you're most worried about the volume threes right he's been rebounding really well you know the defensive stats are there every now and then but it's really you know your fear is that he has like three games in a row this week where he hits four or five threes and all the sudden your trailing in that category so I think for Murphy the strategy is either you know make sure you're starting or you're picking up somebody who you think can you know give you threes to try to counter that or just say all right you know and maybe this maybe this person you're playing has other you know three point studs on the roster and say all right well chalk up that category as a loss and Target something else I mean it was ion obviously the production is is more well-rounded especially with no Ingram I think we're going to see the passing tick back up as we did the other night against Detroit Six assists I mean the steals the blocks have started to come around for Zion that was kind of one of the big criticisms over the last couple of years even when he was healthy was okay we're seeing the scoring the field goal percentage is Great he looks dominant but he's not really the defensive player that he was at Duke like that starting to come back the rebounding has been great since the All-Star break so I don't really know that there's a way to counter Zion I guess the one you know big Pitfall for him and even this has been better lately is the free throw shooting right I mean he's been like the mid-70s over the last month which for Zion is pretty good but you know I think that's maybe one area you could try to exploit is you know you're hoping that Zion as a couple of those games where he's  seven of 12 at the line and maybe you could speak out of Victory in that category right I mean countering is tough because it's like do you are you do you just avoid the categories that the other guys are good in to try to get you know get wins elsewhere you know it's like because if you're if you're talking about these three guys or these two guys it's like Trey Murphy's gonna be going threes Zion points and field goal percentage or like those are their best categories it's like should you just avoid those entirely and just say hey that's a loss I'll go for I'll go for rebounds you know I'll go for assist I'll go for Steals and blocks it's it's tough to give you like a strong counter without knowing your team yeah like your full Team Construction well and the bells are in a three game week right so I don't I wouldn't base your whole week around this you know it's like I think you know one example would be  you know if you early in the season when he was rolling like if you're going up against Tyreese Halliburton and he has four games  might be tough for you to win assist because he was giving you like 13 assists per game for a while there but you know three games of Zion who is you know still not the greatest fantasy player not as well rounded historically as you would like Trey Murphy as he proved yesterday is still capable of going overnight and then you know going five for 10 the next game I wouldn't necessarily Panic about this obviously if you're in a position that you're still playing you know your team is pretty good here and really the rest of your opponents roster you know matters too I wouldn't just worry about those two guys all right back to Johnny he says KI on Ellis or Bruno Fernando who's a with those guys be a better pickup than Messi met to  I would rather have met you than Fernando I think I know that the Hawks are without a Kung move for at least one game and Jaylen Johnson certainly could be more we'll see yeah that that's kind of the the big unknown right now but I do kind of like yeah Alice man I mean he's been in the rotation for a while you basically you served Davion Mitchell's spot you know wild back and with Kevin herder Sidelines now you know we  coming off of a big game against Orlando 19 points six assists five boards four threes  I would like to buy into that at the same time there's been a lot of other nights where he's played bigger minutes and is not produced like that so it could be a little bit of Fool's Gold but I don't mind key on a four game week  I think  well yes some of it's like if you want the guy long term I mean I I don't think necessarily Ellis or Fernando or better for this week but I think what key on Ellis is doing is more sustainable long-term so if you're looking to pick up a guy  for this week who could also extend through the end of the season I would go with Ellis I mean Kevin herters done for the year um and Alice Alice was already stealing as many as to I mean you mentioned Davion Mitchell's Bennett's but herder was really bad towards the end of the season and Ellis look he's he's not gonna do that much for you besides Steals and blocks like you watch him play he's just out there for defense very similar to Davion Mitchell it just kind of like him more than Dave Beyond Mitchell  so you know over the past what is the seven games he's giving you 2.3 steals 1.3 blocks I mean that's like  he's sort of like a Batista Ball even though they're not really the same player  good good note by you heard about the way that we did get official confirmation that he is out for the season obviously knew about the injury about a week ago but King said even you know even for the playoffs he's not coming back this year so pretty big blow for Sacramento Raul Gupta says I have Levert hartenstein Nas Reed and Bogdan bogdanovich would Brook Lopez and or Paul Reed be better than any of those guys  you know right away you're thinking oh Brooke Lopez yeah he's got to be better you know he was so great early in the season and basically as soon as I traded for him Alex and the stake League the production has fallen off a cliff I mean he's basically been a one block per game guy over the last month you know the scoring still there here and there every now and then you know kind of depends as he is he draining the 29 foot pull up threes or not it's kind of what it comes down to we know who we is as a rebounder and a pastor it's going to be spotty so I would like to say Lopez right away but I don't really think that's the case right now yeah I think I'd be most okay with letting bogdanovich go I think he has the the lowest upside of that initial group that you mentioned  so look I think if you need if you need big man stats  I wouldn't mind dropping by zdanowicz for Lopez or read reason to get you more traditional big band stats and Lopez because read real rebound and you'll block more shots and stuff like that but  Lopez doesn't rebound that much hits threats Etc yeah so it depends what you need depends what you need  yeah Lopez on a three game week don't really want it now it's just a three game week this week as well Paul reads at a four gamer so I would stay away from Lopez Armstrong's been really good of late Nick's around a four gamer I wouldn't worry about that you know I think at around about way like OG being out kind of helps him a little bit and you know next still fighting for playoff position so I don't necessarily think they they really slow down here what a backup to a  Shang question that we had early years this one is any chance goon comes back I saw a rumor yesterday he's on waivers in my league I'd be pretty surprised  you know I mean they the last update in you know non rumor update that we had is that he's likely out for the regular season but obviously the way the way the Rockets are playing it's like I don't know if you're if you're saying good and you have any chance to return I think it's  you know it's certainly possible but I wouldn't really count on it like I to me this is more of like a real life consideration than fantasy it's like even if he does return  by the time that happens like unless you're legally goes through game 82 and you have a spot you know kind of like we said betray young if you can hold them and you're not giving up anything I don't really see any downside but if you need that spot it's for the week ahead like he's not coming back in the next week  yeah I I kind of Tracked Down the room or something Tim McMahon said I don't know where he where he got it from but  that it's possible that if it really comes down to it that shenko come back for the very end of the regular season which was sort of the reporting of the reporting initially was likely out for the regular season  I think that was all I don't think Houston anticipated winning eight straight without shengo so there were like it's fine yeah I would say  it's not worth picking him up if your league and  before the last week of the season  like  if you're legal is all the way through 82 I don't hate the idea of picking them up maybe for the last week but I don't know if that's really gonna pay off either way it's kind of a long shot move  yeah I mean the way that big man phrased it you know it I think you put it pretty well it was like  they essentially said he's probably out because they thought their season was over and now it's like well maybe maybe and you know the exact verbiage was quote in the realm of possibility you know I it's not like he's ramping up or anything like he's still he's still recovering from what was not as severe of an interest we thought but ultimately a pretty severe ankle sprain so yeah I would say I mean if anything obviously you don't want news to come out that he's like on track to return and then maybe you missed your window but I would assuming you know you're in a fantasy playoffs situation you need to win this week you need to win next week you probably want that roster spot you know maybe grab him a week from now if that possibility is still out there  Daniel says  scoot is recently putting up nice numbers with a manageable field goal percentage the last couple games how boosted is he was Simon sideline is he a must own in a 10 team 9 Catlett League well um  six straight games of double digit scoring for scoot which is actually notable yeah 40% from the field 38% from three 5.7 assists to 3.5 turnovers 1.7 steals for for 17 points that's good stuff it's good stuff from scoot I mean that's if that's what he was averaging all year we'd be like okay nice rookie season solid is he a must roster and a 10 team 9 cat  I think you would be good  it probably makes sense for someone to pick him up because look it's a nine cat league but I'm gonna assume that at least half the teams if not 80% of the teams are just punting turnovers and probably a decent amount of other teams our punting field goal percentage you might be doing that if you're punting one of those two absolutely pick him up  if you're focusing on one of those two do not pick him up and if whether or not you win over if you go for second just kind of like a wash to you you're just whatever then you can stream them in sure why not so to answer one of the questions here I wouldn't say it's a must own and attend Team league just because there are enough guys out there and he's like that the nine cat thing is what matters to me because the turnovers are a killer I mean you still you could average like five turnovers in a week and that's going to be tough to come back from they do only have a three game week this week as well so that's something to consider but yeah I think you brought up a good point I mean if these were seasoned long numbers we'd be feeling a lot better and you watch some of these games like he's still making a lot of mistakes I'm still a little reserved as far as you know it's just gonna go like we thought it might on draft night you know it's been a pretty rough rookie season for him overall but he's he's gonna have a nice three week Runway here I think to put up some numbers for what's left of the Blazers and who knows what happens with the Simon's thing I mean anybody anybody who's not a rookie is basically liable to be to be shut down at this point for Portland another Brooke Lopez question would Lopez be considered a drop for someone like trayce Jackson Davis he met two Luke kornet Orion Ellis  I would not drop Lopez for Corona  and I would probably hesitate to drop him for met too but I don't I'm not really gonna scoff at you for wanting to drop Brook Lopez for for trayce Jackson Davis who has been really consistent and over the past 10 games his average 11 points eight rebounds two blocks no he's not cooking you the threes but that's not what you're asking about you're asking about the rebounds I don't know if you yeah you are asking about the rebounds  and yeah like Lopez versus Keon Ellis  I mean yeah Keyon can grab some boards here or there yeah that was right tire in the last month somehow well yeah he did have he did have a five block game against Memphis although it's Steph Curry got a block against Memphis so how can we you know let's let's create our curve here  yeah I mean we talked about Ellis before I don't know I don't want to go back but what I'll say is you should not be afraid to drop Lopez for trayce Jackson Davis specifically  all right Reds 22 I don't know if this is Clay link or Jeff Erickson or who he says this Katy drop in a Yahoo points League he's in the finals  first and foremost if it's just this week if you're finals are just this week  I think that comes into consideration three game week for Detroit he's already ruled up tonight so best case scenario is he plays two games one of those is a nightmare matchup against Minnesota the other is the best possible matchup against Washington so you know in Washington they played later in the week so there's better chance that he plays in that one that's on Friday the Minnesota game is on Wednesday but you're looking again at a best case scenario of a two-game week for cake Cunningham that is very scary I would you know obviously it always depends on who's available but I think you have to consider it if you're looking at your opponent and you think they have a better team they have a better matchups they're they have more projected games than me these are the time to kind of like really tough decisions you have to make this time of year yes some people have two weak playoff matchups I have a buddy that's gonna League like that if it's a two week playoff matchup I'm not dropping them if it's just this week  I would try to find you know look at what stats you need however your team is built  and try to find somebody on a four game week  who matches your needs  and assuming that player is pretty decent  I think there's a pretty good chance that they out produce  what Kate does this week on a total total stats basis based on what you need  yeah it's just it's really hard for us to speculate on like injuries like this at the end of the year it's just I have I have absolutely no idea you know if he's gonna miss more time like there's no Detroit's got the worst record in the NBA right now they are a lock to finish in the bottom four record wise so there's no there's no motivation for them to be worse than they have to be but it's also one of those things where it's like all right if his knees really bothering him there's no point for him to play if we think it's something that could you know cause further damage we want them to be as healthy as possible when we're presumably a better team next year you know the fact that they're being cautious with fontecchio cautious with Duran that you know makes you wonder if they would go the same route with Kade so I you know I don't want to be the guy that's like yes drop him and then he comes back and gives you two great games but what I drop in for a pretty good player on a four-game team yeah whatever I think that's I think the risk reward checks out there  yep  all right we got a Kyle kuzma question from Roger 888 Rodger he says do I drop Kyle kuzma kuzma has already been ruled out for tonight's game he's kind of been in and out the last couple of weeks it's a four game week for Washington so he won't play tonight against Chicago they played Brooklyn Wednesday Detroit Friday and Miami on Sunday so still three more opportunities for kuzmin to get out there dealing with a sore shoulder so this doesn't appear to be anything of grave concern here with the possibility of three games for kuzma this one is less of a shirt thing for me than Kate  I mean it's a pick concerning he's missing time now after he missed two games earlier in the week and played two and now he's always out again that's a concern  so we're gonna blindly speaking I'd like the advice I would be scared to drop kuzma it doesn't seem they injury he doesn't seem that serious I wish they would be more forthcoming about it obviously but he's averaging 41 fantasy points a game in March he's really good I you know I would be worried that I would drop him and he would come back so I would prefer to hang on to Coosa not knowing exactly what the what the situation is I never thought we would hear that on the Pod Kyle kuzma he's really good he has been good he's been great at Fantasy this year I'm like I've become like a Kyle kuzma like I think whatever I watch him play now I think he's I'm like this guy's good like this guy's almost he shouldn't be on the Wizards he should be on some good team playing like 24 minutes a game you know giving them like some some jolt Off the Bench although that's how I feel about almost everybody on Washington's roster but you know kuzma yes he is like a good stats bad team guy but I don't think he's like  someone who can't scale up and do a better role we start with the Lakers  all right do I drop Brandon Miller is our next question hasn't been playing well I also have trade man and Nick Richards on the same team so it's a four game week for the Charlotte Hornets so I would proceed with some level of caution here yeah I mean Miller's been a little spotty of late you know played really well coming out of the All-Star break and at a nice run at the beginning of March last five games  shooting about 35% for the field 32% from three just kind of the ups and downs I would say of most rookies but  I mean it's been there they don't appear to be shutting and down so this this kind of comes back to our age old question of you know how many teams are in your league if it's a 10 team her then yeah you could probably do better but if it's a 12 or 14 or 16 team member then you're probably not doing a whole lot better than Brandon Miller on a four-game weight  yeah I just I would not be dropping guys like this on a four-game week just see what happens this week if they still are playing terrible and it's a three-game week or whatever it is next week then you can entertain it but you know if if these guys were on the wire and they were on a four game week we would be telling you could pick them up  you know so I would not I would not drop Miller for gamer  yeah I mean he's been like a borderline top one 50 guy since he All Star break which is not ideal but you know if you're if you're in a points League you're not as concerned about that it's really the field goal percentage and really the free throw percentage that's been Dragon him down he's been under 70% at the line over the last month or so 10 Team league for for Johnny's so yeah again depends on it was on the waiver wire if there's a better for game player if there's somebody you can take advantage of injuries yeah maybe maybe you think about it but you know not a crazy question by any means all right Daniel says would you drop keonte George Gary Trent Malik monk to add any of Naji Marshall Jose Alvarado or Malik monk so for one I don't know if I dropped Malik monk you know I think with with The Herder injury there's just there's a lot of upside  for Malik monk the rest of the way you know obviously he's coming off of a oval 11 game against Orlando he's been pretty awful shooting the ball lately but we know Malik monk we know that I'll probably come back around that's what you sign up for when you when you draft a kind of a streaky player like him so with no her  I still want Malik monk Gary Trent get a George Naji Marshall Jose Alvarado that's you know a little bit tougher  I'm not I'm not dropping I'm not dropping any of those guys to add Marshall or Alvarado those guys are just low usage players they can have their games like Alvarado can get forced he wasn't a game not you Marshall could have a double-double it can happen but low usage players and those keyonte George and Gary Trent are they're balling right now like they're great  they're winning Fantasy leaks for people and so was Malik monk to an extent if you picked him up he while he was having a cold street so yeah  yeah Gary Trent's averaging 25 a game over the last six I mean he is he is loving what's going on in Toronto here he's basically the the number one option for that team a lot of night so I would not be getting rid of him all right a couple more that will head out here I'll put myself out of my misery is Julius Randle a drop he's in the playoffs he has a pretty Simon's and Jalen Johnson on IL already yeah this is another tough call right somebody who haven't really had a ton of updates on the Knicks did tell us earlier today that he's yet to take contact still working on getting strength back in that shoulder  I mean again it kind of depends how deep into your playoffs you are but I  I think we see Julius Randle back before the end of the regular season it's like what version of him do we see there's probably a ramp up period I think if it's do or die and you got obviously you gotta win this round of the playoffs and you already have two guys on ill I would be comfortable dropping him I guess maybe the better question is would you drop Simon's before him I would say probably not just because we have no evidence that that's a longer term injury  yeah I I agree with everything what with what you said first of all Jalen Johnson has a better fantasy player than Randall um yeah like Point Blank so um and yeah I mean Jonathan as far as we know that's relatively short-term and as far as we know Simon's is very short term so I would I be  fairly comfortable dropping Randall of course you become more uncomfortable the long gear lead go League goes but how it is you gotta survive you gotta survive these playoff rounds and if that's what it means then you know so be it when is jail Johnson back well they said he's out at least a week and that was on the 21st so expectation would be that he misses at least two more games they have a back-to-back Wednesday Thursday I would probably guess he misses both of those could be back as soon as Saturday against Milwaukee I just wouldn't count on jail or on Jalen Johnson this week I think if you're you know if your league extends into next week it's a four game or for Atlanta they have another four gamer the final week of the regular season and you're hoping he's back for that  yeah I would say just hope that he's back for early April  yeah  all right two more here and then we'll bounce out here Isaiah Joe or Aaron Wiggins the stream for this coming Tuesday this is an ultimate like we're at that point of the Season question  only four games on the schedule on Tuesdays here options are limited and yeah we're picking between a couple of Thunder players here OKC on the road at New Orleans  oh boy do you have a strong thought here Alex  well if you need threes go Joe  if he don't need threes go Wiggins but to me it's to me it's about as close of a wash as you could get and I think I would rather have Joe just for the threes upside  yeah I mean we can seems to be have like a slightly higher floor in terms of minutes like Joe only played eight minutes the other night against Milwaukee but that game also got completely out of hand in the third quarter I me I would shoot for the upside with Joe and just hope that he hits like three threes Off the Bench  yeah  all right go back to one of the previous questions Daniel said my drop was meant to be Beasley not monk so I mean if let's just say you're cruising between Malik Beasley or Malik Monk  you know Beasley's gonna give you more consistent threes only monks Gonna Give You better much better assist production better points overall I would I would still go with Malik I would go Malik monk bye bye a mile to me yeah yeah all right well and on this one Jabari Walker thoughts nice open-ended question on Jabari Walker who I think you and I both like you know it's just it's kind of a matter of like all right or the minutes there is roles changing night to night you know he had that that run in January February where he was starting a bunch of games mostly been coming off the bench lately but still playing a decent amount of minutes really for Portland it's just like all right is Jeremy Grant out there one is DeAndre eight and out there too if not love Jabari Walker if those guys are in that obviously is sealing is a little bit lower but in general I'm in like if you're in like a deeper you know Dynasty type of League I really like to party Walker yeah I think he's a better Dynasty Target than like this season but it's really encouraging like he's played double digit Mega 1038 straight appearances like they're they're putting about their they're playing them all the time his production really fluctuates but that's because he's he's sort of a  I don't want to call him a specialist he sort of an odd Prospect  but in a good way like he's a he gets to the free throw line at on Place super physical great offensive rebounder decent Defender so  yeah he's a little bit undersized at like six foot eight but he he is fine I'm intrigued for mostly for dynasty for this season I don't four game week it's fine but they're all are probably better options if you're gonna standard size League all so yeah and they're on a three gamer this week they play Houston Atlanta Miami not a great schedule other than the Atlanta matchup his 20 highest minute games this year he's averaging 11 points 9 boards one and half assists one block Steele okay so threes not really not really a part of this game right now but I mean Portland just look for anything at this point right you're just gonna try to find Keepers for that roster when you're actually ready to sell my contend and I think he's looked the part for the most part all right that'll do it we really just dove in on some of the biggest names in the NBA over the last 45 minutes Alex but that's that's the point the season that we're at we appreciate everybody still watching along listening fire in US good questions you know good to see so many regulars in
