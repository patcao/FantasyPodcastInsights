welcome to the award-winning  fantasy basketball podcast by RotoWire brought to you by Underdog fantasy and Vivid Seats and rival fantasy look at all these sponsors oh someone's busy someone hacker changing its job it's Friday October 27th 2023 Alex perutha here with Shannon McEwen and Ken k train Crites  we're gonna jump straight into the news Damian Lillard last night pick up 29 Points excuse me 39 points 30 and his principally watched him scored 29 Points because I saw the second half the beat the hardened list 76ers  Dame with 39 points a nine of 20 shooting 8 rebounds four assists four triples 17 of 17 from the free throw line I cannot tell you the last time a Milwaukee Bucks fans saw someone shoots 17 of 17 from the line we also had Tyrese Maxey in the absence of James Harden go for 31 8 dimes two steals Kelly oubre had a nice game as well  Shannon do you have any I mean this hardened situation  the NBA's investigating it he tried he wanted to play the team was like we I don't know if we want you to play what do you what do you really anticipate Happening Here oh I I mean as a fantasy if you if you're as a fantasy manager if you own if you've lost your James Harden right now you know you can't do anything but sit on your hands you just keep them on your bench and wait until this all blows over you know there's one of two options I don't think he's gonna continue to sit out Beyond this road trip it's either going to be he's playing with the Sixers or he gets traded it's one of those two options I don't think they're just going to sit them long-term so hopefully uniform you think we'll see him on the court index of general form I think I'm not really trust him I think he might not quite tank it but not really give full effort either we've seen that before  I mean that could be the outcome well we'll see I don't think I I don't think we're going to see an NBA player out on the court like purposely taking games will his effort be 110% you know has it has hardens that for ever been 100 so I you know again as a fantasy manager you sit on your hands I do think there's something's going to happen once this road trip is completed and the Sixers get before the Sixers get ready play their game in the season when does Joel embiid make a stink about this like it's got to be driving him crazy like is he gonna is he probably gonna make ultimatums to marry or does he ever come out publicly and say if you I was gonna say I think partially when you're if you're in bed and you're not really saying anything about it I think that's basically the equivalent of just clearly being annoyed by it like if you're not like I would I would love to welcome James Harden but he's the great you know he's a great guy if he was coming out saying all that that's one thing but just kind of being silent about it I think it just implies kind of what you're saying  yeah it with with in bead this one thing I'll say about six is six or teammates is if they want to win a championship this year having hardened on the team is the easiest path to that trading for Terrence Mann and Norm Powell and Bones island or whatever it's going to be whatever that package of FB from from the Clippers is not going to make them a better overall team I thought the holdup was more pics so they can then flip the picks for some other veteran player at the but then that implies that they're a veteran players available you know like I'm Not Who nobody really comes to mind but hopefully by zdanowicz is available well let's get on let's get back to real basketball the other game last night for players playing Lakers beat Phoenix in the LA home debut add bounced back with a nice 30.12 rebound three block three steel performance LeBron who was allegedly on a Minister's restriction played 35 minutes 21 points 8 boards nine dimes two steals two blocks of course this is against the Suns team with no Booker No Deal KD had a very nice 39 and 11 game  I'll tell you what made me a little concerned and maybe you guys don't care but  Yusuf nurkic who should have had a lot more opportunities with Booker and be all out he did have nine rebounds but only four points on one of five shooting other than the big three guys who appeals to you in Phoenix  well I mean we're gonna talk about one of them later I mean yeah so I don't want to step on Shannon's toes we're gonna get to one particular player in Phoenix later I will I one guy I'll bring up is Eric Gordon partially because Beale is relatively injury-prone we're seeing it already Booker probably get nights off as well and that back quarter is just not it's really thin so you know Jordan Goodwin also got 30 minutes in this game 14 points six rebounds to assist two seals like both of those guys if you're in a deep League are interesting and or are at least worth like a streamer and daily leaks if you have like unlimited claims that kind of a thing yeah Jay Eric Gordon you know negative 27 last night in 30 minutes 6 for 16 2 4 8  yeah it is tough but he will have some value if you're desperate for three pointers when when the suns are short-handed  which could be awesome I don't know I don't know how many games Bradley Beal has left him we'll see  it's tough to say I mean they're I won't be surprised if they sick guys everybody knew this though when they drafted him Bookers the guy who you expect to play the most games and then kind of either be or to ramp behind them you know I was happy to get beyond the second round in my nfkc draft but drafting with the first round a little tough that pretty much does it for news so we are going to before we get into fan feedback and waiver wire  we're going to talk about Underdog fantasy Underdog fantasy is the number one platform for

answer it here or in next week's show  we got this  in our risers and fallers video from the preseason from angel ihara angel I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing your last name he wants he or she wants to offer but offer a friend Myles Turner and Brandon Miller in hopes to get Anthony Davis which might be a little tougher after last night's game  let's say you Shannon and Alex  I will say that I don't View Brandon Miller as a 12 team fantasy player this year so you're in my opinion you're trading Myles Turner for Anthony Davis which is a win  yeah yeah if you can do it then good on you you know this this seems more like blindness Dynasty League offer then a retract so if it is Dynasty format and you're dangling Brandon Miller as the sweetener with with Myles Turner that makes sense I would be very surprised if you're able to pull off this trade in a redraft single season league and and even sorry and even even if you view Brandon Miller like let's say you think Brandon Miller might be 12 team relevant this year I don't think he's going to be so good that his production is not able to be found basically off of the waiver wire like I think he'll be replacement level you know like maybe he's your second option off your family bench but you can also stream guys in on four game weeks in that spot and it's fine um so yeah it's okay the keeper League deal Myles Turner's only 27 um The Keeper League offer but it doesn't make sense season long okay well with that Alex what's next  we are officially jumping into our first waiver wire of the Season obviously one of the biggest Waiver Wires waiver way periods of the entire season are the first I would say three weeks and then pretty much a trade deadline so of the of the few major ones this is obviously huge and we gotta explain the format yes we pick two regular waiver wire pickups and then one long shot  yes regular waiver wire pickups being about or less than 50% rostered and usually Yahoo leaks we use and then a long shot being less than 25% rostered  I'm gonna jump straight into it my my first waiver wire option is Xavier Tillman of the Memphis Grizzlies all Society aldama but we have yet to see him play Xavier Tillman's 53% roster right now obviously with the Stephen Adams out for the season news he got scooped up very quickly but we have Santee Obama still only 2021 percent rostered like I mentioned Steven Adams out for the whole year aldama was dealing with the ankle injury hasn't played won't play today Friday  Tillman against first game in the opener 17 points 12 boards four assists three steals one block this Memphis team is pretty thin and for in terms of depth not then they have David Roddy and the roster but Tillman we saw him we saw him in the playoffs last year like we know Tillman is good and he's going to get maybe 30 minutes a game maybe they pull back a little bit when Santee is there but this is just a clear ad for you know pretty much every week  and then if you need threes  santi's obviously the better option and I am curious to see how many starts Tillman gets versus Santee when they're both healthy  I still think there's possibility the Griz will go with a big lineup for stretches too where you have Santee Tillman and Jaren Jackson on the lineup at the same time Sati is a decent passer so I think they can make that work you guys mentioned he can stretch the floor so it'll be you know at least until John Moran comes back I could see them get being creative with some of their five-man rotations Ken who is your first waiver wire pickup for this season well before I do that I do want to ask fans please if you like our videos please hit like And subscribe below  my first free agent pickup for the season  Chicago Bull Kobe white who's four 41% roster as of yesterday and mostly because he is the starting point guard for your Chicago Bulls you know Chicago really didn't have any off-season roster changes of note and there really spinning their wheels last year with the soon moo and Caruso at the point guard  so they're going to experiment with higher score Kobe white which I think is a solid move there's just a lot more upside to White he's never going to be an aid assist games Aid assists per game guy but they're going to give him a long run as a starting point guard he obviously has the higher draft pedigree so and to me point guards are always in short supply off the waiver wire grab Kobe white yeah Kobe white played 31 minutes and in the season opener the last time the only time in his career where he averaged 31 minutes or more he averaged 15 points for rebounds four point eight assists guess what he had in the season debut 154 and 4 that's pretty much exactly what you pick up in preseason as well like per 30 per 306 so yeah really a good ad there Ken very clear for all League what do you who's your first ad Shannon my first ad is rookie center for the Dallas Mavericks Derek Lively Derek Lively had a lot of preseason healing he started pretty much the entire preseason for the maths and then he surprisingly he did not start this season opener they went with a Ken cried saver Maximilian chleba instead but why we did start the second half and he played really well 16 points 10 rebounds one steel one block he was yeah two for three from the line seven for eight from the floor  Lively why we've not gonna he's not gonna stretch the floor his field goal percentage is going to be astronomically High because every shot he takes is going to be a put back or a lob he gives Luca and Kyrie that lob threat that they really you know Luca hasn't really had his career and I think he's going to stick in the starting lineup after getting the nod as the starter in a second half of the opener against the Spurs I fully expect him to start moving forward unless Jason Kidd pulls some kind of weird Shenanigans but Lively I would argue you know Tillman or Lively depending on your appetite those are probably the top two pickups to Target in this free agent period  they love Cleaver and Powell but they've spun their wheels for a long time with those two was the top big man options Lively is the way to go  at least for a long while yeah he was he was really affecting the game with his pick and roll like vertical spacing it was just when he was in the game it really felt like Dallas's offense was running better  I'm gonna jump to my second waiver wire pickup which is Jalen Johnson of the Atlanta Hawks 32% rostered Atlanta's forward minutes after they traded away John Collins this offseason pretty up for grabs preseason didn't  really tell us that much it remained a bit confusing so deep Bay actually got the start and the opener against the Hornets but Bae DeAndre Hunter Jalen Johnson they all got between I think 29 and 31 minutes so they all played the same amount in 29 minutes Jaylen Johnson had 21 points on 13 shotts seven rebounds two assists two steals in a block Johnson is an amazing athlete like a freak athlete so his defense of upside is pretty high and he's a way better Pastor Than People expect he's excellent passing the preseason we saw that in the playoff series against Ken's Boston Celtics he had some nice moments as well it seemed like Atlanta really liked him there so um I think he's worth taking a chance on if he's going to continue to play roughly 30 minutes a game well Mohawks are not married just a Decay they did not give him a rookie extension meaning he'll be a restricted free agent and at the end of the season so I think bass on a very short leash is the starter there and  similarly AJ Griffin could also get a ton of four minutes as you say the Ford spaces are white opening yeah with Atlanta they have a roster full of tweeners guys who can play multiple positions so saddiq Bey can easily slide down you know when he was with Detroit he would slide down to the two at times he would slide down he would slide up to the four you know Jalen Johnson played the three or four you Deandre Hunters same same thing and even plays the three sometimes yeah by God bitch you play one through three so I think you've got a lot of guys who are tweeners that could play multiple positions they ran a nine-man rotation in that season opener you know AJ Griffin who only played 10 minutes it looks like he's really kind of the odd man out with that Ford rotation so if it's a three-man rotation in jail and Johnson's playing 28 minutes for game he's gonna he's gonna have some solid fantasy value  Ken our next wave of wire pick up your waiver wire pickup was one of our Sleepers for this season sure was cam Thomas of the Brooklyn Nets  who some of us are all so wagering on to be a Sixth Man of the Year he's gonna offer points points and more points you may have noticed he had 36 points coming off the bench that was the most Off the Bench points I think for any NBA player in a season opener and you know it wasn't like it wasn't like he was an ugly volume he shot 13 of 21 ate from 11 from the free-throw line two of five threes  um you know he had 23 points per 36 minutes last year for the Nets and the second unit is filled with Defenders like Royce O'Neill and Dorian Finney Smith I think you know they're setting up cam Thomas to be their instant offense Off the Bench guy a Vinny the microwave Johnson type so if you need points in threes I love can Tomas yesterday he was 41% on Yahoo  yeah get him in your free agent waiver claim cue speaking of 40% his usage rate 45.2% I think I think your point is good about Brooklyn a lot of their bench guys or their you know their secondary guys are Defenders so if it's the if it's the middle of the third quarter and they're down by 18 yeah they're gonna put cam Johnson because they just need scoring right Ben Simmons and even the starters Ben Simmons not gonna light it up Nick klaxon isn't going to light it up you really relying a ton on Bridges cam Johnson Dinwiddie and Thomas to do the bulk of the scoring for the squad and the nights when Kim Johnson's not gonna be hitting his shots and they're gone very very happy to switch to Thomas  yes yep that that is true I will say the you know the the breakout potential of Camp Thomas as we highlighted during the preseason could have a negative impact on some of these other guys within the starting lineup Michael Bridges only had a 22.9 usage 12 field goal attempts in the first game Spencer Dinwiddie only played 24 minutes one for three from the floor so I do you know those are things to watch and depending on how much how many minutes how much volume how much usage Camp Thomas has I will say if Camp Thomas goes off and has another two or three games like this I am selling high so putting that out there all right didn't we could be a trade deadline option for these nets a 30 years of age he does not match the timeline of the rest of the squad I mean I think they also view him as Ben Simmons insurance right you never know when Ben Simmons is going to have a back injury  that suddenly can't be played for two years but this if they can trust Simmons Jim what he seems like a great trade deadline this absolutely again this next team you know outside of bridges cam Johnson and Nick Claxton the rest of the roster you know if this team's not winning games the rest of the roster will be available Shannon who is your next flavor wire pickup the stress is loose big game in Cleveland when his Cleveland debut Max Drew started as small forward for the Cavs in that Brooklyn Nets game he played 39 minutes 27 points nine for 17 from the floor 7 for 13 from downtown two for two from the line 12 rebounds one steel one block now this is  you know no charity in that game so here's yeah why the boards for up for grabs okoro Isaac ikoro received the spot start in place of Jerry Allen Max Drew should be locked in as the team starting small forward and receive heavy minutes all season long I do expect to have a slightly bigger role than he had in Miami last year they paid him the money they received zero production from their small forward spot last year 0 now you know the caveat being that that season debut with the Cavs will be maxed through his best fantasy game of the season it will be it really out there but not gonna have another 12 rebound game the rest of the season I would wait and he's only gonna hit seven threes maybe one other time this year but will he averaged to and a half three-pointers per game or you 12 to 13 points grab a decent amount of rebounds for a small Ford yes yes yes I I like Max Drew so I like them a lot and deeper formats as a late round Dart and I do think he's worth a look especially if you're desperate for three pointers if you're in Evan Mobley manager and you see strews get double the rebounds and almost triple the points on opening night how irritating is that how frustrated are you  it is a little frustrating you were hoping for Mobley to have a big game but I probably has such a high floor I don't think it I think it was it bubbly's draft you know his 80P was not unreasonable people were not drafting him 20 seconds and thinking with some big breakout was coming like you could still get them at like 35 but yeah you're completely right and they have to play true 30 minutes of game for their space and this might be his best game if you're rostering him already  maybe sell high if you aren't it's a good pickup like and you can hang on to him it's fine like you there's you know get them on your team or sell high if you can get over ridiculous return for him yeah now Alex I believe you stay in Cleveland for your first long shot free agent pick of the year I am it's not a super long shop a Charis Levert of the Cleveland Cavaliers again 17% roster and Yahoo nothing out of the ordinary from Levert in the opener honestly like 31 minutes 24% usage rate hook up like 11 points five assists but I'm sorry nice five times are nice but you can pass I mean it this is this is like a process thing like he just needs to be rostered in deeply so if you're in a 16 Team league and careless la verga is not a roster that's just not right because he's in the rotation already like even when nobody's hurt the complete rotation he's playing 206 to 30 minutes a game  he's like he's a you know high level six man for them  and then if Mitchell or Garland gets hurt he becomes like the secondary playmaker um so I just think in deeply like he's just he's such a clear add it's not it's not a crazy upside Pickering anything like that um but he should be roster  um Ken let's just go to your long shot I'm gonna go to Oklahoma City and suggest Isaiah Joe who's 1% rostered I think the Thunder are grooming Joe to be their points Off the Bench guy and much the way we talked about cam Thomas this team needs outside shooting in Joe shot 41% from behind the arc last season he had 15 points five boards and three triples Wednesday at Chicago that was in his 22 minutes led the bench for the Thunder um if you need those Max Drews and cam Tomas categories of points and triples but those two were not available look to Isiah Joe for the Thunder I think it's a good point Ken 24.7% usage in the in game one their bench is still kind of their bench has a lot of room for somebody to emerge yes you know they don't have like a lot of established bench options that we know are going to play 28 minutes a game I think I think Joe is a is a good option there I will say for there are people watching in this live stream somebody asked a question Jalen Johnson or herb Jones 10 team points League uh my opinion is Jalen Johnson because he has upside he's way more points upside and assist upside herb Jones I don't really like specialist and points in like three indeed guys because you're not getting the benefit of the three-point category steals are worth a lot but herb Jones is just not really a part of their offense and plus when Trey Murphy comes back if you were minutes for Jones so I really like Jalen Johnson and in that case especially in 10 team points League  yeah that is a tough question her herb Jones is going to have decent run here with trainers yeah but I do expect dreamer if he'd be reinserted into the starting lineup once he is at full strength and shakes off all the rust so you know it's too be determined when that's gonna happen I like Jill and Johnson and a bit more because 10 Team league I believe Jalen Johnson has more upside herb Jones is basically already in in most 10 team formats depending on the depth of the rosters herb Jones is basically ended the bench guy anyways so all right like nonsense upside there nice Shannon give us your long shot pick who's supposed to be rostered and less than 25% a week he's right around 30% he was closer to 25 when I made this it was before last night's game come on give me a break Josh okogie for the Phoenix Suns starting small forward he's locked into it it's pretty pretty simple math here do I think okay is worth a roster spot and 10 teams know 12 teams probably not unless it's a deeper bench but deeper formats and that yes he's locked in the starting lineup for the Suns  he's playing minutes feel and Booker are both dealing with what I presume our minor injuries right now so they both sat Thursday's game against the Lakers not get up the box score but he give you decent production hit some threes grab some rebounds hopefully get some defensive stats he's averaging you know he's basically has one block and one one stealth through two games right now but the three spend there at the rebound spend their those hustle stats are what he's known for so as long as he's getting 33 minutes per I'm in a roster I'm in like a 14 Team league he I watched basically half of both of those first two sons games and like watching the Suns it's so clear how crucially he is to what they do like the hustle you mentioned the hustle he is flying in for offensive rebounds like he's done his Rodman he is just a pure hustle guy will hit some threes once in a while like he is so locked in for them I just can't imagine anybody taking his minutes he's the star compliment someone has to play D someone has to take that defense of lead also role when you've got a Duran and Booker and Beale in there he's the perfect guy for that he's not gonna complain about a lack of shots so his minutes are going to be huge you know when they're all healthy how many shots it gets but how many times will all three of those guys be healthy not so sure the first two games I could tell you he is definitely not losing minutes to Eric Gordon or Grayson Allen wants his team's healthy I texted this way and Gordon looks chubby or chubby you're right I think he's always  you know he's  a little and I have no room to talk but Grace and Allen is just you know fight finally hitting that stage of evolution where he just is becoming Ted Cruz right now waiver there at the quarter could leave for Acapulco at any moment  all right let's let's wrap up this waiver wire section with a Vivid Seats Vivid Seats are sponsoring this podcast so I'm going to do their read the MBA

this will be a little less  chaotic than at other points during the season when a bunch of people are heard and questionable and it's a disaster it's a little more straightforward this time around we have an 11-game slate today the highest over under Warrior's at Kings set at 2:38 I did say you know Nick and I do the NBA XM show over the past two seasons over under in October that are over 2:30 go under 65% of the time just a heads up if you are Gambling Man but we are talking DFS Shannon are there any values or stay aways that stick out to you immediately on this slate well before I dive into my DFS values I do want to mention we are running a DFS tears contest on Splash Sports / Sports is a new spots for RotoWire I'm gonna try to run these contests every single year if you are interested we will post a link out to sign up for slash Sports and enter the contest on the show notes and descriptions both for audio and video and awesome go to our NBA lineups page today and you'll see a link to sports / Sports on there as well it's pretty hard to miss but they have they have pretty cool DFS tiers where you basically our Concepts set up where you just five bucks Stander you slacked five players one for each tier I'll give you a freebie here one yolk is in there and there's no one else even close I have to go with you tear one please check it out play against  me and teal whale I believe is their local right yes sir yes sir but for our DFS weekly segment we will be highlighting salary cap pics primarily and we'll see if this segment evolves during the season for now I'm going to jump around between DraftKings and FanDuel a little bit mentioned a few picks I like on each site like Alex said it's not there's not like one or two obvious games to really Target with tonight's slate but there is one obvious value pick both on FanDuel and DraftKings that I consider a must start and that is day Ron Sharpe  yes the Brooklyn Nets are without Nic Claxton sharp is 5,000 on FanDuel and he is at 50 or sorry 3300 almost a Min price player on DraftKings that's that's a free square right there you have to plug them in so I mean that to me Alex is the most obvious value for tonight's slate very obvious value going up going up against a an experience and old and they're playing Dallas like you're going up against Derek Lively who's a rookie you're going up against Maxi Cleaver and Dwight Powell who are aging this is a really good opportunity for sharp sharp is one of the best offensive rebounders in the NBA now is he good at anything else not really but does it matter for 3,300 on DraftKings or I can't remember what you said on FanDuel but you know five thousand he will get to pins he will um yeah that's an excellent that's the clear value play that's the free Square  I'll ask you Shannon because the Detroit Pistons to start the season kindly announced that Bellion bogdanovich and Monte Moore so basically be out a month with no warning whatsoever but they played a really strong game against the Miami Heat in the opener can you tell us what you saw in that game because they're playing the much worse Charlotte Hornets today which has an over under of 2207 I mean it was it was the Cade Cunningham and Jalen Duren show those were the two most impressive players on the court bam also looked really good on the heat side but Kate was in total control the the Pistons in general dealt with tons of turnovers specially in the first half I believe it's 15 turnovers in the first half a lot of just you know wires crossed bad passes that went right out of bounds they should clean that up as the season progresses but Cade with this 30 30 points nine assists and hit threes super efficient Jalen Duren for blocks and that that kind of feeds into one of the other things I'm seeing on DFS for tonight's late is you've got guys like on FanDuel both Kate and during our quite a bit more expensive than they were for the season opener during that 7900 kids at 88 on  on FanDuel it was prices even with the Christian matchup  I am hesitant to pull the trigger on either I do think they're both within range where they can be considered options but I like I like durian for instance far more on DraftKings on DraftKings endurance only 5600 and in general that highlights what I've seen comparing this slate to Wednesday's slate DraftKings didn't react too much their pricing kind of remain the same they didn't react from the one game whereas fanduel's pricing is all over the map from the one game so forth and Thomas might be cheap then  yeah no I on DraftKings I think he is he's definitely cheaper on DraftKings than his FanDuel I have to look into that but there's it's very reactionary pricing on FanDuel so it's actually made me take kind of two different approaches between the two sites I like sharp on both as mentioned but I'm FanDuel I like the guys who put up Duds in the first game I like those disappointing I want the bounce back candidates so you got guys like Jalen Brown at 6900 Evan Mobley 76 not a huge discount but I think he's gonna bounce back and have a better game tonight Jalen Williams is at 5800 dejounte Murray's at 74 there's a lot of guys you know even Mark helpful he's a guy I want to highlight on both sides 58 on FanDuel 55 on DraftKings folks was heavily owned and game one of the season I think he was close to 50% in the primary gpp on FanDuel he had 26 fantasy points in 24 minutes he only played 24 minutes because that game was a complete blowout yeah you know if he's playing 32 minutes still hit that fancy Point per minute Mark which he was he was basically there at the end of last season as well once he got the rust off and was back to full strength I mean full under 1000 on both sites fantastic play I want to get back to your point on Jalen Brown not only a dud in the game opener but a complete dud in that Series against the Heat where they were eliminated in the playoffs in the Eastern finals they play the Heat tonight on the one hand he should be extremely motivated after his giant contract and all the public criticism to have a big game against the Heat on the other hand Spoelstra always throws that zone at Boston and they always act like they're surprised and they never handle it well it drives me crazy as a celt expand kind of avoiding Celtics tonight to just always seems to have our numbers I was just about to ask you about Boston cat like when I when I you know I was catching that game and it was just a lot of Jayson Tatum look like a man among boys at times in that game and pouring guess obviously yeah um but it was just like the problem was the last year awesome first quarter pretty strong in the fourth but the middle quarters they just fell in love with himself got Lacks  a days ago fell in love with lazy jump shots and let go of the Rope on defense and I'm hoping holiday turns out around persing this was actually fantastic on defense was amazing used to having such a rim protector for the front of the Celtics was gorgeous to see four blocks but he also wildly altered at least four other shots it was wonderful I'm still excited it's early  very excited by that they actually just ground out the win in a game that last year they would have let slip away which they did in the season opener last year to the next as soon as the pressure got turned on  I'll mention two things quickly we mentioned Camp Thomas he is 6700 on FanDuel so immediate Spike for heaven and it's possible he doesn't even see 25 minutes depending on game script and then  you know Shannon was talking about Kate and Duran  I mean one thing I think that's just underrated for DFS is getting really  relatively low price players who could be or basically are number one options on their team like Kate is under 9,000 on FanDuel and his clearly hit the Pistons number one option and then you can pair him with his favorite basically passing option so you take a teams over one option pair him with his favorite passing guy so I think Kate enduring is going to be like a really nice stack all season in terms of guys I'm looking at I've seen who we mentioned already I think that's good we have this OKC versus Cleveland game  which I'm very interested in Darius Garland questionable again so just keep an eye on that but this moldy versus homegrown matchup  I would be worried about playing homegrown I Mobley is such a good Defender and in terms of like length maneuverability he is completely on par with chat I would completely avoid chat and I would personally lean Mobly I think this could be like a really big game for him a bully chat getting the pick and roll everything like that so I'm I'm keeping an eye on that matchup well after seeing what Andre Drummond did that I mean it's pretty obvious chat as washed and right yes we should all just fight him no chats actually very affordable for DFS tonight but likewise I'm not a big fan of the matchup I don't like that shadowy played I think it was 25 minutes in the first game of the season they're gonna bring him along slowly they're not going to give they're not gonna run him out there for 35 minutes so you guys both haven't mentioned the big over under of the night which is a 2308 Warriors Kings not a lot of starting lineup changes I guess though so nobody stands out there there are a couple I mean honestly on DraftKings Chris Paul is of my favorite plays these 6600 you know he he kind of got off to a slow start that that debut with the Warriors first half of the season first half of that game when I'm watching my thought was wow he looks kind of like Kyle Lowry during the playoffs last season this isn't great but then he picked it up and had he had a great second half he's 6600 on DraftKings you know with Draymond Green basically as long as dream on greens out I think Chris Paul is going to put up pretty stellar lines so he's he's good back for 35 to 40 fans he points  did you see a Kyle Lowry's usage rate by the way yesterday  one point nine  in 31 minutes what body doesn't age well that was not aged well I but yeah that can it's a good point to bring up the highest over under right we mentioned at the top of the at the top of the segment again something Nick brought up on the XM show Chris Paul he's a Slowdown the game guy though yes you know Draymond when he's in draymond's out for this game Dream On when he's in he's he grabbed he grabs the boards and he just goes off of rebounds he loves that but watching that first game Chris Paul he's slowing the offense down the whole time we'll walk it up he's gonna control the ball he's gonna stand at the very top of the three point line everybody on Golden State's going to do some movement they weren't I didn't like their offense they didn't get a lot of 65 years old Alex that's what you do that's how Shannon and I run the you know the road to wire pickup offense I played basketball this morning with the old man they're numerous 60 year olds on the court and I know like in Olympic level at  all right calls is that it for our DFS advice Alex tell us about our good friends at rival fantasy I would love to

Drummond almost broke chat on opening night with a crossover dribble get Chunky fellas I've said it a thousand times  can love the thick boy I serious I thought what I thought homegrown was out for the year when I saw him I thought I don't care I don't even under I've I think I've watched that clip 15 to 20 times I can't figure out why he collapsed did the reasoning turn on you know like what what gentle breeze knocked homegrown over into that like compressed somersault Andre Drummond you can measure his 40 with a calendar and yet he drove right he shook he broke ankles a homegrown and his balls of wood legs I'm glad he's still alive after that  man um  mispronounced names can I think we're gonna have a hard time with Benn Jama all year I should really just said when be really all you
