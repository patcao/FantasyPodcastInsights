hey everybody it's Steve Alexander this is the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast  sponsored by smart brackets it's Tuesday  March 19th I'm Dr a his kirian we'll be back in a minute to cover everything that happened on the first Monday  probably of your fantasy NBA playoffs let's do it Karen thanks for coming back we had so much fun last Tuesday we decided to do it again this Tuesday  your guy Anthony Edwards  has now  by my count maybe the three most exciting plays of the year in NBA basketball after he threw down  what I like to call the Dunkirk around the world last night over Alpha first  Horford left the game without you  was that over John Collins oh yeah why am I saying why am I saying now or you know yourself a little bit yeah it was John Collins so he throws this thing down in traffic over John Collins Collins leaves the game with a head contusion  I couldn't really tell if  part of Edwards  hit him in the head if the basketball came through the through the hoop so fast and hit him in the head that's what heard him but either way wow what a dunk  absolutely incredible stuff we talked about it last week I not gonna quit until he gets at least some love for MVP that's Aunt  as for the John Collins injury I'm not sure when he might have been hit by like ants like coming through the pain and also might have been just a case of you know like the childhood embarrassment injury or something bad happens and you're like going down and you're like well maybe this wasn't as bad as I thought it was but I'm gonna stay down for a couple extra but it's cuz that was gnarly but what an incredible play and what an incredible player aunt is and the Timberwolves are making a lot of noise well the cool the cool thing about it was he dislocated his finger on his left hand he's ring finger and that was also due to contact with the head of John Collins I think and  he just kind of like went in the locker room popped it back in the place put some dirt on it taped it up went back out there kept playing um  do you think that  that attention that he got from that dunk last night could get him some MVP boats I mean could this bump him up in the race at all  you know I'm not an MVP voter I've never talked to MVP voter personally so I'm not sure what goes through their heads um but I do think like plays like that and moments like this almond I think it's worth mentioning like with Karl Anthony towns out that this is a huge moment for Aunt to like solidify his case for MVP I don't know if he's necessarily going for that they're more team-oriented this year but  I do think though like plate certain plays and certain moments in a season can really like the find an MVPs and for sure  well and I still don't understand why he's not getting any MVP love I mean SGA gets all the MVP love  and his team's a half game up on Minnesota  in the West Oklahoma City's number one  Minnesota and Denver tied at  47 and 21 a half game behind Oklahoma City  and then the Clippers are five back of a Casey so it's interesting that you know the Seventh Place Dallas Mavericks and Luca  you hear a lot more about Luca winning MVP then you do I got like and Edwards so it's pretty interesting stuff I don't I don't I don't foresee  Anthony coming out of nowhere and winning the MVP but  yeah I'm not calling for him to win I just want to get get them give them some love at least the voter to give him a vote yeah speaking  well we weren't speaking of Atlanta John Collins used to play for the Atlanta Hawks the Hawks  who are reeling with no Trey young know DeAndre Hunter they just got Jaylen Johnson back they just got and you can move back  get blown out of gym last night by Lakers Brawny and Danza Russell all had fought double doubles  um  and somehow  an a relatively healthy Nets team that I feel like is  better than they are in on paper than they are in real life like why can't the Nets try to track down the Hawks and get into the playoffs right now the Hawks just keep hanging on to that ten spot  which means they're gonna get another crappy draft pick and and continue to be the Hawks but I kind of thought the Nets might track them down it's just not happening  yeah I like the Nets team in theory they just can't seem to figure it out I think mikal Bridges struggles limits their ceiling a lot so they're kind of just like grinding out games every night and it's it's a struggle and Johnson was really the only bright spot for the Hawks last night and then that ended when he left the game early he did I saw a report that he returned to the Hawks bench so he might have been able to return if it wasn't a 20-point blowout like you said so there's maybe some silver lining there as for the Lakers man they're just hitting their stride looking great at the not I shouldn't say great they're looking good they're looking like the team that made the Western Conference finals last year it's only a matter if they if they can stay healthy Anthony Davis LeBron playing a lot of games this year I love the starting lineup of Russell Reeves hachimura James and Davis I don't know why it took them so long to get to that point on the Taurean Prince experiment was odd but the Lakers are hitting their stride plant really well right now  good call on Jalen Johnson's ankle injury I slept on that last night I missed it I I actually kind of took the night off last night I  came home to my wife of work came home and just kind of chilled  and didn't  watch much basketball even though  I'm got these huge playoff matchups going on I I think I was so I think I'm so stressed about trying to win the stupid 30 Team league that I can't even watch anymore so Jalen Johnson left with the ankle injury he was back on the bench  um who knows if he could come in and played it's the same angle that caused in the missed three games or in the months of the  keep that in mind he's probably gonna be iffy for the rest of the week so  no Donovan Mitchell last night right so careless Levert comes out and starts 238 and 11  steal a buck and a three in a win over the Pacers  Tyrese Howard and 14 points and 12 assists but he only hit four or 14 shots  first of all I Levert should have been a hot pick up this week they played four games and not many teams do play for games and it's playoffs week  and there's no doubt I'm in Mitchell I think Levert is sneaky and is gonna help a lot of people who picked him up and then  is Tyler Burton losing some of his luster  starting with the Cavs I love Levert I've always loved Levert I thought he was on his way to start them with the nuts and then he kind of got bounced around a little bit he settled in nicely to the Sixth Man role but um you know I don't think we can consider him a star by any means maybe a star in his role but I loved one he gets  like increased playing time I just love the way he plays he's averaging 1996 and a half Steals and His Four starts this year that's that's really solid stuff when you lose a guy like Mitchell and you can bring in a dynamic player like Levert as for Halliburton Wisconsin kid at heart so I'm always gonna be cheering for him as I'm I live in Wisconsin never played him in high school he was he's a little too old for me or two young for me which is sad um but I you know  he ever since the All-Star break he kind of like sold his soul to go off in that All-Star game and then he couldn't even win MVP at home because Damon Damian Lillard and the honest kind of just stole the MVP from him so it's very concerning it's just the three-point shot really though you know he still dishing out dimes and leading that offense but they're just not as prolific as they were early in the season when they were leading basically every category offensively  yeah and they're they're five and five of their last ten they're in seventh place in the East they're behind the Sixers who he just fighting not having Joel embiid Just  he hanging around and keep  keep getting it done their five and five of them their last ten  the magic of eight and two over their last 10 which is the same as the resulting that magic team was weird man like I don't understand how it's that good but it is what it is all right so Levert was a big pickup I think and props to you if you went and did that another I got one more Cavalier this might be like a super deeper League special George nyang since moving into the starting lineup March 6th he's made Seven starts 14 points four rebounds two assists one and a half stocks shooting 55% from the field and he's making 2.73 per game that's like I mean not we're talking like 16 team and over type play but he that that's incredible production and he's doing this obviously without Evan Mobley Dean Wade they can't believe there's just one picked up Marcus Morris too he hit four threes last night so that's kind of an interesting play but there's a lot of opportunities in the power forward spot right now in Cleveland and yang is making hay with it right now yeah I know  camels said we're forgetting about George Yang on Thursday when we were talking and I sort of did forgot about him but I didn't notice he played well again last night he's playing okay him and this Taylor Hendricks guy and my God Delano baton yeah still kind of ball and out like there's there's still plenty of Silly Season guys to mess with out there so um  we had no Jayson Tatum for the Celtics last night right  Chris Staples porzingis greatest with his presence after a five-game absence welcome back Chris apps I love the fact that Boston can just plant him on the bench for five games and nobody even really notices he's gone he doesn't even matter  no Tatum last night doesn't matter Derek White's gonna triple double 2210 and 10 Jalen Brown scored 30 31  and Peyton Richard  my starting lineup in my 32 Team league is going to go for 23 points 7 assists  and presenting his head 20 points in eight boards so  man the Celtic I still think so the team to be but people are seem to be pushing back at me on that what do you think  yeah this silly season Celtics are just as good as the regular season Celtics man oh true holiday was out last night out for results so out last night and Sam Houser was a lot last night he had 30 points on Sunday 10:30 is I had him I was about to pick him up in a deep like 16 Team league I'm in need of Threes in a category league and I had an offer put in for him and then he sprained his ankle and I was like I can't but like you but like you said Pritchard  These Guys these bench guys for the Celtics they're gonna be in line for a lot of run these next couple weeks um  the Celtics have essentially locked up the one seed so I I Envision a lot of resting a lot of  blowouts of the starters do play so Pritchard I I also picked him up in a deeper League last night and I fist bumped when I saw that line and what I came home from the gym there there's a lot of value to be had in these depth pieces especially if the Celtics continue to like shoot out rest people on down the stretch here  which they're going to I mean I yeah I'm sure they're like okay let's let's look for zinga's play against Detroit and then we'll just put him back on the bench for five games and wait till the end of the season because he only played 20 minutes and he's still put up a 20.00 nearly like it's the if efficiency that that offense runs with his crazy in terms of like competing like you said you still think they're the favorite and you're getting some pushback on all the stats say that they should be the favorite and I they probably are the favorite I for our like post All Star break Futures bets I said Boston and Denver I know I'm not really going out on a limb there but I was getting Denver at like plus 450 to win the title and you know they're just kind of flew under the radar a little bit they they weren't compete like really fighting for that one seed as Minnesota and OKC kind of like we're shining early in the season but Denver's great and they are basically the same team a little less depth but like Peyton Watson is an incredible Defender Off the Bench so like I still like their depth this year that's starting lineup is so potent um I think it I think the three real contenders in my in my eyes are the nuggets the Celtics and the Bucks I think  after the nuggets in the west it's just kind of like a who can get hot right like the Lakers could get hot the Warriors could get hot do I trust them to like get hot probably not so I think those are the three real contenders and I would probably put Boston and Denver ahead of the Bucks in that tier are the sons and Clippers gonna get this figured out in time like are they can they flip a light switch and and go  to I I'm yes because they have those types of players that normally can do can flip the switch you know people say that that can't happen but in the NBA there are some players that can do that the sun's fourth quarter issues are  super concerning they you go out and have get three guys get a third guy like Bradley Beal right and you have those three so that your fourth quarters you should be easier right you just pass the ball around if they try to double KD you get an open Bradley Beal in the corner Grace and Allen in the corner so the fourth quarter issues in Phoenix need to be figured out fast if not they're gonna be gone in five or six games I do think  they can get hot though and I do think the Clippers can get hot but my confidence level is not high on either of those things happening yeah I Clippers look so good there for a minute and now they don't so I don't I don't know what's what's gonna happen but I think the playoffs are going to be fun I have a pretty good feeling about that hey March Madness fans before we dive into the madness we want to Loop you in on one of our sponsors  supported intelligence they developed an AI tool called smart bracket.io they

choice is along the way thank you supported intelligence  here and I run a really old school imagine that paper bracket pool  here in my little town I think the first year we did it we had like 11 and trees and last year there were 127 something like that this year Anthony gonna be over 150 by hand sucks but we're sort of locked in I'm like no venmo no no PayPal we're not doing this electronically we're doing this old school you got to sit down in the bar with your pen and fill out your bracket and you got to hand me a 10-dollar bill I stick it on an envelope and that great at night I sent out these really ridiculous emails at like four in the morning after every round that  I tried to get all these as many digs in as I can at my friends and and make fun of people who don't really know I'm making fun of them and it's a big hit so it's a big  everybody seems to like it I love that a lot that brings me back to my high school days I had a buddy who did the same sort of thing his dad was a football coach so we'd all go over to his house like most weekends have like hang out and whatever and every March they like spring break you know first day of spring break like that first Friday we're all we're all there hanging out and there's just like a stack like 150 brackets and his dad's filling them all out and then you know as we get closer to the final four that he'd be like post the brackets I'm like a whiteboard like the ones that are still alive and stuff so that that brings me back on some to some good memories yeah and I'm gonna make it really interesting because I'm gonna I'm Gonna Keep  I'm Gonna Keep a little bit  of the entry fee for my admin fee because if we're like 150 brackets  I think that's probably about 30 hours or work  and it's at least I'm walking around town carrying around this big folder like it like a total you know dork and people are like  what was this guy doing over here he's got he's got 1000 pieces of paper and highlighters and but it's pretty it's pretty fun it's like last night information classified and I do love it and I love the fact that I don't watch any college basketball until like Thursday like that that's what I'm trying to turn on and see what's happening so um  playoff Jimmy Jimmy Butler since out the second game of a back-to-back which means he sat out on Sunday he said out on Monday Jana set out on Sunday like what a brutal  stretch for people who are trying to get in the fancy playoffs and win the fancy playoffs Jimmy got a foot injury  the back-to-backs for the heater over for the week  is he going to play on Wednesday and is he good together the rest of the week I mean I I don't know man playoff Jimmy makes me nervous yeah that's it's anybody's guess now he's missed back-to-back games so it's it's tough I would lean to the side of not playing um you know even his two games before his absences he wasn't really like super efficient from the field so it's tough I would probably be looking elsewhere if I could you know obviously still have them  on deck if he gets cleared and you can throw them in but I would not be like relying on him at this moment  well I told everybody to go get Duncan Robinson and fire him up for the week and after he had 30 points in five triples on Sunday and of course  he left last night's game with a back injury and Three Points so I am sorry for that if that got anybody um  but it's not a lot you can do to foresee and injury coming to a guy like dunking Robinson family was better last night 20 points 13 boards six assists that's more like the BAM line that we've been waiting for  and then for the Sixers Tyrese Maxie had 30 points 8 boards Tennessee  that's a massive stat line man still block three threes  Kelly oubre 22 points 11 boards five blocks you kidding me a six is one two straight they're still hanging it number six in the east  I kind of like Kelly oubre might go away when Maxie came back but that's hell of a stat line last night  yeah starting off with the heat um you know  Jaime Hawkeyes got the start again in place of Jimmy he's been really good this year he was not really good last night especially in the final minute the heat had a chance to  reclaim the lead they gave the ball to him on back-to-back possessions and he had like one little post up like where he tried to draw in like flailed and threw up an air ball and then he had a wide open three in the corner to make it a one-point game with like 35 seconds left and barely Drew iron so that that was a bad showing from The Rook in a big moment where the heat need to win a game like that um the donkey in Robinson thing your process was right he's been great his connection with bam is special whenever they're on the court together and in a situation like when a player like Butler's out there's always value there so the process was right there the injury sucks it is considering a back injury for a three-point shooter that's that's not an easy thing to overcome you need your all your back muscles to get that elevation on that jump shot so I don't know if he's gonna be able to come back right away you know the direct replacement you're like is Patty Mills the answer probably not he scored 13 points in his heat debut but has only scored 13 total points in five games after that so you know I think Caleb Martin might be an option if Robinson and Butler stay out for a little bit he's he can put up production Off the Bench but the heater the butler injury is concerning and I don't know if Robinson's coming back anytime soon as for the Sixers  the embed list Sixers can be fun when Uber or healed kind of like gets hot next to Maxie right like they're those two are pretty volatile shooters  they can put up points in bunches though so it's kind of a fun Dynamic but you need Maxi there to raise that floor because he is incredible no matter who is on the floor he does what he does um it also looked like Kyle Lowry had a little extra motivation last night against his former team I don't there's not many fantasy implications in in that but he looked wired up and he was running around making a lot of plays in a typical  30 game now like a dirty game but like a ugly low scoring like in the trenches type of game that's where Lowry thrives you just said Kyle Lowry and I blacked out for 30 seconds I don't I don't remember the last 30 seconds of my life  it's interesting talk going back to the Heat and how about how my Hawks because how many Hawkins  has played such a major role for that Team all year he's not looked like a rookie he's been a glue guy he's been a guy they run the offense through he's been a guy that sort of involved in everything but I feel like he may have hit some sort of wall in the last month you know since the All-Star break because he  he's been mysteriously quiet and used to be like  Jimmy Butler sits out how many how could goes off and that's not really been the case lately I can see him getting him back I wouldn't give up on High made just yet but  he is not been quite as fun as he as he wants was  but Uber I've still got Uber on a team where I'm trying to win a championship and  that's super fun tell you what I know people there are certain people that watch this podcast and cringe when I start talking about my 30 my 30 Team league but as everybody knows probably from Twitter the final four in that league is me Rick kamla who got podcast with here on Thursdays my bossy ESPN Joe and then beverage who works with Aaron brewski who I worked with it the other rodo side for a very long time ago all these guys were all like brothers and we all want to win this league so bad and we are really good teams and I've got wimby and wimby on Sunday night just took over the world with that 30 point  15 seven blocks seven assists whatever whatever nonsense he put up that night and knocked my boy Matt Smith out of the 30 deep so we've got a final four going on that is is pretty intense and it's going to be tight and super fun and so much fun I can't even watch basketball anymore I'm so nervous about it  um  let's talk about the undertone and the Portland Trail Blazers for second you and I said it last week I think we were like I think eight in my be done no that was me and Camilla we the week before that and now eight in 2515 to blocks again Anthony Simons who were kind of waiting to be shut down of course 30 the lotto Banton my guy I love points five boards  three steals two blocks um all that and Portland lost to the bulls the bulls got  28 points from DeRose and they got 23 in Tennessee from the sumu  Cruz says kind of hurting he's one of five for Five Points  that helped assume you go crazy and then Jeremy Grant did not play for the Blazers our Jeremy Grant gone is he is that done or is nobody shutting down this year and everybody's going to keep playing until the end  um I would be surprised if Grant came back and played consistently  so like I'm not gonna say he's going to be shut down for the entire season but you know like playing two out of four games a week or something he's missed a bunch of games in a row and he's only played like two of the last like 10 or something like that so I would be surprised if he came back and like actually made an impact in fantasy I think Portland is really content seeing what they have for the future with the Simon's Henderson Banton Jabari Walker and 8 in line up Aidan's been incredible I don't know if you saw the  the Twitter explode last night about his or maybe not last night last afternoon yesterday afternoon about his him sleeping on an air mattress to begin this season and that's why you said he said that's why I probably wasn't as well as I could have earlier this season so you know he's got a bed now if he's got a real bed that's seven foot bodies getting a full night's rest who knows he's on stoppable  is Deanna the weirdest guy in the NBA  clothes but that that is a high bar to the cross I feel like I don't Kai Jones is back in the NBA well what about what about well let's figure this out hold on a second what about Jordan Poole  Jordan Poole is a strange man okay but buttons pushing the envelope man like he's really making he's really giving me  some good crazy Vibes here because  you know like I told like I told whoever I was podcasting with that day like I live in the mountains of Georgia and I know if it's if it's gonna snow tonight my car is not getting out of my driveway like you it's not happy so I drive it to the top of my driveway and park it up at the street and if we're really gonna get extreme  I know my car is not going to make it out of my neighborhood because I live in a place called Crown Mountain I live literally on top of a mountain so I know my car is not gonna make it off this mountain if there's snowing I'm so sometimes we have to go all the way in parking in town and then get a ride and a four by four to get out there to have access to a car now if I'm just a  average dude that covers fantasy sports for a living and I can make  these arrangements so that I have a card to get somewhere why can't a millionaire  that lives in Portland  figure out that he he should probably do something to get ready for a snow game tomorrow  other than just calling and sick and say I can couldn't get my car out of the driveway um and now we're sleeping on an air mattress dude I'd rather sleep on my floor hardwood floor in my office and sleep on one of those are mattresses so I don't I don't know man I more powered it down right in for for doing odd things I love it  yeah he he's a national news at any time he opens his mouth or anything happened so it's pretty incredible  I mean he's a max player he's always gonna be they can't take that away from him true  so he's got that he's got that going for him which means she's got a lot of money that's funny man I and I missed that whole tweet yesterday that whole thunderstorm about him sleeping on air mattresses start to see season I love that by the way last time I won 30 deep was 2011 and it was because I picked up Jeremy Lin a like literally the day before Lynn sanity happened and that reminds me of Jeremy Lin because he was sleeping on like his buddy's couch at that time  yeah I remember that yeah yeah he didn't even have a bed  crazy  there you go um okay DeAndre thank you very much Laurie Markin and  shockingly came back from a five-game absence and started for the Jazz right  he had 22 points 12 boards I had like scramble to get him off my IR  and one place I literally forgot all about him I thought he was done  she played well and his return Taylor Hendricks who has been a hot pick up  eight point six Boards of Steel on a block  so it's  it was serviceable but it wasn't as good as it would have been had Mark and kept staying out so Taylor Hendricks came out of nowhere on the waiver wire the last  you know five games when  marketing was sitting by the time I went got in my feel like it's kind of too late but  I'm stuck with him now it is what it is keonte George he's gonna bawl out the rest of the way I think  15 points 8 assists  and then there's Walker Kessler who had  14 rebounds and maybe a couple blocks I don't know  what is going on with Walker Kessler I don't  I mean I was talking to my buddies Zach who's got him on his team and  I was like you got to get rid of Kessler dude he's like I can't just cut Walker Kessler you you sort of could have if you  if you're good in boxing rebounds I mean he literally does nothing else totally starting with the market in return he did have six turnovers keyonte George also had six turnovers so a little inefficient but I like the young core that the Jazz have and I would include Walker Kessler in that core for right now um but the his playing time is just been so sporadic obviously if John Collins misses time Hendrix and Kessler both get a little bit of a boost for the next for the rest of the week we don't I don't know how long Collins will be out or if you'll miss any time he initial concerns of a concussion but those seem to have dissipated on they said he was cleared of concussion just as like a head contusion that still doesn't sound very fun but he'll probably be able to suit up in a little bit keyonte George fantastic player super fun to watch puts up stats like crazy three-pointers assists can get some defensive stats I really like will  Hardy as a coach I I hope that they can make some hay next year it's just the whole Kessler of thing all season has been concerning and I think you're right I think if you would have cut bait with Kessler months ago you probably wouldn't have been like regretting it at any point in the season but if you have them if you still have a rostered right now like you know there's there's not like I don't really know like what you're hoping for you you've already know what you're getting like inconsistent production but when he does play 25 plus minutes he's gonna be double digit boards couple blocks every night and that's the thing I don't really blame this on Walker Kessler I mean he's minutes of just been so weird all year  and he was like a third or fourth round guy last year and now he's like a 12th round guys so um huge disappointing season from Walker Kessler  but again I don't really blame I don't really blame him I don't need his fault so and back to this  head confusion and concussion for Collins like if you get if you get your head caved in because a guy dunked on you like that is like and just  it didn't care man it's like it's like John Collins was standing too close to a  to like rocket launcher something out of out in the war zone he got confused by the  whatever the I can't believe the word when it after you fire the thing off but whatever The Recoil recoil The Recoil got him but anyway Colin Sexton that 24 points and by the way his line was 32.7 boards 8 assists a steal two blocks  and the Dunkirk around the world so it's funny ESPN had that dunk up on on their front page it was like massive don't buy Anthony Edwards changes tone of game and I never really click on stuff like that but I click on that one I watched it like probably four times in a row and I like  wow that goes up there with that I mean it's the offensive dunk and the defensive block of the Year both long to Anthony Edwards he was getting no love for MVP and like I said earlier I don't want to harp on the point too much but Rudy gobert was not playing in this game and not read left early and Karl Anthony towns is still out so and is like he's making these highlights and putting up these numbers and caring the Timberwolves to Victory and these top and without his top Sidekicks you know talk to me about Niles read he get hurt yeah he he didn't return um he played 17 minutes he a head injury I didn't really see the what happened um  so Luka Garza got some extra time nickeil Alexander Walker like started the second half I'm not really sure what the likelihood of him is he an extended time is but I wouldn't be surprised if he missed a game or two hmm I missed that one for the Knicks Jalen Brunson at 34.7 boards  baller great season no MVP talk for him either Ogden and Obey suffers in elbow setback  did not play last night  and then Trace Jackson Davis who was on my son's bench even though he's playing  My Morning Jacket keyboardist Bowser  in a playoff matchup in my rock and roll League  trayce Jackson Davis remains Roman he had 19 points nine boards three blocks  on my son's bench so I'm like dude you can't believe people on your bench it's playoffs gotta set your line he's like I did like but you didn't a kids  kids I tell you some people's kids yeah can can Jackson Davis stay relevant I think the short answer is yes but not necessarily like uber productive while staying relevant I think he'll be on the cusp of relevancy you know over his last seven games averaging 12 points seven boards to assist and two blocks only playing 23 minutes he made two starts during that stretch as for last night I watched a lot of this game because I have Bronson on  two of my biggest leaks right now so I was watching that game really closely and like two or three times he like stepped awkwardly and stayed on the ground for an extra minute and I was like not now not now come back but he was fine he finished the game strong um as for Jackson Davis production last night though I feel like this was a defensive strategy by the next they were hounding Curry on the ball screens and letting the roller slip to the basket and just daring them to make that pass over and over and over again and while the Warriors did they didn't do it every time Jackson Davis probably could have had even more production so I don't think 20 and 10 and 3 blocks is a fair expectation every night but I do think 12 and 8 and a block is a pretty fair expectation for him moving forward on the Nick side like I said Bronson's unbelievable caring teams single-handedly carrying a couple of my teams Myles I was British miles McBride also known as Deuce McBride made a pretty big impact last night he drew the start over for OG and an OB over precious of who is starting when Anna nobody was out before I don't know if that'll continue or if the that was another another just like Thibodaux decision going against Curry you want to get another guard out there saved since legs on defense a little bit so I don't I wouldn't count on McBride staying in the starting lineup but he's definitely someone to watch if you need guard helped his three-point shot has been incredible this season which was like one of the biggest concerns for him in his development I don't think McBride is like a pickup and like a 14 Team league or even a 16 Team league at this point but if he draws a couple more starts this week he could definitely be a pickup  for next week I mean you were looked Duty hit 913 shots six and nine triples yeah scored 29 Points and he played every minute of the first half him and Jason Hart both did yeah like Tibbs it does not care about minutes at all and so there's there's a lot of production there the OG injury for the next soccer um there are 15 and two with them in the lineup like flirting with 500 with him out of the lineup I think um I don't know if they can like contend contend for like the Eastern Conference with him out of the lineup so we'll see what happens there I know they said the initial thing is like he'll just miss a few games but that could extend the five or six or seven games really fast by the way Josh Hart had a 10/11 triple double and played every second of the game the Tibbs cracks me up man like I saw some stat when I'm slipping channels last night and flip by that game and said something like the first time I'll see season two teammates played every minute of the first half to the other for any team  and then one of them played 47 minutes the airplane 48 so McBride got a one minute rest at the end of the game probably heart played the whole thing they beat the Warriors cracks me up man Josh Hart that's rebounding Garden League I think and he's kind of been bawling for the Knicks for a solid month now so hopefully people riding him  yeah and there's no reason that'll slow down if Anna will be continues to miss time and Julius Randle is still nowhere near returning from the like the latest reports that we have  Desmond Bane played again for the  for the Grizzlies last night scored 23 points  um  I'm shocked I'm just shocked that Desmond Bane is is back and you know him and I were talking about the other day like the mindset has shifted like  I don't think he NBA  General  attitude of well  we're done we're not in the playoffs our season's over I'm gonna sit my studs  something is changed the mentality is changed and now they're like get out there Desmond get out there Triple J just keep playing people are paying money to see play so the fact that Jaron Jackson Jr and Desmond Banner right now absolutely blows my mind oh yeah and they I feel like they are kind of in the same boat as you because they were just chucking up shots they both attempted like 25 shot at least 25 shots or something like that they weren't very efficient um but they if they're gonna be out there they're gonna be getting their shots up trying to  you know pad their stats a little bit as the season comes to a close the Grizzlies were not very efficient like I said last night but they made up for it with defense they had 13 Steeles and seven blocks as a team gonna give a little shout out to my guy John conchar I hope that's how you say his name I'm not really sure I've never heard he's got eight steals over the last three games and he's got 20 stocks over the last so eight deals over the last three games 20 stocks over the last eight games that is a lot of production right there would talk in Matisse Bible of Defense of production you know he doesn't do much else he grabs six seven boards a game but there's not much offense there but that that defense production is is incredible and with all of their injuries and if you need some defensive streaming help in category League's that guy in a deeper League that guy might be a someone to look out for other than that the GG Jackson had another good game he was like the only the efficient Grizzly last night but you like you said the the mindset appears to have changed I don't want to like completely um  put that all on the 65 game rule or whatever it is but I feel like that has to be at least a factor or a variable in that conversation for sure and zir Williams sat out Luke Kennard set up for personal reasons Vince Williams my guy yeah we haven't seen him for a while haven't been able to play him so they can't charge  GG Jackson Jr all played  at least 35 minutes for that team man like that has wild those are dividendo numbers 39 39 404 for Gigi  44 minutes  um they all they were all productive there's Grizzlies out there to be had and they're playing playing big minutes right now like you said inefficiency was there Jerry Jackson Jr hit of 27 shots that's not good but it is what it is for the Kings the monoson bonus 2518 of 5  all are Harry Barnes had 11 points Keegan Murray had 15 points 10 boards dear and fox had 23/7 and 10 three steals blocked six turnovers four triples Kevin Hart got hurt left the game very very early and then Malik Monk  went off again 28.6 board 6 assists is he locked up six man of the year  I would I would have to lean yes um he has not started a game this year which I if I was a voter I would feel like that is kind of important for me I know there's a lot of six men that get a start one of a starter is injured or something like that but even one starters are injured monk comes off the bench and he plays that role and he plays it to Perfection he was incredible last night scored 12 of 6 of The King 16 points in overtime of had some big shots in the fourth quarter to like we were talking about with Aunt there's moments when moments in the season where voters can like be swayed right and in a game against the Grizzlies like the king's need to win this it goes into overtime the Kings the Kings lose this it's bad news and monk was like I got this guy so that's that's a moment where you can kind of sway some voters there so bonus whole home man just incredible satellite lines and you're just like oh yeah daily daily bonus line I'm riding him and we did we go right away goes to Vegas every year and we did  a draft there and I'm in the final four two week Championship or two week or two two week playoffs right so first um  first first round and I'm going I have a bonus in my opponent has yolk so as long as the bonus can like kind of mitigate yokich I'm gonna be really happy there and got off to a great start Fox had of Darren Fox had a flurry of Threes in like the third quarter of last night's game but other than that he seemed kind of passive I think he only finished with like 16 shots or something like that and in overtime game for him is kind of surprising herder was really just like flat out bad um he was not making his three-pointers for like the last couple weeks so the injury kind of just like shells him for good and then my guy to watch out for with that injury is Keon Ellis he was already kind of stealing some minutes he drew the start in the second half defensive production three-point production you know probably not gonna be a prolific player especially with guys like Monk and fox and a bonus dominating everything but Ellis could be a sneaky pick up her estimates the next week or two he had five blocks and steel last night  so yeah Keenan Ellis played 34 minutes that is a guy  that is the guy worth keeping an eye on especially with this herder injury so let's dive into some viewer comments and questions start off with a comment here just because the students fired up David said guys in my playoff semi-finals 12 team I get I have ant  some bonus to Shante Josh Hart I'm feeling good for the first day of the week of good for you man that's that's awesome it's fun it's fun when your team's playing well and you have a good first night you get off get out of the blocks on the right foot speaking of you're going up against yolk its Wendy and yokich were going against each other last Sunday in my 30 Team Matchup and you didn't shoot it that well and then when he came out and went off and when we when we got me passed yolk itch and that's why I'm taking women being number one  in all my drafts next year this is from manila's Most Wanted guys is it is hero a drop on a two week playoff game some of the finals started this week I think he is I'm not messing with Tyler hero  yeah I would agree with that semi-finals playoffs it's Do or Die mode you know maybe hero comes back and somebody in the championship picks him up and you feel a little like shouldn't let him go but you gotta do what you got to do to move advance and if he's taking up a roster spot that could be filled by someone who can give you production you got to make the move all right this is perfect Christian says more guys had to drop o g  who's a good waiver wire pickup for me we talked about  Taylor Hendricks a little bit  he's hurt by the fact that Lori marking and has come back we just got done talking about a guy named Keon Ellis  who had five blocks to steal last night it depends on who's available in your league I mean there's  there are so many hot pickups  out there I feel like that Karis Levert still a hot pink cup  here and you got a guy's off top of your top of your head well yeah I feel like because he said OG and then he was picking up Hendricks he might need to fill the forward spot on and so like in that case like you know I said Georgian earlier of that that might be ill not a high ceiling guy but a pretty high floor guy especially with all those injuries in Cleveland on Henry's like you said he's hurt by marketing coming back but he could also that could be mitigated by I just totally lost it there was there's another injury in the front court so I would be fine oh yeah John Collins yeah yeah the Andrew injury so like that could be  it could be mitigated there so I would wouldn't mind rolling with Hendrix I think he could give you  flirt with double double production for the rest of the way I think this is important too like let's see  the New Orleans Pelicans  still have four games left this week  they're the only one who is not burned one of their four yet so  I mean if you can pick up a pelican  and what's his name is hurt right herb Jones yeah he's still hurt I think he would you pick up there he's he was listed probable for today though so he'll probably play all right but New Orleans still has four games left you got and get one of those and then there's still a ton of teams that have three games left on the schedule this week I mean that's that's sort of what you want to do you want to Target somebody's does a lot of games I care for us three  Payton Pritchard still has three amen Thompson still has three if did he play last night I don't even know now they didn't play last night  but team like the Lakers only has two games left this week and in Memphis who we just talked about only has two games left this week so I would Target more like a three-game three game team when you're looking to make that replacement and you said you mentioned Rockets too so like a guy like Jack Landell is probably still rolling around the waivers and he's gonna be seeing some some extra run with sanguine out to  other good question from Matt Kearney  gotta take a player off the eel who's she drops cute Henderson about him all read or anyone that's tough me and who's the guy coming off the eel oh so School is gonna be inefficient so if this is a category League  might be a little hesitant on him but I if it's a point League I'm not dropping scoot right now I think he's gonna get a lot of run the last couple weeks I feel like you would have to probably oh I had to head points like okay sorry so yeah I I'm not dropping scooter Banton in a points league right now they're the only thing that concerns me with them is their efficiency at this point so it's between read and a Congo unaka returned last night um I think he was pretty limited Off the Bench yeah um so I would probably lean with him at this point read just has a higher upside than a Congo at this point because of the embed injury so I'm probably wrong with the net go I'm with you I'm I think I'm taking well I'm dropping on you I'm keeping rage yeah  didn't champagney  and this is from old yeast it's just me and add in the ESPN points League  All right so the Wizards in the report is substantial right now they have quickly caught up with the Trailblazers and The Grizzlies Spurs with Wizards  this is this is Justin I think so he's the other champagne yeah so this is the this is the wizard guy yeah the first the first champagne I'm probably fine staying away from The Wizard champagne actually back to back-to-back games with double figures at least seven boards Scott free Steals and three blocks during that stretch and this I'm just gonna read off the Wizards injury list right now Marvin Bagley is out Landry Shaman is out Denny avios out omaroo is out tyus Jones is out cooler bali's out for the season Isaiah livers is out for the season who's mad didn't show up on the initial injury report yesterday but that is now listed as questionable so I yes I feel like Justin is a fine pick up right now  that's quality information you will not get that on very many other podcasts  so when I'm sitting here thinking it's the dude the place for the Spurs when it's actually his brother the place for the Wizards so good information right there I know I know I'm missing any of Deezer right now yeah and  yeah Wizards are banged up man Tori Thompson was able to pick up Chris Middleton and Desmond Bane off waivers a few weeks ago  I wouldn't have probably done that maybe I would give you Middleton I just had no face in Maine so yeah I I don't know what the expectations  should be but I mean you should be happy you got both of them they're both playing they're both getting minutes they're both good players and I think it's smooth move by smooth Movement by you to go do that yeah I've it's looking like a great play right now on Middleton probably won't be eclipsing 30 minutes anytime soon but when he's on the court they're gonna rely on his offense and Giannis has been dealing with a knee and an Achilles issue so he might get some days off which means more shots from Middleton so expectations going forward probably some inefficient scoring as they get back to full strength but as long as they're healthy throw them in their lineup those are great way for wire pickups at this point in the season if they're yeah they're really are all right here we did it and we might do this again next Tuesday I might just lock you in for Tuesday the rest of the way is there aren't that many left we're winding this thing down thanks to Smart bracket  check that out when you're feeling out your brackets today and tomorrow yeah I get those things in by
