hey everybody Welcome to the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast it is Thursday February 22nd I'm doc he's Rick we're gonna start off talking about LeBron right after this  welcome to the second half or the last third of the NBA season it is Rick Hamlet is Hall of Famer Steve Alexander acha doctor a I'm the fantasy free and we're the ogs and we've been doing this a long time and we love hanging out with you all so get your comments in here and we got a lot to chop up here today and we're here to help you with your second half decision making we have 12 games tonight Doc before we go into LeBron and all this stuff man  how bad did you miss basketball over the last three nights and here's the thing Doc  I like the rise in Stars challenge I do I like the format I think the All-Star Game needs to take the rising stars format because the 48 minute game isn't working day it's broken like the Pro Bowl they need to fix it all start Saturday night sucked you all start game sucked even more so it'd be one thing if we had all these nights without our beloved fantasy and all these games to watch and all the box scores to look at but I'll start Saturday now was in any good and all star Sunday night was in any good man I am starving for good basketball bro yeah I mean it's it's a long break I mean I feel like the  back in the day the All-Star break was like four days you know they stop on Friday they start again on Tuesday  now it's over a week and it's like  and you've got you know Yahoo and ESPN combine those those two weeks into one long super long one week and it's just it's just a tough time to try to just Now's the Time we're really making a push for the playoffs and figuring out what you're going to do with the rest of your seven or eight weeks or left to get in line of where your team needs to be to win a championship and you have all those momentum going and then poof it's just all gone and now you kind of got started over again Plus  it's just that time of year where there's nothing else going on and unless you want to watch Xavier vs Butler seven times in a row you know college basketball but there's just nothing going on so it it's a long break and you know I kind of embraced it I was like I knew it was coming like I'm not even gonna look at basketball stuff for the next four days and and just step away and do whatever but I'm glad it's back man tonight and tomorrow it's weird though what a weird way to come back with like 12 games tonight 11 tomorrow I think and like everybody's playing back-to-backs well not everybody others a ton of back-to-backs there's a lot of teams they're going to play three games in four nights and like CBS like Doc was talking about CBS does a short week leading up to the all-star break and then a short week coming out of the All-Star break and so in 30 deep this is how it goes so you this is a four game week and and so there's a lot of teams that have three games in this four day period Thursday through Sunday and then there's teams that have two that is going to be crucial in those types of scenarios fan tracks is another League not the doc would know he's in the cam Dynasty here but not  but the but fan tracks does the two week extended game thing what do you prefer by the way I'm more with the CBS model of suck it up man it's a short week let's go you know go for get in the CBS 30 deep is a weekly scenario not a daily scenario I wish it was daily but you know it's old school it is what it is but I prefer more the two short weeks is supposed to the one super long week how about you well you know the schedule grids that are all built made up they all based on 25 weeks and that means the week 17 and 18 or the two short weeks I prefer to be broken up there's there's two teams only play one time this week and then there's other teams to play three times this week so it's it's a big deal a lot can happen this week and also  while we're talking about schedule I prefer this to two short weeks for the record but we are dinosaurs dude playing in that CBS League It's weekly you say set your lineup on Sunday you can't touch it again it's it's CBS which is which is as old schools against I still love CBS though I think that's where we always did League free back in the day it was but this coming week  I think it's the Brooklyn Nets play four times  starting Monday and then they have a five game week after that that's a big deal for my guy cam Thomas in 30 deep oh you have Cam Thomas in 30 deep I actually don't like to hear that we'll get to Camp Thomas in a moment so all right we start the second half here guys with a buzzkill LeBron James isn't going to play tonight against Golden State it's the game of the night maybe not anymore but but I'm still sight for this game it's Lakers it's Warriors and 12 games tonight the league gets back to work and dudes will be shaken off the island Vibe and all of that stuff but LeBron is out tonight with an ankle Dave mcmenamin reported that LeBron and this was days ago overall star weekend he reported that LeBron says the treatment that he will undergo one his left ankle this week will possibly keep him out of the lineup for that Lakers Warriors game on Thursday boom we're here that actually happened now I checked with the Lakers source that I have Doc and he warned me about this dnp that's happening here tonight and when I express concern as a manager of Lebron in the cam Dynasty at 39 and age and his 21st year this told me I don't anticipate much missed time so is this just a back-to-back thing is this just a three-game in four night thing which the Lakers are presented with right now coming out of the break and so I believe I that's where my head is that done that the Lakers play at home against San Antonio on Friday he won't be playing tonight you know does he get back to work tomorrow in the windy game at home that's kind of where my brain is with this I did see Lebron in the All-Star game go up for a dunk and come down kind of weird it didn't change his gait after the dunk but it looked weird I don't know if that is anything to do with anything and you know so you know why did Lebron play in the All-Star game if he's got a health issue here that doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to me but I'm gonna remain optimistic here that this is a maintenance plan type of thing and not a legit setback type of injury what kind of red flag is this for you if any at all  not really a red flag I mean LeBron's always questionable he's always a game time decision and he's always if you for the next one him and add both I mean you know McKenna was talking about this days ago oh like we knew even before he played in the All-Star game he was gonna he was maybe not going to play in this game on Thursday like it's a plan day of rest I think that they probably had on the calendar for a little bit I'm not really worried about it I think same with LeBron  I don't understand why you wouldn't  like okay if that's the plan and okay we've got three games in four nights Lebron James playing all three of these games so he's gonna play in two of them why wouldn't tonight be the game that he plays he's coming off the All-Star break you've had all this time off your feet and then you rest at home tomorrow against the Spurs who you should be able to absolutely obliterate with Davidson Reeves and rui and Dinwiddie and Russell without Braun right and then Sunday I don't know who they play on Sunday but it's somebody right and I don't understand why you wouldn't go that route and give yourself a better chance to win all three of these games as supposed to now I like Golden State a lot tonight I mean they're rolling they're at home they're feeling fresh and frisky now in the Lakers are going to be headless without Braun um that that kind of doesn't make sense to me but doc the people need to know and maybe only in streamer fashion here tonight with LeBron out and we'll see how long this this goes but rui hachimura is a guy the people should be looking at to stream tonight last three games he's gone 21 points team points and 36 points that was the last game of the first half without LeBron James in these three games he's got eight threes two blocks he's shooting 69 70 60 that up and he's not catching and dunking those are literally his numbers over these three games he's been crazy efficient this year 51 from the field 40 from 3 and 13 starts this year doc he's averaging 14 points a game and shooting 60% from the field rui Hodges having a quietly fantastic season man and I think he's a really good streamer tonight do you agree I mean I don't even know if he's a streamer at this point I mean the last three games he's got to be on  a pretty short list of you know 10 or 15 guys that might be available in your league that you have to think about picking up as well so I think he is a I think he is a lock to put up a solid stat line tonight because there's other guys on the Lakers who are also  not guaranteed to play tonight I think Ruiz gonna have a good game against Golden State and to your point I don't know why Lebron is not playing in the game either unless they did something that I mean they do did they do something to his ankle where they knew he was gonna need a couple days to rest it did they do not a procedure not a not a surgery but did they do some sort of therapeutic  thing to his ankle where they knew it was gonna knock him out for a couple days I don't know but it's weird but I think that's where is a great call tonight he should be in a ton of FanDuel lineups  um you lost me without whatever that clinical term you just said us with was I was like yeah I don't know I'm out in the weeds right now um oh about some therapy that you know took a guy I know idea my friend but I do know this my sister bonuses doubtful tonight with an illness for the Sacramento Kings are you feeling Trey Lyles I see him Rising on the most added list and I'm in a bunch of Yahoo's being scoped up off waivers are you one of those people  oh yeah I I think anytime that Simona's out tree Lyles is a decent play especially in DFS and even when Savannah's in their lies can get loose and put up some decent numbers so I think Lyle's is on the radar even when Savannah's is healthy Savannah's out then I think Lyle's moves in the most played territory he's streaky just know that people he's very very streaky he had two games recently where he went back to back averaged 17 points and four threes um and then you know that next game after that he played more minutes than those previous two games and had one point I know of two he's a weird player okay but I would look way more into rui than I would look into Trey Lyles but if you're in a super deep League you know no dough Moss is going to mean at least half the game for Trail hours and maybe he catches a heater they have San Antonio tonight don't they doc I don't have that in front of me right now I believe they have San Antonio tonight at home so that obviously would be a juicy matchup for trellis you mentioned Camp Thomas earlier Doc and what jump on got like go Monday right right back to business with the NBA after the All-Star break boom Monday comes out from Ward Janowski that the next dismissed Jacqueline as their head coach  I don't know about you but my first thought was Kam baby because think about this last year Camp Thomas started  four games that's it four okay in those four games he averaged 39 points in 39 minutes I'm not making this up he had three straight 40-point games at one point and then had another start I think it was three for 16 in that game and then Jack bomb was like that's it I've seen enough and sent him back to the bench and he was playing 15 minutes a game  it was a ridiculously bad coaching move by jock Bond who apparently pissed off at Kel Bridges and Ben Simmons and nobody likes his offense and so by Kevin Ollie was taking over his Dean interim guy and there's a lot of Mike and holes are talking I brought up Mark Jackson's name yesterday on NBA Radio him being a Brooklyn guy in New York City point guard I think and a former Nets announcer by the way I think that would marry pretty well but but doc talk to me man um I'm pretty geeked about cam Thomas right now and the reports are that he had a big hug with Kevin Ollie after their first practice the other day so the Love Fest is on is a compass season doc it is it's been campus season for most of the Season unfortunately that just means a lot of points a lot of inconsistency and a lot of empty stat lines but for where I got him in that 33 Team league he's a key component to what I'm trying to do I'm second in the power rankings um  you know the the system loves my team it's got when Beyond it it's got cam it's got Austin Reeves we got deer and fox we got Kobe white like we're looking to make a deep 30 run this year and yeah the first thing I thought of and the first thing that rosin we're still and I talked about on Tuesday on the very same podcast was cam Thomas  should be a much better player with Kevin Ollie as a coach I think he's fired up to have all he is his coach and I think it's a good thing for the whole Nets organization real I think they're going to  play with a lot more a lot less stressed a lot more fun the finish out the season and I think it's going to be good times in in Brooklyn like I said four games next week five games the week after that one half to League one place three  Kevin Ollie threw up ball and under the bus when talking to reporters when he was introduced as their head coach and he said we've drawn five charges all year yeah I mean it just doesn't even make sense Jalen Williams the big man for OKC has had five drawn charges in the last probably three or four games okay Brandon poganski has five drawn charges every single practice I mean that that's that's unbelievable I mean five drawn charges and we're two thirds of the way through the season that means these two aren't even trying out there they didn't even care all right doc it is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast with Rick Campbell and Steve Alexander acha doctor a he is either in or going to be in the fswa Hall of Fame so doc let's not let's rank these hot pickups man oh you got a bunch of names on here take us into this man  I mean I guess we can add rui Hachi Murray and Trey Lyle's to this list we want to but so guys that I've seen out there  floating around on and off of Waiver Wires random pickups lately over the break and whatnot like Brandon jameskii is still available  in fantasy League's which kind of blows my mind I don't understand  how that is possible and Rick can you see the notes I wrote her here I wrote the wrong guy was on my Chris Paul not Steph Curry so Chris Paul is coming back right maybe not this game but soon what is that going to do to push him ski is that is that hurting is that scary you at all kind of and and Chris Paul's return is right around the corner and I'm glad you brought this up um I think Klay Thompson is uh is in trouble here with with Chris Paul coming back Moses Moody you can forget about it like he ain't even gonna play he's not even gonna be a thought incurs mind right now  because kamanga is going to play Curry's gonna play draymond's gonna play his minutes he's playing very very well Wiggins is going to have to play his 28 to 30 and so the optionality is put Jim ski it's Paul it's Clay  it's Sarge it's guys like that and you know doctor depending on the matchup here I'm really curious to see who Kerr closest with you know what I mean um I'm usually more of a starting lineup guy but with this it's always been about the closing lineup for Golden State going back to their death lineup  I look at look put Jim ski is hers hand-picked Homie first round pick first round of the post Bob Myers era and he's just bringing a lot to the wood taking the charges making threes he's a great rebounding guard he's basically Dante Stevenson with floppy what's what's your boy's name is Jack Harlow is that the kids name with the Jack Harlow hair he's basically Dante with that fluffy haircut okay her loves him and Clay may be out the door there's already these reports about Orlando and the Lakers and the heat in the Clippers are interested in him in free agency um you know Lake of stocking about getting out of the second apron that probably means bye I can't pay you I am done with this I'm so it's all kind of heading in that way and then you've got potente the love of fairies in the starting lineup I I look at this more as Klay Thompson I I think that what when he's got a heater he's gonna be out there and when he's in a two for ten he ain't gonna play and and I think projects He is pretty locked in for 26 to 28 minutes docs so I'm looking at this the Paul return is more of a clay Buzz killed in a Pogue buzz kill  well I don't think they're going to bring Paul back and immediately throw him out there for 28 to 30 a night either I don't need to play that much I think put gemski has between his practice at the work ethic how he's been in games his Tommy points the hustle the fact is teammates probably love playing with him I don't think he's gonna take a hit I I'm not too worried about I still think he's a guy that fantasy managers should have like he should not be on waivers and any league right now so I'm not I'm not scared about Paul coming back and so I saw you put pajam skiing here and I'm like okay like I was rock with your stuff but I'm like  like why are we talking about pages of pickup like how is he not 97% roster right like that's where it took my mind and I mean I'm on you right now he's 54% roster doc I am alone Away by that literally shocked by that it would be one thing if like mid basketball season all of a sudden football season kicked in right this syndrome pardon me for a second  this syndrome hits Fantasy Baseball it's one of your boy cams  secret sauces I give a shit about fantasy baseball from game one to game one 62 a lot of people went football season kicks in in July they stopped managing their teams okay and my teams are good like I'm not just like benefiting from the laziness of others here okay you're talking to a goat but but doc like righteous staying in the fight making pickups doing your lineup just a normal stuff that we do mowing your freaking backyard right all you have to do and you have a huge advantage in fantasy baseball down the stretch goes football season kicks in we don't have that right now so I literally don't understand 46% of the fantasy populist on Yahoo platforms um leaving Brandon pajam ski on waivers that makes no sense to me at all can I blow your mind even more yes  204  point nine percent in any ESPN he's available in over 75% of the audience now let me ask you a question uh Yahoo's standard leagues which I don't play as much anymore it's just a lot of my new ships for me but they're 12 teams okay um and I do play in Yahoo public baseball League's and I've already been doing some baseball drafts and stuff and they are 12 teams as well um I believe football teams used to be 10 and they might have recently up to 12 but 10 League 10 teams suck to me they're too easy okay so does he has been have a standard 10 Team league because if they do then that would help to explain what pigeons on waivers 75% of the time well I think that the average ESPN league is 18 and I don't know why that is oh that's so stupid yes PN  I mean I don't think they have it set up that way I think that's what their users that's what their user said that's not their default as an 18 League you're no no okay okay and and Yahoo's is not either I think the default for both is 12 I think Yahoo is mostly made up of 10 teams and some 12 teams and I feel like ESPN has a majority eight also 10 also 12 so I but I don't think they're pushing people in those directions it's just sort of how those websites numbers shake up and maybe maybe it's harder to find  maybe it's harder to find 12 people that want to play  basketball is supposed to finding 12 people that want to play football but you know where I live we can't find enough people to really put together a great baseball league in my in you know the town I live in  so we struggle more there than we do other places but you know I'm with you dude I think you and me and most of the people that are listening to us  I'm guessing most of the serious fantasy basketball people play in 12 Team league and like you they're like why is Doc tell me to pick up his there's no way he's available in my Savvy league but I mean the numbers don't like 25% in ESPN 50% Yahoo that means he's available in a hell of a lot of League's and you just can't ignore people in those leaks no this is a this is a very valuable conversation I mean I like I said if we're having a mind blowing experience okay it's definitely a valid conversation ah  wow man wow if if Pete like  for the Savvy that you just referenced by the way it's the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Rick Campbell Steve Alexander we're the ogs if you like if you're a Savvy like doctor of this or PhD of this like we are like a lot of our audience members here are like I mean if you're on with us you're a badass okay you're not some fly-by-night casual like you were seeking out fantasy Knowledge from goats so okay we love you guys out there um you are the next level fantasy players and so you want a 14 Team league you want a 16 Team league you want a 20 Team league heck you want a 30 Team league because you're not just that deep and that bass of this beautiful thing called fantasy basketball so when a 12 team league in levels the playing field and the smaller you go the more level that playing field goes doc write in a 10 Team league you and I don't have a huge advantage over the rest of the pack in a bunch of casuals and a bunch of bronze rated and silver rated people on Yahoo right we don't have that a huge advantage over them it's a 10 Team league it's an All-Star team and if it's eight it's even worse so 12 is like a happy medium I think but but the stud fantasy players should want 14 and 16 and 20 and 30 because that's where you weed out the guys that really know from the guys that are frauds boom that's when you attack and you pray on the weekend you win  yeah I mean the bigger the bigger the league the better players should rise to the top I mean it's just the way the way it is and I mean it's the same in sports too they're talking about you know expanding adding NBA teams eventually and people are like man that's going to further  mess up the pool of players we have but it also means the cream rise to the top so yeah so for Jim key I mean it's literally a no-brainer everybody should be  he should not be on waivers in any League I don't care if it's 18 I don't care if it's 10 gigs and we're still waiting for the Jaron Jackson Jr shut down right like it's coming  we're gonna we may do something before we're done we may predict predicted date that we last see Jaren Jackson Jr happened but GG Jackson I'm scared to even pull up his roster ship numbers because it's probably like  7% and 18% or something like that trade man  has been all the rage since he came back for Charlotte Gigi's at 41 on Yahoo Gigi's up to 41 on Yahoo all right so he's probably like 17 on ESPN train man has been great in Charlotte for three games but now there's there's  rumors and there's inklings that lamelo ball is  practicing again he's getting ready to come back  what's that do you as far as the Trey man needle goes  so I'm  gonna go here but um when I redid my depth charts after the trade deadline and I put Trey man in the Terry Rozier spot as the sidecar guard to lamelo ball so on my depth chart I have lamelo ball in his customary point guard spot man sidecar in him with Brandon Miller with Miles Bridges and with Mark Williams so obviously has heard but when healthy he's the starter and Nick Richards is the backup and then your bench is Grant Williams Seth Curry um Cody Martin and in Nick Smith who's completely fallen off since Trey man um let me just a plain time they're just not even playing Nick Smith anymore he had Nick Smith's been very good from the three-point line this year on Steve Clifford's lack of deployment of him has been missing for me especially in that period where a lamella was out and you had 13 guys out and he's still really wasn't spiking that was weird to me on leaky black was getting more run than Nick Smith for a period there my worry Doc is  strangers this sound is Cody Martin  he's paid he's a vet Steve Clifford is you know in older coach and they love that and they're usually not real hit on young dudes playing over vets but to me like a train man has to start if Trey man does not start if Cody Martin is starting over trade man I'm gonna freak the fuck out and lose it okay like stop it you did not make this trade to get Trey man to play Kodi freaking Martin over him so that's where I'm at with the doc like I'm a little concerned because of Steve Clifford and we don't run these rotations these coaches do and a lot of times they're more vicious than they're young-ish but to me it should be tremend season in Charlotte right now  Charlotte has won 13 games  13 and 41 I mean  I don't know why we're really I don't really know why we're bringing lamelo ball back I don't really know why  they would ever bring  the center back that's been out forever and I don't eat they not even on the depth chart anymore  Mark Williams I don't I don't understand why we're talking about bringing him back miles Bridges is healthy he's trying to talk I gotta take you deep man I gotta take you  Doc it's February 22nd we've got almost two months left in the regular season I mean what do you mean they shouldn't even bring these guys back these guys are paid to play basketball man weeks dude seven weeks since all we got like it'll be gone like this season will be the it's oh like  the the 30 D Playhouse we have this week next week and next week and that's it that Seasons done so this week and then two more weeks know we have less we have this week and next week and that is it and then the playoffs yes  why my team is I'm 8 in the power ratings on 30 deep I just don't like my team doc I've been telling you this all year I missed out on homegrown by one pick I took Josh Green over Tim Hardaway Jr been beating myself up over that all year long  I just hate my team doc but I'm still ate in the power rating man but I don't feel like I'm winning it this year and I don't feel like I'm in a twin it man if I win I if I got lucky as hell up in the chip this year comes to say it right now this is not a championship 30 deep team to me  all right well back to Trey man for just saying I I like the fact the Cody Martin is in his way because I think even if lamelo comes back train man still gonna get enough run to be fantasy relevant but I do like him a lot more if lamelo is still chilling with his name what what if Trey man starts with lamelo and Cody Martin is where he should be coming off the bench like are you did you I mean I still think Trey man can get goodies and flirt with triple doubles even with lamelo ball I agree yeah I'm just worried about what's gonna happen there I like you said I don't know who who they're gonna start I hope it's Trey man but the other guys on this list keyonte George and 33 point game right before the break they've said he's locked and loaded the rest of the season in Utah you got Vince Williams Still Ballin in Memphis with GG when the gerund Jackson happens Vince is gonna hopefully continue to go off you got the Thompson Twins you're an ouster guy more than an amen guy I'm not sure not I want I want both of them not roster overall I'm more of an amen guy than an offer guy like in the pre-draft process scouting these guys out and I love them both but I was more than I'm in guy so if I've said a more of an offshore guy maybe it's just for the fantasy of it all but I think his role on Houston you're you're more worried about his role Houston then you are with us Sarah in Detroit and that is no longer the case stop okay so let's stop right here and talk about Oscar for a minute I'm worried about Isaiah Stewart AKA beef stew AK a I'm gonna light your ass up if you talk trash to me right he punched Drew Bank job sharoniae said yesterday that the video the people that have seen the video said that he did punch on Drew Eubanks so I do think a suspension is coming down for beef stew but think about this doc he is healthy now he's back practicing he's going to be ready to play and he might play tonight but I think the league is going to suspend him before they played this game we shall see but I just Stewart over the last three years had in all of the games that he has played has come off the bench for times he just got paid four years in 60 million dollars he has been there starting power forward with Jalen Duren and then bullion was their three  so now they have your boys Simone contact you was their new bullion right so I'm worried that off now is going to have to kick back to the bench when I said Stuart gets back in that starting lineup which I believe he will go back to that for spot dokyo is their new toy he's the new Bowie on and then you've got all right thinking of ventral so I'm back to being worried about Usher  I know I I feel like  feel like Monty is going to be like all right we've won what 10 games this year it's it's time to finally throw in the towel maybe we're not gonna make the playoffs this year I've got this Thompson twin it just sitting over here waiting to go like a like a caged tiger  I'm gonna let him I'm gonna let him go I I feel like it's gonna be all Sara season here real real quick I'm not worried about I've got both of the Thompson Twins on my rock and roll league roster and neither one they don't play tonight but I can't wait until they do play again  I think they're going to be I think they're fun I think both of them are fine I think they should be they should be rostered everywhere and funky was the guy we don't have on those lists also so last the last guys you know Jordan Goodwin playing point guard for Memphis occasionally is another guy  who's kind of worth looking at if you're in a deeply and then I think rui and Trey Lyle's and from Kentucky oh  radar guys like I'm amazed there's this many guys out there this late  that are this good that you can still make me go out and pick up on your in your league  people are either all star weekend fatigue and just sort of their team is out of sight out of mind or maybe we're two thirds of the way through a lot of teams are like they've lost interest I don't know I don't understand the losing interest in a hobby thing it's your hobby see it through but it happens it's human nature um here's my thing on Jordan Goodwin I see these numbers here doc 10 and a half points five rebounds three assists one and a half steals one three in two games in Memphis decent stat line got our attention we're looking at you but I have been on the Taylor Jenkins I don't know who the eff my point guard is night tonight yoyo in the cam Dynasty I've gone with Gilyard and been Iced Out I've gone with Scotty Pippen Jr and been Iced Out and literally gotten Bagels don't worry I won these games anyway but I like Perfection I don't like holes in my lineup even if I'm slaughtering a team seven to one it's not how we roll over here so Taylor Jenkins has pump fake me so many times this year doc that I am out on that point guard position because I think it's just an experimental position I think Jenkins is like all right let's see this guy tonight with this lineup and let's see this guy tonight with this group and okay this guy is  heard let's go with this guy I just feel like it's a yo-yo dude that I'm not willing to play with anymore  I like that because gillard's gonna be in and out of the G League I don't even know about Goodwin is Goodwin is he a two-way player I don't even know I think he's a standard contract guy okay right now it's good when is it's good when season but like you said that's been two games and tomorrow that could that could all change you could go back to Scotty Pippen who by the way why is Scotty seniors names spelled s c o t t i e  and Scotty Junior's name is filled with a why can you  help me with that I yeah I'm worried about the unsolved mystery of why the league hasn't suspended Isaiah Stewart yet that's where my brain is like how is the suspension not come down for this man he lit up Drew Eubanks the video proves that why is the league not suspended this have you seen the video no shut up whereas the video I haven't I haven't seen it either oh okay yeah no this is like this is top secret ish man like TMZ usually breaks somebody off right to get the video of John Moran and the strip club with the gun to get the video of a dream on green punching Jordan bull right like where is TMZ to break somebody off and get us the video man  you know people make fun of TMZ a lot but they're usually first and they're usually never wrong oh tmc's on it dude TMZ totally on it people up people just expect TMZ all time I'm always like yeah but they're always right and they're always first by the way my wife has that show on from time to time like the voiceover guy with the funny voice and he says all the jokes after they tell like the story of these dumb Hollywood stars doing dumb Hollywood star things and the guy comes in like slap sticky with some I think I think it's a well done like that part of the show I like when that big voice guy comes in and like mocks Ben Affleck or what what's your name couture couture whatever the f is name is the dude from that 70 show um I have poor Hollywood doc by the way I think that dude has been doing that voice over thing for that show from a very long time and I remember when he first came on  came on the air my wife was all about it back then and she's like oh yeah I think they concealed this guy's identity so nobody comes after him and so he's like free to just like bust on whoever wants to do I don't even know people know who is I could be totally wrong about that I think Casey's onto something man it's Hollywood okay the Illuminati hello uh so if I were that  I'll just I'll just sit in my man cave looking out at the ocean somewhere in Malibu and doing my little voiceover thing man I be I think that's why we don't know who that guy is I really do another player who's been playing really well who's probably available in Morley's and he should be his Mike Conley just signing an extension he's like 47 years old playing for the Minnesota Timberwolves he's been good man Connie Connie is getting better with age and is it true Rick that he's never had a technical file in his entire career  I don't know that but I seem to recall hearing that at some point that doesn't surprise me he is is mild man he's a Ford I'm on his bio here he's a four-time sportsmanship Award winner okay so yeah that's probably the case he's the anti-drama on um here's the stat that I want to look up on Connelly so I could get it right for you guys 44% from 3-point range this year and you know he said 10 points six assists one steal two point three threes he's still a valuable fantasy player like I'm putting that my lineup I mean the six dimes is good we're out of steel we're at two plus threes the percentages are fantastic and so and Doc you know this dude is we go to reality here from a minute he is the perfect fit for that team he takes eight shots a game okay and and he takes doc I will say this right now and I don't have a stat to prove this this is just me watching a million hours of basketball he takes the most buck naked  three balls of anybody in the league with the gravity of cat the gravity of Ant-Man Jaden McDaniels doing his thing the lobster Rudy and then they're like damn it we forgot Conley and he gets that ball and he's like  checks the wind you know Winks at a hottie in the crowd and then fires that Lefty three ball good right he takes the most Buck Naked threes in this game dude well he's just such a calm old guy to be running that offense with and you know ants like give me the ball let me work maybe I'll even shoot it with my right hand this time that by the way that Aunt left hand shooting thing over the weekend was  was not not good you probably didn't didn't watch it  no I I watched it and I was killed him he throwing it off the bat inside of the backboard and so two things I love Ant-Man but he made a mockery of that event and the All-Star game so I was met and Ant-Man and Lucas should just be told to stay home because they're poisoning all-star weekend with their aloof arrogant I don't give a ish Behavior they really are I but if I were Adam Silver but just go to Bora Bora okay well we'll put somebody else in these events but doc they have to take the skills Challenge and throw it in the trash that event sucks the guys never understand how to do the damn slalom thing with the dribbling drill right we're always running in Something official comes up no no no no no it's  such a bad look this is all star Saturday is the best players in the world and they look clueless out there and then you've got that stupid passing thing where they passed the ball into the little hole oh my God is that stupid and then they do this lame shooting drill where you've got three guys passing out to each other it's like a dad and a daughter in the driveway I don't want to see a dad and a daughter in the driveway I want to see cool basketball dude they have to destroy the skills Challenge and replace it with a one-on-one tournament or like what we were talking about the other day with Brian somebody mentioned just doing away with all star weekend all together and having the in season tournament to this time of the year and have it be like three weeks long and then have that event Cascade in like Las Vegas for the finals and then have the dunk contest and the Three-Point Contest  around that in season tournament finals weekend which very interesting concept because I don't know man is the All-Star game so broken that it's irretrievable at this point like yes yes here's my idea doc I've been saying this all week you take I like the format of the Rising Stars challenge because it creates a keeping the floor mentality with these guys they pick up full court they double they Blitz they foul they try to step in and block shots because when the target scores 40 and your opponent has 35 it's go time okay it's like if you're playing to 12 and the opponent has 10 it's go time you got a really dig in and play defense and I see that even with these first and second year players on All Star Friday night so I mean it all comes down to do these are these entitled Max Player NBA All-Stars just so over it and so cool that they won't compete no matter what you do okay that's a possibility but I see these young fellas literally playing some defense in the rising stars challenge our boy podemski was diving on the floor for a loose ball for the love of God okay so I'm doing that in All Star Sunday night doc I'm going to semi-final games with a 50 Target score and a 50 Target score and then I'm going to final game with a 50 Target score 24 All Stars so you chop it up 146 for the All-Star Game  all right um you want to hit the rest of these topics so you want to answer questions we got seven minutes give me five seconds are you buying what I'm selling their or not I am I like it okay because yes it's broken it's like oh well we have to shred this this All-Star Game the Pro Bowl it's  it is like the Pro Bowl and I don't even watch what whatever the hell they do in the NFL right now it's completely off my radar um one of the interesting things I saw you put in here doc was about the Wizards okay and the possible shutdowns and you mentioned or you keeping an eye on Corey kispert the answer is yes and here's the deal with Casper when Kyle kuzma is out boom greenlet when Kyle kuzma is in there um not so much because then he got Denny and you've got pool and you've got tires and then kiss bird because kissed and in Kula Bali like toggle for who the sixth man is in the seventh man is it's kind of like the Norman Powell Russell Westbrook dynamic in La so I'm Knights Powell has 20 in Ross has eight some nights Russell flirts with the triple double and Powell has 10 right and then with Kula Valley sometimes he takes off and kissed for his small sometimes kiss for hits a heater and then coola Bali is small so to me it all hinges on Denny and kuzma with KISS FM and if either of those guys get hurt and or shut down that it is Corey  kiss for season because this dude doc has the potential to score 17 18 19 a game and hit like three or four three balls per game and even if he's not giving you defense of goodies and rebounds and assists like we roster Tim Hardaway Jr right that's what he's doing 1718 points three plus three that's what kiss for would be doing yeah I kind of think kiss for its gonna break loose one of these games in the in the final five or six weeks where he blows up for like 40 points but I don't know I don't know how reliable he's gonna be um and the Kula Bali is a Steals and blocks machine if he gets minutes and gets role and you know the Wizards are interested the Wizards and the Blazers both I mean if they decide to shut people down and just let the kids play which probably gonna happen for both of them it's gonna be interesting there could be some very valuable  no name pickups coming out of both places  I don't I don't think team should be doing this this year by the way I'm going to destroy them on NBA Radio on probably here as well if it's by the way it's the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Rick Campbell and Hall of Famer Steve Alexander doc if okay doc who are people taking for this year you tell me  I have no idea okay that's why why shut down your players and ruin basketball games and diminished the NBA product to tank and acquire ping pong balls for I don't know who the guy is I just want the top pick in the right no there is no wimby um and so next year will be the Cooper Flagg freshman year at Duke right and everybody loves Cooper Flagg he could come out like a chat Holmgren type and be that um that it dude and be a top pick so if teams want to tank next year for Cooper Flagg I get it but if you're taking this year for what to Bella's or this Alex our guy I mean these people I mean they may be really good but there's not Buzz about them doctors not hype about them and at this point if there's Buzz or hype about to do there's Buzz or hype about to do you know what I'm saying um because Scouts have been to Europe and they've been to Germany and they've been to Spain and all this kind of stuff and then they come back and they talked to reporters were reporters talk about it oh there's Buzz their site there is no buzz there is no hype about this class  you're right about that I mean  we at all heard when be by now we had all heard of Chad by now I there is not a lot of hype but I still think Andre 88 Lonzo ball right like just guys like that like these it dudes like there's been all this Buzz In Trey young right it was the whole season of Trey young and college basketball there's no buzz there's no hype about any of these guys yeah but I don't know that that means that it's a  I still think you want a lottery pick you don't you don't want to be the Atlanta Hawks and finish  you know 10th every year and then get a crappy draft pick every year if you do get a draft pick you screw it up I think Marvin Williams instead of whoever hold on but you put your boy Travis schlenk nailed a bunch of those picks John Collins Kevin herder Jalen Johnson he was told by ownership to trade trade for Luca or pardon me Luca for Trey  I'm not Travis schlenk was a beast in that Hawks front office man oh he was he was I'm talking about more like back in the day but yeah you just don't it's hard to build  I mean here the Hawks are in what your boy Marvin Williams and so on so what  his heart when he walked  and it's the way he walks was like are you heard are you living what's going on here but anyway you just you can't draft in the middle of the draft every single year and build a team you want you want the good picks and I even this year even though there's no hype there will be by the time it gets here and and you know we've seen how many rookies made an impact this year  it's a ton and I was like all every lottery pick has made an impact this year and I think every lottery pick next year will make an impact so you still got to still got to get the still got to get the picks and they need to be good picks and that's why pop in the Spurs are down there  bottom feeding waiting to see what their people say when they get back from Europe because nobody's better at finding these sleepers stud  basketball players then the Spurs have been over the last 30 years and they're probably going to keep doing it  so let's uh let's set up some of these comments dude oh yeah I like this one right here because it allows me and talk to my my favorite thing the schedule so this week  the Memphis Grizzlies and the Miami Heat only play one time  so GG Jackson only has one game this week Charlotte has three games so if you drop Gigi and pick up Trey man you gained two games you get three games instead of one that's kind of a big deal I'm saying yes you do this with  I'm I mean yeah  I'm gonna go with the flow of this I I definitely do not like the idea of dropping GG Jackson but if your roster is that deep and you got to have a win this week this is a little counterintuitive to me because if your roster is that good that you're in a position to drive GG Jackson then why do you need a win this week like to me you should have some optionality and some wiggle room maybe to take an L not that we want to take else around here but but yeah do what you got to do man if you have to win this week and I mean look trade man is still on waivers isn't that an indicator of the waiver wire in this league right doc at this point of Trey man is still on waivers there's probably some other really good talent on waivers as well so yeah go ahead and make that move well that's the thing about Gigi he's 15.7% roster in ESPN so  I mean to you drop him you get your two games and and maybe you can even go pick him back up but if you can't pick him up I guarantee you one of those other dudes we talked about is sitting out there whether it be from you whether it be counting George somebody maybe out there for our guy's gonna be sitting there uh but the two one game weeks this week are Memphis and Miami so Jimmy Butler maybe a goose egg for the week right is he gonna play do we know and I've lost track I I've lost given up I don't care you don't care well he doesn't Bang three so while he's banging threes a little bit this year but not I don't know I'm just I'm kind of over the Jimmy Butler thing right now  you know go go on a streak of five strike games with 30 and get my damn attention Okay I mean he's capable of that dude I don't understand what Jimmy Butler doesn't go Hulk smash mode more like if you were a Hotshot player like that and you could just go Hulk smash and literally push a button and like beast mode everybody why wouldn't you do that why does he cruise control through games Doc just as a mortal NBA player as a member against Janice in the Bucks in the playoffs last year like  why was that just a one-off like what was up with that like why don't we get more of that from Jimmy that that's kind of why I'm out on Jimmy like I don't like to turn it on turn it off thing man and even playoff Jimmy isn't that fun sometimes these days I I don't know man was it was last year I mean that was a hell of a run last year yeah I don't know yeah we were we were talking about Jimmy's emo hair on Tuesday shows pretty fun let's see here Christian wants to know I was offering Anthony Davis for John Cena Murray and Nicola boots 12 teams I lost them bead when I be giving up too much for accept this trade so  he gets 80 gives up Deontay and vouch  I mean I  you're getting the best player in the deal Christian so that's good um what I'm wondering is who are you back filling that second spot with so it's Anthony Davis and who maybe it's somebody you're picking up off the waiver wire uh maybe it's somebody you could get back in this trade you know the the dude that this other managers going to drop um I'm not a huge booty bitch guy but dang it I'm a huge to Shante Murray guy  doc I feel like I feel like he's giving up a little bit too much here I mean I get it you know back feeling the big man you need blocks and stuff with with him beat out and Davis is a phenomenal fantasy player  it comes down to who that's who the second part could be to fill in and  I don't know man I think I was still need to see the rest of the roster to make a totally intelligent decision about this um and then also like you said you have Levine out for Chicago which makes Boots the second option like I don't know I'm not crazy about this I think  I'm trying to steal Anthony Davis I'm not trying to like like overpay for Anthony Davis you know what I'm saying I feel like this is this is too much of an overpayment here I believe I I got to get another player back that I maybe a Trey man maybe it's a pagie I don't know maybe it's just a  somebody that I've got a little itch and a little tickle about you know what I'm saying let's say let's say pigeons know he's probably not available it's 12 Team league but you know one of these guys we've talked about will be available it could be keonte George it could be GG Jackson it could be dance well you know like you said like I'm going big for big with boots and add so I need a small to replace the jaunty so if Trey man is out there I feel better about this if potentials out there I feel better about this who else might be Doc what about trying to think of some guards that maybe I don't know maybe a neb hard I don't know Anderson maybe that Hearts maybe going about 10 points five assists I don't know like  what's up with neb hard playing 30 minutes in the stat line pretty much sucks right doc what's up with that like he's getting minutes like he should be at I don't know 13 points six is 1.2 steals one point eight threes like why are we getting about her style for Navarre he's just thought they're getting exercise dude I don't have an answer for that  I don't know I can't figure it out um  Jay Sizzle dropped Klay Thompson to pick up Trey man  I like that here we go really I would do that okay doc Clay is a two category guy points and in threes yeah that's any right now he's sort of one category guy  James Chan wants to know cam Whitmore is he worth  to pick more  is Kim Whitmore going to come back and do what he was doing a month ago three weeks ago  or is it are we locked into a man at this time let me let me look at let me look at the back of whitmore's game log here for just a minute refresh my memory you know the back of his card yeah it's it's pretty good actually 17 points in 18 minutes up 9 points and 21 minutes 14 points in 19 minutes 25 points and 21 minutes 17 points and 20 minutes okay so he's playing around 20 minutes game and basically giving you like 15 points um and giving you at least two threes yeah I'm still I'm still I'm still there with Cam Whitmore I am doc if you've got him keep him if he's on waivers and you need to like points and threesome combo with that um and he's he's an exciting young player I'm I don't think cam Whitmore is out of value here I don't  yeah I'm I'm I would rather have one of the guys who talked about earlier personally but  we'll see I mean came up more was playing very well I had him on a lot of Ross's  will this Mister a mitch Robinson and Joelle and bead come back this regular season  I don't know  it sounds like Mitch Robb is getting close hmm  I I think I saw resumed on court activities I think I saw that so that that's probably another month out knowing medical staff and all that kind of stuff um I based on that though I would feel a little better about Mitchell Robinson coming back in and beating got cut man he got a meniscus surgery and it's dwell on beating he's very injury prone and he's the face of the franchise one of the most valuable Commodities in all sports I don't know man I just don't know about him be DACA we all want him to come back I don't know I think Philadelphia is gonna slide back into the play in tournament here doc their they have a I think two and a half game lead over Orlando and Miami um you know to stay in the top six and I don't think they're going to stay in the top six so if they keep drifting  then what kind of  you know how will that change the motivation and sort of hurrying to get him back I don't know that that's a tough one to answer right now mister a I think I think you've done I and I I think we've I think we've seen  the end of Joel embiid at least for Fantasy relevance  right now NBA playoffs totally different totally different thing but I I don't think  I don't think he's coming back to help your fantasy team this year I could be wrong I mean I'm stashed on an IR that's where he's going to stay  last one  Daniel Gonzalez he got offered Jalen Johnson for buddy hield  I like to rebounds the steals who would be better rest of the season  like  that's a that's a run don't walk isn't it rick I don't know if you seen buddies numbers in Philadelphia it is balling out right there but phenomenal they're all star numbers let me give you buddy heels numbers and I mean they're literally all star numbers and it's a very small sample I think it's three games I think I believe they're two and one in those three games let me give you his three-game sample size here with Philadelphia he is at 22 points  four rebounds seven and a half assists 1.8 steals 4.53 which is Steph s he's shooting 52 from the field 45 from 3 playing 39 minutes a game I mean it's like Daryl Morey it's like he's lost it's a long lost son and he's just throw I mean 309 minutes here oh God this one's so hard doc this one's so hard  um I'm gonna say I'm gonna say take Jalen Johnson doc because I mean it's closed I want to give this man an answer and I'd rather have Jalen Johnson the rest of the way because doc we have a couple of things here we do have the possibility of indeed coming back we also have De'Anthony Melton is going to be back I believe tonight Nick pitwm is going to be back I believe tonight and and so those two guys are going to play their main rotation guys um I believe buddy hield will still start but with Melton back that'll cut into him a little bit and then let's face it DOC you have a heater here born of the honeymoon period of just being traded to a contender and just getting out of jail in Indiana and now you're in the starting five and playing 39 minutes this was not happening for buddy in Indiana so it's all new and he's Unleashed in all this kind of stuff but at some point this kind of dies out in the law of averages kick in right and buddy I don't think it's gonna shoot 40% from three the rest of the way so I go Jalen Johnson all right  last one I lied Michael Chang who are we dropping out of these players badly read or austere Thompson 10 Team league he's got to get even shinsou off the ill so Marvin Bagley Paul Reid their Thompson he dropping  probably Bagley  uh and I I've seen the recent lot he's so injury-prone doc just when you think Bagley is like in a role he's got minutes and he's cooking a little bit and Pops something goes man I just don't trust that dude I just don't trust Marvin Bagley and Marvin Bagley is not helping you in three he's not helping you in defense as well so I say three throws a terrible he's not in a block shots he's gonna get rebounds and points that's it that's it yeah so I'm with you on that all right we are out of here we are out of time I'm having a mystery guest coming on Tuesday it's actually someone I've never met but it's supposedly a baller and then you and I will be back here next Thursday on the road to wire fantasy basketball podcast Rick welcome back from the All-Star break we got basketball tonight baby let's go everybody thanks for watching and we will see you all in a week  peace
