hey everybody it's Steve Alexander here at the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast it's Tuesday  April 9th I'm Dr a he's curious Becker  I'm going to the Hawks game tonight supposedly God willing in the creek don't rise  and we got fantasy championships injury news and and incredibly busy Tuesday night to talk about when we come back  here in we did it we made it through to the final week of the NBA regular season  we did it and now we just got to make it through one last week of crazy long injury reports  well I my League's are all done they all ramped up I got the big the big dub in 30 deep which I'm super psyched about and did you get any did you get any wins I didn't get any wins um I'm battling for a third place that it's a four week long Championship type deal so the last week of that probably not gonna get third place and then I secured  like we have a stake leak so there's 16 teams and then the bottom eight have to pay for the top eight at first date dinner so I'm in the eaters in that section so I say myself a couple hundred dollars with that so that that was a big win for me even though I didn't take home any money I get a free steak that definitely counts anytime you get a free steak  from playing fantasy sports it counts as a win um  so we had the national championship game last night and I'm from Indiana on my Purdue people were at the game  I was feeling Purdue I was kind of  not Zach he was gonna kind of run over them he did but nobody else could do anything you can have the perfect game plan turned out to be kind of a hoe home  boring game but how weird was it did not have to worry about one single NBA thing yesterday like that was that was wild  yeah absolutely crazy um I and like there's so many teams that are playing back-to-backs the Grizzlies played a back-to-back last week and then their next game is about like a back-to-back this week and then there's no games on Monday it seems like odd scheduling um you know there was a free slate of MBA so that we could all tuned into the college championship and I tuned in for about five minutes on the second half and I was like all right well this is over so yeah the only real like thing that I noticed from that game was Purdue only had one player that had an assist that's seems crazy to me like you got if you're playing Yukon must have had some sort of defensive scheme and obviously clinging is a beast down low but that only one player and assistant a champion he had eight assists of course but like that's still crazy to me for a championship level game  yeah they gained really well for produced so all right let's hit some some injury highlights real quick some news from yesterday um Trae young of the Hawks has been cleared for contact after his finger surgery  so it looks like we're gonna see Trey at some point this week will that be tonight I doubt it but I mean anything is possible at this point  Giannis is iffy for Tuesday against the Celtics  Karl Anthony towns scrimmage on Sunday he's gonna play at some point this week for the wolves  and Anthony Davis after getting his  I raked over again on Sunday sounds like he's going to play tonight just fight the discomfort  yep absolutely I think Trae young and cat have both been ruled out for tonight um barring you know we saw Joel embiid be ruled out for all the way up until tip off and then he got cleared for his big return so baring the situation like that tray and Cat will both be out tonight but I do expect them to play at some point later this week the Hawks you know they're kind of just chilling in that plan spot playing pretty decently they've lost back-to-back games but you know jeante Murray is like kept them alive so it's gonna be interesting to see how much Trey young plays when he does return and how big of an impact he'll have the cat news is fantastic for the Timberwolves and Timberwolves fans not really just been playing really well in his and cats absence but cat brings just another level to that team another offensive threat another defensive threat he's not great on the perimeter but still like that team is better with cat and they're gonna be a force in the playoffs with him healthy Giannis and AD should be fine we are a little bit concerned about Kauai Leonard though right he's messing another game tonight we haven't really had a substance in like update on like how he's feeling that'll be five straight absences and for a guy like Kawaii 5 straight after healthy season up to this point ahead of the playoffs of the little concerning  yeah it is highly concerning on Kawhi Leonard I moved out five games in a row and a knee and man he he was such a good soldier this year and I I was like coming back around like and maybe I'll draft Kawhi Leonard again next year and now I'm kind of feeling like man if I if I would have gone through that whole 30 deep season and he was my anchor and then he checks out for the last five games man I I'd be crushed right now I would be  devastated so I  I don't know man and then a couple other things we didn't have written down and we talked about Yakima portal  out for the year for the Raptors Scotty Barnes done for the season for the Raptors  yeah this Kawaii thing man  that's I don't like it I don't like anything about it  no it was nice to see Paul George turned back to his Indiana Paul George days the other day but the Clippers without quiet are not going to be a force in the West  they're not and and Phoenix is struggling again like yeah I don't know the west west is weird but everything's kind of locked into shape now right like let's take a quick look at the standings guy I have not done that recently I know Boston Boston has like a 15-game lead on Milwaukee right like  that that's it but the rest of the East is the Bucks have just Fallen apart and kind of let a couple of teams have a chance here at the two seed between the two seed and the Seven seed are separated by three and a half games that's seems crazy the two seed in the 8-seater separated by four games so there could be a lot of shuffling here over the last week freaking Orlando Magic our one game behind the box  like that  is nuts the the mismatches that Franz and Paulo provide the magic are just awesome I like trying to game plan against Paulo for the playoffs it's gonna be tough I think he has he needs to take a couple steps still but like the way that he's dominating games like it's LeBron esque I don't want to say he's LeBron yet but his post-up game his facilitating this year he's taking all of the next steps to be a superstar and a couple years and you know they're about to be a two-seed they make some hey now it could be he could be turning that corner in the next they're in the playoffs for sure and then you know the Nicks got OG back there they're gonna be fine you know Julius got ruled out for the season but OG and Mitchell Robinson are back so the next defense is going to be tough the Cavs with Donovan Mitchell I'm still not sold that Mitchell's a 100 percent and if he's not 100% I don't know how I feel and then the Sixers within bead and the heat are at the bottom of the standings and those are two super dangerous teams if  I was the Bucks and I'm really and I just lost to the Wizards and now I got to play the first round matchup is against the Sixers or the heat that's really tough that's really tough for the for the bucks dude you know the Box the Bucks have four games left  and the magic have four games on it and they play each other in two of those games  like Orlando is at Milwaukee on Wednesday or land of finishes at home we get some Milwaukee on Sunday so if they win both of those games if Orlando happens to win both of those games it's probably done they're probably gonna pass them  this is incredible I don't  I I'm this is a Orlando Magic but the bad news is I know we're gonna get this exactly they they lost France he got hurt on Sunday his friend his ankle and now he's kind of iffy for the whole week and they're gonna need friends to play if they're going to be the Buck's two times but that's pretty exciting me I love I love when these head-to-head matchups that have playoff indications implications actually end up happening and  you know it just makes it makes the free playoff runs so much more fun so yeah with the 82 Game season it doesn't always work out like that like but in the NFL you feel like always weak 16 weak 17 you're seeing these huge playoff implication matchups so it's good to see in the NBA with that make that last weekend then you still have in the last Minnesota Denver and Oklahoma City all kind of battling for whose number one you've got the Mavericks who have gone nine and one over the last 10 red hot red hot on fire Kyrie and there's pictures on Twitter at Kyrie and Luca like best buddies brothers and you know that's made a nice little run they passed the Pelicans they wanted their division they  are the number they're going to be the number five seed in the west all that might be enough to get Luke and MVP I don't know I doubt it I doubt that they're going to give it to anybody but you but  I don't know I think Luca  and the average finishing fit at least puts him in the conversation and Lucas shot like 79% from the freezer line this year  if you've done that back in the day when Matt strap and I were betting a jersey every single year I would have a closet full of jerseys  yeah it's great to see him get better at the free-throw line you know for Fantasy purposes he's a great shooter by all like he can knock it down from Deep so I don't really know what what goes on when he gets to the free-throw line and he gets there often and off that if he increases from 69% to 79% that's a lot more points per game for sure yeah he did it and you you said if the Mavericks or the fifth seed they theoretically could pass the Clippers they're two games back but like we said quiet is out so who knows if the common game is the Clippers are going to win and this next year's Long Shop but they there's a possibility for them to jump to the force you  that's true all right so  let's just preview this crazy 14 games I think all 28 at 32 teams are playing tonight I think it's 14 games Detroit just Philly  cheesy me too who I picked up for my 30 team  final week if I had to play this week but I don't think fully but me too was gonna be in my starting lineup this week if we had to play it out so he is starting for Detroit me while Tyrese Maxey Kyle Lowry Tobias Harris and Joel and meet her all literally game time calls for the Sixers and Kelly oubre is not have a Big Red Cross by his name he should be a strong play tonight I would think yeah absolutely um looking at FanDuel and DraftKings neither of those sites have player props for any players other than indeed and Cade Cunningham and both of those guys are questionable for today so I would stay away from placing any single bets down obviously we like we said most fantasy seasons are already over so if you're looking for Action you can go to those sites or prize picks or something but it's kind of surprising that those are the only two available there are a ton of question marks for Philly Five Guys questionable Maxi Lowry Harris and beaten Melton I would expect a couple of them to play on but I'm saying away on any player props for that game  the over under is 15 and a half or over under the spread for Phillies 15 and a half over under that 223 this is one of one two three  four five five games six games that have a double-digit spread tonight so that's just kind of shows you where the league is at right now though there's gonna be a lot of blowouts tonight I think there there's a couple games on the Slate that are going to be entertaining for for a viewership as opposed to like you know having fantasy implications or betting on it this is one of those games Detroit is a messy is kind of trying to figure it out but they're not gonna risk anything now with and bead coming back I I'm probably rolling with  Philly to cover this um the Detroit that 15 and a half points is a lot of points but if  half of their starters are playing I like Philly to cover against Detroit tonight Kate County ham is been one of my he was I was really high on him coming into this fantasy season I drafted him and multiple leaks I think I had him in half of my League's I was a little disappointed at times um with it like his shot selection and watching it those games and just be in like the Pistons are terrible and like I like Cunningham style and he gets stats but the way that he gets stats it's kind of like you know fluff stats and ball games um I'm really hoping that he becomes a guy in the next couple years but I don't think and it was great to see him like play a full season after being injured all year but I wanted more from Kate this season it was nice to see like Jade and Ivy step up but you know there it's gonna be like you said met two is coming through like there's a bunch of like no name guys that are making hay for Detroit to see week  yeah um I I don't  I can't make my mind up about cayde County him I  I tend to try to ignore the hype and the people that the naysayers that are like oh game doesn't really translate the fantasy that well  um and think that he's gonna be awesome but then like you just said you watch him play and it's like  okay well it's is game is kind of detrimental to Fantasy it doesn't match up that well but he's also  really young and I was a lot of time to figure it out and still puts up big numbers so I'm cool with Kate I'm not I'm not reaching Kate is not a guy I will ever reach yeah I I reach for him a lot this this year and like a lot of assist a lot of points a lot of Threes at times good free throw shooter not many defensive stats poor field goal percentage so obviously he a lot better in a points League than a category League  yeah okay so on to Indy and Toronto Indy is healthy TJ McConnell has been very good I think if I build a fan to a lineup tonight it's gonna probably have music me too in its gonna have TJ McConnell in it um Kelly Linux should we be good for Toronto you again a manual quickly is out  meaning gradey dick and Gary Trent are both probably  going to play and put up numbers tonight Trent's good to go dick is got some sort of injury problem he's questionable but anything stand out with Indian Toronto for you Karen yes so RotoWire has been trying to promote all this prize picks tool that we've been using so what it does is it take  the numbers I'm price picks and then it Compares it to what sportsbooks are offering what RotoWire projections are offering how often that prop would hit um and normally there's a bunch of cool analytic tools to look at check it out rotowire.com slash picks so for this game I was looking at that tool and it had Kelly Olynyk on prize picks his number is at 13.5 points right and then you go to FanDuel or DraftKings that number goes up to 14 and a half so if you want to play price picks tonight Kelly Olynyk more than 13.5 points he scored at least 13 and six of his last eight and he's averaging 15 points are in that said like like you said Quickly's out there's gonna be more shots available I like Kelly Olynyk points total today 13 and a half it's this is another double digit spread game Indy has  still trying to kind of like figure it out they they look good at times teaching McConnell has been playing really well um but I  don't really like anything else in this game I like Trent to get up a bunch of shots Barrett has been RJ Barrett has been playing really well since coming back from his personal apps and he looks really comfortable in Toronto I'm not quite sure that I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is with RJ Barrett I'm much more comfortable rolling with the clinic I feel like he's a safer option tonight which  uh well said my Dallas Mavericks against your Charlotte Hornets oh my goodness that's gonna be tough that's gonna be tough to watch  Dallas is pretty healthy right now on the  on the healthwatch like Derek Lively's out Gafford and Grant Williams or  both  ready to go they should be good Luca and Kyrie should be good to go maybe just for a half maybe just for a quarter whatever it takes to win this game and it's not going to take long I see Luke having one of those  25 and 5 or 3 pointer first quarters tonight um  and then  didn't know I can't remember we got his first name but me check the point guard for I see  for the Hornets should be playing tonight and should be ready to go so  I like magic and I like Grant Williams in the game yeah absolutely Grant Williams Nick Richards came back for the last game against OKC but since okay see obviously has Chet Ed Center they rolled with Grant Williams again in the starting lineup I think Williams just gives Charlotte a little more offensive Firepower and they desperately need it so I like rolling with Williams but I'm taking me to church today on prize picks like I said I'm I used the tool again his points rebounds and assist total is set at 21 and a half um that is the same on FanDuel and DraftKings but if you go on those sites you get it at minus 125 so there's a lot better value of on this number on price picks it says surpassed 21.5 points rebounds and assists in five of his last six and he's averaging 12 and a half points 10 assists and 2.7 rebounds during that stretch things there's a lot of really good value there and I this is is another one another surprise surprise another double-digit spread today and like you said I wouldn't be surprised if Dallas blows them out in the first half but I'm not really concerned about Charlotte polling guys like meech or Grant Williams in this game this is also a little bit of a Revenge game for Grant Williams obviously Williams started the season with Dallas and there was a lot of chatter online a lot of rumors about how he rubbed people the wrong way there um so there might be a little bit of a Revenge game going on for Grant Williams against Dallas tonight  yeah and I think that's that's definitely valid because the way he went out in Dallas was not cool and  yeah and he's playing well and he's probably gonna want to he's probably gonna win rough on him up a little bit so I think that's legit the Miami Hawks are the Miami Heat are at the Atlanta Hawks I am going to that game with my sometimes Rotoworld fancy basketball podcast Bob the stain of it should have been pavement we are rolling down there together taking my daughter to Hawks game she's bugging me to go for a couple years we're doing it we're going in Terry Rose years if he was a neck injury bam is probable  the Hawks will not have trade young as we established the rest of their lineup looks like it should be should be good to go what when she got here here um so yeah like you said Trey Young's not playing um this is actually only a four-point spread Miami's only favorite by four so this should be a good game I think you you said Terry Rozier had the neck issue on Sunday he was not listed he was good to go and then he was a late addition to the injury report with some neck stiffness which was never a good sign I was fully expecting him not to play and then he got cleared to play and I was like oh well maybe it's not that bad and then he put out the biggest dudes of all the scored Four Points played only like 20 minutes and then after the game said I probably shouldn't be playing that kind of leads me to believe that he won't be playing tonight which sucks for the heat but they got hero back so I think you know the back court of hero and Robinson will be fine and mitigate Rosie's loss for the prize picks tool the theme of today's show I'm rolling with Jalen Johnson on price picks his points total is set at 16 and a half points FanDuel and DraftKings have that at 17 and a half points so you get an extra point on the prize picks tool he had a dud last week again in Dallas scored in single digits but his other two starts since returning from injury he scored 28 points and 17 points I know Miami has a good defensive front core and all that but Jalen Johnson is a stud he's from Wisconsin I'm from Wisconsin so I'm going with the hometown boy Jalen Johnson against the Heat tonight it's more than 16 and a half points it's nice to see the Hawks lineup looks normal it doesn't have cree and a bunch of no names in it like it easily could at this time of year they are  they've got to play in tournament they gotta go win they got a win some games you getting ready to welcome tray back I'm sure that  part of them thinks hey you know what if we get hot at the right time you never know what can happen and it's been such a visible season for them and Coach Quinn is not really fit in the way everybody hoped he would and I think them making a run in this in this playing tournament and maybe getting into playoffs and and getting some more postseason experience would actually be good for that team so we'll see what happens next on the docket is the Celtics and the Bucks is that correct yeah it looks like that  porzingis  probably gonna get the night off that's the thing man these Celtics I don't know how people are like well I still don't think they're gonna win the East I mean they just run over the East they can do whatever they want they can hold a Horford out they can hold for zinc is how they can sit Tate on them they can sit whoever they want because it doesn't matter everybody's gonna be healthy coming into the postseason there the Bucks it sounds like Chris Middleton is probable Giannis little iffy for tonight  and I don't know that Milwaukee can afford to not play honest but I don't know what do you think um yeah I feel like to be honest is gonna play tonight with the Bucs recent struggles this really feels like a game where a team that is probably been like we're only thinking about the playoffs right you fired buttonholes are big the he had won a bunch of regular season games right like that is that is what he does he wins regular season games his team struggle in the playoffs you fire Boot and holds her because you want to have better success in the playoffs and now you're all upset that you aren't playing as well during the regular season and it's like well well wasn't the whole point of the off-season to prepare yourself for the postseason and get these guys obviously there's no better way to prepare for the postseason than winning in the regular season but I do feel like you look at teams like the Lakers last year and these veteran teams the Warrior's a couple years ago when they made the run to the finals against the Celtics like there's these veteran teams with these Superstars Ken turn it on I know that that phrase is kind of like looked at in a negative light but in the NBA these Superstar teams can turn it on the Bucks need to turn it on and I feel like this is the moment where the honest is like I'm playing tonight Dame has a good game the Celtics may be resting prizing and Horford so that you know they got a little bit of a light front court that the Bucks can take advantage of I kind of like rolling with books money line tonight they're it's kind of a wild card play just a shot in the dark but they need to turn around and what better way to get like to cite yourself up to be like all right we're back after a couple bad losses then beating the number one team in the league um I think this the Celtics can only favored by two and a half tonight I think that takes into account that the assumption that presumes and Horford are both going to be out and it both those guys are out I really like  the bucks from court to dominate Luke cornette and Xavier Tillman and O shape or set and guys like that um and obviously that Giannis is also questionable but even if he doesn't play Bobby Portis and Brooke Lopez are much better than the backups for the backup front Court players for the Celtics so I'm kind of this is kind of like my play of the day I'm rolling with bucks money line which is plus 110 right now I don't really like any of the the price picks place here I was kind of looking at a Brazilian points total his points total set at 16 and a half but like I said he's questionable not expecting and I don't want to put down a bet on on somebody that's questionable  okay I like that the the play of the day the Milwaukee Bucks against the Boston Celtics and gutsy and I like I like the fact that Vegas has got spread down low that's that works  it works and we've seen a Boston news games they shouldn't lose so it's not it's not crazy the Knicks are at the Bulls the Knicks are healthy Jalen Brunson just keeps rolling along mowing people down what if  Bronson was still  playing with Luca I'd like to know how that would be going right now for the Bulls you've got Kobe white as probable you got I assume as if he and you've got actually Caruso also if he was an ankle injury  so the whole backcourt for Chicago's kind of banged up are you  that make you want to roll with Kobe white tonight or do you not trust him oh no I I probably rolling with Kobe I know that he's had some struggles since that that long injury absence but and the next defensive backhoe is really solid I like Kobe in this game um  going back I'm from Wisconsin but I'm actually not a box fan so there's no there's no bias in that box pick but I did I did have a couple buddies texting me like if Janice can just can beat the Nicks to get back in the MVP conversation and then Bronson drops 40 on their head and it's like well this Bronson deserve to be in the MVP conversation now because  if you only played the books and played against Damian Lillard every game Bronson should be the MVP he's averaging like 38 points a game against the Bucs this year um so that that Jalen Brunson fantastic player I don't think he'll get any MVP votes but he more than has exceeded expectations this year and um I I feel like forever we're going to talk about  what would have happened if you would have stayed with Dallas but I don't think you would have seen this type of Ascension I think he he learned he learned those pivot moves he got all of that stuff going on with the  by plane with Luca and all of that stuff and then he really had to be on his own to flourish and then now there's you know the talking heads on the ESPN are always talking about oh let's go get Superstars for New York let's go get you know let's go get Donovan Mitchell let's go get mikal Bridges probably isn't a superstar type player but I think he would actually be a good fit but this team really for me is is Bronson  Robinson and that like defensive front Court Stevenson ogno be like I think they went out and they they did the moves they got oh gee so I think they the next don't need to get a superstar for tonight I think you know I'm just rolling with the next to cover they're only favored by four and a half points I'm pretty healthy squad tonight like you said there's a couple injuries to monitor for the Bulls um I think the next just a much better team um I think that number is too low so I'm rolling with next minus four and a half against the Bulls tonight and OG and Jewish Randall wouldn't have gotten hurt I think the Nixon be really fun to to watch in these playoffs so it's it's I'm pretty sad that they're not not going to be a full strength um Orlando Magic at Houston Rockets Houston finally gave up the fight they did not catch  the Golden State Warriors I think we're all hoping they would  Franz Wagner injuries I think on Sundays hurt are we are we gonna get a Joe Ingles signing tonight if he's out and Houston actually still rolling along everybody looks healthy expecting green and the guys to go off in yeah I was on the Pod yesterday with Nick Whalen on Alex brutha was off and we were he was kind of questioning like our is Houston going to rest some of these guys in the stretch run and we kind of came to the conclusion that they're built backwards right um you know normally you have your veterans starters and then you got some young guys willing to contribute Off the Bench but this they're starting lineup is a bunch of youngsters aside from Fred Van Vleet and then their bench is a bunch of veterans so I don't really see Jalen green Ormond Thompson or Cam Whitmore or Jabari Smith or any of those guys while taking a seat so I expect the Rockets to play pretty well over the final stretch and continue on to build off of whatever they've in the last couple weeks a fantastic stretch for young team that they can look back at in the offseason and be like if we play like that for a full 82 we can be a playoff team for sure so that's exciting I think they're going to want to can use that over the final week with that said even if Franz doesn't play tonight I am rolling with the hot hand Orlando's only a three-point favorite right now and we're talking about a 3-point favorite I know they're playing on the road but they're fighting they're the almost the number two seed there's a number three seed in the East against the 11th seed in the west and they're only three point favorites I don't think that's enough points even if France doesn't play I know I'm not psyched about a lot of Jill Engel minutes but I know they can also go to Marie's Wagner his bronze his brother Off the Bench they can go to Jonathan Isaac I really like the way that Jamal Mosley manipulates those bench minutes on one one guys are out so I I think France will be fine for the for the playoffs I do think he might miss a couple games over the final week and even if he misses tonight I still like her Lando - 3 against Houston yeah and if France is out tonight Bangkok is going to be locked  into all my FanDuel lineups hard because  he has to do all the heavy lifting himself so definitely um okay washing Minnesota  we have got  calcium if he with an ankle  Jordan Poole kispert and Denny of dija kind of all Ballin Out right now like I think Jordan Poole finally  cleared his mind and is just playing basketball again and  finally let's get kiss for scoring points have these is these Visions had a great year in my opinion man like I maybe not a great year he's not like an All-Star not a fan of fantasy All-Star but he's just a solid fantasy Blair relatively low in the rankings like you know anytime I get a 31 and 12 out of got like that I'm just psyched about it Minnesota starters are all healthy including Nas Reed we're still waiting for the return of cats what she got going on with Washington Minnesota yeah I think you I know I think he's a star in his role right like you look at the overall season stats and you're like well this isn't star player by any means but he has been a star on certain nights and he is certainly capable and he's taking a hugely this forward I'm really encouraged to see that I mean right yeah yeah um and obviously it's for a team that's not really playing well so we'll see how that translates to like actually winning games but super encouraged by that I hope pool plays in the league for a long time he's an entertaining player and character obviously for him to do that he needs to be productive and I think he can be that said this is another double-digit spread Minnesota's favored by 16 and a half points Washington has five guys that are questionable kind of staying away from a lot of bets on this game I do like Rudy gobert's points total on price fix I know that's kind of sounds like a weird phrase Rudy is not known for scoring right um his points total on prize picks his set at 14 and a half all of the sports books have it at 14 and a half but the odds are at minus 125 so you get a lot better odds on prize picks um gobert has actually scored in double figures in seven of his last eight games on so like he's getting buckets there's opportunities for dumps off from Aunt and family and whatever but the biggest reason why I'm doing this is because Washington has no centers uh Marvin Bagley has already been ruled out Tristan Bush who's been playing pretty well as questionable richaun Holmes is also questionable Kyle kuzma who plays some small ball 5 at times for them is also questionable um so even if these guys do suit up their little banged up and even if they were at full strength I don't have they're not really good matchups against Rudy gobert so it's a little bit of an odd one but I'm known with Rudy's points total 14 and a half tonight against Washington no Center Wizards  no sinner Wizards  yeah they don't have Danny Gafford there anymore do they don't have anybody Reshawn Holmes  almost tried to call me 30 D but I didn't let him do it Sacramento at Oklahoma City Keegan Murray  if he was a cap injury Jalen Williams if he was an ankle injury he's missed four straight games  I feel like Jalen is is Gonna Roll out there and play and she'll just be good to go as well I feel like we're about to get the Oklahoma City Thunder back at full strength  yeah absolutely I sure hope so um and this would be a fantastic time to do so because this is a playoff matchup right here this could be a first round playoff matchup the kind of getting an early preview there's so many big double-digit spreads tonight and this is actually going to be one of those competitive games that I'm gonna be tuning into for sure um  while SGA is fully cleared he's not on the injury report at all he's making his return on falling up multiple game absence I think he's missed he must Force straight and six of the last seven the one time he did play he did play 35 minutes during that stretch but he scored only 19 points and given that I don't think he's really gonna be limited today like I don't think he's gonna play 25 minutes or 27 minutes I think he will get a full a lot of minutes but I don't know if he's gonna be as aggressive right now price picks has sga's points total set at 28 and a half seems like a pretty high number for a guy that has played only one game in the last two weeks so I'm gonna be rolling with the under on that less than 28.5 points on sportsbooks have sga's total at 28 and a half but the odds again are minus 125 so you get better odds on prize picks on and that said like I don't think I'm not expecting him to be super Rusty or anything I just don't think that he's gonna be super aggressive Darren foxes a great defender SGA Fox sabonis chat like hopefully Jalen  Williams plays this is this is probably right behind bucks Celtics for like must watch games tonight right like these are the two games that I'm definitely tuning into probably throwing in the Warriors and Lakers but we'll get to that in a little bit for sure yeah and deer and fox was another Cog another key cog on my my 30 D team during Fox Kobe white shout out to them Austin Reeves Victor women llama of course and so yeah I'm probably I like Fox to try to go off against the Thunder night so I could I could see him being in my FanDuel lineup as well um here and I think we're here to the annual Silly Season special the San Antonio Spurs are taking on the Memphis Grizzly tonight if you look at the lineup sheets for this game and you look at Memphis you will see like 12 guys with red crosses that their name and then you'll see five names of people you've hardly ever heard of that are in their starting lineup and it's pretty funny um just going over some of these names Trey Jones Malachi Branham Julian champagne Sandro my Luca vealey  Victor Jordan Goodwin GG Jackson Myles Cena Pereira and Trey Jameson like that is your starting tan tonight and it's just it is fabulous you to look at the Memphis injury report you got to have the eclipse glasses on you gotta have something to protect yourself it is a mess I I have no other and Analysis aside from that um you know the only reason why you're tuning into this game is to get one more look at Victory women Yama before the regular season is finished  they're expecting it to be a pretty competitive game Spurs are only favored by four and a half points the over under is set at two 15 and a half which is tied for the lowest on the board I'm probably staying away from this one if I if I catch any of it I'm probably just cheering for Victor to make a couple threes or have a fun block or something but like you said this is silly season and full of fact  happy to see some of these guys get an opportunity you know Victor vs Victor vs GG Jackson should probably have some highlight where the plays today but not much going on in this one for sure dude if they let if they let Victor woman go out there and just play in this game like this could be one of those  historic nights because he's gonna be by far the best player on that court and you know I I'm from my personal standpoint I'm glad I don't need to worry about whether when he's gonna play or not because it was incredible to see that that team I had him on and all the teams I had them on like if he played I won if he took one game off a week I usually lost so he was crucial for him to be in there but man he could go out there and just light a fire tonight it could be awesome well one of the biggest things with Victor for me throughout the early stages of the season when he wasn't really quite putting up the points or like the the consistent production that we were hoping for he wasn't playing a full like 30 minutes he was playing 28 minutes 29 minutes um that has gone out the window and I'm really happy to see it like obviously the Spurs aren't playing for anything but when banana has played 30 plus minutes in 17 straight games and like you on Sunday for the year championship probably he played 43 minutes against the Sixers and when a guy like that is playing 40 plus minutes the stats are just gonna come like even if he has a bad shooting night or something he's gonna get stats just because of the way he is and the dominance that he has 33 points 18 rebounds six to six seven blocks and 43 minutes if he plays anywhere close to 40 minutes tonight like you said historic performance could be a coming for sure yeah I think that was a double double overtime game as well which I was not complaining about as long as it kept him on the court and my free throw percentage didn't drop tonight we've got Denver  at Utah  all five Denver starters are actually on the injury report but all of them are probable except for Aaron Gordon his questionable Utah's silly season started five will include Gente George calling sex and who should go off some dude they Embrace sense of all Taylor Hendricks and Omer year 7  yeah I I'm pretty high on Chianti George as a is a guy for next year as a guy for keeper League I think he has a bright future um for sure Bryce sensible and Taylor Hendricks and other two more rookies that are carving out playing time but I I'm kind of hesitant on them projecting them for next year just because you know obviously you're gonna have marketing back and columns problem you know like they'll be other options in the front Court keonte George is a really great player for next year fantasy and for keeper  as for tonight this is a another double-digit spread Denver by 15 um their money line is minus 1450 so there's not much money to be made on Denver tonight um so I'm probably not rolling with any of that they have been rushing a lot of their their regulars Jamal Murray just came back from an absence Gordon is Mr couple games you'll catch missed the game a couple weeks ago but he's been playing he's been a regular on the injury report I think this is kind of just like a Get Right game for Denver blow out a silly season team not much going on I do like um Nicola yokich like to to dominate the you said Collins and Walker Kessler John Collins and Walker Kessler are both out tonight that means you're seven is starting at Center I don't expect him to be locking down yoked for much longer the only thing that could stop yokich from reaching his totals tonight is just to blow out and he doesn't play in the fourth quarter which is certainly possible  a couple more games here and then we're gonna get rid of all out of here we've got the Golden State Warriors  it's the Lakers you got Wiggins Andrew Wiggins is probably trayce Jackson Davis starting for the Warriors playing pretty well I like him and FanDuel LeBron and AD are both if he LeBron missed last one with an illness add love with an eye but I think they're both going to play and  at least seems don't really like each other I think they want to go out and try to bang each other up here before the playoffs get going and it should be it should be a fun one this is a game I could actually sit and watch tonight I think yeah absolutely this is definitely a top three game on the Slate thank you said these teams don't really like each other stuff and and LeBron or always kind of cordial in the media and whatever and talking about their legacy and and obviously there's the dream on green he he adores LeBron based on all of the things that he says um but I think these two teams when they play each other they want to be at their best trayce Jackson Davis has been playing really well as a starter I I'm expecting him to remain in the starting lineup just because of the Anthony Davis and the front court but Jonathan kaminga is back and healthy and he is he might like he came off the bench last game so don't be surprised if he did that again even though he was a regular starter for a long time  this is  a fantastic game like I said you know you got the Kings and the Thunder and then he got the Bucks in the Celtics this is right there up there on the Slate for most watched TV I'm probably the Lakers are two and a half Point favorites they've been on fire on recently the Warriors have trouble containing LeBron so I think I'm gonna be rolling with Lakers minus two and a half against the Warriors tonight I do like the Warriors I just I feel like clay has to have a big game in order for them to be able to combat the Lakers physicalness in the front court with LeBron and Rudy hachimura for that matter and add  well anytime you have to rely on a clay I don't think it's a good thing but rehab tomorrow man one thing I learned this year's of 80 or LeBron's not playing Reed is going to be the man the Clippers are visiting the Phoenix Suns koala Leonard is out for the fifth straight game James Harden Paul George Terence man will all play and should do well they all played well on Sunday's injury report is pretty clean except use of nurkic alert questionable with the sprained right ankle oh yeah if choir was playing this would be a must watch game without Kauai I don't have much faith in the Clippers PJ TARC PJ Tucker in a starting lineup for I want to be Championship contending team in the year 2024 is not ideal um so I I like the sun's to cover tonight they lost last night they had they had been kind of picking up steam and then kind of hit the brakes again it's kind of been the story of their entire season they're horrible in the fourth quarter um that's the biggest concern for the Suns going into the playoffs but barring another PJ PJ PG-13 Paul George explosion I don't think the Clippers can keep Pace with the sun's when the sun's at full strength with Booker and B and Alan and KD dropping in three so I like Phoenix to cover here the line is Phoenix's favorite by 7 and a half points if Kawaii was playing this is totally different  story but just don't think the Clippers have enough Firepower  nice oh  yeah I'm kind of I'm with you on that I think yeah I I don't know that I love a lot of FanDuel stuff in in that game maybe some Grayson Allen but he's so expensive now that he's tough anyway last game of the night it is a doozy the New Orleans Pelicans healthy except for Brandon Ingram  against the Blazers Silly Season lineup that includes scoot Henderson rayan Rupert Chris Murray Jabari Walker and somehow  the man I feel is being punished all season for being who he is the Andrea 8 in look the I know you want to get a king cocoon we know you want out of here we know you don't care like guess what you're playing 30 minutes again tonight sucking up and go it Dominate and yeah I mean DeAndre is playing really well I'm happy for him that starting lineup is brutal scoot Henderson has not lived up to my expectations I think there's still hope that he can turn a corner he's just for Fantasy purposes he's kind of a wash in category League you can put up stats and and points the main piece for Portland is is the bench guy Delano Banton he's been just fantastic he's probably him and DeAndre are the only guys I like in Portland I'm really big Pelican stand I'm sure anybody who Tunes in has noticed that I think I know that they've been struggling with without Brandon Ingram Zions been playing fantastic ball I think he's playing the best ball of his career right now on that's dangerous CJ McCollum is nice Herbert Jones is a fantastic Defender Trey Murphy he's a good shooter like they got all these pieces I'm really hoping that they can put it together I I gotta stick with my guns here I'm rolling with the Pelicans to cover minus 13 against the poor against the Trailblazers  there's there's not much analysis go into this other than the Pelicans need to win they need to keep winning and they need to blow out teams like Portland they can't pull the Bucks they can't they can't fall apart like this on I think Pelicans play pretty tough tonight and I think Zion just absolutely goes crazy so the  Pelicans minus 13 and and all over on the designs over on every Zion prop that is out there wow that's a lot of faith in the guy with a hurt finger and I'm  an Appetite for Destruction ah I almost let you let me get out here without giving Denali Benton some last second praised but man that guy  carrying teams for the last two months just bawling Silly Season Superman so he's in here I love I love Banton so much I love the fact that  um you know I love that I love when I picking guy up and nobody else is really talking about and then you know a co-host on a podcast or something like  I'm not really feeling that guy and and then that guy just goes off for the next two months and it's like let's let's go and do this so love me some denial about absolutely all right man well I think we I think we did it again we made it through a podcast my voice is still here and I think now here and I my vision is for you and I to do this every Tuesday through the playoffs are you good with that Yes sounds good to me before we get out of here I do want to answer Matt carmody's question oh yeah he said how many of the final four games do you think Middleton will play for the bucks I think  so looking back Middleton is played in nine of 11 and the only two times he sat out was the second night of a back-to-back set the Bucks play tonight and they also played tomorrow I'm expecting Chris to play tonight expecting him to sit tomorrow but then I would assume he'll play the final two games the Bucks are fight like we've mentioned they're fighting for the number two seed so they can't really rest him over those last two games and like we said one of those games is against the magic so they're definitely gonna need him to be available for that game as they fend off the fierce competition for the two seed on so I would say conservatively he'll probably play at least two probably will play three of the four and I am I'm more bold on him playing three then you are and I think he might even play for it depends on what their locker room is like um  if they're locked room is talking about getting Tracked Down and getting Tracked Down by the magic and getting past and they're like we can't let this happen and Middleton your Healthy you've only played so and so many games over the last two seasons get out there and you know curious home down the stretch so I wouldn't even be surprised if you played in that back the back I'm not gonna go as far as pretty predicting that he will I just think it it's possible that he could yeah and like the game tomorrow is against the magic so that would be the big one and so I feel like there's a chance he plays for but I like you said I don't want to project that he'll play for for sure all right curing I will be here every Tuesday at 11:00 throughout the NBA Playoffs to talk  DraftKings FanDuel Underdog price picks whatever and then Cameron I'll be back here on Thursday doing our Victory lap so on our championships  and then we'll go from there but I'll see you all again Thursday at 11 and caring thank you so much for coming on and look forward to keep doing this Yes sounds good Steve looking forward to it have a good time at the game tonight thank you guys have a good
