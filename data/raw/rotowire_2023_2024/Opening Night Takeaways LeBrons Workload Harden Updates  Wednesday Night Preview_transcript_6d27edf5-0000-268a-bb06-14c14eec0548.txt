welcome to a regular season Edition Brandi Kravitz of the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast I am Nic Whalen joined as I always am on Wednesdays it will be throughout the NBA season by brand new credits Brandon had a lot of fun previewing the season these last few weeks with you but man it is great to have real NBA basketball back you know the first week of the preseason I'm dialed in I'm watching every game I'm watching the condensed highlights things like that but by the end of the preseason you're just kind of ready for things to to have real meaning and what a relief it was last night to to get Lakers Nuggets in the early window and then really fun game a little bit of a sloppy game really both of them were a bit sloppy between the Phoenix Suns and the Golden State Warriors but let's start with the LA Lakers you know there's a big outbreak of panic on Fantasy Basketball Twitter after this game when Darwin Hamm said yeah you know we've kind of what the to have this plan in place for LeBron James to to have a limited workload during the regular season he played 29 minutes last night was notably like in and out of the game and in short stints you know didn't play a ton in the first half of specially and even as the Lakers were making a rally you know it felt like they were pretty hard-line sticking to this stance that LeBron James was not going to play 30 minutes no matter what still gives you 21 8 and 5 with the steel 10 of 16 from the field I thought he looked great physically I will say this I don't think LeBron James is going to average under 30 minutes the season this is like the 8th year in a row that whatever team he's on has said that their managing his workload but as we saw last night when the bronze off the floor the Lakers are not gonna win a lot of games no and somebody who had Lakers plus five quite confidently last night every time they took him out I was just cringing because this Lakers team would allow the Nuggets to just pour it on and you see it reflected in the in the Box Score LeBron James plus seven I think anybody else was was in plus territory about the in terms of the starters I don't I you know that's that might need to be debunked that I mean plus mine is take it for what is worth but I think for LeBron it does tell a story here yeah I agree he looked really good that was great to see he doesn't look like a 38 year old I don't think that shocks anybody at this point because he's he is so great that he defies reality but he's still somebody that's inching closer to 40 years old so it's probably the right approach but how long can you get away with it the good news is the Lakers won't be playing the defending Champions every single night and man credit where credit is due Denver picked up right where they left off you know part of my handicap last night and I know it didn't have an episode where I  you know thankfully you guys didn't hear this because maybe I would have convinced some people to lose money with me you figure there's going to be some form of a championship hangover yoga shouldn't go back home and write horses fast enough for playing all that basketball last year and they just didn't miss a beat it was like they were playing the next game of the NBA final series that's how locked in and prepared they looked  I thought the Nuggets role players vastly outplayed the Lakers role players for most of the night you know kcp was one of the best players on the floor for either side he goes eight of 12 2 of 3 from Beyond The Arc Aaron Gordon looked really good had some big shots throughout this game obviously yolk Kitchen in Jamal Murray did what they do I mean jokes was just you know the touch around the rim I mean that's that's the thing that I always come back to with him it's like the the angles don't matter the the level of Defense doesn't seem to matter as long as he could get that shot off and he's within five feet it always finds a way to kind of die on the rim and just roll in I mean he's just it looks so easy for him he was operating at like 75% speed which I know we always is to some degree but like I you know never played well they shot 53% from the field a lot of it was shot making you know it like the Lakers were missing a lot of the looks that that Denver was making it was not a good night for Austin Reeves was you know DeAngelo Russell we said he was a plus one but he's just he's not a winning player and I don't think he's long for this Lakers team might be shocked if he makes it through the regular season as a member of this team Tori Prince  you know for talking guys to to maybe take a look at off the waiver wire we'll see how much time Jarred Vanderbilt misses but he hit four three-pointers 18 points three boards for him at a block as well we need to talk about Anthony Davis spread and I took him in the first round of my NFP Casey the other night I didn't feel great about it you're never gonna feel good about your entire fantasy basketball season hinging on Anthony Davis but you know my concern of course is that he's not going to play more than like 55 games it's not that he's going to go scoreless in the second half of a huge game when you know he talked all off season about how he can't wait to play the nuggets and then he comes out and just has a classic Anthony Davis I'm not that guy type of performance exactly because it's not like you wasn't involved he was over six from the field so he was he was getting shots up they were going in he is the most befuddling player in the NBA because that is best he's a top five guy but you can't have a conversation about him in that range because he has these Disappearing Acts usually it's not in the middle of the game I feel like that's not really how Anthony Davis usually usually he starts the game and you know he's gonna be irrelevant all the way through  17 points in the first half it was like all right you know Anthony Davis game I was feeling pretty good about my Lakers side because when he's playing it as best that's when the Lakers win games LeBron's always going to give you that sort of consistency the fact that he didn't play over 30 minutes and then you had a no show for me Anthony Davis in the second half in some ways it's surprising it's as close as it was at the end of the night but yeah that's that's really disappointing I you know I hate to be the guy that says I told you so I don't touch it any Davis because I don't trust him I was picking Knights overall you know it's kind of at that point where if you're not taking him you're reaching it felt like for some guys you'd rather take and round two and I was able to pair them with a metal ball who was still on the board coming back around was actually all can't trust you might as well I might as well lean into it at this point so yeah I'm either winning 10,000 dollars or I'm taking dead last most likely and that League there's another one where you know people stake is it no thank God no I do not have him that one that was an auction so like you have to go out of your way to end up with Anthony Davis and that league and I think I had him last year actually so we will not be we will not be going down that path again but we'll provide updates on that league as a year goes along yet we saw a decent amount of camera redish 18 minutes looked okay he's actually a plus for the Lakers I think those minutes probably evaporate to a significant degree with Jarred Vanderbilt his back gave Vincent did not look good my goodness I mean he was he was probably the biggest minus I think of all the role players for the Lakers even more so Dandy Angelo Russell just getting  hunted on defense you know wasn't hitting anything he's over four from three you know again not a ton to take away fantasy wise like Brewery three of ten that's just kind of what really have to where it does like I'm not I I think the collective depth that the Lakers have branded but I'm not really high on any of these guys individually like even as like late round fantasy targets like I've never been a hatchimal guy you know Christian Wood had a couple of nice looks last night but I think what Vanderbilts back his minutes kind of dry up as well is there anything else you want to mention from Lakers Nuggets yeah actually I've been a little bit higher and throughout the draft process on some of these Lakers bench guys I I love really hachimura I think that he will get rolling at some point this season just the way the Lakers play basketball ease LeBron super light I'm not comparing the two by any means I'm not comparing I'm just I'm saying in terms of the the body size the ability to get to the rim the comparisons and there but I feel like he's Marcus Morris super light are we talking about LeBron good super duper I can't add enough I would it would take up the rest of the episode for me to hit you with that but I just I can't in terms of just like this is a team that wants to beat you with their size he's got it that's that's the point technically he does yeah you're not wrong which is a big body he's a big body that can get to the rim and he's had he's had his stretches I thought he got lost in Washington as most players do and he's played well for La this is but he gives you these stinkers so I didn't end up with him anywhere so not as not exactly a money where my mouth is situation Christian Wood is somebody that I have rostered and I don't think I'm gonna be able to drop him fast enough he yeah just I've been over him for years and it's kind of I'm at the point where it's just time to admit it the Gabe Vincent thing I'm very curious to follow this it's one game and I'm not gonna make too much of it he's not going to go over from three point range all season long but if he is bad for this Lakers team  boy is that gonna just shine a big bright light on hashtag Heath culture like never before because he was a playoff Superstar yeah I mean it would be shocking to me if he takes a step back like there's there's something about that that Heat team where it's like everybody felt like was playing above their level right like I wouldn't be surprised if we see kind of a similar thing with Baxters in Cleveland where he's just not quite not quite as good like there's there's something about playing in Miami and kind of the the coalescence of how that group came together that is going to be hard to replicate somewhere else yeah I don't have much else on this game you know we handed out a few props on the road to wire MBA Show on Sirius XM last night you know Alex hit his best bet kcp over one and a half threes I hit mine which was Anthony Davis to just make one three luckily we got that out of the way early I thought he would take like five or six he's been launching a bunch of Threes in the pre-season Darby have said he wants he was taking like six seven three pointers per game he was aggressive early on completely got away from that as the game went along with that is something you know fantasy wise to keep an eye on when it comes to Anthony Davis is that at least in theory you know that three-point production could take up a little bit but we'll see how comfortable he ends up being all right before we talk Warrior's Brandon let's let's touch on this James Harden situation because I'm getting tweet alerts like every five minutes from Chris Haynes you know 22 minutes ago James Harden was expected to travel with the 76ers today to Milwaukee they're coming here they're coming to you know my town to play the Bucs tomorrow night and then roughly 14 minutes after that Chris Haynes tweets update James Harden will not travel with the team to Milwaukee today it will remain in Philadelphia to continue his ramp up you know Hardin said like a month ago that he wanted to  you know be around the team but make things uncomfortable try to force his way out are the Sixers uncomfortable here like if anything this just feels like one giant inconvenience and I don't think anybody is like feeling bad for James Harden  yeah well if I hear players say I want to play I want to be around but I'm gonna make the team uncomfortable I'm not exactly saving a spot on the airplane for that individual I think the Sixers are making the right choice here I thought James Harden would be dealt by now but Daryl Morey understandably so those don't want to operate in in panic mode that's not what good general managers do but when you see a report like this ahead of game one where you're trying to set the tone for the season this is a Sixers team that has high aspirations if if he doesn't play and it's not traveling with the team what's to make you believe that he's ever going to suit up for the Philadelphia 76ers again so I this is a we're just sort of waiting it's an if it's a when not if situation at this point  yeah I mean there's kind of this lingering deadline of like you know Harden's away from the team for what 30 days you know then he could potentially lose his ability to become a free agent but I got to do more reading on that like is does he have to play in games can he just can he be with the team does that you know extend that time line I'm really not sure I mean I do think it's it's still overwhelmingly likely that he's traded at some point you know ironically Tears band is on the injury report and will not play tonight I think there was some speculation you know around NBA Twitter over what that could mean but I do think at some point he gets his wish and his likely traded to the clippers but Daryl is not just gonna send him out for 40 cents on the dollar like I think they're gonna have to get another team involved they're gonna try to create and manufacturers some sort of minor bidding war for James Harden because I don't think they're just gonna be send him over to the clippers for free but nonetheless at this point looks very unlikely that James Harden is going to play on opening nights so as of now you know if you're if you're kind of configuring your your weekly lineup ahead of a 12 game slate on Wednesday I would be leaving James Harden to that bucks by the way either five and a half or six point favorites at home over the Sixers depending on where you look think I like that  I think so too I think so too I you know it's funny I've seen a lot of like projection models you know that kind of spit out wind totals and things like that  a lot of those are low on Milwaukee I think there's some concerns about the the lack of proven depth and you know the potential fall off on defense going from Drew to Damian Lillard I get it I don't think they're gonna be a team that's like pushing for 60 wins or anything I think they'll go through some ups and downs I would be surprised if it's a little rocky at first but I was looking at one of them I forget which system is like the dark OS system I want to say had the books Peg for like 44 wins like what come on they'd have to have some serious injury problems to get to yeah 44  yeah 44 wins is we will be it'll be like the ship is sinking situation but the end of the year yeah yeah well the one thing I do worry about you know I think Giannis Lillard both of those guys they probably build in some rest but you know neither of them have like a real injury track record I do feel like what's going a little undercovered is you know Brooke Lopez at what 3536 years old coming up a back surgery two years ago he played I think 77 games last year I mean that is best best best best case and you know I think if Brooke Lopez work to have anything happen with that back again and missed at any chunks of time like that to be is where the books could be in real trouble defensively yeah I am the Bucks making it to the finals so this the conversation is not making not giving me the warms Mormon fuzzies in terms of that pick  all right let's go to Subs Warriors we'll completely flip it will no more injury talk here although no Draymond Green for Golden State know Bradley Beal for the Phoenix Suns they said during The Telecast that deal was reportedly quote devastated that he was unable to play on opening night but he does hope to be out there so let's play they turn around and play tomorrow at the Lakers in game two for both of those teams could be looking at what two star here for the Lakers honestly I feel like that's likely based on how they looked last night but we will see 108 104 in favor of the Phoenix Suns kind of an ugly game on the Golden State Side they were kind of on the verge of I'm getting blown out I mean they were down 15 at the half you know came out with a Vengeance in the third quarter they outscore Phoenix 40 to 19 in the third period end up leading the game going into the fourth and that Phoenix rallies back so it was that you know everybody says the NBA is a game of runs like this was this was the single game sample where it just about like each team was was kind of taking turns going on a run yeah well first of all how about that Adam Silver you put in those new rules about load Management Phoenix doesn't make it one game into the season they're already load managing Bradley Beal it's just comical I do not like seeing that right out of the gate he got to get these guys playing together this team is very real title hopes and if it's only one game but he got to start forming that chemistry so the fact that they're already holding him out for cautious reasons we had an entire offseason we were about anyway the Warriors continued to be the best third quarter team in NBA history I think 40 to 19 it was about the only thing they did well last night I thought Phoenix looked  really good Kevin Durant didn't even really shoot the ball all that well seven of 22 Grayson Allen gave you nothing literally oh six from the field last night I thought Yusuf nurkic was I thought he really was the story for me because he proved in one night that he is such a better fit for this team right now then DeAndre ayton is 14 points 14 rebounds three assists he is just perfect for this roster allowing everybody else to thrive and he just takes easy buckets and gets rebounds so this is a dangerous team I mean I like Phoenix as long as they can get over this paranoia of injury throughout the course of the season this team's going to be really good  yeah I like what I saw for Phoenix I mean they they started Joshua kogi and we'll see you know if that's ultimately his spot or if that's Beale spot or should take Grace and Alex spot obviously be able to be starting you know one guard spot but I think they'll probably bring Grace Off the Bench like that was the way it was reported going into last night was that Grace now which started in place of Bradley Beal so I think they want to go out there for his defense but he was great you know finishing around the rim seven of nine from the field like he said Durant not a great night for him you know he's even on a bad night you still gonna give you 18 and 11 like you're never gonna come away you know like you just got completely burned by Kevin Durant but he didn't look great you have a Booker looked fantastic he came out strong in this game it was kind of the finisher for the Suns like they they needed a basket late to to essentially you know put this one away make it a two possession game Booker help the ball for like I don't know 18 seconds well being closely guarded like five seconds just doesn't get called anymore maybe that's been completely erased from the rule book but did a really good job you know kind of protecting the ball from Gary Payton got into the rim or got into the I should say pulled up and then made a really nice last second pass to a cutting Nerge who laid it into to put this game away I still think like if you just look at the basketball players I think DeAndre ayton is like a better fit for the Suns but I also think he he had basically just decided that he couldn't play there anymore and I think Devin Booker had also decided that so even though I think going from 8 into Booker or eight into nurkic is like kind of a downgrade in terms of assets I don't think this one's really had a choice I think they just had to get him out of there and you know bringing in Turkish is kind of your emergency option  it looks pretty good it looks pretty good right now I think I think defensively there's some matchups where he's going to struggle but I mean his finishing you gotta forget like when he's healthy he's he's a skilled skilled player he's a better passer than the Audrey you know it's injuries have really been the thing that I feel like is kind of knocked his reputation in the last few years yeah the thing I like about it is it yeah it's a downgrade it's not like he's a better player than the Andrea and I think he's a better fit for this roster because with the three guys that are gonna be handling the ball and scoring most of the buckets throughout the course of the Season build it and play but we still saw that from Durant Booker in this game guys like nurkic and eight and when he was there they're gonna fade into the background nurkic isn't bothered by that he's not gonna lose focus because he's not involved DeAndre ayton would if you didn't if you didn't get him involved early he would lose him in a basketball game and and I just think that that's not what you need if you're the Phoenix Suns so this nurkic add it seems to be paying off early one of the things that take away from last night is you you go into the chase in into the chase Center  is it Chase Center Chase Arena where the Warriors yeah okay and you you held the Warriors to 104  you won the game without getting into a shootout with this basketball team we don't look at the sons and say they're going to be you with their defense but the team actually played pretty well defensively that's that's got to be something they're going to hang their hat on after last night yeah yeah they did and you know I think they have done a good job of mixing in you know and some of these role player spots mixing in defensive Focus players right and even someone like Nas little who barely played in this game but you know had played a couple key minutes late you know a kogi I think it's number one on that list and the sun's bench is a little alarming and what we could kind of say the same thing about some of the pieces at the warriors were bringing Off the Bench as well but I mean it's Eubanks want annabi little Gordon Jordan Goodwin I mean those that that's your bed unit and you know there's obviously with Bradley Beal plays you know maybe you drop one of those guys but still I mean this is a team that's going to be hunting I think for help at the deadline you know whether it's bio player or some sort of minor trade at some point because it's about as top heavy of a roster as we've seen with that big three on the Warriors what don't sleep on their debt the fact that my guy bold was a DMP coaches decision speaks to Hell lot of they are yeah he must still be ramping up I think it's exactly 10 it was kend  Perkins that said that he could win defensive player of the year which might have been it those were actual words his words I don't know what NBA he is watching but yeah Bobo didn't get in there last night the depth when you get to the playoffs though it's his team is built for how much does depth really matter when you're that loaded and in terms of your starting lineup these guys are going to play such heavy minutes at that point so as long as you can get there and they should be able to do that you want to talk about how bad Chris Paul was to open the game last night  yeah we can't I mean I agree on the minutes that are on the depth thing to some degree but I also don't think you want Kevin Durant playing like 42 minutes at night in the first round of the playoffs right I think there's some weird tear factor that the further you advance you just you're asking more and more of those guys because you're not adding any depth that's the playoffs go along yeah Chris Paul I mean Paul had I think it was in the third quarter you had a nice little run where you got an ad one off of nerds you look like he was turning things around but started off six from the field ended up for a 15 it was not a not a banner night shooting the ball for the Golden State Warriors like I think you do give credit to Phoenix defensively only forced 11 turnovers that Phoenix actually had night 19 of their own but a lot of this was the Warriors just missing missing the type of three pointers that were used to them making and you know Paul over six and three Wiggins over three even Steph Curry 4:14 and then was not a banner night for Klay Thompson either he went three of eleven yeah I just don't I don't think you need Chris Paul taking 6 threes per game so that he's not gonna miss all of them obviously in the future but that's that's not really what he's there for they have guys to do that they still went cold pretty much everywhere else credit the sons what they were able to do defensively but yeah this was in a great night it wasn't a great showcase for Klay Thompson who's still looking for an extension to start the the year with 15 points when you you and Curry need to be the offense at this point for this team as they've always been this isn't anything new these guys are getting older and this is the concern with the Golden State Warriors I certainly respect NBA history I respect the legends of these guys have turned themselves into but this is why I don't have the Warriors go all that far in the playoffs this year I think this team is going to look old more times than not in key moments we saw a lot of Dario saric last night probably more Dario starts than we needed to but that again speaks to some of the depth issues that the Warriors have and look we're draymond's in their SARS is probably playing you know eight to 10 minutes instead of 20 minutes but you know their bench unit we can kind of joke about phoenixes but sorry kaminga Cory Joseph Gary Payton Moses Moody I thought Moody it could make a warrior some good minutes as special during that third quarter run you know I'm still pretty high on what can make it can be he had you know two steals in a block for Fantasy purposes but I think the Warriors are another team that they're kind of gonna assess where they are mid-season and you know they talk about them getting older like they're leaning into that right like they for a while they were kind of trying to play both sides and like develop this kind of next generation core for their franchise they're still doing that to some degree with kaminga and Moody but you know that now they've kind of lean the other way bringing in Chris Paul like the old get older oh well yeah because they realized that the next they're trying to play Both Sides like you said that but they realized that their next Generation guys weren't really all that good that's why they got rid of James Wiseman kaminga has not developed yet Moody shows moments I really liked him coming out of college but he isn't shown that he can be that guy to take the mantle they want to pass the Baton but those guys are not ready to carry it so they want to be young girl they've wanted that for the last couple of years they have not been able to make that transition so they have to lean on Age and and these veterans at some point the well is going to run dry Steph Curry's still amazing the guy can't do it all by himself and defensively he's never been able to do it all by himself because that's not his game so where they bringing it in terms of defense and if the legs are getting old and tired then you really where do you love the Warriors anymore it's a team that's chalk full of names that might not be able to produce in a way that we're  used to so how's that for a game on overreaction  all right the Warriors are cooking you heard it here first alright um alright before we turn our attention to Wednesday's monster slate we got a question in the chat from our good pal but banana he says Brandon thoughts on the lack of a true point guard in Phoenix I think for Fantasy purposes this is actually going to be a good thing for Devin Booker specifically you think back to excuse me you think back to a couple years ago when the sun is had no point guard this was before they had arrived and are the sunset we think of today all right Booker had like back-to-back years where he was essentially playing point guard on an experimental basis and an average Joe around seven assists per game so I think between he Duran and Beale I think Booker's the guy that's going to be on the ball the most he had eight assists last night of course when deals back you know maybe it's more of a split between those two but I don't see the Suns like bringing in anybody you know who really functions as a true point guard I think they're they're fine with three main guys splitting those responsibilities and I think Bookers the guy who's gonna benefit most in terms of fantasy I'm gonna hit you with the cliche that you'll hear from coaches all year long  it's positioned this basketball at his absolute finest you've got three guys that are gonna score a ton of points this year that all do pretty well in isolation so if there if they're running everybody's viable and then if they get stuck in the half court they can put the ball in any of those three stars hands and they can and they can make that can I can create space for somebody else and and an easy Outlet pass to get the job done or they can just get a bucket at themselves so do they even need a point guard I guess would be my question I don't think they do I don't think they do and I think they would have addressed that if they believed they needed a point guard I think you got three guys in Durant Booker Beale who you know for the most part can get all handle the ball to to some degree and I think I mean Beale and Booker I could play point guard if they wanted to write like they're they're you think of those guys that's kind of true classic shooting guards but I think between those two they're plenty fine with what they have right now we have another quick question here Brandon thoughts on  okay we got a murders row here Paul Reed Kobe white Xavier Tillman Derek Lively and Jeremy Sohan in Roto being asked to rank those players  hmm oh you yeah I think I might go Tillman one just I think he's gonna play a lot of minutes like he was already playing a decent amount of minutes last year I get the Kobe white hype you know he was a you know top 10 pick not that long ago they they have this void at point guard  Paul Reed we'll see you know kind of feels like he needs an indeed injury the whole thing I think the percentages might hurt you I mean it's never a good thing when you're when there's like a story that comes out that you're being asked to shoot free throws one handed you know usually like the 88% free throw shooters are not being asked to do that so in Rhode Island work well he's got better when he went to the one hand yeah yeah I mean the fact that he's willing to do it says a lot I think I would go Tillman white Lively Sohan read but you know ultimately those are kind of the roster type of guys we got some ads to pass along here before we talk about Wednesday slate and get into some of the players that

counsell is interviewing for the Mets job don't love that anyway that is neither here nor there as we are on a basketball podcast not think we'd get a Craig counsell reference on the NBA pod today oh man this is people are gonna be upset about this in Milwaukee all right so we have another James Harden update it's been a combination of Chris Haynes Shams and whoa who are all just like chiming in and like one upping each other with news what was just now reporting that James Harden has not actually practiced with the Sixers in 10 days it's been October 15th so it's his last practice he's just kind of sounds like kind of getting work off the side working with their developmental coaches the the plan is that he's going to ramp up in the coming days but the Sixers play their first two games on the road they played Milwaukee and they're at Toronto so what was you saying Harden is out at least the first two games of the season  yeah no surprise here I think they're just they're gonna try and find a trade partner um if he hasn't been practicing then you know you haven't earned your way onto the floor with these guys and I'm not sure the players I would love to know they're genuine feelings do they actually want to play with James Harden if they can't get a deal done immediately so I think a lot of this also has to come down to how much confidence do the Sixers have in their ability to retain Joel embiid because their path forward with hardened they can be a lot more patient if they know that indeed's gonna be out the door soon anyway so if they're going to have to trade him eventually then who cares about keeping him happy and let's just make sure we can maximize the return for both of these guys if you want to keep him beat happy and you want to actually get off to a good start this season and not have a headache and you're you're top star just gruntled you're going to have to move off of James Harden quickly so how they handle this is I think a pretty good tell of how they view their relationship with indeed yeah we'll keep you posted you know the rest of the Pod if any more news breaks on James Harden but again for Fantasy purposes get them out of the lineup sounds like he's not going to play in the Sixers first two games Brandon you texted me this morning and you know you said yet you wanted to talk about some kind of situational strategy when it comes to you know NBA bets whether those are team or player Focus so I would give you the floor now you know we have a big betting slate to break down we're not going to go game by game or anything here since we got 12 games but you talk about some of these these you know situations that you're looking at when you're looking for you know kind of pairing down a slate like this to find games or props to Target so for in this isn't I have I have five typical situational spots that I look for and none of it is you know that I follow like it's the Bible in terms of everything is is Case by case but there are five situations that I Target throughout the course of the Season that that have been pretty profitable for me in terms of night one none of them apply because a lot of the these deal with the Ebbs and flows of an NBA season for tonight I think it's pretty basic if you if you think there's an edge for a home team take a take them against the spread home teams in their season opening game where the energy is never going to be higher legs are never going to be fresher tonight is the night to do it so I like the magic minus four against the Houston Rockets the Knicks plus three and a half against the Boston Celtics for that same reason the Memphis Grizzlies do a lot of people are sleeping on because of no John Morant the Pelicans looked uneven in the preseason that's plus one for the Grizzlies at home tough place to play the Jazz going up against the Kings I even like the Spurs so I mean I I feel like it's pretty basic in terms of the way I would handicapped tonight your thoughts on that before I move on and just generally looking at season opening at home I just love backing that sort of energy for the most part yeah I mean it went for one line or one and one last night right Warriors weren't really able to to conjure that up but you know kind of a unique situation without poorly they shot the ball and obviously the Nuggets were were feeding off of that ring night crowd but that's that's kind of a different ballgame and I think especially when teams are undervalued though it's not something you know just play it clean across the board but yeah you know team like Memphis right now I of course I don't undervalue the magic I cover the team but I think a lot of people nationally do and over rating the Houston Rockets the Spurs I don't know how maybe as a team undervalued I think more it's about fading Kyrie and Luca as a combination  well that's good that's what I want to do to go back to and you know that'll be the late game on ESPN Tonight early game I believe is Celtics Knicks so believe it or not we're getting a national look at Wendy right away Dallas four-point favorites on the road are you is this like a singular spot where you like the Spurs or in general are you a little bit higher on this team and think with women Yama there'll be more competitive yeah I do think they're going to be a competitive team I love the season opening new energy aspect so it's kind of hard to put a value on that but I do think there's something to it and frankly Kyrie Irving and Luca we don't have a I haven't seen yet the official report on on Luka playing tonight in some ways I like the Mavericks in the Lionel move if Luke doesn't play Kyrie has been winning games with this Mavericks team when he is the Lone Star Lucas has been winning games at this mads team when he's the Lone Star we what we have not seen yet is these two stars coming together and winning games in the line and ends up inflated when they play together because you've got two stars on the floor so if they're playing tonight and the line stays at four or even moves to like plus five for the Spurs I have to take that and the sprinkle on the money line too I'm just gonna  fade those guys because they're going to be overvalued based on their name value  yeah another interesting line to me Chicago 2.5 favorites at home against okay see everybody loves the Thunder this year yeah see that's where it's not it's not Universal in the way that I approach this I think this Bulls team is largely just sort of dead in the water I would say take Chicago but I have no interest in betting my hard-earned American dollars on the on the Bulls when I do have so much belief in OKC this year so I can't fade the thunder right out of the gate I've got too much belief in what they can do this year  yeah me too I think that's a if you're looking to Target a road dog tonight that was one that I would look at for sure you know we'll get our first look at Zion in a regular season setting and quite some time Pelicans on the road at the Grizzlies it feels like these teams play like 15 times a year like they're I don't know like they do there's like a really weird analogy to make but they feel like these are like an AFC North battle the Pelicans in the Grizzlies like these are kind of like mirror image teams exactly some reason oh then you just nailed it because if two teams in the AFC North were playing wouldn't you just blindly take the home Underdog so that's like a Steelers Browns game I can't explain why but hopefully people understand what I mean I completely get it you know but that's why Memphis is the play tonight and that regard and Pelicans  I just I don't think that they figured out exactly how they want to fit Zion into the mix yet Valentina should have himself a nice game tonight but by and large I like Memphis so I've got my my Five Spot plays I'll go I'll go one by one and if you want to jump in that's fine or I can go all the way through but I'll give you some space here to comment  five favorite spot plays throughout the course of the season one is I fade Stars returning off of injury especially if they've been out for over a week so this isn't a star missed one night because of load management and then they're right back in the lineup I'm talking about an extended week two week month absence and then the star comes back usually it takes time to reintegrate them sometimes the team themselves even finds a Groove without that player there's they develop some new form of chemistry and more than anything when the star returns it always inflates the line and usually they're not great right out of the gate so in the NBA regular season watch these Ebbs and flows Stars returning to the lineup after extended absences I usually fade that team  yeah I I'm not gonna push back on that too much at all I think you know for opening night purposes you know it's difficult to translate that but yeah over the course of the Season no question and unfortunately there's going to be a lot of those situations I think that pop up you know I think we set the NBA record last year for you know most instances of a major star returning from a an absence of more than seven to 10 days so that's a good note what else you got up so conversely these two kind of go hand-in-hand I would bet teams when the star players announced out in the line shoots up so for one you get value of extra points in your favor when the star player is announced that they're not going to play It's a one-off situation though this is not if a player is missing night after night players usually step up in the absence of a star so if you it's a game time call and the star player is out the line is going to move away from that particular team you get extra value there this doesn't work for extended stretches but teams tend to play over their head players lesser players play a better version of basketball in a one night situation where they've got to overcompensate for the lack of a star so if the Bucks who've been rolling with yanis all the sudden Giannis can't play The Line will move in the direction of the opposing team jump on the Bucks again this is  Case by case but that's usually one that I look for  yeah and again that's the type of instance that you see all the time throughout the regular season and for me it would be a little bit more opponent dependent you know if you're playing a mid to lower level team then yeah you can kind of see the Bucks you know finding a way to to kind of continue that rolling without us although I mean that might be a tough example this year because I don't I don't know that the Box have quite as much you know bench infrastructure around him as they have in years past yeah Joel I remember playing that spot last year a number of times when Joel embiid would miss a game and and then the Sixers would step up you'd see the role guys play really well so that's something to look for don't automatically discard a team because the star is out sometimes you as long as you get that good closing line value that's where the value is home dogs off of a road loss assuming that the road trip was short and that part is really important because you don't want fatigued underdogs at home this works pretty much in every sport home cooking off of a loss teams tend to lock back in after losing so pretty simple formula that's one that you could follow early on not a factor tonight but as the week progresses that's one to keep an eye on the length of a road trip matters for teams that go on extended road trips like four or five games I usually fade them that first night back home it's the most human element of the NBA it's the most distracted time for NBA players all season it's  even better when you do this during the holidays reconnect with friends reconnect with family and then boom all the sudden I've got a game tour about and I'm Road tired those teams I tend to fade that's a profitable spot too as someone who needs like five holes to warm up after driving like 45 minutes to play golf I completely I completely empathize with this you're totally right and I think a lot of these will be will be great to keep in mind as the season rolls along do you have any any spots that you really like on tonight's late  so I I mentioned a couple of those home teams the Memphis Grizzlies on the the magic tonight going up against the Houston Rockets I think that team could struggle out of the gate just to figure out sort of who shoots on that team and in terms of player props it's actually one of the reasons that I like the magic it correlates with a player problem playing on the other side jailing green under 22 and a half points scored tonight he was a volume monster the last couple of years I think that's going to take a tick down and we're gonna see his nightly number shorter than 22 and a half that's my prediction moving forward and it's a little high right now we're gonna see Fred Van Fleet get up a bunch of shots still in Brooks see how I'm in Thompson factors into the offense so I think that lines a little bit high and then Victor I saw his assist total over under was at one and a half I'll take the over on that all day all day um  you can find that at Underdog so if you pair that with something else that I'm actually pairing those two together Jalen green under 22 and a half and when Benn Jama over one and a half assists we saw during the preseason it's one of the things that I like the most about his game that doesn't but we did see some highlights the his ability to distribute through traffic he's gonna get a lot of guys involved the defense will collapse on him he's going to get multiple assists tonight so I feel great about that one as long as the jailing green one can come through I think the Wimbledon Yama assist prop is is pretty much a lock I'm not taking too many side tonight in terms of the the matchups I like to play these Ebbs and flows of the NBA season it's really just to sit back and observe night more than anything else so a couple of props a couple of home a couple of home teams in their season opener and then I'll just sit back and enjoy it I love the women Yamaha call that that's a Preposterous line I really that's that's the one thing I've been more impressed than anything with with manyama it's like a lot of the stuff we kind of expected to some degree you'd seen flashes of it you know the shop blocking the length the finishing that almost doesn't look real sometimes with like how little he has to jump or extend just to dunk the ball but the passing like that was that was in the in the in summer league in Vegas you know when it when it kind of felt like the rest of this game was a little bit shaky like the passing to me was something that really jumped out like that was not really discussed all that much as part of his his player profile you know coming into the draft process but he is above average Pastor for someone of that size so yeah I think you know by default he's gonna probably have you know five six seven potential assists and just got to convert a couple of those to go over I was looking at the the over two and a half threes for Larry marketing I think that's a guy that picks up where he where he left off last season it's just pretty heavily to the over for good reason he averaged three made threes per game a year ago but that's one that I think you know could be could be bumped up into like more Elite territories like the the best three-point Shooters on the Slate are usually three and a half as they're over under you know getting that at two and a half is great for now good matchup against the kings that should be a back and forth game and you know I was talking about this I took Market in in my NFP KC draft the other night was talked about it on the live stream which I just talked for 90 minutes straight kind of to myself like there are some people leaving comments but it was overwhelmingly just me you know just staying whatever I want yeah dream you know something I had really thought about you don't really hear about with marketing is like all right we have one sample of him being you know one of the 25 to 30 best fantasy players in the league and we have five years of him just being like a pretty average player  is it fair to assume that the guy he was last year was just who he's going to be going forward for the sake of my team I hope the answer is yes but I want to get your opinion on that oh I I think that that's the case that when he found he found himself a home in Utah and they used him perfectly I think that his it took him a minute to to grow into who he was gonna be in the NBA and then we see this all the time and sometimes it takes finding the right spot in order to completely unlock that he found that last year not a lot of change in terms of that line up outside of the addition of John Collins so yeah why not and I love that prop for tonight specialty at home crowd behind you going up against a bad defense he should be chucking up shots all right before we get out of here Brandon any any kind of like under the radar sneaky story lines that you're keeping an eye on tonight any like random you know rotation question any games on this slate that you know maybe aren't the obvious ones that you'll be keeping a very close eye on like I really want to watch the Blazers today I'm excited to see what they look like it gets the Clippers Thunder Bulls is gonna be a lot of fun like I'm excited to see you know year three of Scotty Barnes you can you can kind of pick out something from every game but what is catching your eye  yeah I mean this one is definitely not under the radar but I want to see this new look Celtics team I want to see what porzingis and Drew holiday look like in a real game that matters totally a tough road game I actually kind of like the Knicks plus three and a half I don't know that I'm willing to play it but I'm at least willing to say that I like it the next tend to play the Celtics stuff and the Celtics are coming in so overhyped what are they going to look like out of the gate so it's far from under the radar but I think that this team has the potential to lead the NBA in regular season wins how good do they look right out of the gate and then you know I'll be at the Magic game tonight so curious to see obviously what they look like but there's a lot of continuity with that roster so it's really just about playing to the level that I think they're capable of which is slightly above 500 I want to see what I'm in Thompson looks like and Kim Whitmore when games actually matter what more was a summer league star but I'm really excited to watch those two play and I actually later on today on my show I'm gonna talk to the overtime Elite general manager a demon Wilkins who ran the show for the team that amen and also played for so curious to get his thoughts on what those guys bring to the table they seem like special players so I'll have my eye on both of them tonight but up close and personal with amen  I've been pretty impressed with how those guys have looked starting in summer league when we saw limited action out of a man but in the preseason as well like I I think we there was kind of this General perception of the overtime League it's like all right what the heck is this is this just like a professional AU team like who are these guys playing again but they're doesn't look like there's been you know this like jump up and competition where these guys are drowning like they they look the part they absolutely passed the eye test so far so I really excited to see what both of those guys look like I'm I'm a little bit higher on a sar for Fantasy just because I think he's in a better position you know obviously being that they are twins they have very similar skill sets and very similar you know strength said deficiency is but I think a sour has a clear path to you know seeing 25 to 30 minutes both States whereas there's there's still a lot of overlap on this Rockets roster between green Thompson Brooks you know Whitmore you mentioned like they still got guys like Reggie Bullock Jay Sean Tate tari Eason hanging around on the wing as well so very happy to see how that rotation shakes out yeah I I'm I'm really excited about being at that game tonight because if I were sitting back at home as just an NBA nerd what's my league pass game of the night I think it would be magic Rockets speaking at this completely objectively just these two teams with all of the young talent that both of those rosters have the complete unknowns with the Houston Rockets and the additions that they made I met doca back on the sidelines there's so many interesting little storylines that aren't going to get The National Pub but for NBA France there's a lot of intrigue with this game  all right well and on this what would you say is your your worst game of the night the game that you were at least interested in for me we got some candidates like Hawks oh yeah Pistons Heat  Wizards Pacers with without a doubt I will avoid as many Wizards games as I can this year and Pacers see I kind of know what they are you know they're a team that's gonna they'll fly up and down the court that they'll probably score a lot of points they don't play a lot of defense and I'm sure how Albert and I'll have himself a great night tonight but I have no interest I have no need to have that on a screen at any point tonight yeah to make another like really forced egregious NFL reference like this this is like getting like Giant in commanders week won Sunday Night Football well thankfully this is Sunday Night Football means that's the only game that you can watch you've got plenty of other options if I don't know where you'd have to be where this is your only option tonight yeah I yeah I guess you just have to be in Indiana or DC and have access to nothing but local television I I'm interested in both these teams I don't want to deal with them too much I just I'm not interested in them playing each other like I have curiosity about the Pacers I want to watch Albert know I want to see math in the starting lineup you know the Wizards have a lot of interesting pieces for Fantasy but know that not together this is too much all right we got to cut it off here Brandon we got things to do we got a big 12 game slate to prepare for want to thank you for for taking the time as always looking forward to
