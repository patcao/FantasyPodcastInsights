all right that was a lot of talking to begin the episode and let me ask you how are you what's going on in your life I'm doing great coasting along I feel like the month of January has lasted three full months I can't tell you exactly why I think it's just you know you try and ramp yourself back up it takes a couple of days maybe even a couple of weeks and  and then before you know at the month is over so this is a this is where I'm at that is that that's my old man take of I think as you get older you just feel like  you feel like sometimes these months just drag along and you'll see you'll get there  old are you I can't  I'm 38  okay I am 31 so all right yeah I guess I guess technically if we're going you know by that scale technically an old man there's probably people watching being like no not at all I would  look like a young 38 I would have guessed like 34  that's great thank you I appreciate that but no good the weather's been amazing here in in Florida so I mean the fact that I'm I'm wearing a sweater I get to I get to rock these about you know four times a year so always a good time yeah I mean I I escaped to Arizona last week actually write a big trip so yeah man we played a lot of golf out there played 54 holes in two days which was fantastic played like the worst two holes of my life to start and I had like a mini panic like did I just forget how to play golf like it was like embarrassingly bad like you know pulled out my seminar and hitting the ball like 35 yards so maybe that's what happens when you haven't swung in a month and a half you get off a plane the range is closed and you just have to walk up to the first tea when you're paired with two strangers and just Tee It Up and see how it goes but yeah we all tell you off are Brandon I will just say we were paired up with the wildest two men Duo I have ever played with in my life like you know can I be with anybody else kind of away I in a fun way I guess for them in a in a dangerous way in some ways for us it was it was not I mean they were they were nice guys but let's just say they were they're doing some things on the course that I would not ever partake in or advise so that made for an interesting experience but the next day was a lot more chill you know we played we got paired up with like this 70 year old guy who spent his whole life working as a land surveyor in Alaska could not have been more chill could not have been more of just a classic golf Guy where do you stand on that no you're not as big of a golfer as me but I am a staunch I do not want to be paired up like I wouldn't I would never be that guy that's like oh you know you run into somebody and you're like oh just join our group like no I want to either be by myself or with my friend's I am with you one hundred percent it is one of in this is probably not good not a good reason to stay away from the course especially in the state that I live in where they are really available in the weather is usually accommodating for it when it's not raining but that's one of the things that keeps me away from the course I don't have friends that I would routinely go golfing with so and I have no problem going by myself but I live in fear of being paired up for  a day with somebody that I don't know  and by the way so the weather has been so great I did go out to the driving range last week I am not a golfer I own I have a golf set it was handed down to me I have never purchased golf clubs in my life and I thought you know what these are pretty crappy I'm gonna go into the clubhouse and see if I could get myself right I'm gonna get myself a new driver I don't pay 800 dollars yeah I I said so how much is this one and the guy goes 5.99  and I'm like there's no other thing five dollars and ninety nine cents so  I was like I meant for the just that club I'm not talking about the whole bag and he said yeah I don't know how you go do it that is insane I know I know I don't want to spend too much time on golf I will say I'm not I'm not like a big equipment guy I'm not a you know upgrade the driver every year it's a you know on a need basis I don't I would love to you know someday be in that position where I can you know drop 10K on clubs every couple of years but can I let me ask you something before we get to the very important basketball news is somebody who has purchased clubs  you know  I think you probably do well for yourself but you're not a millionaire and you know you don't you don't know that  that is true I don't technically have no idea what you've got in your bank account but when you when you first went to go make that purchase yeah were you just like forget it I know that this is this is gonna cost a lot I'm gonna deal with mm-hmm what I have to incur here and then live with it or did you like go the back Channel Craigslist Facebook Marketplace route how did you really hard to make that jump yeah yeah I have a bargain hunter so I did not I definitely did not pay full price but I don't want I didn't want like you know I bought a new driver last winter so I you know you get the end of season sale you buy a model year behind right basically right after the new models come out they'll drop the previous models by like 200 bucks so I think I paid three hundred maybe 350 for a one year previous model driver a ping and it was worth it to me I mean I play enough golf it was worth it I've had my irons for a long time like you know seven eight years at this point so you know that's I have trouble spending a lot of money on anything but golf is where I will I will make an exception to that rule all right here we got a good question in the chat and this pertains to what we wanted to talk about obviously if you were watching in the late window last night you saw Joel embiid writhing in pain shouting out in pain as Jonathan kaminga kind of jumped for a loose ball they're actually a couple of these you know Draymond got tangled up with a bead earlier in the game kind of dovet his knee I don't think that was malicious yeah I know there's some tweets going around like Audrey mine wasn't going for the ball I actually think he was and he just kind of tipped it away at the last second so I don't you know doesn't really get the benefit of the doubt but in that situation I don't think he was in the wrong but comica you know kind of landed on him beats need just a one of those freak plays where to me it looked like you know and Beads knee kind of got smashed into the floor he's gonna get an MRI today we will see it certainly to me it didn't look that bad in person but you never know either way Joel would be just very much in danger of dropping out of the MVP race and our guy Matt brings up an interesting question here is the 65 game minimum rule for NBA awards helping or hurting us in fantasy feel like it's forcing players to play hurt and play few minutes I think everybody had that thought last night right where and B ends up playing and almost feels like he was pressured into it right like all the tweets around the NBA World yesterday are like man if he misses this game he's only got four left before he's he's ineligible I don't know how much that factored in for indeed you know obviously is this time already this season you know he missed a couple days before this he wanted VP last year I don't know if it's as important to him this year as it was a year ago but this is an interesting kind of rub to this NBA rule which I I was in favor of right I think you know the resting and whatnot got so out of hand the last couple of years that it felt like the NBA had to do something and you know one of the unintended consequences now is like if you're a borderline player like a beef who has the numbers to be the MVP are you now pushing to stay in contention when maybe you shouldn't be out there what would say you yeah I say good I mean I don't want to see anybody get hurt but what you just explained of a guy feeling pressured to go out and play good that is what you're supposed to feel when you're a professional athlete you're paid handsomely to do it there are fans that are dying to see you in attendance and your teammates need you in every other sport we applaud that in the NBA we've gotten to the point where we go man it's like caution over everything and I'm so tired of it I see it all the time so yeah it it's unfortunate that we are in a season where the clear cut MVP is Joel embiid and yet he probably won't end up eligible for it that stinks maybe they can go back and and change the the requirement maybe 65 is too much and disqualifies people that would still be worthy but overall the like the pressure that it puts on players I think is a good thing and the league is winning in that regard even if a player did get hurt  I had to agree with that and you know it's not like Joel and bead came out in the first quarter and you know hobbling around and his knees clearly initiated like he you know he lived off after the Commando play but that was you know that I don't think that had anything to do with the previous knee injury he just happened to get his knee kind of landed on right like I don't I don't know if we can draw through line on that one necessarily but you know it's certainly found like a bead you know he's aware he's not on social media he's aware of what people are saying about this I you know I I don't know that we necessarily need this hard disqualification like you cannot win MVP if you play 63 games like I just I wonder like how many people are gonna vote for indeed if he puts you know let's say you finishes at 58 games played with these numbers and the 65 game rules not in place like I do think in general if you missed that many games you're probably just not going to get votes anyway you know like obviously a need you know you almost won Rookie of the Year playing like 29 games his first year but that was a unique situation I think he was going up against like what Malcolm Brogden and like Michael Carter Williams or something I think with how competitive MVP is right now like if you have  like Janis Luca sga's those guys are all playing around 70 games and a bead plays 54 games I just I think that's gonna kind of work itself out anyways so we'll see the NBA's always been flexible with this stuff I don't think this is just something that set in stone now forever but speaking of a beads odds a week ago plus 120 to win MVP after last night he's now 15 to 1 I wouldn't bet it I would not bet it like the chances of him missing five more games the rest of the way you know could happen in the next two weeks right and yeah I mean there's no way you can bet Joel embiid right now he's got there's too much time left in the season you got the injuries still set to get an MRI he could be disqualified with just this diagnosis never mind whatever is to come in the future at the end of the year if they're seating is set or they're comfortable where they're at they could bench him and get ready for the postseason  he has what six games left to miss is that I believe that's the number he can only miss six more  five six because he played yes so that's not that many um we're not even at the All-Star break yet right but this is this is the reason why the NBA wanted to set a specific number you're right if you missed a certain number of games voters are going to use that against you but they're I think the NBA is trying to say let's not put the pressure on the voters here let's get the players back out there because the I think we would all agree the number one issue the NBA has over the last couple of years is load management and they're just trying to come up with different ways where they can mitigate that and they came up with this Rule and they came up with the you can't you can't bench to All Stars in a national televised game which is so goofy I know I mean never mind the fact that like the other day we had the nuggets and the 76ers go back to indeed and bead was announced inactive 15 minutes before tip-off as was tired Tyrese Maxey who isn't an All-Star yet so technically the 76ers didn't break the nationally televised rule but come on they did it's just that technically by the letter of the law they didn't I think I think the NBA not to get too far off track but they need to adopt more of an NFL rule where you know for a fact 90 minutes before kickoff who is available and who is not none of this oh he went around he did shoot around  five minutes before tip-off and we decided that he's not good to go in a freak accident okay but he got to get away from that it's just yeah it's it's tough it's tough for people in in our world and you can't shy away from it if you're gonna show us gambling ads during your product then  you kind of have to cater to that audience fantasy and sports Bettors are and left out in the Lurch when it comes to this stuff yeah you're right and you know of course if Kevin Durant slips on the floor five minutes before the game starts and twist his knee like and that situation of course he's not going to blame but no I I would not be surprised if you know a few days from now we get the you know some sort of nominal fine for the Sixers for the way they handle the indeed situation at least Maxie was on the injury report I think I think the big issue is that a bead was cleared from the report Nick nurse said pregame yeah I think he's gonna play you know I have no reason not to believe that like I don't I don't even think Nick nurse was complicit in this I think he actually thought it was gonna play and then you know like you said 15 minutes before tip-off he ends up being scratched so yeah at least got to put him on the report you got to put the possibility out there that he could not play for sure we'll see again MRI coming for Joel and bead today if we get any news you know the next half hour so we'll of course pass that along by the way I get before he moved on I I found an interesting stat that was curious just did a quick Google search on this the least amount of games played by a player to win NBA  MVP  you'd actually have to go back to a time where we didn't think this was an issue at all 1998 or maybe that was a strike here yeah okay that makes sense 49 games played by Karl Malone okay scratch that of recent memory there you've had two players that have not hit the 65 game threshold that have won MVP Giannis in 2019 and LeBron James in 2011 everybody else has played at least 65 games yeah well 2011 was also a strike here right where the season started late and I think it was a 66 Game season oh there you go yeah right yeah so yeah this is so really it's one an embed one last year he met the threshold that rule was in existence he played 66 games last year so yeah maybe  this is and this is important information to know when you start to form your own opinion of what the NBA should do 65 looks like a pretty good number because we just don't have a lot of examples of guys winning the MVP outside of strike Seasons apparently but even the artists example I think that was the covid short season when they played 702 games right so I mean there's just there's really no precedent for it in a in an actual 82 Game season oh yeah you're right right yeah so there's great well look I I follow the MBA let's let's just say that good point here too before we move on by Matt that Tyreese Halliburton could lose 40 million in bonus money which I agree with Matt I mean I we saw it last night I mean this was kind of a crazy move Pacers were down big to Boston they rally back in the third quarter it was like a 3-point game and then we get an announcement with a minute left in the third quarter that Albert and is on a minutes limit and will not play the rest of the game Pacers ended up keeping it closed you do Wonder of course do they win that game of Halliburton plays and it's like that's going to continue for at least a few more games and you got to you know in order for Halbert to get that 40 million dollar bonus needs to make all MBA and you can't make all NBA if you don't play at least 65 games and you also the other caveat here is you have to play at least 20 minutes per game in those 65 so there's there's kind of like a minute's threshold that's tied into this as well anyway enough load management talk I want to talk about the Nicks real quickly they're down two starters they're down Julius Randle I would think at least through the All-Star break you know I think it's actually as far as good timing to dislocate your shoulder you know when you got an eight-day break built into this timetable kind of a good time for it to happen you would hope he'll be back in late February they've been without OG and an Obie for these last two nights as well played it back to back on Monday and Tuesday came away with two wins over Charlotte and Utah we've we saw them you know start precious to chewa next to Isaiah hartenstein Josh Hart moved into the starting lineup that's a demon shenzo has been on fire these last two games 28 against Charlotte and then 93 pointers last night in that win over Utah and as we expected you know Jalen Brunson has obviously been the heart and soul this team all season but without really his Randall stepping up to an even larger degree and you know she was somebody I was telling Alex on Monday I paid up for him in stately I you know I think I put five or six bucks in out of 100 dollar budget which is dwindling for me as  this year goes along I'm really hoping that pays off you know if I can get a month of a precious to you know giving me 12 points and 8 rebounds and a couple blocks per game I think that's gonna be super valuable and play 40s last night yeah Tom Thibodeau Biggs are always going to be a factor just the way that they play that kind of clang and bang style and precious Ochoa is a big physical body that can take advantage of situations like this surprised the rebounding totals haven't been higher but I love what you're seeing in terms of the scoring department and I don't blame you helping to keep a red hot Nick steam the float it's amazing sometimes you get these teams that they just catch fire and it almost doesn't matter who is in and out of the lineup they have they just have it rolling right now in New York and there's solidifying their spot they're they're playing so well they're probably gonna end up a top 14 in the east at the end of the day yeah they have not missed a beat man and you know I think when you lose someone like Randall you're not a better team but I think they can be a better defensive team without him and I think the the benefit to losing a player for like a month as opposed to a season ending injury is you get more Reps for some of these guys you're gonna need later in the season right it's like I don't know if it's really a bad thing it's like all right pressures you up this is your time you're playing 35 minutes at night for the next month Josh Hart you're doing the same you played 43 last night I mean that's part of that is just tips being Tibbs but you know you're getting guys a little bit more seasoning you know they've had to you know hands more minutes to Jericho Sims miles McBride has been in the mix quit and grinds playing more minutes as well and I think that could pay dividends later in the year you know what push really comes to show of let's talk a little All Star here Brandon and we had the starters announced this past week Thursday Janice and bead Tatum Halliburton Lillard in the east no major surprise there although I thought it would be Bronson Overlord I thought narrative wise it's really felt like brunson's had the better season I thought he was more deserving to be honest but you know it's Damian Lillard can't really quibble too much about that in the west LeBron KD yokich dosage SGA again no surprises there although you know I listen to a ton of PODS and read a bunch of stuff as you do I was surprised how many people are like yeah I think LeBron might not even make the game yeah it's like if he had not been voted in which you know he was leading vote getter for like the feels like the 20th year in a row I think there are people that were prepared to leave him off given where the Lakers sit in the standing but we knew we knew in the west specifically the battle for the starting spots would be insane you know obviously Kawhi Leonard super deserving I think he's a shoe in you know to make it as a reserve but it's gonna be really really interesting to see where those spots end up going to have like six seven eight guys in the west to I would say in a quote normal year or maybe a more diluted NBA would be shoes for this yeah the the snubs list articles are gonna get a lot of clicks this year you have some good ones I think in both conferences but certainly in the west the NBA media nerds and I'll put us in that group too have to remember what the All-Star game is all about LeBron James as long as he is playing well will be an All-Star until the day he retires as he should be he is what the All-Star game is all about and that's why I'm not going to quibble too much about him being a starter but if you want to get technical with it then it teammates should be the the starting front Court player that represents the Lakers not him Anthony Davis is played more games he's got better averages he's a better Defender so Davis to me would be the starter but it's LeBron James so I think we should all quickly get over that what happens with some of these bench guys and do and for the similar reasons even though it's year one of his career can you find a way to wedge victima into the All-Star game that's  probably they're probably not enough spots but I mean his numbers are ridiculous and his popularity is off the charts so when you start to combine those things statistically it's not crazy and in terms of the notoriety that would bring to the game which is what it is all about at the end of the day I wonder if he becomes part of that conversation he's in the conversation no question I just think it's too competitive this year for somebody on literally the worst team in the Western Conference to get in I mean he has the numbers he's been as advertised I think in some ways he's been better than advertised if there was ever a rookie who was going to do it and in general like even the best rookies have a really tough time making the All-Star games like you know LeBron had as much hype as anybody coming in he didn't make the All-Star Game his rookie year I don't think it's happening I just I don't think you can justify it on a 10 and 3017 which is not women yamas fall by any means I think he had to be I think he would have had to be voted in and he was he was 8th  in the fan vote in the Western Conference and look you know LeBron yolk kitchen KD it's like those guys are going to out vote him no matter what but I just I think it's too competitive yeah you look right now it's like  Minnesota they have three deserving all stars I think they I think they might only get one you know I think Edwards makes it I don't know I mean go bare we'll get some votes he could be maybe the last guy in I don't really think towns has the ton of support right now you know Jamal Murray is deserving in Denver I don't think he gets in either okay see there's been some Jalen Williams All-Star buzz you chat homegrown is in the mix as well I don't think either those guys make it I think Kawaii and Paul George are deserving I mean why for sure and you know I think Paul George is actually been super underrated so far the season I think both of those guys get in I think you have to choose one of the Kings guys  it's probably sabonis for me yeah I sure I hope will make it I think they're both deserving but then you get into you know Devin Booker kind of feels like he's gonna get a spot Anthony Davis is going to be a reserve you know marketing shangoo and then the really interesting one to me is Stephen Curry  I will be shocked shocked if Stephen Curry is not selected as a reserve but this is the shakiest case he's had and is in really in his entire career dating all the way back to like 2012  yeah but it's still Stuff Curry and he is he is helping he is the only reason why that Golden State Warriors team is still afloat look at what he was able to do last night knocked down 8:36 it's not like this guy's going anywhere so Curry I think Curry is a lock to be an old star Anthony Edwards I'd put him in that conversation as well do you get both Clippers guys in because then that opens up a spot Paul George and Kawhi Leonard probably both All Stars they've been Booker it would be a lock and Anthony Davis and so you really only have about two spots to quibble about when it comes to all those other names that you just mentioned yeah so my locks would be Davis Kauai George Curry and Edwards and that's that's more when I say lock that's like what I think will happen not necessarily who I would pick although I would have those guys so you're right it's really two spots for you know I mean we haven't even talked about James Arden who I think is absolutely deserving and you know the Clippers surging to 30 and 15 and you know knocking on the door of the three seed in the west I think helps his case again I don't think the Clippers get three but  wouldn't surprise me again Harden deserving so you get two spots for you know hardened Kyrie Foxx sabonis Booker Murray shengwen if you want to throw weapon llaman in there you can towns go bare you know I don't think Jaron Jackson really has a case obviously nobody in Portland has a case you know New Orleans is an interesting one because you know they're they're sitting in a right now they're five games over 500 I just I don't I don't think anybody's had a good enough individual season you know ziya has been good Ingram's been good and McConnell has been good they'll just have been good  I just don't know if I need those guys have the statistical case right yeah and you I mean the NBA would love to get Zion in the All-Star game but there's the there's just way too much competition for that it is tough because do you do you look at this through the lens of it's just simply the most deserving and that's it that's the period end of sentence or is it most deserving with the most fan appeal this is still an All-Star Game this is not an all NBA list and that's where I go back to somebody like women Yama if you're trying to tell the story of the first half of the season and do it with the biggest stars that have played well enough to where it's not a joke if you let them in like it would have been if Jeremy Lin was an All-Star back when he went off with the Knicks right  that's where  I'd have a hard time leaving him but now I'm off if I were among the folks that vote for this um  but but sabonis I think sabona should be in both of the Clippers guys so it really comes down to that like that go bare spot there's really one spot for me where I have no idea what they're gonna do and it would be between Rudy gobert so bonus deer and fox Victor 1 banana  Laurie marketing like though that would kind of be my group  I think I don't think marketing had quite has the case it was fun as a jazz had been for the last month I if you guys are late too yeah I would I would rather see foxes to bonus in I think those guys are deserving I don't think you could really knock the team record the stats have been incredible I mean it just it really feels like both of those guys are having All-Star caliber season so that's where I would lean the East to me I'd like to say it's a little more straightforward but I still think those like those last two spots are all going to be interesting you know I think like Jalen Brown's in Jalen Brunson absolutely has to be in and you're at seven Donovan Mitchell 8 Maxey nine that is where I draw the line as far as guys that have to be in  after that you know the heat get somebody is it out of Bio is it Butler you know both both guys have kind of missed time I would probably lean out of Bio feels like Miami gets one you know follow back hero I think I think he's got a chance here you know I think if we had taken the vote like a month ago he would be a lock but I think he's got a pretty good chance you know DeMar DeRozan's in the mix Trae young I have no idea like he he finished pretty high in the you know in the initial voting he was four oh yeah or number two number two in the fan ranked number six in the player and the media ranks so that's ultimately what did him in but you know very young still very popular despite being a little more polarizing and MBA circles and then he got you know Scotty Barnes Pascal caca as a couple of guys who could sneak in as well yeah I think Paulo gets in as somebody that is like it's easier to slide him in without debate with that Julius Randle injury when I was looking at this we've talked about this a lot of my sports show in Orlando how does Pollo get in because there's a there is that clogged with the seven bench spots Julius Randle getting hurt I think opens that door wide open and and then yeah you have that debate about the heat guys Jimmy Butler's the bigger star I still think that matters so I'll use the same argument Jimmy Butler is one of the it guys in the NBA's at a good enough year to this point to be in All Star without making a mockery of it so you put him in Tyrese Maxey has been amazing this season so if he's healthy you throw him in there as well Trey young I mean tree young got the fan vote that has to matter that stuff has to matter but I mean I think the Jonathan Murray has been a better player this year  but that stuff when you're when you're into coin flip mode  the fan vote I think should matter a lot and if fans want to see Trey young then Trey young should be in the All-Star Game power to the fans I don't know what to tell you okay yeah yeah I don't think that team success thing is going to be as big of an issue in the East because  you know I think it's pretty pretty obvious like who's gonna make it from the good teams and like you said Randall might you know Randall could get in and then you know that's about rolls over and becomes a replacement so it's you know kind of a wash as far as somebody like Bank hero you know whether he's actually technically in or just is the replacement for Randall but you know it's like Indiana's not getting more than one I don't think the Sixers have a case for anybody besides him bead and Maxi you know Jared Allen is in that discussion you could say maybe Brooklyn Lopez for the bucks I don't I don't really think either of those guys get in I think Alan probably would get in over Lopez and you know Miami doesn't necessarily feel deserving of two and you know Orlando don't think he's quite gonna be an All-Star this season all right let's answer a few questions here keep those come in in the chat guys we will continue to hit these as we finish up the pod  now says trade Katie question mark  we've gotten a lot of you know should I trade to Ranch and I trade Davis should I trade LeBron you know even Stuff Curry has come up in that discussion some of these veterans who've been injured and recent years for the most part you know the league I think this has been like a best case scenario Health season for a lot of guys who've been shaky in recent years like Kauai Paul George they played as many games as possible I think LeBron's only missed like four or five games on the year last night was only Anthony Davis's third Miss game of the entire season Katie is only missed seven you know he hasn't had one long absence it's been two games here two games here three games there and he hasn't missed a game you know since January 5th  I would probably continue to try to ride this out with KD I mean if you if you're trading him like any Elite player you got to be getting a pretty big package back right like you're either trading him straight up for another top 10 guy or your packaging you know two borderline elite players in your sending out coming to Rand I would just say you know if you're putting him out there if you're Kevin Durant owner and you're you're initiating that trade aim high aim high do not do not start with like oh I think they'll accept this like you know go maybe go a level up make somebody say no yeah I completely agree with that I I do think Kevin Durant is saving himself a little bit for the playoffs when you get to where he is and his NBA career you know at the regular season is it's just one giant tune-up and this team is good enough to win the championship with the talent they have so I see a Kevin Durant that he's playing and he's actually played more games than the other two in the big threes played more games than Devin Booker he's definitely played more games than Bradley Beal but when they're all out there I think he's comfortable taking a backseat role and that can impact things in the fantasy department but you know you don't need to go selling that to the person that you're trying to trade with so Nick is right he's still Kevin Durant he got a gotta have somebody that's willing to pay the premium for him  our guy Diya over in Indonesia he said you know what update can Brandon shout out from Indonesia appreciate the global reach of the wire fantasy basketball pod first of all I said his golf set was handed down from his dad no way he's paying for a new set he's just a casual on occasion golf for only  yeah golf is crazy expensive dude you want to like a nice full set we're talking like 5K so I'm with you on that that's I had no idea 38 years old this is the year that I learned it costs that much to own a new setting Club we're talking well you can get a nice set for cheaper in that but if you want you know if you want the new Titleist set yeah it's gonna cost you crazy  I did the also asks on the basketball side of things is Paul Reed now a musk grab  I you know I would obviously like to to wait for news on embed if this ends up being nothing and he's back in the lineup later this week you know their next game is tomorrow at Utah then they play Saturday against Brooklyn they do have a four game week coming up the following week but yeah if you're in a somewhat deeper League you know 12 team or above  probably I mean Paul Reed historically it's like in Les Joel and Beads out he can pretty much be ignored almost never plays enough minutes when it beats out there for him to matter but when it beats out I mean we've seen you know he had that big game against Denver over the weekend 30 and 13 with two steals I was really the game of his life by the best game he's ever played yeah the numbers haven't been like fantastic in the other games and beats missed like even factoring in that 30 and 13 game in 10 games that fall region started this season he's averaging 12 and a half points 6.7 rebounds two assists 1.2 steals 1.3 blocks very good you know definitely good enough that you want him out there but it's not like he's just a guaranteed like you know 20 and 13 without a beat every single night so if you're thinking Joel and beans Gonna Miss time and of course we don't know quite yet I would say yeah you know I think in mostly he's gonna go he's gonna be scooped up so if you don't grab him somebody else well yeah I mean he's definitely worth being grabbed but keep your expectations in check if you're just going I know that was a nationally televised game maybe we we all paid a little bit more attention to that one collectively against Denver that highlight spot on ESPN but that is not who Paul Reed is 21 shot attempts in that game the highest total he had reached in any other game this season was 12 so the there's just a volume Factor that's not typically there I don't know what got into those guys in Denver they almost won that game but just keep your expectations in check but yeah if indeed is gonna miss real time I think you have to you have to consider him a pickup  Pedro says the Randall status is weeks not months but should we expect at least four weeks  I would say yes I mean we're we're not injury experts per se but we  we've seen a lot of injuries over the years you know that's kind of how I came up at Road Aires just you know monitoring the newest wire you kind of get a sense for this stuff you know it's never a one-to-one comparison as far as all right just located shoulder that equals x amount of time but yeah I think four weeks sounds about right and that's factoring in the All-Star break keep that in mind so you know this week would be one week next week would be two weeks three weeks would be the week before the All-Star break when the next only have two games and then that fourth week would be coming out of the All-Star break when they also have two games you know teams resume play on that Thursday the 22nd so I think that's case he's back on the 22nd at Philly a you know worst case maybe it's it's like he's back for that fifth week at the end of everywhere but I don't I don't think we're talking months here for Randall you know I think teams  you know sometimes it could be a little optimistic when they hand out a timetable but I think you know if this was going to be a two to three month thing I think they would have told us so I'm I'm gonna base my opinion off that information and my guess is that he's back you know before the end of February so either that you know 20 seconds 24th 26 somewhere in that range yeah good news is a dislocated shoulders one of those injuries that once it's healed it's healed so you know it's it's not one of those things or you need a big ramp up period like some of those soft tissue injuries so I would say a month definitely prepare yourself for a month that sounds about right  yeah I think I think that's about what I would expect as well all right good question here from ABE he's talking about a point sleek and he asked quick question LeBron James for Jamal Murray and Cade Cunningham who wins that deal so anytime we get a points league question on Mondays out like to point out just do the math right I mean points leaks it can be a little bit more simple you know all leaks are different as far as you know what what point values you sign for each stat category but in category about percentages and stuff like that a board sleeves it's just kind of add up the fantasy points so so far this season LeBron James this is going off of the official mba.com scoring he's at about 48 fantasy points per game in points Cade Cunningham that about 38 Jamal Murray is at about 38 as well almost exactly the same production as cage so  in that story format that would tell you that Murray plus Cade is more valuable than LeBron  I'm skeptical though because you know  I we've seen enough evidence now over the years that LeBron is good for it  Jamal Murray is great in his role but this is very much Nicole yoke which is team and Murray stats can kind of Rise and Fall with what the team needs from him and Kate Cunningham plays on a piston team that we can't trust at all moving forward with how they're going to manage their business so yeah I'm a little bit nervous about what you're taking on when you have LeBron who based on the ranking I'm looking at total points he's eight in the in the league in terms of fantasy points scored this year I'm just not trying to trade that away right now I know he's gonna have his days or he doesn't play but it's LeBron James and if he's if he's healthy he's he's playing all right well disagree on that one I would take that trade I think at a points League I would do it in a category League I would think a little bit more deeply sfk 13 says hello from Australia what do you guys think about Maxi for Jalen Johnson  yeah I know Max is cooled off a little bit obviously he's injured right now Jalen Johnson looks great I would still rather have Maxi I think he's got a little more upside going forward you know we'll see if the Hawks make a change at the deadline you know there's a world in which jail Johnson you know kind of becomes the number two and maybe that's a little bit closer to the rest of the way but I I would still prefer maxi  yeah definitely want to keep Maxi on my squad and and more of an offence of load that'll be on his shoulders if Joel embed and ends up having a missed some extra time so he is like we just talked about a Bonafide All Star this year legitimately love Jalen Johnson and what he's been able to do this season but Tyrese maxey's the guy should I drop kaminga to take Ben Simmons off my IR today 10 team had to head Yahoo points League Matt is currently in first nice props to you Matt and I'm in a close matchup with the second place team I was streaming that spot before I picked up kaminga so it's basically who would you rather have kaminga or Ben Simmons and you know obviously in deeply both of these guys very roster bull you know Simmons if he plays like he did the other night even startable I mean can make us been been really good lately and he was good again last night against Philly 26/7 and 2 with three Steals and a block so I personally would stick with kaminga that is just me I don't really trust Ben Simmons at all to stay healthy you know again he looked great on Monday looked way better than I expected especially after the long layoff if he miraculously stays healthy he's probably the better option in a points league but I'm not really pumped out mingi right now man last time a game's 25 points 7 rebounds 1.3 steals about a half a block 61%  from the fields started to shoot it much better from three as well so this is a tough question but I would I would stick with Commando  yeah hard to look away from coming over right now and what he's doing part of that starting lineup for Golden State team that's trying to find life anywhere and it seems like they've found it in a guy that they invested a heavy draft pick in just a couple of years ago no chance I'm moving off of them like you said Ben Simmons maybe the least trustworthy player in the entire NBA what exactly are you chasing that that kaminga isn't giving you from from Ben Simmons  that's what I mean know a few more rebounds maybe well I mean Simmons again if he plays like he did in a one game sample on Monday he's a nightly triple double guy right I mean what do they have like just like 11 12 and 8 or something like that I mean it's it's a debate it's just matters how much you trust Ben Simmons in my opinion is that I do not trust him David says is Wiggins finally back to his old self in good to pick up  I mean he's he's having his best week and a half of the Season by a mile up 23 last night that was best scoring outputs and mid December last five games 18 points four and a half rebounds two and a half assists a steal in a block  I'd like to see a little more before we just say that he's like back but you know there were Rumblings early in the season that he was showed up out of shape you know maybe he had to kind of play himself into that condition  I would say in like a anything bigger than a 12 team League yeah you could you could definitely pick him up and even even in a 12 team member probably should be roster at this point is Ross roster rate is up to 66% on Yahoo  yeah feels like a roster will player but the the sample of him being really good again is very small so I would be willing to cut ties if he dips back to the seven four and one guy that he was not too long ago all right we'll hit a few more of these I got like two or three more minutes we'll go rapid fire here crowd silencer says what you trade giddy for trade Jones 10 team points League City you just can't be patient with giddy anymore  I think so yeah I mean if if the Spurs you know they're finally kind of doing the right thing with and then having a real point guard out there it's it's changed the calculus they've been more competitive women yamas look great ever since trade Jones entered the starting lineup  I think I would I would go and trade Jones I think he's giving you about the production you'd expect since you've been starting he's playing almost exactly 30 minutes a game you know you could argue that giddy maybe has a little more upside but we just haven't really seen that this year  yeah and maybe giddy gets more run if Jalen Williams is out for an extended period of time but I also don't know what the timeline is on that I'm with you I like the the shake up that pop has gone with with the Spurs team and and you know the assists are going to be there that's what he specializes in and and then he certainly got a big Target their down low well Clarkson or Sexton be traded at the deadline is it good to stash keyonte George prior to the deadline asks Albert I think it's more likely that Clarkson ends up being dealt I think he's the guy that rather part with you know Sexton's played well for really most of the season but especially the last month or so I think both guys have appeal right and just totally depends what you tell wants to do they're sitting in 10th right now and that's going to be a dog fight for really those like eight nine ten eleven twelve spots going down to the Warriors at 12 so if you talk you know I wouldn't be surprised if they just stand Pat and and kind of run with this unit it's not going to get a ton for Clarkson anyway but I think it's more likely of the two that Clarkson  yeah and you know I'm looking at Jordan Clarkson's contract situation this is a guy that would become an under strict of free agent after next year of course that helps in the trade department and and could also help the overall value that you get back if you're the Utah Jazz Colin Sexton has played himself into a role where I think he's part of what they would like to build their team around that's how well he's been playing but Clarkson does feel like the odd man out and and yeah I guess that makes the second part of the the question thumbs up in terms of stashing keyonte George because he would certainly be more of a factor yeah two more years left on Clarkson steel but it's you know it's two for 28 which is like a pretty big bargain at this point with where MBA salaries are going so I don't really see that as an albatross by any means all right couple more and then we're out of here Scarlett says Fox and Lively or Maxi so would you trade Fox and Lively for Tyrese Maxey in a nine category League  hmm um struggle with that one  I think I would keep fox in Lively  I think so too  yeah I mean foxy are like almost a dead even match up if you're just looking at Fantasy values so far this season and you know Lively ranks a little bit lower than you'd expect the free throw percentage kind of drags him down even though it doesn't take that many you know it wasn't blocking a ton of shots early on but yeah I think it's close enough between Fox and Maxi like I think I maybe would rather have Maxi but if you're saying that I have to give up Lively to get him that I would just hold those two  right and I would I would think without looking at it the the Derek Lively doesn't take a lot of shots that are that are far away from the rim so he's not you know he's not hurting you in terms of field goal percentage Yeah Lively by the way out tonight no Kyrene no Luca and no Lively for the Mavs so they take on the Timberwolves all right two more Scarlett also says Trey Murphy's he hold in nine category leagues  the answer to me is how deep is your league  14 and above maybe not or maybe then I would say yes sorry 14 or below or 12 and Below maybe not it's been a little disappointing you know that the palace was kind of have too many guys in some ways and you know he's still playing a decent amount of minutes but you know the usage hasn't really been there he's kind of three-point dependent you know he's 10 threes against Boston on Monday so it's like it's just a matter of is he is he going to pretend or is he going you know four for ten or five for nine which is in the rabbit possibility and given night the shooting has been cold lately you know he's under 30% and his last 10 games but  I do think in general and Scarlett says this is a 16 Team league I would hold him there he's going to be picked up for sure yeah this is a guy that does not get to the free throw line amazing outlier over the last month he had a game against the Dallas Mavericks about 15 days ago where he shot 12 free throws but not not a guy that gets to the line and when he does he doesn't shoot it at a high clip so that you know that would hurt you um and yeah just not what he was last year I think they needed him to step up and play a bigger role and that's just not what is called upon this year because they've been they've been fairly healthy all right here's a good one to end on from Pedro  can you tell me your top three stash players based on guys you feel are going to be traded so he gives us an example he said he's holding on Yucca Kung move of course hoping that Clint capela could be dealt I compel is going to be really interesting I think he should be traded I think it would make a ton of sense I you know it's like what team would be interested it's like would like who needs a big man right like with golden states entertain that you know they've kind of been needy at Center you look around at some of the other teams out west it's like I don't think the Clippers could really bring him in but certainly they could use a guy like that you know okay see team that would that would maybe use some Center depth but yeah man I'm holding a combo and like every long term League that I play in I absolutely love him I think that the time will come where that will pay off they gave an extension for a reason so he's he's a pretty good place to start I think the Hawks in general are a pretty good team to look at for for later season value you know I think Chicago would be another one like if Zach Levine gets dealt  you know obvious name I guess would be to Sumo but like even when he's played big Menace this year he's been pretty disappointing you know he's just kind of like a worse version of Jane Ivy to me but you know if you're handing him 35 Plus minutes of game you know I think then he becomes valuable so he be on the list for me you know the Jazz if they were to deal Jordan Clarkson I don't you know it's like I guess we'd see more keyonte George we kind of saw that early in the season we'll probably see more above you we'll see more tht I'm not really fired up about those guys  yeah it's you know it's tough to come up with a list on the Fly of the of the stash candidates but you know depending on how deep your league is if scoot Henderson is kind of on and off rosters a guy like that Malcolm Brogden I think is most likely gonna get traded and then you'll see scoot get a ton of minutes after that yeah  let's see what else you know I would throw and this is you know deep legs only you got to see it's like you know Nick Smith who's a you know first round pick Big Time High School Prospect you know somebody who kind of had like an up and down injured season at Arkansas if the Hornets turned into fire sale a team yeah Gordon Hayward you know miles Bridges basically anybody but lamelo and Brandon Miller I think could be on the table for them you know that's one of those guys that you could see maybe having a run at the end of the year but you know I think he's probably a more effective real life player than fantasy so you're digging a little bit deep there they're just they're really aren't that many sellers that's the thing right it's like I think in the west we just talked about there's 12 teams I want to make the playoffs right now it's like Memphis they don't really have anything to sell and they're basically down to their their young guys already talked about Portland I think Brogdon see obvious one scoot I think has his moment at some point later in the year I don't think really the Spurs have much to sell you know Washington's kind of stuck where they are Detroit I mean they're all Charlotte Chicago Atlanta Portland those are probably your big sellers in the NBA so if you just want to look at those rosters and see who would become available or who would step up in in the absence of who gets dealt you know you can look at that route the problem that I have with getting too deep into the weeds with that sort of projection of who would step up in another player's absence when it's not someone that's obvious like Malcolm Brogdon leaves they drafted scoot early obviously they're going to give him that role is you don't know who's coming back and so you could stash a guy that ends up getting you served from the guy that they just traded for you just you never know how these rotations are going to Bear out so well it is a Savvy thing to do to look ahead I think sometimes we can we can overthink it a little bit  Yeah the last two names I'll throw out before we go would be both Thompson's I think you know Detroit is a team that has first weird is this roster is you know they have a couple guys that you know Alec Burks for example Joe Harris who's not really been playing for them and then the most obvious one being bugged out of it you know if they were to part ways with him you know that's 33 minutes A Night That become available and I think I think we do see a late season assault Thompson Resurgence and then Houston to me you know they're on the borderline they could sell I don't think there'll be a buyer they could just stand Pat but you know you got I'm in Thompson you got Camp Whitmore you know both guys have looked pretty good when they've had a minute looked great yeah right yeah and it's like if I don't know the trip I don't think they really trade Dillon Brooks one I don't think there's a market for him too he just signed a contract you're not you're not trading Barry Smith I don't think they're trading Jalen green you know that was out there early in the season but he's played better lately we kind of kind of crazy to punt on him in my opinion but you know do they thin out that depth at all you know it is like you know Jay Sean Tate somebody like that you know Jeff Green veteran who's been playing a decent about a minute's even just removing like one of those guys from the Clutter I think could could help amen Thompson and even if they don't make a trade I think we see more men down the stretch just if Houston falls back and they're just kind of hanging around the plain Zone yeah you forget what kind of pedigree I'm at Thompson hat right I think the injury early on clouded you know kind of like he got off the slow start it was basically because you just didn't play in November and December and you know there's I think sky high expectations for this guy so both Thompson's our guys that I would keep an eye on as well Brandon good stuff is always man always appreciate love doing this pod with you every single Wednesday you could find us at 10:30 a.m. eastern right here on this stream your magic they're on the road right now they're at San Antonio tonight they play at Minnesota on Friday so I know you got a little bit of time off as far as being at the arena but enjoy those games man and looking forward to doing this next Wednesday
