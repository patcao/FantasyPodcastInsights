if you  welcome to a Wednesday morning LIVE edition of the road to wire fantasy basketball podcast Nick Whalen joined as always on Wednesdays by my guide Brandon Kravitz Braden we will talk about your Orlando Magic later in the Pod we haven't done a deep dive on the Magic in a while and they they deserve it man still a top three team in the Eastern Conference with Milwaukee right now at 16 and 7 we will discuss some of the Fallout from last night's pretty small Tuesday night Slade only five games so not a whole lot to say but you know we got some Draymond Green news we had the return of Bradley Beal we'll play a little head to head who would you rather roster the rest of the way and then of course later in the show as we always do we will take an answer as many live listener questions as we can so put those in the chat we're not ignoring them we will get to all of them later in the podcast how are you doing Brandon it's been a week so we've chatted fun NFL weekend a really fun football weekend coming up as well but looking forward to chat some hoops with you the yeah for sure I have like one I think one foot still in The Madness of this sports schedule and then the other foot is in the holidays of already had multiple get-togethers actually had a already yes sorry are you someone who's family does these like pre-Christmas gatherings  so I grew up in a Jewish family so Hanukkah has is already up and running we're on to night 7 tonight so that gets together is already happened so we're like the group PlayStation of Hanukkah yes whatever we're wrapping it up like we're about to hit the final four things are getting pretty serious my kid already has way too many presents good problem to have and then my my wife's parents split when she was young so she's got you know two sets of families that we were all between two different holidays three different sets of parents that we have to accommodate for December is pretty well taken care of every year so yeah I'm I've been all over the place and I actually had a radio commitment this past Sunday so I couldn't go to one of the get-togethers I had a Sunday with Red Zone by myself no wife no child I didn't even know what to do with myself I just started working on mewing issues like I'm not even a mechanic just so that I could feel better about the situation yeah I mean all all is good well I don't have a child I do have a wife but no child so that is that is basically my Sunday every week is you know pop down we got the two TVs go and we got the iPad going you know I'm some sort of random streaming website to try to find the Jaguars game I'm fighting through pop up ads every five seconds oh but man I love nothing more than a chill NFL Sunday and we got four of those coming up you know with no more teams on bye but anyway let's talk some hoops here Sons beat the Warriors last night 1916 Golden State's got major issues man you know watching this team it just you almost feel bad for Stephen Curry I mean he is now really for I guess you know they've had a couple down years you know over the last few since Durant left you know there was the one year where Curry got heard and everything kind of bottomed out but you almost felt like you know with curry missing so much time that was kind of a wash and obviously you know got them the number two overall pick which did not necessarily turn into a foundational piece but I mean really for the first time I feel like Curry is going through what like LeBron is gone through a few times so you think of that final year in Cleveland you know some of those early years in La where you're watching it they could man I mean this guy's still got it in his mid-30s and you know the players around him are kind of crumbling you know we're still waiting for Andrew Wiggins who went one of seven and 15 minutes last night to come around you know come on Looney his minutes have been all over the place you know Klay Thompson two of ten last night you see Steve Kerr kept Wiggins kept Thompson kept Looney on the bench last night would Golden State clawed its way back into the game and you know really it was kaminga branded podemski you had a huge game we'll talk about him in a bit those are the guys that kind of rallied Golden State and kept them in this game late but man the Warriors got big problems their 10 and 13 they need to find a way to to add some more reliable depth or swing some sort of trade I am of the belief that you know first of all if you try to trade Andrew Wiggins right now I mean his value is at the basement I don't know what you could even get for hip for him I don't think they want to trade clay I think I think that would be a really really tough decision and I also don't really know what you could get for clay at this point as well you know for a guy who seeking a big contract it would want that with another team I think prize that would be a disaster and then of course right and on top of all this Draymond Green takes a huge swing and I don't know if he meant to hit use of nerc edge if he didn't I don't know what he was doing with that arm what are we looking at for a suspension here I mean where what two weeks removed for him and coming back from his previous inspection for the gobert WWE takedown I mean this is this is just as bad as that and I think you know with everything compounding again he definitely he deflects in the post-game press conferences like well you know I didn't mean to do I didn't mean to swing my entire arm around and whack this guy in the head like a spin Ric Flair trap what is he talking about it was so weird too because like you know he was acting as if they were tangled up and like if you watched the plate it's like you know nurture just there but it's not like he was like grabbing his arm or they were like you know elbowing each other going for a rebound it's like a side you know sideline play and I thought was just kind of he was playing normal you know normal defense so he was right there I don't I don't think Turkish was doing anything you know maybe there was a previous plays where you know something had been building between those there's always something building specialist I you know normally in those situations you can at least see like all right I can see why this escalated like that to me just kind of came out of nowhere I think was a shock does anybody I mean I think we're looking at 10 plus games for dreaming I think this is a you know message sender by the MBA especially given what happened with gobert I mean what is your expectation for what the suspension will ultimately be I'm hoping we find out today yeah I do think nurkic fouled him before Draymond he kind of grabbed his hip and turned him so you could have called a foul on that that's not a reason to turn around and smack someone in the head but you know I guess we're getting technical here but he's last suspension was what five games what was a little lightly I was pretty surprised it was five and this is the way teens objection in his NBA career I think they'll save the big one for 20 I think this is more like yeah exactly you build up it's like getting rewards it's like getting rewards points like you buy you buy nine smoothies you get the  10th one free that feels like they're gonna wait they should for a banner at the chase center for the 20th ejection for Draymond like this the eventual statues like I think there's going to be a curry Klay Draymond maybe combo statue outside like you know it should be it should be Curry hit in the shimmy Clayton with three and then Draymond like you know somebody on the bottom I think the sabona stomp would be the would be the statue I kind of forgot about that one right I mean people were doing the the Draymond retrospective last night on Twitter I was like oh yeah that was actually a pretty major one yeah and that one gets lost to history because it was like somehow the least violent of all of his recent offenses and he denied that one too I don't know if you maybe you go with punching Jordan Poole and practice  Yeah that would be cool yeah if you could build an exact replica statue of like the TMZ footage I'd be on board of that I think seven games feels about right for this man I think I would not be surprised if this is double digits you know with with everything you know even on the last suspension you know Adam Silver said you know we had to take his past history into account  I said enough I mean this this feels like a  equally violent if not more violent act and then what he did to go bare which is saying a lot but yeah even if it's seven games I mean that's that's a big deal for the Warriors like fantasy wise dream on and he breaks barely inside the top 100 you know the minutes have been kind of spotty obviously his defensive production is down he's not even giving you a block or steal per game but you know you're missing the rebounds you're missing the assists  I mean I think it's almost a bigger deal for the Warriors in real life though I mean there's that 10 and 13 right now and really have not been able to string anything together they have not won consecutive games in well over a month you have to go back to the first two days of November when they've won back-to-back games you look at their schedule coming up Clippers Nets Portland Boston Washington Portland Denver those would be their next seven so for expecting a seven game suspension you know the interesting thing is the seventh game of that list is Christmas day at Denver like do you think that's a consideration at all it does the NBA want him back for the big Christmas Day showcase I would think so having dream on green not on the floor doesn't help your product I mean I think we're at the point now Golden State shouldn't even be a Christmas Christmas Day showcase anymore but Steph Curry's that big of a star yeah be curious to see if they structure it that way that would be the right amount of time did you already do the tally on how many games now is now between now and then what kind of suspension they'd be looking at I think that he would come back for that the there's no there you go seven games so they'll be there'll be the seventh so six game a six-game suspension seems awkward maybe they just give them another five gamer I think he'll be back by Christmas yeah maybe but they allowed to play on Christmas and then he's suspended again after that he gets like a work release for for Christmas day but yeah I mean it's it's just a bad situation for the Warriors and you know it Steve Kerr is kind of danced around this for the last couple of weeks you know he's been pelted with questions you know about you know what are you gonna do with Wiggins what do you do with clay and I don't think there's a real answer you can even see the frustration with her last night he's like look yeah I left those guys on the bench because they were helping us I mean it was it was the bench that got us back into the game and he's not wrong about that right I mean it's sorry come in guy and Chris Paul played really well last night 15 and 11 with two Steels and five boards and 30 minutes both are booty gave them some good minutes as well but at the end of the day I mean this is a team that's still wants to compete for a title and it's all well and good to get those contributions but that's that's not gonna push you necessarily to the top of the the West now on the other side of this game no Kevin Durant four Phoenix we're now 23 games in for the Suns we are yet to see Durant Booker and Beale play together that was the fourth appearance of the season for Bradley Beal he was back he missed the previous 12 games missed a full month and I thought look pretty decent you know something that stuck out to me and all four games that he's played this season like he's working his way to the line like the shooting has been a little up and down obviously when you're missing so much time you know it's tough to reintegrate but got to the line seven times five of 12 from the field you know hit his first three of the night 16 points three assists three rebounds at 27 minutes what do you do with Beale you know in fantasy if you're holding him anywhere like is there is this somebody that you're really comfortable holding right now it's like he's a tough player to trade right I mean I don't think anybody anybody's gonna be buying until he at least stays healthy for a couple of weeks and you know the back injury it's just something that can always be reached right maybe we thought he was going to be back a month ago played three games and he misses another month it just I'm not saying it's gonna be a loss season like I think it can only really go up from here Health Wise for Beale but he got to take into account you know I think you forget because he was just playing in the Wasteland that is Washington these last couple years I mean he's missed big chunks of time and each of the last couple Seasons absolutely I don't think we're out of the woods yet when it comes to injury concerns with Bradley Beal or really any of these guys giving the fact that it is hard to believe when you said that I thought is that right they haven't played a single game together that is crazy we still haven't seen the it and I think part of the reason he's getting to the line is also part of the reason why I don't really love him in fantasy this isn't a guy that feels like he needs to jack up a bunch of shots order to help his team win he can pick his spots he can be much more patient and deliberate and his approach that means that he'll be more comfortable just driving to the rack take it to the rim and and maybe you draw a foul and just help his team stay afloat offensively rather than be the offense because that's Devin Booker's job and Bradley Beal shouldn't come in and try and take that when you add Kevin Durant to the mix I think you're gonna get an even more passive Bradley deal and he's never been an elite Defender so it's not like you're getting those stats passing I mean it's seems to be falling on the falling in the basket of Devin Booker's well he's a guy right now definitely don't want to drop him he's got way too much talent for that and you're right what do you gonna get for him in a trade let's go to Sons fan in your league I think it might be hold on Bradley Beal yeah I mean we're dealing with such a small sample size and again you know every game that he's played has been without either Booker or Durant so it's tough to even use that small sample and feel like you can extrapolate you know he is assist numbers have been up the last couple years in Washington you know they were kind of lacking a true point guard in the post job wall era but I don't know if that's really gonna carry over like you said I think Booker is the point guard for the Steam and we saw that last night I mean he's the guy that I think they feel more comfortable in that role and obviously with Durant's back you know he becomes the number one or number two and yeah I think we're gonna see a lot of Bradley Beal you know kind of functioning as the Kevin Love Chris Bosh in this situation if you will which can still be really productive you know I think he has a chance to to Really up his three-point volume like that was something that quite quietly fell off the last couple of years in Washington like he had that season where he put up over 30 a game back to back Seasons actually 2919 and 2020 and you know those those years he was hitting you know two and a half three three-pointers per game but those last two years in Washington you know you think of Bradley  Beal is this high volume knocked out three point shooter I mean he only took four and a half threes per game last season and yeah I think that's the the one area where maybe he could improve and it's not ideal because you're kind of using him maybe underutilizing his skill set but you know at the same time Bradley Beal is is way overqualified to be standing in the corner hitting open three so I write you know if you could get to like six attempts per game you know I think that's a an area in category leaks where he could be a monster yeah for sure and and they're dealing with injuries right now too okay left the game last night you already seen graceful  what was that we saw some bowl of bowl and the first half I mean we we're not getting enough Bowl I mean if you really have a nice five-minute appearance from him with a node made shots the R.I.P to the days of bull the fantasy relevant basketball option but Grayson Allen he'll be out tonight as well oh curious to see what they look like second of a back-to-back going up against Durant's former Squad and Durant hasn't been ruled out as the last time I checked yeah by the time you listen to this recording he will be but we could possibly see the debut of the trio tonight yeah my guess is that you almost never see a player missed the front end of a back-to-back and then come back on the second end so I guess he does probably miss but you know it's not a serious injury for KD like more likely and excuse me in my mind that we see that big three together on Friday at home against the New York Knicks but at some point it's going to happen hopefully at some point all three will play together and we'll find finally get to see a fully formed version of this subsystem you know again not a whole lot else to discuss from last night we saw a little bit of a post in-season tournament hangover from the Lakers who got off to a slow start against just an altar depleted Dallas Mavericks team that is now you know one two straight without Kyrie without Josh Green they're down Derek Jones who's actually been given them a lot of good minutes of late I mean it was just a kind of a classic what you'd expect type of game from Lucid write 43 minutes gets you 33 points 17 assists crazy only four turnovers three of ten from Beyond The Arc six of six at the line great Williams had a great game I mean Kim Hardaway coming back after missing Monday night 32 points off the bench for Hardaway and Dante exit out of gonna say we're not gonna spend five minutes on Dante excellent at least five minutes on that day except seven of nine from three last night I mean Dallas the Lakers actually played pretty well yeah LeBron and AD I think had to exert himself a little bit more than they expected last night I mean another just Monster night from Anthony  Davis who was clearly hampered and still gave you 37 and 11 with two blocks 33 9 and 8 for LeBron like the Lakers played well enough to win this game they shot 40 they shot 54% from the field they had 153 Dallas what 21 of 43 from Beyond The Arc and you know the exact same thing is interesting like if you're if you're like a daily lineup League where you can make moves throughout the week like I'd say pick him up I mean once once I read his back what's Josh Green is back what we'll see what his role ends up being but you know I think he's played well enough now that in deeper leagues you at least have to consider it  I mean it looks good this is a guy that we thought we'd get a breakout from almost 10 years ago and it didn't happen so he's definitely been putting the work in to get better but my favorite stat of the the line that Dante Exum gave us last night is that he he made seven threes on the season going into last night he had eight made threes so he almost matched his season total in one single game probably not but my point is doesn't sound all that sustainable but but it was cool to see and and like the I wish I could remember which coach I heard say this if I've seen you do it once before I know you can do it again and so yeah maybe he's got that in his bag now  I mean Exodus basically a career 30% shooter and yeah that's played in the NBA since 2020 and you know that was I don't even know if we count that he played like six games for the Cavs that years so I mean it's obviously possible that he could improve and you know he's been playing well overseas over the last couple of years you know maybe that's a little bit more tailored to where his game is out right now but he's only 28 you know it's not it's not inconceivable that you can still be making improvements but that's gonna be an interesting one to monitor I mean I think there are a lot of people out there who didn't even know dot X it was in the NBA this year yeah I think that would probably be accurate but it goes to show the Dallas Mavericks are deep this year they're not reliant on on Kyrie misses time and by the way weird look for Kyrie he gave the he gave him the the DeShaun Watson treatment he was up in the suite last night you got to stay down with the team you know I know it's more comfortable upstairs yeah Mark Cuban sitting on the floor he's the owner of the team like what are you doing bad but yeah they're not they're not as reliant on on the the non Lucas stars as as you would think  Mark Cuban was wearing a Dallas Mavericks football jersey last night it's like something that only Mark Cuban does it look like one of those old school like FUBU jerseys that people used to wear in elementary school I'm sure those are those were popular in the Orlando area as they were in the general Green Bay Area like those FUBU like oh seven oh yeah where do you even getting Mavericks football jersey Walmart I don't know yeah our Cuban does not dress like a guy that is worth billions of dollars and that's probably why he's worth billions yeah that's like I dress better than he does he yeah um Kyrie by the way that the latest update that we got was yesterday he still in a walking boot and no return timeline you know they in these situations like at RotoWire we're not supposed to you know like rule a player out like technically he's not ruled out for Thursday's game I don't I don't know if he's playing anytime soon man it's kind of its weird injury right a bruised heel you know which seems like a win based on how that injury looked but I still think there's a chance that I read you know this is a pretty significant chunk of time obviously a guy who has a pretty lengthy injury history especially with with lower body injuries so I think there's going to be a lane here for Dante Exum to to be streaming candidate for the next couple of weeks obviously Hardaway I was probably get a benefit most I mean Jaden Hardy is in that conversation I think in deeper legs like he looked great on Monday came back down to Earth last night just one of  seven from the field I'm not not all that interested in him but you know if you're in like a 16 Team league I think he's somebody to consider at least for the next week or two yeah and you mentioned Grant Williams really liked what I saw there he's always been an efficient three-point shooter and it was good to see him get back on track so that's another guy that I'm gonna be looking to take some shots at as well all right keep those questions coming in the chat we will hit those in a little bit I know it's early I know it's Wednesday morning but if you got any questions for the rest of the week and he trade questions lineups ads drops throw those in the chat guys and we will get

that out again the code is our WNBA all right Brandon I wanted to kind of place some head-to-head you know who would you rather roster the rest of the way and I'll throw some names at you you can toss them at me and we will discuss but I want to start with we get a lot of questions during these dreams about what do you do with veteran guys who are injury Pro you know they Kauai Paul George LeBron Kevin Durant in general you know I'm kind of in favor of like write it out a little bit longer we're still only 20 25 games in later in the season you maybe start to worry but do you do you have you know of that group I just named LeBron Katie George Kawaii is there somebody that you could possibly trust the most out of that group you know like is there any is there any inclination to trade for one of those guys because you might be able to get them at a discount if you have a manager who's worried about that injury you know coming around the pike I I'm not that worried about LeBron James I know that he's older but he's been the healthiest over the course of his career by a pretty significant margin over everybody else he doesn't have nagging injuries I worry more about LeBron being held back or really if you want to word it properly LeBron holding himself back so that he can be full go for the playoffs but this guy really only knows one speed and that's Full Throttle we saw him go all in for the in-season tournament the in season tournament this guy was playing like he was in the playoffs LeBron's a competitor I trust him much more than I trust anybody else he's not as squirrely as a Kawhi Leonard who will just miss time seemingly for no reason and you know obviously he's getting older all these guys have their concerns but I trust LeBron the most  yeah I think you're right and the injuries that LeBron is suffered the last few years have been  I think flukey you can say right he's getting yeah he's yeah dive into him things like that I mean who was it Solomon Hill they who dove into him a couple a couple years ago I mean like you said they're not nagging injuries they're you know slipping on the floor and straining your growing type of stuff and you'd like to think that you know maybe that injury luck comes around for LeBron whereas you know all those other guys have had you know more chronic issues if you're if you have the option to roster one of these two players the rest of the way  Julius Randle or Pascal siaca they are right next to each other in the season long rankings right now  I think I would go with Pascal siakam Julius Randle is so hot and cold and you just never know when it's going to go away I think Pascal siakam is still so important to the everyday grind of what the Raptors want to do it just feels like they're very similar players to put those two head-to-head you know in terms of the numbers that they're putting up the abilities that they have and and they're upside but in terms of I think for both they both have incredible upside and in their best Nights Are All Star level but the downside definitely points in the direction of Julius Randle so I'll take the upside with the higher floor of Pascal seaquam yeah I mean obviously they're very comparable players in a lot of ways same position you know like I said there is the basically provided equal value on the year so far I mean you do worry a little bit more about the field goal percentage with Randall although siakam has been just a disaster for three and we'll see if that comes around at some point you know Randall had that he'll take as many as Randall does know he doesn't and part of that is because you just not make them but you know Randall got off to that horrible start and I think that's still dragging down his numbers you know the first first nine games of the year Randall was shooting 33% from the field 25% from three since then so we're looking at a sample of 13 games 52% from the field 36% from three so maybe he settles somewhere in the middle but you know if you isolate the last month you know Julius Randle has been he's been the better player he I think he's a little bit more reliable counting stat wise like his his down nights aren't as bad as he comes like Jacob every now and then we'll just have a disaster type of game you know four of 12 from the field three rebounds three assists whereas at the very least  Randall's is giving you you know the counting stats every night and you're gonna have to live with a hit to the field goal percentage in the free throw percentage but I feel like he's a little bit more reliable in that regard oh boy we got a frozen Brandon  or he's taking his time to really think through this one all right we'll get Brandon Back In The Stream momentarily let's see take a couple listener questions when we get Brandon back  David asks all right thoughts on a Kobe white Breakout  I think the Kobe white breakout may already have happened maybe in the process of happening he's been any top 50 player over the last month and I think it's entirely possible that Zach LaVine has perhaps played his final game in a Chicago Bulls uniform I not saying he's not truly injured but I also think there might be a little bit of gamesmanship going on with the Chicago Bulls front office and waiting for you know players to become trade eligible later this week and we'll see if anything comes with that but I think it's almost a lock that's exactly is moved at some point you know might not be until the trade deadline in February but it's going to depend more than anything on what the Bulls bring back in a potential Levine trade and we'll also see if they moved to Rosen you know maybe they tried to move Busch as well I think this pretty clearly is a sinking ship and a team that needs a reset but Kobe White's gonna be a big part of that right I mean this is a guy that has a draft pedigree right he's a top 10 pick in 2019 I think they have a reasonable investment in him and you know bringing in Levine bringing into rows and just kind of forced him to take a back seat these last couple of years last 11 games for Kobe white which is really when that breakout began 23.3 points 4.6 rebounds 4.9 assists 51% from the field 53% from three on over nine attempts per game that's the that's gonna be the determining factor for Kobe white obviously he's not going to shoot you know 5153.91  the rest of the season how much does that 3-point percentage come down you know he's basically been acting as the cocoa point of this offense so I don't know that a whole lot will change there but at some point you know he's probably gonna regress closer to 40% from three which is still totally fine I mean if you're if you're above 40% the rest of the way you feel pretty good I would not be looking to to offload Kobe white by any means I I think if anything you're going to have people trying to trade for him and you know make sure you get a good return like I had an offer Brandon on Monday come through in a league where somebody tried to offer me Kobe white for Jared Jackson  wow I mean that  that's pretty strong and Jared Jackson coming off of the Season best game but that like that just goes to show we were talking about Kobe white a couple of weeks ago on the show hopefully you all ran out and grabbed them leave Zach LaVine doesn't look like he's ever gonna to play for the Chicago Bulls team is operating so much better so much more fluid offensively sharing the basketball but a better playing that sort of Billy Donovan brand of ball so what did you end up doing with that offer  I declined it you know I do think Jared Jackson's best days are still ahead of them and it was tough because you know white played a great game the other night I mean this was right after Kobe white went for 33 and 6 was 63s you know it gets against Milwaukee and Jerry Jackson was coming off of that 42 point game so it was kind of you know my peaking player for your peeking player but I still I still like Jared Jackson more rest of the season you know I want to see what this team looks like with Java Ranch and Marcus Smart back I think they'll be more competent I think in a roundabout way it's actually gonna help Jerry Jackson more than it hurts him like obviously my rant coming back means less offensive responsibility for Jackson but these last 20 plus games have also proven that Jerry Jackson's just he's just not a guy that could carry a team offensively and I think he's gonna be a lot more efficient like right now it's like it's like you drafted Jaren Jackson thinking like all right you can lock in 25 points per game it's like the thing that's really killing you is the field goal percentage and he's taking he's taking more shots and he needs to you know he's never been overly efficient as far as Big Ben go but he can't be shooting like 41% from the field like that that's gonna be a killer so I want to see be I want to see how he's you know if you can kind of go back to being closer to a 50% guy from the field which Java rant you know taking more attempts around the rim the raw scoring numbers are going to decrease but I I think we see him hopefully move back into the player that he was last season and it's hard to say how the return of java rant affects Jaron Jackson the shot blocker but that's the other thing like if you paid up for junior Jackson in a draft or in an auction you're expecting at least two and a half blocks per game and you know that's been the other thing that's really dragged down his value he's had he's had some of those flash games but you know he's not giving you a consistent two three four blocks every night yeah and John Moran coming back is shouldn't do anything to to help that that seems like more of a Jaron Jackson issue but offensively it's the two-man game that's missing they need each other they feed off of each other and his offensive production is he's not a guy I've seen way too much ISO Jaron Jackson Jr that's not his game and he definitely we've learned that he needs jiren or he needs John Moran in the lineup I think you made the right call would have been over  reactionary to make that sort of a deal but man Kobe Wright what what to find he has been the fact that that's even a discussion it's great I have no idea what happened to my computer by the way not a clue I just talked about down yeah someday that'll happen every now and then just couldn't handle the heat of the road to basketball podcast keep those questions coming in the chat we'll get to those momentarily want to throw a few more you know who would you rather have questions your way Brandon you know I I've been looking to offload Damian Lillard in a league and you know part of it is I was just saying like a rage situation every went to of 16 the other night it gets Chicago it's like that's now three just horrible games I guess three worst games of the year arguably have come against the Bulls for whatever reason you know I tried to trade him straight up for Donovan Mitchell that that trade request is not been answered yeah it's in this league I assume it'll be declined but yes I got to know your league and I try to trade him to a die-hard box fan who I thought maybe value electric a little bit more highly but it what do you think of trying to to trade game for you know kind of do an elite guard swap like I don't know if you can get Trey young right now probably not maybe in a nine cat League where we're a little bit more worried about the turnovers but you know I'm trying to float offers for you know Donovan Mitchell for Trey young you could even do a package deal for for two lesser guards but thoughts on Dame overall is this somebody that you feel is going to find his stride as a year goes along because he's he's been fine like he's still been like easily a top 20 guy on the year for the most part everything's been good like the free throws especially super efficient high volume but we're not we're not seeing those like crazy Peak Nights from Dame anymore right it's like we haven't had one of those like Dave Miller has 31 points in the second half type of games yeah and we're seeing him score into the 30s but you don't need and he doesn't need to be that guy anymore they have Giannis Giannis he's putting up monster numbers because that's just what he does so he's gonna defer to honest and try and make sure that he remains the focal point in the offense it's completely different than what he's ever dealt with in the past even sharing the rock with CJ McCollum back in Portland right I think that what he has been is what he's gonna be you just hope that he can be a little bit more consistent and avoid those pitfalls like you had against the Chicago Bulls where he went three of 17 from the field I still like Damian Lillard a lot and and I think that he's a guy that over the years we've been able to rely on what he brings to the table scoring you just doesn't have the same level of upside but he also have to keep in mind these guys have not played a lot of basketball together we're not to Christmas yet I still think he most likely is just going to be what he is but his best days with Milwaukee could still be in front of him I would  look at like would you rather have a  Jalen Brunson deer and fox like I'd rather have those guys I don't know if somebody's willing to make those willing to make that sort of a deal but I'd rather have those sort of bald dominant guards he had Dame versus Bronson is interesting I think I would lean Dame their fox fox would be a really interesting one that's an offer that I might have to float out there what about Franz Wagner or Zion Williamson they are also basically equal fantasy players in eight cats over the last month and yeah this one maybe comes down to if you're in a category League you know where where are you willing to take the hit versus you know get some of the The increased production but my guess is that you being in Orlando you would lean France but you know it's hard it's hard to say that there's not more upside with Zion but you're worried about the weight you're worried about the potential injury but would you chase the upside there or go with who I think it's a safer option in Wagner yeah I mean obviously I I'm gonna be a little slanted in my view because I watched this guy play every night but what Franz is one of the most consistent basketball players in the NBA and I could say almost the exact opposite about Zion you just never know what kind of player you're going to get he doesn't look like he's in shape I know that's been a big haha talking point on the debate shows but it's legitimate I mean the guy looks if you look at his side by side now compared to what he looked like in a Pelicans Jersey a couple of years ago the guys put on serious wait it's not the good kind like you I think seeing him next to LeBron In the End season tournament semi was eye-opening this is not a guy that's fit and I do worry about him staying on the court fronts is in Iron Man type if he misses time it's going to be only because of a significant injury and nothing else the field goal percentage I know was an issue a couple of weeks ago it seems like he's rectified  that and he's been back to his old self in terms of what he's doing around the rim and and him in Palo they played a great game side by side you never know like one little shine one night one little Shine the other but most of the time they usually split for about a total of 50 to 55 points between the two of them I would go with the safer option but of course it's not going to surprise anybody that's been listening all right let's hit some of these questions in the chat again keep those coming guys we appreciate it makes the podcast a lot of fun for us hopefully it gives you some actionable advice and more than anything you know helps us talk about as many players as possible each episode Paul asks I'm trying to trade away players from potential tanking teams I have kuzma and marketing who can I Target with packaging those two or even a one for one separately that's a good question we get this one a lot you know I I have a ton of marketing exposure you know as far as Elite guys go he might be my most roster this season which is good and bad when he's been out there he's been fantastic when he's now missed what seven or eight games in a row I think the hope is that he's back at some point this week you know practice late last week practice over the weekend and then still it was ruled out the other night so we'll see we're early on enough that I don't think you have to panic on marketing but I don't know if I want him on my roster after the trade deadline you know I think you know those final 10 to 15 games of the year is when it could really hurt you as it did with plenty of jazz player  last season but even even in season even if we take the the shutdown aspect away from it the Jazz are one of those teams that feels like every other night they're getting blown out you know they're down 30 going into the fourth quarter and you know you're losing five or six minutes per game for marketing because the game so out of hand so I totally understand wanting to offload him you know who could you target then Brandon I mean you I I think he's still good enough that you don't have to take like a massive discount on a return but you know I think the idea is that you're targeting somebody who obviously you feel better about health wise and then you know from a team that's more competitive  and so if I'm understanding this question correctly you're trying to package these two players in order to upgrade either package or do one for one trades yeah yeah I think a couple of names that would come to mind like Paul George just missed time with an injury or not yeah I got her last night  a guy like that maybe there's a little bit of panic and injury concerns so maybe you could pick up someone like that domantas sabonis with two players of that caliber you might even be able to swing a trade like that maybe a little pie in the sky maybe you've got a fantasy manager out there that's down on someone like Desmond Bane right now and with John coming around the corner they might be looking and saying you know let me see if I can offload him I don't think Desmond Bane is going to be hurt all that much by the presence of John Morant I think the rising tide will lift all boats on it comes to the Grizzlies like we were talking about with Jaren Jackson Jr there's our couple of the names that just popping in my head immediately yeah I think marketing is obviously the far more valuable of these two and you know it's tough to trade a player who's injured but you know again maybe you wait for him to come back for a game or two look good and then you know you can do a little bit better in a return but I think you have to you have to Target somebody that where there's a little bit of concern on the other end that's the only way you're going to do it so with Bane you've got the Morant Factor looming with Paul George you've got an injury that's recent we don't know the links of it maybe one of those Sons guys who I mean I don't know there's I mean b old yeah I just I think that's taking on probably more risk than you're looking for you know some names that came to mind for me he could try like Alfred and shengwen you know he's having a great year but still ranks a little bit lower than you think fantasy due to you know some of the deficiencies and his staff profile you know like a dejounte Murray type you know even bam at a bio kind of a my injured guy for your injured guy right about him coming back I think Desmond Bane's a good call yeah even James Harden I think there's still some you know some kind of doubt as to how that situation is going to work out but he's he's been a great fantasy player man I had a good game last night quit James Harden dude I look into a quiet James Harden like wins and losses team chemistry that that's not a category in fantasy basketball right he's trade requests right I mean he said he had the hamstring issue you're too ago but other than that he's been really healthy despite everybody questioning whether or not he's in shape like he's the guy that I trust most of that big three in LA to stay healthy so those are some names you could consider you know like I think some bonus like you said if you package those two maybe you could get him who knows that that's a decent one I was gonna save a call Bridges  probably not you know he's like the ultimate safe option right I mean that's you know they're gonna be in the mix for a playoff spot or play inspot he plays 80 games every year so that's something to consider obviously you probably have to package those two in a deal but you know kuzma is kind of a meme at this point he's still relatively productive right we just spent the most consistent player out by far fantasy wise for the wizard so I don't think that here you should be able to bring back some pretty decent value all right what's cat's value and bridges want to package for a player so  look I don't know which Bridges were talking about could be miles could be a call but either way your packaging one of those guys with Karl Anthony towns  especially if it's McCall Bridges I mean aim high here I mean this is this would be a pretty Elite trade package yeah for sure when we're talking about what a top 30 player in fantasy and and I love the way the Wizards have been playing and he's a really big part of that so I don't see I don't see his production slipping off in any way  I mean I don't know that I'm trying to unload Karl Anthony towns  I'm not either but over the last month he's been a a first round value in category league so I wouldn't  I you know again if you're if you're trading cat plus Bridges either Bridges right now  I mean to me you got to be getting back on top 10 guy right I mean cat in and of himself is almost the top 10 player and then you're adding big time value on top of it so I mean to me we're talking like Halliburton you know take a type of packages guys that are almost impossible to trade for it yup go for it though I mean if you if that's what you're trying to you're trying to make a move but yet definitely value your guys properly and make sure that you're getting a fair return shoot for the moon and if you get a rejection then hang on to those guys because assuming that it's Mikhail Bridges and not miles Bridges that's quite the tandem to have on a fantasy roster I mean even if it's miles Bridges I think there's a lot to like there too I mean you worry about the competitive aspect I guess with the Hornets but that's still a player who I would be trying to acquire right now is not knowing when the Mellow is coming back  all right Jason says hey question should I trade out of it Mitchell for Devin Booker in a nine category league on Yahoo  I don't know if you can really go wrong here I think both these guys are really comparable they've been very comparable throughout their careers especially the last couple of years if you're looking over the last month Donovan Mitchell ranks just outside the top 20 Bookers about six spots higher  I again I don't really feel strongly about this because we're yet to see you know the fully formed big three for Phoenix and I do think as we said earlier like Bradley Beal's gonna take the biggest hit when those three are healthy I don't really think we see a huge drop off for Booker but you know Donovan Mitchell is the guy in Cleveland and that's not going to change either I I guess I would do it but I don't feel strongly I think you're in a good spot either way I I think Devin Booker's assist numbers could potentially go through the roof I think he's a guy that could average over double-digit assists when those guys all play together because he's gonna be the primary ball handler and he's the most this might sound wild with a Kevin Durant on your team but he's the most consistent scorer among the three of them too so I would rather have Devin Booker of the two but like you said that's not me I'm not I'm a big Donovan Mitchell guy and he's one of my most rostered players so I love Mitchell but I'd still rather have Devin Booker  I think the other thing with Booker's he's the best health bet of those big three right right it's like obviously Durant to me is still the best player even at his age but if you're talking about who are you most confident in you know playing  90% of the games the rest of the way I would say Booker all right good question here from dub Force Azar Thompson is this playing time picking back up again this is a million dollar question man I mean we had four straight games where they brought a star tops It Off the Bench he averaged 16 minutes per game in that span didn't play well it was 25% from the field didn't respond well you know wasn't it still giving you rebalance I was about the only thing but you know only two assists one total Steel Slash Block in that span and then all the sudden two nights ago they move him back into the starting lineup and he plays 33 minutes that was his most minutes in any game since November 14th 20 points six rebounds two assists a steal and a block and was a kind of an ideal matchup fantasy wise against the Indiana Pacers you know Alex and I have kind of danced around this one we've gotten a lot of us our questions over the last couple of weeks and we've you know our answer is basically been trying to hold them if you can like I I think he's a player that you would regret dropping and if you did over the last couple of weeks you might already be regretting it but there's there's literally no way to predict what the Pistons are doing here I mean no team has changed up the rotation changed up their starting lineup on a whim more than Detroit has already this season like they are clearly scratching and calling for any answer trying to end this losing streak and you know I think they had internally like real expectations for the season right like there are other bad teams you know Utah Portland I think they do what they were getting themselves into this season whereas I'm not saying Detroit thought they'd be good but I think they thought they would be significantly better than they've been so far I don't think they thought they'd be the first team in the league right so you have to factor that in to some degree I I again I if somebody dropped us our tops and I would go grab him I think it's a great sign that it looks like that stay on the bench was only gonna be a week and a half and you know Detroit has  to accept their fate at this point right like some sort of crazy turnaround is not coming here so what is the point of you know keeping your top five pick on the bench playing 17 minutes at night yeah we don't see a lot of teams that go on a 20-game losing streak make a deep run into the playoffs so that's I'm pretty sure that's never happened I I think the the Fate has been sealed for this team but I wouldn't be too worried about a start Thompson I'm with you if he was on the waiver wire he would Zoom to the top of my list of guys I'm trying to add his minutes are going to increase of course they're trying to do different things they've lost 20 games in a row you have to think about that take yourself out of the fantasy mindset think like a coach you would be switching lineups like crazy trying to figure out how to get out of that situation and it's our Thompson is is a looks like he's gonna be a really good player in this league he's already a fantasy asset when he gets the minutes but he's a rookie and when you're losing 20 straight games you need to experience out there to try and dig your way out of it but that hasn't worked and I think he's yeah we were going to see him as somebody who he's a Bi-Lo candidate he's a Surefire pickup if he's sitting there on the waiver wire blocks steals he can score he's smart with  his shot selection he's the kind of guy I want on my fantasy roster is at let us in his through the roof and he's one of the few players I feel really good about in Detroit right now Skeeter asked do you see Josh Hart getting a bump with Mitchell Robinson out interesting question you know not a one-to-one positional replacement obviously that's hartenstein who played 27 minutes on Monday 11 points 8 boards two assists two Steals and a block got a best case you know we'll see how many minutes he ends up playing obviously we saw a stretch last season where you kind of thought hard to die would be in a good position with Robinson out and Tibbs was still a little bit hesitant but yeah the Josh hard angle this is interesting because obviously he's such a great rebounder for his size and Mitchell Robinson is just a rebounding vacuum I would I wouldn't say there's a significant bump here you know I mean you have three very high usage players already in Barrett Brunson and Randall so you know Josh Hart like really upping his usage or doing more offensively without Robinson I don't think that's really in the cards but you know I think they'll distribute those minutes a little bit more differently you know they'll play smaller you can use Randall at the five maybe that means a little bit more for Josh Hart I would say a marginal increase but nothing super significant yeah I don't think it changes that much we actually saw Jericho Sims get the starting nod with them switching up very tips yeah yeah I mean a lot of these coaches they like to keep their rotations the same and they try and not mix that up I see it here in Orlando it's the reason why I go capita is become a fantasy name because they didn't want to insert MOG into the starting lineup and and disrupt the you know they plaque they practice a certain way they play a number of minutes together with certain guys on the floor at certain times and you know these I guess it's not just the Old School coaches we're starting to see some of the newer School guys like Mosley do that too but yeah I agree I'm Josh Hart a fine fantasy player but not anybody that that gonna get this big tick up because of the injury to Mitchell Robinson  all right we got a couple either or questions from Mr a number one Caleb Martin great question I would go I'm gonna go with what I've seen more of and that is production from Caleb Martin on and I think he'll get he'll get even more of an opportunity he would Highsmith dealing with an injury right now don't know how long he's supposed to be out and we saw the playoffs last year I'm a big believer in Caleb Martin after watching all those playoff minutes Dante Exum is giving us one single great game in years so that I mean I actually has all the upside in the world if he's gonna get the minutes but Caleb Martin is to play I feel the same way I like Kayla Martin the big concern of course is the return of Tyler hero right I think if he if he wasn't coming back and this is a whole run Caleb Martin for me we'll see you know once Heroes back that's 27 to 30 minutes all the sudden that you know need to be inserted into that rotation and I think obviously some of those are going to be lopped off of Kayla Martin who is played 39 34 3135 minutes over the last four games I still think he's you know vastly more consistent you know he's going to be the guy that you know on average is going to give you much better fantasy production if you if you look at a month long sample you know certainly be weeks I think we're games where he could be more valuable it kind of depends on what you think the Kyrie situation is too like if you think Kyrie is going to miss a month plus then yeah maybe there's something there with some but I would rather have Caleb Martin I  think he's been he's been so good that even with hero back they're gonna find ways you know for him to see at least what 25 27 minutes a night so that's what everybody else pick up Dante some up it was great it was I loved what I saw last night I was on the Mavericks plus two so that was I was smiling year to year but now I'm not buying it keyonte George or Tim Hardaway  this is another really interesting one to me this comes down to what kind of League are you in and what categories are you worried about if it's a category League  you know keonte Georgia shoots 35% for the field that's the the big concern he does technically still ranked ahead of Hardaway in category leaks even despite that but that's mostly because Hardware is basically just points in threes  yeah I and and I mean that's kind of what you're getting from keyonte George too you get the assist um I'm gonna go with Tim Hardaway or consistent like you said with the Utah Jazz like they've had so many games where they just  they just bought them out they do but like yeah they George is the guy 38 minutes because yeah they're okay with the Box yeah like George but I would still rather I think I'd still rather have Tim Hardaway okay  I think for the next couple weeks I rather have hard way I think there's gonna be some you know some games like we saw last night with no Kyrie where he's the clear number two option and you know Lucas happy to feed him but on balance going forward I might give slightly into keyonte George even though I have been the biggest fan of him  all right pressing a question for you Brandon is Cole Anthony a dropdown um no I he has not been as explosive offensively but if if you were if if you liked what you saw from him before nothing circumstantially has changed and he still  a candidate for six man of the year I would expect they're gonna be Ebbs and flows to his season by the time you drop them you're going to be regretting it wishing you'd pick them back up I I would just hold if you have Cole Anthony there's no reason usually when I put a guy out on the waiver wire it's big it's something has happened a circumstance has changed that's led me to believe I'm never going to get that production again that's not the case he just he's had a down week  what is the full situation I don't know if you have any more insight on this than anybody else but that that to me is the biggest Factor here if he's back he's playing 27 to 30 minutes tonight I think at that point you could say yeah maybe call Anthony's a drop in in 12:00 on Bounce has been fantastic this year and like you said you just spent a little bit down of late but do you have any idea Fulton's coming back I mean this is just starting to feel like more of a chronic like you know they're taking a game to game but it really feels more week to week and I think they kind of need him back you know the battery obviously the magic have been playing well their record is 16 and 7 right now and the battle for first place at the end of the week they have the Celtics on Friday and Sunday but Anthony black is just not a starting level point guard and if he was healthy they'd be putting him back in the lineup I could tell you that I think window Carter Junior from what I've heard is closer to a return than folks is I haven't  the full Situation's been much more tight lips which leads me to believe  it's not coming in the immediate future I do think he's gonna come back at some point but I don't think it's gonna be within the next couple weeks  all right we got back to back very similar question eerily similar one from Sean and one from Don just traded Kobe and porzingis for Karl Anthony towns thoughts and then we have another question that says Kobe white for poison gifts both of these are nine category so we'll talk about the two for one first Kobe white and forcing gifts for cats  pretty fair deal to me  yeah yeah I'd rather have Karl Anthony towns then then the other two but yeah I mean there for both sides I I would prefer talents because of the injury risk with personas like that's just I always been really good when he's been out there I just you know history suggests that that's going to be a losing investment more often than not and obviously cats miss a lot of time too so it's not like he's early in his career he was like 82 games every year but I think Kat's been good enough and you know he has first round upside those other guys really don't but I think this is a fair deal for both sides yeah I mean there is a chance what we're seeing with Kobe white isn't going to sustain but  we still don't know what Chicago Bulls is is really gonna look like but it's good to see Chris taping just back out there we know that he's gonna bomb it from Three's at six attempts and each of his last two games the rebounds should be there I think they've been a little bit suppressed but I would expect that to pick back up I mean these are all really good players but you want the best player in the deal currently Anthony towns so whether he already did it so yeah I agree good job kid Cunningham for pool and Jeremy Grant in a 14 team Nyan Cat League our question asked her J would be looking to offload Cade Cunningham worried about a potential shutdown from the Pistons I get that I mean I don't think the shutdown would come until much later in the season and that would be ridiculous if they did two years in a row to shut the guy down I mean at some point you got to play basketball right one and last season was it was injury related I I don't know if they would shut him down you know like you said I think you just gotta want to get Reps for Kate Cunningham I it's not like he just winning them games right is like at the end of the year or you really are you worried about draft positioning like you've lost 20 in a row with the guy playing every night so I don't think that's really that big of a concern you know something else and I talked about Monday too is this draft class there's not a prize at the top you know there's not a weapon Yama sweepstakes here where you're trying to make sure you're in that bottom four for the the lottery odds so something will develop you know in a few months from now there will be two or three guys that were really excited about it always happens but I think with the way that this draft is shaping up that's something you have to consider as well I would I always be more worried about a Jeremy Grant shut down then a cake Cunningham shutdown I completely agree I'm not trying to move on Cade Cunningham I know the whole piston situation has been frustrating but I still gives you 20 points most nights he's good for double-digit assists a couple times over the course of a two weeks band and the 3-point shooting is in there that's not really his game but I still really like the player and  I think you can only he's only gonna get better he's a really talented player we have not seen the best of Kate Cunningham yet  well dressed this one quickly kind of talked about it already is Kobe white is so high or could he keep this up rest of the season do you expect Chicago to trade Levine for point guard  that's the thing it's it I expected to trade LaVine I think that is so up I really think that's happening if could be a soon as like next week when guys become trade eligible could be January could be the trade deadline at the latest Levine wants out you know when it gets to the point where he's publicly talking about yeah probably time for me to move on and then is you know kind of mysteriously shut down with a who knows what's going on injury like a week later the writings on the wall like Levine's gone but the question is who's coming back right like do you bring in a young guard or do you want to get a look at I have no idea there's no way to predict which team is going to step up or who you're gonna get back  I don't think Kobe white can keep up the efficiency rest of season like we said earlier in the Pod I mean the last month he's at like 50 50 90 shooting that's just that's not sustainable 3-point shooting a specialist so he's at Peak value right now but I think he could do like a reasonable fact simile of this going forward like in less they bring in I don't even know who like what you know name young guards who would come in and have to play 35 minutes like even in that situation like you might be sending out more than Zach LaVine you might be trading to Rosen as well like I think there's going to be minutes available like I think Kobe White's gonna be a big big minute player the rest of the season so Kitty keep up what he's doing right now exactly know but I would be looking to acquire rather than trade Kobe white I I tend to disagree I do think I do think that he's gonna Remain the starting point guard for the Chicago Bulls and I fully expect them to move off of Zach LaVine I don't know why they would bring in somebody else to take that spot from him when he's been one of your most productive layers and you've played well since putting Zach LaVine on the bench and just kind of waiting this trade situation out so I think that that will continue what the problem is is he  is not sustainable and what he's doing in terms of the three-point shooting percentage and all of that so we're going to see dips right now what we're seeing is and average to good NBA player that's playing a really really hot stretch of basketball sell High when we're talking about some of the names that have already been discussed in the trades that have been thrown out there like you talked about Jaron Jackson Jr we had Karl Anthony towns as part of a Coby white trade of one of the answers or questions that we had a little bit earlier when you're talking about selling High these are the exactly the kind of players that I think do it with and if you can get max value for him right now I think you strike while the iron's hot  you don't just sell them to sell them but I think you can sell high on Kobe White all right we'll Zoom through the rest of these questions really good one here from Admiral Nita has the stock of Jordan Poole Ben Simmons and Josh giddey fallen so low that they're no longer Buy Low targets and are more stairways 12 team category League I want nothing to do with Simmons didn't want anything to do with them and draft season I think anybody who's watched bits over the last couple years got a new this was coming I wouldn't be really looking to acquire him I think even even if and when he comes back there's you know the next injury or the next week is right around the corner but pool and giddy are interesting here  yeah I I tend to be a little more stay away with all of them I've now been burned too hard on Jordan Poole this year not not happy with the investment that I made there and and and it seems like the Thunder getting by just fine without Josh giddey being one of their Stars you don't worry about a suspension anymore it looks like that's not really gonna happen so that kind of factor that into the equation but these are three players to just simply are not blowing me away I mean giddy I don't mind grabbing just because you still giving you last 10 games have been really underwhelming and he's still you know 10-6-4 in a steal it's like it's still usable doesn't take enough shots where the field goal percentage is like a huge negative I mean it's certainly not a plus but you know you shouldn't a terribly from three doesn't take that many I think there's maybe some Bilo with him pool look like he was moving in the right direction for a while relatively speaking and then just terrible the last two games so I I think any hope of like you know a Jordan Poole breakout at some point like I think it I think it would have happened right I mean we thought this guy would hit the ground running and just be piled up points and you know there's that report like a month into the season at the Wizards don't view him as part of the future like I it's a Lost season for Washington and the worst part with pools are not getting the minutes like that is a really that's a bad indication right it's one thing if you're playing poorly but you're still out there for 35 minutes racking up counting stats but they're getting blown out every night he's only playing 26 28 minutes for a lot of those so I would I would probably stay away from  all three but if you're if you're looking to aquire one it would be the guy for me  what's up with Devin vassell should I be looking to unload him or hold we are of course talking about Devin the cell for the San Antonio Spurs yeah you know it's been a little bit shaky the raw numbers look pretty similar to last season you know obviously you missed basically the entire second half but is that 47% from the field on the year of 37% from three again close to where he was last season so I think he's been about as expected like maybe hasn't taken a big step forward but  I think kind of neutral on him like I'm not panicking of the sella I think you're you're getting about what you should have expected  yeah I mean the Spurs are in a similar situation to what we're seeing with the Detroit Pistons they just lose a lot of basketball games and when you lose a lot usually your best players aren't holding up their end of the bargain and Devin the cells still the second leading scorer on the team he just kind of is what he is I don't think could you look to unload him I don't know who's trying to buy Devon to the cell right now so I would just hold  Kawhi Leonard and Drew holiday for Chris Stapleton gist and Deontay Murray this is a nine category League he's punting field goal percentage in hunting rebounds which side of this trade do you like more  um I I think I would lean the steps and dejounte Murray side just getting a little bit more bang for your buck there  yeah Gerald is just not been a great fantasy player this year you know his numbers have taken a predictable hit in Boston so great real life player of course you worry about the injuries with like pores I guess and quiet almost cancel each other out for me injury-wise you know kauai's still the best player in the deal but dejounte Murray is also been extremely healthy and I think it's always one of the more underrated guys in fantasy so I would I would I don't love either side of this because of the injury risk but obviously you're either hanging on to an injury risk of aquarium one in poor thing is but I think the like Murray to me outpaces Holiday enough that I would rather have the poisonous Murray side  what can I get for pool and Hayward  tough to say  you know Gordon Hayward I I'm writing it out with him in a couple weeks just like waiting for that injury to come he's been solid though I mean he's picked up his assist a little bit with no lamelo you know minutes have been there he's always he's always been fine what he's been healthy it's just you know that that injury is coming at some point and you know we just talked about pool not a guy that a lot of people are trying to acquire right now so packaging those two together you know I don't think you're going to get anybody that's going to blow you away right you got to go pretty low here is there anybody that comes to mind could you get one of the Pelicans guys like a herb Jones or Trey Murphy or is that even asking too much I know I think that's fine I think that's a good range to aim for you know could you try to get I don't know Spencer Dinwiddie D'Angelo Russell you know guys who kind of have high variants you know somebody who might be frustrated with some of their down games do you know Russell by the way I was looking at that mvp list that we went over a couple weeks ago he's still towards the top of it as far as the most successful teams in fantasy basketball a high percentage of them have D'Angelo Russell and their roster  I I don't understand that I don't either yeah I think you know  that does adopt to you know like Yahoo's default settings maybe they have some sort of DeAngelo Russell boost in there you know he's shooting 50% for the field so whatever we'll give him that I have no idea how that that makes sense like when you watch him  I think every night I tune into the Lakers he's not having a good game so I guess what I'm not watching he must be going off all right James says I have Boost valentinus Triple J heart and Stein and Nick Richards tried to trade one Center away for a good power forward in return who should I aim for and again who thanks all right thanks for the question James yeah you got a little bit of a glut at Center here it's not depending on your like your league settings it's not a bad thing to have options that Center you know you're you never want to be in that boat where you don't have enough Setters and you're forced to start maybe two of them but you got enough here  I you know I'd be looking to trade the object can make a case for any of those guys but if you're looking to get a good power forward in return you know you might have to trade one of those first three booster which valve Tunis or Jared Jackson you know if you're putting hard Stein or Richards out there I don't think you're going to get a quote unquote good power forward back I don't know I mean do you maybe try to aim for somebody like Jabari Smith who's quietly played pretty well it was one of the first names that jumped out at me when I was looking at the list I think PJ Washington has been his Productions has been suppressed with lamelo ball out of the lineup but if we see lamelo come back he seems to thrive off of the way that lamelo runs that offense and his defense is going to keep him on the floor so he's a guy that you might be able to look at I don't know if Evan Mobley is getting a little bit too aggressive and what you could potentially get back but yeah those would be those would be a couple of the names I like the Jabari Smith Pool because it just that somebody who has Jabari Smith he's one of those players on your roster you're always willing to unload because he's not he's not changing the game for you but  he's good enough to be in your starting lineup  yeah I mean you could try to pull like a Triple J for saieko that type of thing I think those are two players that a lot of people are probably looking to move off of right now so you got options you got plenty options all right Yusuf says hey guys I got offered and bead for my Booker and McCall Bridges do I need to get another player to equalize the trade is it worth to get 75 to 85th player within bead what is the target rank for second player okay so basically is you know Booker and McCall for MB does that a fair deal  I actually think that's relatively fair I mean if obviously if you can get a if you can get a third or a second player you know to come with and be I think you at least try that first you know don't accept the offer without countering and if they declined I think this is a relatively fair deal like I'd still rather have the impeach side because he's just been he's been such a monster you know some of these top guys like SGA MB Halliburton yokich I mean they're they like outpaced even other first round values by so much so that they're just incredibly valuable but you know Booker called bridge is to me a pretty fair offer yeah and and so this person has Booker in Nicole Bridges so I would just yeah just I would slam except that wouldn't get cute sometimes you start to you start to throw offers counter offers back and forth too much into losing the deal I think I think I would do it straight up because the player you're going to add to that mix where the other person still gonna say yes I don't think that that individual player is going to change the game for you oh all right we'll do this one quick you take the Warriors make some changes soon maybe come and go over Wiggins less clay his team is looking sad yeah we talked about this at the top man it's it's not looking good I feel bad for curry which I have not said very often as somebody who tends to be more available bronze supporter but it's it's tough man I mean they  they left it all out there last night still came up short because the bench that was carrying them I think we need to me is the guy who gets replaced first I mean he's just been a total train wreck and even if you know they don't pull up from the starting lineup like we've already seen you know more Moody more kaminga I think some of a pagie minutes have come at the expense of Wiggins Clay is so tough like I think they have and rightly so this kind of undying loyalty to Klay Thompson and and you know I think we know if anybody's capable of heat up for a month and it is still play like it's hard for me to see because I actually thought he was really underrated last year people were talking about his downfall last season and like his numbers to be like pretty good I know he's slipped on defense but I thought he for the most part played really well last season and it's hard for me to see you why there would be this big Cliff coming other than I guess just age in these injuries adding up so I think they will they will punch on Wiggins much faster than they do clay yeah the legs seem to be going with Klay Thompson and he came back after a bunch of many months of rehab from that ACL in free and and it just seems like age is caught up with them what can they do the only player they have on their team with significant trade value they're never going to trade his name is Steph Curry I just don't know what they can really do outside of making some of those minor moves  yeah starting comingo over Wiggins they might end up doing that they continue to slip Steph Curry wasn't all that good last night either 26% from 3-point range so I'm not gonna say he's part of the whole problem but he was part of the problem last night so on top of this Zach asked you know basically is it worth addict but jet ski right now or are we jumping the gun after another you know kind of Splash game for him and you know we got a lot of similar questions about a month ago when he had that big game forget who was that again Minnesota I think that was the Draymond ejection game that's right so that was like almost exactly a month ago against the Timberwolves you know skis last five he's averaging 28 minutes a game 12.7 rebounds three assists did the field goal percentage for a guy who's that small it takes a lot of tough shots has been pretty good if you're in a deeper League I would say yeah I mean if you're 14 16 teams absolutely I think Golden State you know you kind of heard it and Steve Kerr's Voice last night like they're searching for answers and I don't think you know I again Curry's safe you know I don't think Clay is gonna see a massive reduction in minutes but they're gonna do whatever it takes to try to win games here and I think pajam ski is been he's been better like on balance the clay has for a lot of the years so yes I would go out and add him if you have a roster spot you know don't expect too much but  definitely worth an ad for me  yeah I mean it's a speculative add just to see what the Golden State Warriors do in order to correct this situation I got to do something because this team is has too much pride to be sitting at 10 and 13 right now so you know Steve Kerr he's gonna start to shake things up all right Supremacy asked how do you check that mvp fantasy team stat we will send that in the chat right now oh yeah I believe I have that I believe I have that saved let me move this I just okay but you can well that was fast yeah you all you got to do is just Google Yahoo fantasy Basketball MVPs and it'll take you there but yeah interesting page that shows you the highest rostered players on the most successful teams this season James says I try to get Middleton if so who would be a good trade for him  huh yeah I mean  he's probably pretty undervalued you know I think it's special if there's somebody who's not you know checking box scores and just You Hear The Narrative of oh you know stop playing that many minutes you still working his way back like he's still gonna be like a borderline top 100 guy so yeah I actually don't mind adding Middleton I think there's only upside the rest of the way unless that knee injury you know really starts to crop back up even at limited minutes you know still giving you like you know 13 four and four which is fine just deeper league but don't give up anything too crazy for Middleton you know like I wouldn't be I wouldn't be giving up somebody who's like played better than him quite yet but if you have somebody in your league who's worried about Middleton long term I don't mind adding him but if you yeah yeah even if there's somebody that's been hot off the waiver wire you can package someone like that and and a low-end starter something like that and and work your way into getting Middleton I agree with Nick I don't think you need to give up much in order to acquire him he's not somebody that that teams are holding on to with dear life  do you expect Trey Murphy to get back to the same production he had last season  good question I love Trey Murphy one of my favorite you know individual guys in the league my answer is no because Zion barely played last season and that was a part of the reason that traversee you know had his little second year Breakout  I think he can get close you know I could obviously get hurt again that would certainly help him but yeah you just gotta remember that you know most of his you know breakout last season came out Zion and as long as he's in the lineup I think it's got too many guys you know they got to play herb Jones obviously Ingram McCallum these guys all need big minutes so as long as I have healthy my answer is no yeah love the player but a lot of that production came due to Zion not playing basketball and if he's out there he's gonna get his minutes so yeah same production know but he's still a player that I want oh let's see Westbrook is he a drop candidate or should you ride it out I would drop him wait and see I'd Paul George I guess I know that Clippers downplayed it after the game last night they said it was precautionary holding about in the second half so I wouldn't have too much concern there but I  I'm not a Westbrook guy I'd be right I mean he's playing like 17 minutes a game over the last couple of weeks I'd be pretty comfortable dropping him trying to unload Jalen green and Brogden for a point guard or shooting guard 14 team category League anybody come in mind this is tough because you know Jalen green is kind of doing some more things to last season obviously with Brockton he's been banged up you worry about a trade and just doesn't really match the rest of that roster in Portland so yeah I mean tough to hand out a specific player I suppose but if you're looking  let's see  I don't know I mean I  could you try I mean could you try to get like Zach LaVine Bi-Lo on him while he's out  I think you absolutely good who was who's who's trying to hold Zach LaVine right now I think if that person that has him on their roster specially if you gotta look at their record and see if they are they struggling to find production do they need wins and take advantage of situations like that I think that's a that's a really interesting player that comes to mind their all right we'll do a couple more and then we got to get out of here we're well over the the hour mark let's see Rodrigo says you guys prefer Jalen brown or Darius Garland rest of season  um I would I would go with Darius Garland man I I mean I saw him personally the other night at the Amway Center and he just went off the second you start to focus in on Donovan Mitchell which most defense is going to try and take him out of the equation as much as they can as hard as that may be it's just really opens things up for Garland he's become a better three-point shooter and he's a great facilitator he leads to him and assists as well  yeah I'm on team garlic here no question and category League's Jalen Brown's free throw percentage really hurts you he's never been a good free throw shooter he's gotten worse this season compared to the last couple I mean he's hanging around close to 70% the assisted her down the rebounds are down quite a bit I think the addition of poor zingus that's Rob him of two rebounds per game so it to me it feels like garlic hasn't even played that well and he's still been a better fantasy player to date and Garland has and I think all it is more upside the rest of the way so that's that's where I would lean all right a couple more heart and Stein and Caleb Martin for khris Middleton uh I don't know if I would do that  I don't um  I think I'd rather have hartenstein and and Caleb Martin  yeah me too at least for the next month you know I the thing with Middleton like I think I'm relatively high on him I still don't think he ever plays like 36 minutes A Night by the end of the season yeah they're saving him for the playoffs yeah the Bucks I don't think the Bucks care about the one seed that much like this entirely its title or bus from Milwaukee and I don't think they care about our fantasy teams either so no I mean Caleb Martin's production is probably gonna be pretty similar to Middleton notice for a while here so I would much rather have the first side of that  LeBron for Booker  I get LeBron is that fair rest of season it's fair um I think I'd rather have Booker but it's close  oh I mean LeBron's a better player it's just you think about Ron's getting hurt that's what it comes down to for me definitely fair though  you're incurring some risk with LeBron I'll just say that if you're doing well in your league and you're you know you're like the top three right now I probably wouldn't rock the boat but if you're if you're looking to make a move up then yeah sure go ahead grab LeBron oh let's see  we'll do one more here Obi topping  and on a high note is he still a 14 team 9 category hold considering and Nesmith that played well recently  I unfortunately probably not I don't know I mean what happened  like he's a better like real life player I think what he's running hot then he is a fantasy player  you know on the year it's like he basically gives you 12 to 14 points really doesn't rebound for how athletic and large he is you know only three rebounds a game on the season you know marginal 3-point shooting he does shoot a very high percentage that's the thing he's over 60% on the year so he is helping you quite a bit of yoga percentage but I I don't think you necessarily rule the day that you dropped over top of 14 Team league it's a good way to put it yeah he's a put back specialist so he's gonna shoot that high percentage but just doesn't give you a lot else and I think the I've been waiting for the Ben mathura in a sentence I think we're finally starting to see it and perhaps that does hold back top is overall value  all right last one coming in to the gun here George says hi guys appreciate what you do thank you George would you hold in a joy and pretty Simon's or should I sell High I would hold it for now I mean I think he's gonna be a complete monster later in the season we'll see you know he could be a shutdown guy for sure but he's also young enough and part of their core that like I you know I think Jeremy Grant is who I would worry about most important being shut down  I would hold Simon to me I guess like if you could flip him for like a bona fide top 25 guy yeah that I would think about it if you really want to but I mean I think he's gonna be a complete monster like this is a ultimate this is what we thought Jordan Poole would be right I mean this this is like he's like a good version of Jordan Poole for sure people were worried about a trade then I would be a shutdown I think for any Simon's with all the glut of guards they have Simon's definitely Brogden those guys might end up on the move but that doesn't necessarily take his fantasy value could end up in a good spot I think he's gonna keep doing what he's doing like I wouldn't you spent awesome these first three games hits the ground running his averaging like 33 a game you said to try to threes very good free throw shooter as well yeah that's something that's not talked about with him and he's like almost 90% guy so I would hold him I still think you could trade him in a month if you if you have the same concerns and his values gonna be about the same all right that'll wrap it up guys what for 80 minutes here yeah good question to
