welcome everybody to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by RotoWire rotowire.com slash try just type that into your your url amazing things will happen we came and tell you about them it's Friday March 8th 2024 Alex baruthi here with Shannon McQueen and Ken k train Crites oh Lord  let's Jump Right In we have a potential finals preview last night Denver gets the home win over Boston 115 to 109 yoke it with his 30th triple double of the Season at 3212 on 11 was bullying kristaps for zingas a little bit too well Aaron Gordon was was bullying the rims dunking all night off yolk hitch another players that you hanging out the dunker spot taking advantage of what seemed like maybe a little bit of a soft spot in the Celtics defense Jalen Brown at 41 points 14 rebounds but only made half of his 14 free throws  can I will let you take it from here since this is your Celtics well it was too great teams will say that and I think it would be a fantastic probably seven game final if they do both make it to the finals and it did expose Boston weaknesses which to me are two things uh when games get tight at the end of the game our Boston's executions poor they haven't had a lot of tight fourth quarters  Joe missoula's timeout usage is still weird and hard to predict  and then a little overlapping with that is Jalen Brown as as highlighted in what should have been a great game from he's having a really bad free-throw season 71 for the season so only shooting 67% in the fourth quarter almost makes between his bad handles and bad free throw you almost wonder if you should be really going after steals like the heat did to Brown last year in the Eastern Conference Finals because it's not gonna punish you with the line I will say this total side note I think Denver has a really great young bench gem in 21 year old Peyton Watson that guy's got some amazing lengths had some sweet blocks last night per 20 per 36 minutes he averages 3.1 stocks a game it's probably a better player in real basketball than fantasy but if you're in deeper League's I like Peyton Watson great NBA basketball last night so Boston's weaknesses are Jalen Brown's free throw shooting and Dean Wade right we've got that  yeah that Cleveland lost ugly Missoula I'd say Missoula got lazy and stopped coaching the bench  the bench guys and let the Cavs get back into that Dean Wade was on fire no a weird Oddity with Jalen Brown back to back games where he got Rim stuffed on a dunk attack that actually happens more times than you'd think and it's a little frustrating layups aren't terrible layups or not terrible Mr Dunk Contest who didn't win humiliated by a g leaker all right some bad news out of Minnesota Karl Anthony towns is out indefinitely they torn left meniscus good surgeries already scheduled he'll be reevaluated in a month could return early part of the playoffs maybe we shall see technically a month from now is still the like two games left to the regular season Kyle slo-mo Anderson with the start last night at 27 minutes and as he came off of bench for 26 minutes of run and newly signed TJ Warren and answering a trivia question whatever happened to 30 year old  TJ Warren he played 16 minutes in his team and she's in debut for the Timberwolves last night and Edwards of 44 points had a sweet game-saving block goes see that online if you haven't seen it yet anyway the T Wolves beat Indiana in Indy gentlemen though thoughts on this Karl Anthony towns injury  well I mean first of all it sucks for Minnesota I mean you know we talked about it Nick and I talked about this earlier in the year it's actually had not been had not been a bad year for injuries a lot guys stayed healthy this year whether you think it's a 65 game rule or not whatever but now injuries are piling up like crazy and it's getting pretty ugly out there and some of these games  you know I mean I still have to hope to be able to hang out of the one seed I just think without Karl Anthony towns if we're talking long term for talking playoffs not fantasy  I just don't think they can get that I don't think they can get to the Western Conference Finals without Karl Anthony towns yeah that'll be tough the good news is he he is uh you know the current schedule hopefully will be available for the playoffs or at some point early in the playoffs which they will need him you know my my vagus League wrote a wire team had Karl Anthony towns Scotty Barnes and Evan Mobley oh my God not a great week for that all right moving on to Golden State late Thursday night Steph Curry exit exits the game he exited the game with an ankle injury you have left with 3:51 left in the fourth quarter Golden State lost at home Chicago 125 to 122  courage he's only missed three games so far this season but teammates kind of implied afterwards that he might miss a few games it's definitely a boost for Chris Paul I'm assuming that's where I would be looking CP3 is 85% roster on Yahoo sets Paul is returned from his own injury he's averaged 9.3 points 6.3 assists  and 2.2 steals over six games while coming off the bench are we going to see Chris Paul and the starting lineup for the Warriors guys I think I think we could write I pods isn't really a true point guard they need someone to set up the offense with oh yeah alright Corey Joseph throw him in the start I would argue pods Legends I'm gonna argue pods is more of a point guard than Steph Curry but okay  I mean yeah I think so I'm gonna Dodge the answer to your question a little bit just by saying I think it doesn't matter whether Chris Paul starts or comes off the bench because I think he's just gonna see you know five to eight more minutes per game right and regardless of who it comes with you gets he's going to get a boost but that of course he'll ski should get more minute and maybe Moses Moody and Gary Payton and Corey Joseph but I think pajam ski is really the and Chris Paul have kind of the key ads here yeah they airpods has already been seeing the high 30 minutes he's averaging basically 38 minutes for game over the past five so Chris Paul would was like he's stepping in the storyline up I'm assuming and he's going to be worth a stream if he happens to be available in any of your League's 85% roster are already pretty heavily a heavily rostered in Yahoo leagues  well let's let's get to some good injury news Jalen Bronson and OJ & Obi are close to returning for the New York Knicks  Jalen Brunson is questionable for tonight Friday's game against the magic an adobe is now according to Frank Katz day to day after he is now back to doing contact in drills and has been playing five on five  Julius Randle  who knows it's like it we all the updates we get about Randall are just really vague not great he progressed a light contact like that's good but the regular season ends like a month  three of us have like contacts schedule today I mean right right you know they're fantasy wise  can you know if you're rostering if you've been enjoying the demon shenzo run I've seen Miles McBride that's that's gonna be mostly over when he comes back but what you sort of anticipate here with assuming both of these guys come back very soon Brunson light it up I'm sure I mean he's only missed a couple of games the fear with Randall and frankly I don't know B is yeah they're back but they're at like 80% you know a lot of Honor nobies fantasy gold comes from hot percentages but elbow injury who's to say he's gonna be shooting well when he comes back from this we'll see I mean you know he probably the other stats probably will be there but  certainly the Knicks you we know Tibbs though they'll get 78 minutes a night when they do return I don't care if blood losing out of every pore  tips let's see hey fans in the chat please ask us questions yeah we'd love to answer them we do have a query from a Christian Rogers thank you look at your leaping ahead here defend feedback well let's start we have any other news yeah we don't have any sponsors I mean I'm used to being the bad host for this and queuing you guys up to look smart with questions now I'm worried you're gonna kill me up with a question I'm sorry I'm just taking over its gonna do a one man ah thoughts on Keegan Murray Shannon should I should he trade Murray away before the playoffs start or is he worth holding on to he's in a 14 team category League  yeah I feel like this question is only coming through because of the game that the back-to-back games Keegan Murray's come off of yeah just the past the past this past week over the past two games 31 minutes each but he's only averaging 5 Points three rebounds shooting 33% from the floor but if you go back and look at the five six eight the 16th before that 175 2.5 stocks 2.73 pointers made Keegan Murray as Ken alluded to with his hand gestures is a roller coaster his Productions always going to be up and down like that I'm holding Keegan Murray in a 14 Team league he for me he's a whole  I would probably need like a top 60-ish player in return if you can get that via trade then it's worth exploring but right now I mean Keegan Murray's been pretty solid and I'm not gonna you know I I'm not gonna overreact from one or two yeah down games he'll bounce back in the next week or so well said Shannon and I'm going to jump in with the next question because I know host Alex has an opinion on this from Ryan Ryan wants to know  is Malachi Branham worth an ad after getting a recent uptick in minutes it's like he read my mind we had this chat just before the pod  so I I don't hate the idea of adding Branham because he is getting more minutes lately I will know pass three games he is shooting 55% for the field and 61% from three which is not going to continue  and one banana could miss some more games here so if you have like someday waivers  you know keep an eye on that  my personal opinion is that Malachi Branham is not good I really do not think he is good I have watched a decent Market Spurs basketball over the past two years when I'm feeling depressed I want a wall in that  and he's just out there just he's just kind of playing pickleball basketball sometimes and his efficiency is not that good he's like an okay pastor but it comes up and down  the rebounding isn't good he's giving you nothing and I mean nothing on the defensive end and look I tried with a lot of young guys he's 20 I look at the I look at the advanced stats I go on cleaning the Glass Great site almost every single box in terms of like  his Advanced numbers are blue as in like bad as you know just like your frequent bouts of depression I do like how your depression does help fantasy fans of RotoWire long story short you can add them all these hot because it's a Spurs and they might give them 30 minutes my but do not be surprised if he like delivers like 15 total points in four games for you or something horrible all right moving on next question because I want to fix it to a few of these James wants to know in Charlotte  train manner or might you  um well we'll talk about me such later but I will say definitely at Trey man should be rostered and if Trey man or Mitchell's available I would prefer man because the assist upside is similar  but man has more scoring upside  but I do have a do you have a different opinion Shannon yeah I think I'm going to meet you here it is a it is closed I think more minutes right yes he has been man is dealing with a what seems to be a minor growing right growing strain he's questionable for Friday night's game and that but that injury and Charlotte's injury reporting is why I'm siding with me to cheer this this groin injury who knows with Charlotte you know they list a player questionable for for multiple months so we'll see if man's rule out missed a couple games obviously like me Chichi is the where I would lean so I it is pretty close I think all things even if they're both healthy man gets a slight Edge but with this injury I am in a side with me to cheer all right I'm gonna ask the next question because I know this is another Hot Topic between Alex and I  Jason wants to know Trey Murphy or Andrew Wiggins  mom she started  well you know I'm Pro Murphy I've been a lobbying he's finally healthy he's the thing I think his really slow start this season's due to the well obviously missed a ton of games and then he had a slow start with the knee injury I think he's finally healthy and playing well and they really need some scoring Off the Bench for the Pelicans but Alex you like to point out that his hot shooting is not sustainable is that shooting is not sustainable but I agree with you just pick just grabbed three Murphy because Murphy even these two at least his personal life seems to be in order and Mercury Murphy if if you just take a season-long numbers he's basically going to put up similar to Wiggins and Murphy hasn't been shooting that while all season and if this hot shooting  if this hot shooting you know takes him up a level and then he levels out to like where he was last year that'd be great so you know don't expect them to keep shooting  50% from the field and 53% from three on 11 to 10 so like he has a past four games but I think he can I think he could stay alive a little bit and should be roster over weekends  and I I mean I'm in agreeance here give me Troy Murphy the third all right we're gonna end with a last question from Nomad and this might bleed a little into our  waiver wire section but no mad wants to know any Memphis players we can trust rest of season Vince Williams please but  rest of you guys who else you got  it that's why I mean Jared Jackson Jr has ruined there's many of them know never charged yeah obviously Jerry Triple J Janet Jackson Jr when he plays when he's actually on the court he is he is a very trustful source of production he's been playing well when active recently but he's also missed some games and if he has even a hangnail Memphis will sit him down and that's that's my worry whereas Vince Williams gonna be out there playing even if he has little minor bumps and bruises  I was a quickly James James says what about Obama yeah kinda odama he's just really inconsistent he would be number two for me that's for sure yeah that's Williams and then I'll download and everybody else is just scattered  desire Williams hurt is he out for a while I was yes just flip a coin I you know what  probably all right Alex take us to the money segment oh waiver wire so here's how the game Count goes next week Minnesota and the Lakers have only two games we have 12 teams of four games the rest have three games so as always before you drop guys before you add them streaming Etc check the amount of games for next week via the schedule and I will actually link our schedule in the comments right now so you can check that out my first suggestion Nas read of the Minnesota Timberwolves he is 65% rostered so in a lot of leagues you know he's gonna be off the table but content teams he could be out there so in weekly waiver leagues 26 minutes off the bench last night don't want to bury the lead Karl Anthony towns is most likely out for the rest of the regular season  the rest of the fantasy season 26 minutes last night for nasri 13 points only but he took 15 shots which yes bad efficiency but it's a good sign on the on the volume standpoint eight rebounds to assist stealing a block when he sees at least 26 minutes the season 17 points seven rebounds assistant gonna happen at one point eight stocks on the whole season regardless of who's in who's out one Fantasy Point per minute so in points League's you know all he needs is about 25 26 minutes a game to be worth roster spot they only Minnesota only has two games next week  so read this is a long-term play if you if you're streaming this is not a streamer this is like you add Niles read for the rest of the year kind of a play  Amen hard to argue I similarly have a highly rostered but need to mention this name player in Kelly the clinic Olynyk the former Celtic former heat former rocket former jazz current Toronto Raptor is 66% roster so only available in a third League's but as Alex said hey and weakly waiver Wireless could be out there and he's only only Rossford in 20% of ESPN leaks he's now starting for the Raptors with Scotty Barnes out for the season look you're gonna love the clinic one night he's going to break your heart the next he was over matched last night by Kevin Durant Most people are in that Suns game last night but hey Toronto loves them they just extended him two more seasons and he's Canadian the Raptors are just collecting Canadians they love Canadians per 36 this season Olynyk with almost 15 points eight and a half boards over seven dimes two and two point one stocks over one three-pointer with strong percentages when he's when he's playing well he gets a little bit of everything uh plus that sweet hairstyle Kelly the clinic Olynyk is my first waiver wire check for the week as James Chan mentioned and commented here the lunch lady is back I love it my first waiver wire suggestion of the week is Royce O'Neill Swing Man for the Phoenix Suns 35% rostered O'Neill has averaged 11.8 points 6.5 rebounds 4.5 a cyst 2.83 pointers and 1.5 steals plus blocks in 33 minutes per game over the past four contests Devin Booker's expected to be out until at least March 14th with an ankle injury and O'Neill's then a top 60 player over the past week we've already seen him fill in as a spot starter for Grayson Allen for Bradley Beal now it's Booker  he's probably I just feel like the sons are getting out always have one guy who's nursing some kind of minor injury and O'Neill will be getting heavy run even if he moves to a bench role again he will be seeing as much run off the benches any other player in the sun's rotation he has never gonna pop off for you know 30 points in a night but he gives you a nice well-rounded production and I think he's worth a look in many 12 teams at least until Booker returns their bench stinks they have no depth we mentioned O'Neill prior shows because of those reasons agree with everything Shannon said what I interrupted you there Alex sorry no deal is playing sort of a weird hybrid point guard role for them right now with Booker out he's a he's at the top of the key a lot facilitating offense and you can see that in his assist numbers he's got was a 16 assists in the past three games so I think the passing is real you know if you're someone who's like as the story on your passing thing real it's like he's out there passing the ball for them but yeah everything everything Sharon said is great my next we've wired suggestion Karis Levert of the Cleveland Cavaliers you've been to this well before I have 45% right it's better than the initial Matisse thigh pool well I thought about going back before  Donovan Mitchell is out through the weekend no real reason to rush him back after he got a platelet rich plasma injection into his knee Evan Mobley might also be out for the rest of the regular season that's a longer term injury and to be honest like yeah if you're in some deep religious look Dean Wade George nyang Isaac Coral like if you need to stream a man you got to do what you got to do but in the vast majority league is the Charis Levert show here Levert's past five games  13.2 points 8.2 assists 6.2 rebounds and 1.6 stocks he is improved defensively this season that's an important note something the Cavaliers coaching staff has mentioned and that all those stats were in 32 minutes he's averaging over a Fantasy Point per minute in the stretch these are obviously huge so yes Donovan Mitchell might come back early next week he also might not and if he doesn't  it's it's great and if he does it's like Levert's gonna be fine like you're not gonna get killed if you throw a vert and you're starting lineup and Mitchell comes back  yeah the cows would be crazy to rush Mitchell at this point there right they need a healthy Donovan Mitchell playoff run there's no chance them dropping to the dropping out of the top four they'd be nuts to rush Mitchell back  yes sir with Max Drew sauce I mean Levert's essentially the number two scoring options for Cleveland right now well said well said well speaking of Max truce how about a little Duncan Robinson Robinson has slipped down to 50% or Oster frequent free agent pickup mentioned on this show and others he started eight of the last Heat games for Miami in those nine games almost 16 points four and a half assists 3.7 triples shooting over 50% from the field and 90% from the charity stripe look you pick up Robinson to get threes points and percentages when he's on a heater he's on a heater now Miami though with only three games next week but if you need threes if you need points Robinson is a nice pickup right now yes he is absolutely so my next waiver wire suggestion is Kyle slo-mo Anderson shankh Yang asks would you consider Kyle Anderson a must add in category category leaks not a mustad not a mustache if you watch only move slowly move to your waiver wire he hasn't been playing as well last year he was he was pretty solid for the Timberwolves last year nine and a half five and five gave you two stocks per game you know he doesn't hit three pointers but the percentage yeah at least the field goal percentage was solid last year I'm not a big fan of Kyle Anderson this year but as long as he started I think he's worth a stream like Alex mentioned with knives read only two games next week so not an immediate pickup but if you still available in your League's for for the week 18 March 18th week he is a better  option then yeah I mean 30 34% roster he had that is moved up about 10% in the last 24 hours  slo-mo can still provide about top 120 value if you see in close to 30 minutes for game and he's a sneaky source of assist that's where you know if you're really looking for someone you know we've got Duncan Robinson we've got Roy so Neil now we got Kyle Anderson all decent sneaky sources of assist um Anderson was built in a lab to average 10 5 and 5 as a starter you can draw some Kyle Anderson Kelly Olynyk similarities Frank got imagine those bad hair slow too bad he's not Canadian get him maybe his Canadian at least the lunch lady can hit threes that's true that's yeah  um all right let's uh well we talked about this guy earlier but I will I will stand on that long shot my long shot of the week Vasily meat Church of the Charlotte Hornets who is 15% roster Yahoo leagues I know there's some Dead Leaves out there but I was shocked to see this is only 15% roster for meat Church Cody Martin and Seth Curry are out for at least the next two weeks and in Charlotte Hornet terms that means they're careers are over  there actually dead over the past three games for mechanically since these Kobe Martin and Seth Curry were ruled out meet you at 15.3 points 5.7 assists a couple rebounds and two steals in 31 minutes since the All-Star break nine points and six assists basically averaged just pick him up for the assist I mean don't even have to think about any other stats I mean if you're if you're in a 12 team 14 Team league even attend Team league and there's some guy out there getting you five six assists per game on the waiver wire just Adam especially the Hornets have four games next week so he's an amazing stream he could get you 20 24 assists easily  agreed agreed and like I said man's groin injury well I know Shannon you were saying earlier could be an issue yeah true who is your long shot Ken  I'm going to that mess in Memphis and taken Jake laravia look he could take any Grizzly who knows who the heck's plan for Grizzlies for the rest of the season but on Wednesday 32 minutes off the bench in the win at Philadelphia 17 points 13 points three blocks really had a lot of nice hustle put backs around the rim and Shannon's mentioned when will Jared Jackson Jr just sit for the rest of the season if I'm the Grizzlies I sure don't want Jack Jackson getting hurt last four games for laravia 15 points almost seven boards over one and a half stocks and 1.3 triples it is laravia I searched his highlights online last night I really wanted to say anyway he can create his own shot he can score off the dribble he can hit threes and for guys six seven he gets a surprise him on a blocks I could see him getting a lot of Run for the Christmas here  next year no  he was a 19th overall pick a couple years ago I mean they invested a decent among in him Grizzlies have had let's say mixed six success over the past couple years with some of their draft picks I think they would like to see what they have in him for sure  Shannon who's your last waiver wire suggestion I'm kind a little bit of an audible here I'm gonna do a two-for-one for my my long shot both the players are on the Toronto Raptors  we've got greedy dick  lottery pick for a Toronto Raptors and oh try abaji who is been starting for the Raptors since Scotty Barnes went down we'll talk about Obagi first three consecutive starts since Barnes suffered his broken hand in the first five star 13 points 9 boards two blocks he can a whopping 20 field goal attempts from the floor  the past few starts to bed pretty rough but he left one of those with the minor knee injury the new looks good now he returned to action last night against the Suns  not a great game though his offense rating was a pathetic 50.1 Obagi I I don't hate a bhaji skill set as much as some other fancy pundits do I think there's a reason why Toronto targeted him in a trade I think they they view him as kind of that that Anna nobe type template that they've they've brought up in the past about you I think he could he can hit some threes he can put up some defensive stats he has the skill set to do so as an early been there yet there's gonna be some rough outings but if you if you're in a deep enough League you know for as long as he starting essentially and playing heavy minutes I think he could be worth a he's a stream option to consider at the very least gradey dick is another guy I actually like he can knock down three-pointers you know they have Toronto actually has quite a bit invested in them they selected him 13 overall and the most recent draft he had a solid game last night off the bench 31 minutes 12 points yeah mainly mainly a three-point guy I was  four for 10 from downtown last night so if you need threes gradey dick is an option to look at he is 10% roster on Yahoo while obachi is 5% roster so both widely owned oh I'd be available like two quick notes on both those guys you just mentioned abaji 5% usage increase that's coming to Toronto that's very nice it's true shooting or is effective field goal percentage is down about 10% but if that goes back up like Shannon alluded to a good times are ahead he's also a better shot blocker for his position than a lot of other guys Ken mentioned liver Avia can create his own shot I was looking around Larry laravia played 326 minutes last year every single point he scored was assisted but this year only about half of his scoring has been assisted so he is creating a lot more for himself well would you don't have any point guards you got to create your own shot yes so he's out there he's out there doing stuff that is for sure  okay should we move on to yes it is time for the DFS segments starring Alex and I will be quiet and let you to make some fabulous daily fantasies suggestions for Friday March 8th  yeah like it's cook  all right so some notable eight game slate first of all so notable over unders Minnesota Cleveland's at 207 Orlando New York's at 2:06 these are bad obviously and then it looks like our highest over under is Minnesota Lakers excuse me Milwaukee versus Lakers 232 and a half LeBron has his questionable tag which he may as well just get like tattooed on his body at this point he's like a 90% chance he's going to play don't do not get me started on injury reports we Shannon we have them gray on the lineups page that we because we have to we have to and we will not get into that Shannon I'm the Slate where is the first place that you turned I'm actually gonna go look at the Atlanta Hawks and really Target some of these players that they have who should see increased roles We've Got Talent Johnson has been ruled out looks like you know he's gonna miss some time he's ruled out with Friday's game with an ankle injury he's considered day-to-day which at least that's positive but you have to assume you know it's possible he's gonna miss multiple games that leaves the door open first to be Bay to you know really have an increased role which he's done already in the past few games he played he's played 35 36 and 40 minutes over the past three averaging 21 points 6.7 rebounds and two three-pointers for game over that stretch so I like Sadiq Bay another guy in that forward role for Atlanta is DeAndre Hunter I could see DeAndre Hunter possibly getting spotted even here at least at the very least his role will increase for tonight's game so you've got all so  akong Wu is out as well so they're not gonna be plugging him at the four like they did early in the season when they were missing Johnson it's going to be hunter in beta that are going to get those minutes yeah and and you know Memphis is obviously terrible but and they try to they try to improve their defense by just forcing a lot of turnovers  which means they take a ton of gambles so there's a lot of opportunities for some guys in Atlanta just get wide open looks if those gambles fail especially if they're you know not Playmakers right they're like City Base not going to turn the ball over a ton for example he's the one who would benefit from an open shot  yeah I mean the injuries man injuries are really starting to pile up just in general on the slates you know Tyrese Maxey and beat her out melting out long term for Philly you know it's going to lead to some you know some Kelly oubre some buddy Heald some Tobias Harris I mean people are just gonna play a lot of a lot of those Phil Delphia guys and then we we kind of touched on what's going on with Minnesota and Cleveland earlier in the show where else you're looking I mean you really just going to Target for Value a lot of those you know a lot of those teams that have injury woes and then fill in more money with just like guys like Giannis and and the higher price safer floor guys yeah yeah exactly exactly I mean like you'd mentioned Philadelphia numerous players out Charlotte numerous players out so meet you Trey man Miller miles Bridges all those guys are on my radar for tonight's late if Trey man's ruled out I like me to even more he's only 5300 on DraftKings so that's that's a very solid option Washington is another spot where you have Bagley Marvin money bags Bagley has already been ruled out for Friday's game kuzma Kyle kuzma has been receiving these spots in place of Bagley and kuzma's been crushing it for what is it five five straight games six straight games of 40 fantasy points and he'll get he'll get well over 30 minutes he's only 7,800 on DraftKings so I like him tonight even even if he's playing out of position that Center all seems pretty safe against the Charlotte team that also struggles against opposing team's front courts so there's going to be tons and tons of injury options Cleveland the other one right we already talked about Levert we talked about Dean Wade briefly I'm not as high on Dean Wade I don't think our Optimizer kind of like some for tonight but even if he starts you know we're not going to see what he did in Boston that that rarely happens he's 3800 so if you need a player in that price range he's an option but I'm gonna try to look elsewhere give me Levert give me Garland give me Jerry Allen I like spending up on those guys with Mitchell and Mobley out and we should mention very quickly if you're playing in the draft DraftKings main slate the final two games of the of the day are not on there so that that excludes Milwaukee Lakers and excludes Houston Portland so you do lose a few sources of potential like High Rock High salary players that you could throw in there but you still have other guys in the Slate like SGA home Grand bam you know if you need to fill out your your salary because we are at the point of the Year where you may end up building a roster you're like I actually a 4,000 dollars left over and you actually need some points here  all right I mean any closing thoughts I mean this is a pretty small slate with a with a lot obvious value so we can we can wrap it up here yeah I mean nazreen other guy we mentioned earlier he's gonna be worth a look tonight whether he's coming off the bench or moved into the starting lineup and a possible low roster percentage play for tonight Scary Terry Rozier for the Miami Heat  he's only 6500  he's starting to kind of find his form with Miami he exploded for 57 fantasy points against Dallas he had four straight 30 plus Fantasy Point outings in the the two weeks before that he is a solid opportunity at 6500 you know there's not going to be many players who have 50 plus Point upside there Tyler Heroes probably sitting out again tonight so I've like I like scary Terry in that spot quite a bit and I do think the roster percentage will be a little bit lower than what you'd expect for a player in his price range I will say I'm surprised to see Rudy gobert only 7700 with five straight of 42 fantasy points at least on the towns is out so there's also intriguing but let's let's wrap that up Ken it's time for your old man ran  Ark  you know what burns my britches  drinking too much and buying ugly stuff look at this ridiculous
