welcome to a Monday edition of the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast at Whelan Alex barua here with you as we are every Monday afternoon want to welcome everybody watching a Long Live everybody who listens to the Pod archived on YouTube archived on Spotify Apple pods wherever you get them as you can see I'm sick my voice is going to probably go in and out for the next hour so just be prepared for some rough audio but as we do each week we will recap the weekend talk about some of our waiver wire ads what the schedule looks like coming up and just some of the major takeaways from the weekend and then we will open it up to live listener questions as we move along but Alex you now we're just talking off air we're both dealing with a bunch of injuries in some of our most important League's by nfkc team still hanging around all things considered but I have CJ McCollum there I have Marcus Smart I have Walker Kessler so we've been battling some big injuries and the latest of which is La Bella ball who had been on a complete Terror over the last couple of weeks you know felt like he was just like a nightly 35 and 12 with rebounds and Steals and threes but he goes down last night in a heap it looked like he maybe got tangled up a little bit I couldn't quite tell if he landed on Taliban Carol's foot or just landed awkwardly but very very concerning for lamelo he was able to kind of hobble this way to the locker room not really putting any weight on that foot I have not cheated an update quite yet I would imagine there's very little chance that he plays tomorrow night the Hornets are at the New York Knicks but I'm just at this point praying that you know we're dealing with a sprained and not a break for a guy who missed a ton of time with foot problems last year  yeah I so it's a I believe it's a right angle  that's the one he fractured last year so that's a problem and you mentioned it did not look good put no weight on it as he was being helped off the floor and  I you know it actually interestingly enough this happened in the same game that Terry Rozier made his return or was it his second game back I can't quite remember I think it was his return first his return game and Rosie goes for 20 and 9 just in 37 million minutes I guess first game back so he was ready interestingly this doesn't actually change that much I don't think because all I really think is gonna happen is assuming lamelo's out for at least a week which probably I think they're just gonna slide Rozier in that point guard and then we're still going to see the swords minutes you know distribution that we were seeing before for the rest of the roster yeah yeah I mean  it they've always kind of had one too many guys or maybe even two too many guys and we haven't we haven't gotten a good look at what the rotation is actually going to look like and maybe we never will because one of them is always going to be hurt but yeah even in even in rosier's first came back we can't make it through with a full of mellow game I'm probably going to cautiously sadly reluctantly put Gordon Hayward back in my lineup in our 16 Team league you know it's been very up and down mostly down lately but I think with no lamelo you know maybe a little bit more ball handling for Hayward a little bit more CIS potential again I don't love it it's a three game week for Charlotte but not a week where a ton of teams have four game weeks anyways so that's not the biggest concern but yeah we will see on the Bellow that didn't look good to me you never really could tell just based on how it injury looks but I I'm expecting at least a week or two I would be thrilled if it's a week or two for the Mellow  yeah 100% um it was kind of a an injury Riddle weekend in general you know Dr Ray Steve Alexander writes a weekend recap for us and I went through an agenda did that today and it was like uh you know lamelo injured Jalen Johnson injured doncic hand injury porzingis calf injury Durant foot injury so yeah tough tough holiday weekend  so in reaction to those injuries you know I mentioned I've been dealing with a bunch of attrition on my nfb Casey team you know my State team is in shambles for reasons other than injury so I do have Lori Market in there and we did get word that he will not play tonight to begin the week for the Utah Jazz you know who did you end up adding I know last week was a little bit quiet for you on the waiver wire but did you go and get anybody in any of your big leaks  yeah I mean so our stake league is 16 teams so in those League's and those leagues like there's no saddiq Bey there's no DeAndre Hunter that's not really an option again the lamelo thing I think it's mostly gonna be Rozier who I at least have so that helps me out I did manage to add Al Horford in the wake of the porzingis news I dropped Alec Burks this is telling you how deep this league is I was like I yeah I gotta get rid of Berks he's washed it's over I picked up Al Horford and then somehow in nfb Casey and this isn't because of any recent injury news I dropped Skyler Mays because my entire bench is filled with guys who are injured Tyler hero Jamal Murray camp Thomas Wendell Carter somehow managed to pick up Jaime Hawkins blue 14% of my total available Fab in that league but I only had you know we got 1,000 in nfkc I had 700 left I put in a bit for a bag 100 and ended up getting him which is pretty surprising because the more I watch Hot Heads I know this wasn't exactly a direct answer to your question but the more I watch hot as the more you see him play it's like he I think even when hero comes back that Haka is going to be playing like 28 minutes a game every night he's too good to bench yeah man I mean I'm glad you brought him up because I targeted him in my nfkc league as well I believe he's already been rostered for a while in the 16mm so that ship is sailed I lost out I did 77 he went for 82 so you know so maybe sometimes it's worse to like you know I like way overbid for Sam Houser which tells you where my rosters at right now basically I cut baby with Gary Trent in every League like every single year and you know like if you start on the right week he's awesome and he'll give you like three straight 20 point games and a bunch of threes and steals I've just had it with him the field goal percentage is killing me you know the free throw percentage just been bad he's been missing more days he's been hitting this year so I added Sam Houser my NFP Casey but I really really wanted Hawkeyes and I showed on up you know I see in retrospect it's easy to say that but came close with the 77 dollar bid he went for 82 you know I had that same thought you know when I'm looking through his recent game blogs that you watch all the highlights with hot guys and you know last night games is that 15 points five rebounds three assists deal over 50% from the field he's shooting almost 50% from three which at some point is likely going to regress but he's also been a good free throw shooter and you know you how can this kind of a jack of all trades like I believe correct me if I'm wrong with these actually guard eligible in the NFP Casey rather yes he is he is and that's actually why I needed a guard because I had to drop Skylar Mays so I was looking through the list of guards and I saw Hawkins and I'm like well I need to I literally have to get a player so I probably overbid for Jacques and you owned a bit the appropriate probably like 90 but no I think that's fine and that situation I mean I don't very few times in like any League do I end the year you know with like zero five dollars you know almost always I look back and say man I wish I would have gone bigger and it's not you know fantasy basketball is not really like fantasy football where you know Nick Chubb goes down and it's like okay there's a very obvious replacement here it's Jerome Ford I could fantasy basketball you have to work the margins a lot more week to week so you want to have some more room to play with and I get that but no wait what you said about about hero is the same question I had of like I don't I feel like these guys don't play the same position and yet Hawkins can kind of play every position and I do think you know when hero comes back that's what 27 to 32 minutes that need to be added to the rotation and the heat you know like Jimmy Butler's this time on and off at a bios missed a couple of games Duncan Robinson missed their last game so they're another team where you know when they're very rarely at like complete full strength but I think Hawkins has been so good and so versatile that you know here come back it probably diminishes his upside by what like 10 to 20% but I think if  you're in a really competitive league like the NFP Casey or you're in a 1416 Team league he's absolutely roster and probably still startable a lot of weeks  I think so I mean I'm looking at the minutes split right now guys who have seen increased minutes with with hero out it's been 14 extra minutes a game for hockey as Duncan Robinson seven extra minutes Josh Richardson six extra minutes and then a bunch of random stuff for like the yoga chairs and the highs of the world you know I think I think Miami would love to find a way to continue to get Hawk as like again 28 to 30 minutes a game even if that does come at the expense of guys like hi Smith and Duncan Robinson and although Robinson's been playing pretty well so it's it's hard to take that down but um yeah I'm happy to add you know every day heroes closer to returning yeah yeah so I guess that added Sam Houser as well yeah just somebody with the poor thing gets injury I don't view it as a long-term add necessarily but you know just hoping you could Bank a couple of three-pointers over the next week I mean he he's averaging 3.2 made threes per game over his last 12 and you know the vast majority of those games have come with Chris Tap Sports and gets so I still think you know even if even of course I guess comes back a little bit sooner than expected or I hang on to Hauser somebody that you're okay throwing out there just kind of hoping for one category I was hoping to get Isaiah Joe and stake League he ended up going for 14 bucks in a 100 dollar Fab budget League I didn't go up that high I think I only bid like six or seven which to me felt high for a guy who's still really flukey and you know kind of a Gary Trent in his own right but he's been a lot more efficient than Gary Trent he's spent a lot more consistent even on an OKC team you know where there's plenty of scoring options part of it for me was was like a little bit of a hedge of like you know I don't want to go too deep on the Josh Kitty thing but if he ends up missing time and you know that that you know continues to devolve then I think Isaiah was somebody who would you know benefit from a minute's perspective  yeah that was the mindset too I looked at him in terms of someone to potentially add  obviously revolving a giddy situation which we have no real information about  but yeah part of me also worried like  you know are they gonna are they gonna just continue to play him like 26 minutes a game I write you know I wasn't I wasn't gonna freak out if I missed out on on adding him because I think it's just it'll probably end up being more Touches for Jalen Williams and more Touches for Shea if anything yeah I mean he's also been like on fire lately and I think that's that's boosting him up I mean he had that 747 3 pointer game against the Warriors a couple of weeks ago I mean he's hidden like four and a half threes a game over the last five and obviously Jalen Williams was missed time as well so that's part of it and jail Williams will be back in the lineup tomorrow night so you know that's somebody that takes some minutes from him let's talk a little Jalen Johnson some of the big news from the weekend we got a question about him as well from Albert he says who benefits the most with Jalen Johnson out to be clear Jalen Johnson expected to miss four to six weeks dealing with a pretty major injury fractured wrist you know that's one where it is I believe to his left side so you know at least it's not the you know the shooting hand but nonetheless you know something that could certainly extend well beyond that time table I think the obvious name is Deirdre Hunter who's quietly been off to a pretty good start and you know he's somebody that I feel like I pick up and drop and pick up and drop every single year but he's gonna have a pretty nice Runway and you know last three games he's played 39 31 and 40 minutes  yeah I mean in terms of like you mentioned who's getting the benefit a hunter but so Jalen Johnson got hurt a two games ago you only played eight minutes against Washington Hunter plays 31 and then 40 minutes bogged down Bogdan which plays 21 and then 32 minutes babe Place 32 and then 29 minutes AJ Griffin played six and then 12 so part of me thought maybe they would leave they would try some stuff with Griffin that really hasn't been the case I think Quinn Snyder prefers the bigger lineup and yeah those are you know Hunter and Bay are the main two guys although both bogged on as well um so that Trio is the is the group to look into I don't know if I would necessarily  I might honestly prioritize bogged on because he's the most aggressive of the group he's the best pastor he's the guy you can take on the most usage  of that group but again he might not be available in your league so I look into any or all of those three guys yeah I mean DeAndre Hunter you know my main ESPN league is the stake League which again is 16 teams so he's been long gone he's under 20% rostered right now according to what I'm looking at so if you're in a 10 12 even 14 Team league make sure DeAndre Hunter is not available go grab him if you could still put in your claims ahead of this week but yeah everything you said makes sense I mean bug out of which is one of those guys it just kind of feels like he's plateaued you know I think we had higher hopes for him a few years ago but he still still really solid especially if you're looking at it as kind of a you know a month long fill-in for Jalen Johnson and you know Atlanta plays fast they put up a ton of points there's going to be fantasy value to be had what we got to get our token Bowie on ballgame question out of the way is he worth the at Detroit looks like a mess right now with their losing streak says Raya  I don't I don't know there's no way to predict this distance at this point right and Bob for what it's worth will not play tonight against Washington so you know if you're in a weekly League obviously it's pretty tough to chance that they do play three more games this week they played Wednesday Thursday Saturday so it's possible he could come back for one of those but I would not I wouldn't be putting him in a lineup this week but if the question is you know if you have a roster spot to grab him yeah I don't hate it I mean I think if you if you have somebody you know if you're holding on to like I don't know Jalen Smith or somebody like that the deeper League then yeah cut them and bring in Bowie on and just see what the minutes are but I I think I'm relatively low on what his upside is going to be like  most teams in this situation I don't think you view like a 35 year old Corner three-point shooter as like the solution but I also feel like Detroit thought they would be better so I could kind of see them going down that path  yeah I've had a lot of conversations with Friday basketball podcast co-host Shannon McEwen it's his Detroit Pistons he's a fan  talking a lot about you know with the frustration of Cade Cunningham the lack of spacing on the team and having Bowie on available fixes their spacing know he's not young but just from a functional basketball standpoint yes it's good to have him on the court the thing I think the thing you have to look at in terms of rotation who might lose magnets Etc the Pistons were like finally healthy they're the last game  I forget who they play it it was  Chicago  no it wasn't  you'll have to I apologize this I don't even played since like Friday all right yeah it was a long weekend Pacers regardless I think it was the Pacers um they finally had Jalen Duren back so we got to look at basically the real rotation um you know Ivy has been seeing more minutes kids up at the top I think where the slot where bojan has a chance to jump in maybe take some of IVs minutes because we know money Williams has been up and down about Ivy Isaiah Stewart and Isaiah livers I think both can see their minutes decreased and potentially Alec Burks and a Moody's playing minutes so I think there are 30 minutes available for bojan should you add him I know is like the big question  he's probably worth adding just to see what happens yeah um don't freak out if he sees like 18 19 minutes right off the bat because he probably has to work up into it he's 34 calf injury Etc but and a 12 team League he's probably better he's a good chance he's better than someone you have on your bench right now yeah I think that's what I would make the cutoff 106 smaller probably leave it alone but yeah if you're if you're into 12 teams I think you can find somebody to to cut and bring him in as a speculative add and I would probably do it now even if you're not using him this week just because if he does come back and as one big game and everybody's gonna be all over him so I think our final decision is tread lightly but overall worth an ad let's talk to CJ McCollum quickly Alex we got some good news on McCallum finally thankfully for my steak or my NFP Casey team he is quote aiming to return this week will not play tonight against the Utah Jazz which is a shame because that's a good matchup but the report is that he will probably play either Wednesday against the Sixers or Friday against the San Antonio Spurs so good news overall on that front because when you're dealing with a collapsed long I mean I think he's like the only other player I could think of was even have this injury right so there's not a lot to compare to like you could be weeks it could be months you never know but it looks like Mccalla will ultimately end up missing  about 12 or so games here and they should have him back by the end of the week that is huge obvious McCall was off to a really good start Pelicans should be getting Trey Murphy back in the near future as well that's big for them we do have the NC's and tournament week of course coming up next after this one and the schedules still kind of on announced for that one but after that you got a three game week for McCallum and then you got a four game week after that so good news overall on him yeah and then you know if your rostering Dyson Daniels or Jordan Hawkins you have to be careful or just take note of when McCollum Returns what happens to their minutes I'd have a pretty quick hook with both of those guys to be honest you know I mean we've seen Jose Alvarado make his return he played 23 minutes in the last 10 minute leak I'm not proud of it and so I mean that's kind of ridiculous actually that's like a 20 team lead I think so I mean maybe you know Hawkins might  you know see a bigger decrease in minutes than people imagine and then when Trey Murphy comes back I think the same thing could happen to Daniel's he's more of a guard but he's got Wings size  yeah I mean Dice and Daniels I've kind of been off of him like just kind of waiting for this run to to run out and I do think the return of McCallum plus Alvarado you know that that might be the end of him as a Bible fantasy guy but you know then he goes out and puts up six deals the other night against Utah and that's that's all really what you're using him for right even even during what's been the best run of his career here he's not doing a lot of scoring he's been super inefficient but you know rebounds have been fine it's just been there but you really off at the Steels when it comes to dice today Daniels I would say this is probably the last week that you're putting him in a starting lineup let's see what else we got here thoughts on that yakka Kong woo after the Jalen Johnson injury is that that's not somebody we touched on is there any is there any way we can spin this as like a trickle down benefit for a kung fu  um I wish I mean I will say you know he did play 25 minutes a game Jalen Johnson got hurt in the 27 against Boston although capella you know didn't play a lot in either of those games so it's hard to know exactly what to make of it personally  I think if Quin Snyder wanted to experiment with a Kong Witt power forward next to Capella he will try it more already  I don't personally I'm not like adding him if he's on the way for wire or expecting like bigger things out of a Kong woo  yeah I would love to disagree with you but they just  I don't know they refused to to play him more than like 25 minutes to feels like any night and even the other night he played 27 it gets lost in that was last night didn't really do a whole lot with it you know I think you could still you still keep around for you know lower end blocks production like you know I still like if you have enough bench spots or you're in a deep enough lie like I still want him just in case click gets hurt even if it's for like a week or two like I think a book and just completely go off in those situations but now unfortunately I don't think they want to play they can't really play cappella in a Congo together right so I don't know if we're moving challenges that no and at this point a Kong woo like we've had the cop we've had the okongwu conversation so much that we all know what we're talking about at this point if you're in a 12 team category League  and you're like losing like if you know you're like eighth or 9th or something I wouldn't even blame you for dropping him to just try to stream in other production I would probably hang on to him almost no matter what in a 14 team category league but again it's because you're going to drop them in someone's gonna pick them up but you can't feel bad if you're if you're doing really poorly in your league  we saw the return of scoot Henderson this weekend Alex made his return against Utah around Thanksgiving and play 27 minutes against Milwaukee last night that was a game that Portland looked like it was gonna send bucks Twitter into a complete tailspin and it did for half of that game and then the Bucks comes storming back they make a huge comeback and win it but looked okay 13 points five of ten shooting hit three three-pointers which is good obviously was struggling from three before the injury had seven assists at 17 minutes against Utah but we had a question about you know whether or not he's worth activating off IR obviously if you want to put him in your life if you have to do that but Nicholas asked should I drop one of Andrew Wiggins Gordon Hayward keyonte George Derek Lively or Spencer Dinwiddie in order to activate go scoot Henderson so would you drop any of those guys I would  I would consider wagons because to me the lamelo ball injury means maybe more for Hayward keonte is a starting point guard averaging like seven assists a game you don't drop that Lively is just a very good Center I think he's playing time and usage could increase as a season goes along and Don just gets more comfortable with them and did what he's on a heater right now yeah then we'll be saving one of my team so I if anybody would be it would be weekends but I don't I don't think you have to activate scoot this week I don't I don't think you have to  well and we have to keep in mind I mean our Nicholas is asking for a nine cat League too like the turnovers was good or not gonna be good yeah that's gonna be three four and nights and I  yeah I don't know man I I prefer scoot in my daily lineups I guess where you could Target certain matchups because I think there's still gonna be a lot of ugly nights I think he might hurt you more than he helps you but I mean Wiggins at this point it's like I don't even know I mean even on the nights at he's okay he's basically just getting you pointed to some rebounds right I mean the three-point shooting but terrible the three shooting's been bad like he's I think he's you know still a plus player for the Warriors but he's a better real life player than fantasy so yeah I think out of that group you could probably drop somebody I just temper your expectations for school because I still think it's gonna be pretty bumpy hey speaking of speaking of bucks games were you am I wrong or were you at the Wizards game the other man I was yeah at the in-season tournament game you mean oh yeah I was there for the Brook Lopez 39 point game yeah can I can we can we get like a take like a in-person what did you see kind of a thing they give us a diagnosis I will say it was a quiet 39 for Brooke I don't like I was not aware that he had that many points they announced you know Midway through the fourth quarter like that is a new bucks career high for Brooke Lopez like what the heck how do you have 39 yeah fun game obviously didn't expect the war the Wizards to hang around the way that they did in the Bucks the Bucks have like five chances to really slam the door shut with under two minutes left and pack audited missed both both ends of a double bonus that kind of wizards back into it but really fun game I mean three guys for Milwaukee scored 30 plus I think that's the first time in a very long time that's happened you know the institution tournament thing I don't know that most of the crowd was aware certainly most of the group that I was with was not aware I was feeling a lot of questions about the court and the uniforms and things of that nature there wasn't a lot of clarity provided in the arena as far as what's at stake here but you know it was a run-of-the-mill Bucks game but you know for me I was I was there as a civilian I was not there as a as a journalist or a podcast so you know to say that I you know had 0 push lights in my system would be a lie okay anybody checks from either team like a Wizard's Vibe check like a Jordan Poole well yeah so I mean he's Milwaukee NATO as you know was it wasn't super well received I think there's a lot of just you know questioning like why would you shoot that coming from him like honestly the guy who stood out most of you Corey Krispy he was on fire the kids he's going he looks really good dude like he looks awesome I mean the shooting form is obviously textbook and you said some really difficult looks Johnny Davis played a few minutes I was I was there with a group of fellow UW  Madison grad so that was cool everybody was excited and we saw him shoot and I was so Fielding a lot of questions about that I saw Sam Dekker this weekend went on a Twitter rant it was like what what did you guys do to break a shot I mean it looks bad especially if you slow it down not that anybody cares about Johnny Davis for Fantasy but I mean he's got he's got like a full-on Markle folds hitch going on balls moving around his wrist is moving around like he he looks like he's a danger of falling out of the league like we might have a like a James book Night situation here ah yeah I think it could be I saw a Twitter clip go viral about his shooting form and he kind of he brings it up and then moves it and then it's it like you mentioned it's bad so that's your that's your Dynasty talk five seconds on Johnny Davis offload him if you can  all right any other you know major weekend news that I'm omitting I know we talked we touched on the Brazil's injury I know Durant has missed two straight games I mean those are kind of day-to-day type of things you know Orlando has been on fire that's more of a real life story than a fantasy story Chicago continues to look horrible every single night I do think changes are changes are coming for Chicago and is there anything we can do fantasy wise to to take advantage of that you know I know Kobe white is somebody we've talked about like if you could have higher him I think there's a pretty good chance that they really turned him loose you know whether that's in a few weeks or a few months from now  yeah I like I like the the move to try to acquire Kobe wife from somebody or if you're in a shallow enough League you know pick him up I think I guess it's possible he's available in 10 teams I would I would maybe agreement stash him if you can and anticipation of some movement there other than that I mean I honestly don't think so you know I am I think I'm just out on Patrick Williams so I think it's fine like if you're again this is like if you're in a 14 team or you want to speculative add hymn because it's possible he sees 33 minutes and touches the ball more I'm not gonna really argue with that but it's like not gonna move on making in 12th no I I know there were was it like a year or two ago I think Patrick Williams himself said something about like I could be like Kawhi Leonard no that's not that's not happening now I mean there's there's been nice where he's playing like 17 minutes I mean he's like in Isaac a coral mode  yeah he's just a low usage I don't even know I still have I saw a Twitter Montage of him driving left and losing the ball like every time so that was all so alarming and then if you have any of those other guys like if you have food if you have Levine if you have the rose and even if you have Caruso you have to assume if those guys get traded their moving into worse situations  so you you probably can't sell because no one's buying but that's just a heads up  yeah I mean I think I think you can get value for DeRozan and Levine especially and I think vouch is the least likely to get moved so you know there might be like a second half  terrible team good stats run coming for booster because like nobody wants to trade for him right  with the contract probably not I mean I think someone would love to have him as like their um you know they're sort of like it's hard because it's like who's he gonna is he gonna start for somebody like is he gonna start for Dallas I mean he's so bad at defense I know our guy Ricky O'Donnell was just did a threat on that over the weekend and he was just like Lucifer can't guard anybody you know so like I I'm not saying like playoff teams wouldn't want him but I think it'll want him to start and play 33 minutes right like I don't I think I think you'd almost be like a souped-up Kevin Love this would be like you trade the Hawks trade a Kong woo for him or something insane that's all maybe a bad example but it's like but it's like you know he should be playing 22 minutes 23 minutes off the bench just sort of like an offensive Center specialist like he should be Bobby Portis right he's not right and he's better than that I'm not saying he's like terrible and should just be like at the end of his career but you know defensively if you're being realistic he just can't be out there for a team that actually wants to win games all right well let's let's hit

Bridges boldly or Bain who are you targeting first I think  man um Bridges is probably at the top maybe Bane it's either Banner Bridges at the top like because Bane  is like a 30th ranked player right now Bridges is 42 but you assume Morant comes back pain drops mobilize kind of also in that range to me those guys are more even I think I would honestly rather have any of those three guys then Butler Butler hasn't  played as well this season as he has in the past and he's been sitting like it was concerning that he was sitting at the beginning of the season with a knee thing I'm kind of concerned about his age and injury history if you're again I would I might lean  I don't know it just bridges used to go down campus comes back I mean technically Mobley might actually be the safest of this group  yeah I I think I think Bane is still the guy I'd probably want I know it I feels like you know Memphis has been such a disaster but he's he's still having a pretty nice year fantasy wise yeah the the percentages have been a little bit down especially the field goal percentage I think that's what's hurting his overall ranking like if you check out our rating at Road a wire and the return of Aransas is gonna you know take some of that off but I also think you know ultimately Bane is under qualified to be number one option so you might you might lose some counting stats with Miranda comes back but I think he probably picks up some efficiency yeah that's possible um  yeah I I so I think what we're trying to say is  it's probably Bridges like Bridges Mobly or Bain I I'm cool with you like what you're saying leaning towards Bane because it's possible again he loses accounting stats but gains efficiency when Morant comes back but this is a pretty again if you're like wondering you know who should you be targeting at any of these particular trade I think you're asking about  it's closer to a wash but we might lean probably Bay in or Mobley  interesting question from point blank Mitch what are your thoughts on OG's performance in Toronto are we expecting more upside would you trade De Anthony Melton for OG and an Obby  no but I get I understand why you're asking because Melton has been playing like really well lately you know he's got what is this nine straight game with double digit points  averaging 16 5 and 3 with 1.2 steals but you know Anna Nobby is is someone with a lot more upside who just hasn't been playing as well um I I would lean on anunoby still  his performance is Arabic up and down because you can be kind of reliant on the three ball he's not asked to create in the same way that siakam and and Scotty Barnes are asked to but you know an adobe basically has the same usage rate as last year his steals are down once this I mean once this deals come back up which I assume they will I haven't dug in to the deflections numbers but then you'll be getting better value out of OG  yeah I go OG as well you know tough to cut bait with belt and at this point but I think you're getting a steady or more proven player in OG and somebody who actually ranks higher on the season and I also worry about the Sixers trading for Zach LaVine or trading for someone else and you know at that point you know you probably see Melton regressed back to the guy that he's been the last couple of years  right  shengwen Brunson lamelo or Tatum Wyman Scottie Barnes I assume this would be like a mega trade question which side of that do you want  um  wow yeah I mean this is really tough to evaluate because I think this is like a this is a really fair trade I'll say for I'll start with to me this is really fair  because to me lamelo and Tatum are on the same kind of in the same tier one banana and bronzer in the same kind of tear Scotty and sanguine are in the same kind of tear so I mean do you do you have a preference well obviously you know right now it's tough not knowing lamella status so yeah you know if you're like trying to make this deal today I don't know that I would want to acquire lamelo but you know to me Tatum is the best player in the deal the study is player like I know could be better in terms of his upside but I I think I want the Tatum side just because he gives you 70 to 75 games of elite production every single year you know women he almost coming off of a huge game like what 10 people blind steals a blocks the other night and it's got great so I would I would lean toward the latter I'd walk Tatum webinars  I think that's fair it's a it's always interesting to me how fair like these like make a trades are and these in these deals so you have a you have a league mate that respects you for sure  going back to jail Johnson should I drop him in a 12 team league with no I else spot I don't I don't play in a lot of League's without ill I'm just say nfpc is like that I think he's been good enough that if I had him in that League I would be pretty wary of dropping him if you're in a you know attend Team league then maybe you think about it I I don't think I would though I don't think you can he ranks 47th this year is too good if he ranked 80th  and your team was bad I would say maybe but he's too good he's too good to drop  oh let's see a sar Thompson you see worth hanging onto for the Long Haul production is you know ticked down a little bit of late I mean the rebounds have still been there the blocks have still been there and that's really you know kind of been the reason that he's been so valuable so far almost 10 rebounds a game which is obscene for a guy who we thought would maybe play shooting guard for them he is not giving you anything for three I mean he's at 13% from Beyond The Arc so if a very unique step profile but I think he's worth holding on to I mean it's this somehow relates to you know the Boatyard bug and a question for early or where you know if he's coming back and he's playing 25 to 30 minutes I think a star is somebody who could lose some some tick there but I I'm not really looking to offload him I mean that's that's somebody that you basically got for free  no I mean we talked about this with Bowie on who's gonna get their minutes cut to me a sar again like more than anything yes Detroit does need three points shooting they need spacing around Kade but a sar man he's so good like he's so good defensively you watch him play he passes the eye test know we shouldn't be shooting threes the air balls them I've seen it multiple times but he's like there's so many other guys that they could decrease minutes to rather him so I think he's he's completely legit to hang on to  Ian asks us about Kawhi Leonard are we worried about his health rest of season and if so when is the best time to flip him and who can I Target in a nine category League I mean Health aside why almost been impacted more than anybody by the hardened edition which is a little bit surprising to me I kind of think of why is just being so bulletproof but he was coming off of a terrible game against Dallas again but they wanted to blow out so part of it was the only play 29 minutes but still two of 12 from the field I mean since Hardin showed up he's basically been like under 20 points per game the efficiencies spent down I think most of it you could chalk up to what just looks to be a mini shooting slump but that combined with the fact that he always missed his time I mean we talked last week I think with a similar question  I you want to ride Kawaii as long as you can but somebody like him you know if you could flip him for like another top 40 guy whose healthier which is going to be just about anybody I would do it he said it are their worries about kauai's health rest of season every season yes when's the best time to flip them as soon as you can um anytime if he has like a streak of three game start shopping them and exactly like Nick said you know he's ranked about 35th on the year he was being drafted not so far off of that if you can get somebody in that range I would absolutely do it if you're able to steal away even like Deonte Murray be able to get the Shantae Murray forum shangoo and you know I think a really interesting trade that someone might offer you or you could offer to somebody else would be like kawaii for me Simon's to me that's seems like a very sort of their problem for your problem kind of a situation those are the kind of guys I would Target or or I think a realistic  what about CJ McCollum or miles Bridges  oh Myles Bridges is interesting um McCallum  I think I would rather have Kawaii honestly because to me McCollum ceiling is not that high I think he's played really well to start the year but it's just not I think we what we saw last year was pretty legit in terms of miles I mean he has been playing really well and a lot of minutes I think I actually would I'm pretty sure I would I would trade Kawhi Leonard for Miles Bridges straight up yeah  yeah I think I would too I just don't want to deal with it with Kauai you know been through that one too many times so yeah hope those names are useful I mean I think dejounte you know the first name you mentioned is a really good call I'd kind of started in that range and you know fire some offers over maybe even said to you and if you're comfortable with all the returns just you know let your let your league manager pick which player he likes best let's see thoughts on Malcolm Brogden rest of season you know I had a big game I guess Milwaukee yesterday somebody who's played this season you know has been it just feels like he's so much more like competent and experienced than the rest of the roster that he's just he's putting up really nice numbers I think the big question here is just does he remain with this team and I guess does he also stay healthy  Brockton is a 32% usage rate this year like that's we're talking about like Jayson Tatum type stuff right now um  yeah I mean it exactly like Nick said at some point the teams going to be healthier scoot's gonna start playing probably 30 minutes a game Simons is gonna get healthy and then what's available for Brogden you know when everybody was healthy he played 23 minutes in the opener still at 20 points in five assists so to me again I would be looking to sell High because he is injury prone and the rest of the team will get healthier and he might get traded kind of like what Nick was talking about so um can he be a top 100 player for the rest of the year maybe sure he's 105 right now you know the shooting percentages rough because he's asked to take some bad shots  I guess my my final answer would be I would sell High  all right Paul has a question here or more of a more of a possible complaint depending on how he said I traded away miles Bridges and Kate cutting ham for Jaren Jackson and Dennis Schroder before miles came back watching Myles ball out as soon as he's back and it hurts did I do all right in this trade  I mean I was British might be the best player in this deal probably not I mean shooter I think is actually gonna hold value like I don't know really know what Toronto is doing but they have no other point guards and obviously if you took shooter at the end of a draft that's paid off I mean I'm going through it with Jared Jackson he finally broke his streak of like 10 straight games without multiple blocks together night but he's also barely shooting above 40% from the field like that looks like it's just going to be a huge regression compared to last season I don't think you got completely here I wonder why you decided to give up Bridges right before he came back and I told him to get by low on Jaron Jackson but I you know getting rid of Bridget and cutting him in this deal I don't think you're gonna win it the if you look at it now it doesn't look good obviously I you know I understand the process of what happened here you might be thinking well Cunningham and Triple J maybe that ends up being closer to a wash sugar is playing really hot you don't believe in bridges okay um  I just I feel like maybe more than a lot of other people like you know we  you know it's actually like on the Friday podcast we talked about bridges a lot in terms of like well the only time to do the qualifying offer or they committed to him why would they play him if he's not part of their future and I was always kind of pushing back in those conversations like they're trying to win games and Miles Bridges might be their second best player so I were gonna have made the deal because I think I'm hot I was high around Bridges than like a lot of other people but when I think about where you were at what you made this trade and what your mindset was like I get where you were for sure  all right another good trade question from Luke would you take capella and Murray deante Murray for Clarkson and Paul George in a points League  so I think  hello is not necessarily a must roster player in 10 team points like I think he you should roster him but it's not going to kill you to like lose out on him necessarily um  you know Clarkson I just don't know I don't trust him the rest of the season necessarily it's possibly gets traded or something like that I mean I guess I would prefer PG of everybody so I think I think I would lean Clarkson and PG actually  I think what George is just you trust the health you know we always say you missed he's missed more time than Kauai since joining the Clippers if you do then that that's the right side you're totally right on Clarkson like it's he's in the midst of a nice run here I think that it always runs out you know he's gonna have those weeks where he shoots like 30% from the field and I love to Dante Murray I mean he's been one of the safest players in fantasy but I think you got to chase the upside here with Paul George you know unless you're in a great spot and he just kind of want to reduce your risk the rest of the way but I would rather take the Paul George side it's Wendell Carter worth the ad in a nine cat 14 Team league or should I stick with mulva Wagner slash Golgotha  this is an interesting question because  the magic of plates so well without him  and he wasn't doing that well to start the year his usage was down his efficiency was bad when no Carter I don't know if I said that yeah um  so should you pick him up in a nine cat 14 Timur  he probably is worth a pickup someone I think almost inevitably will pick him up  but I  he's not so much of an ad like the rest of the season if you're asking me what I rather have him than Moe vogner or Goga yeah I think so  but um  I don't  the situation is a little yeah it's getting interesting I would say  yeah the fact that they've been playing so well is what complicated I do think if you pick them up I I wouldn't expect to start him necessarily right away but I think the kicker here is it's a 14 team leaked so yeah yeah I think you want them I mean eventually I don't see them like freezing him out of the rotation right I mean I think I think worst case scenario he's giving you like comparable value to those guys and chances are it's probably better so yeah overall worth the pickup it's not read worth holding it a 14 team 9 category League I would say yes I feel like I always love having nazreen you know whenever you have like a two game week for a couple of your big man you just toss them out there you know someone non-traditional in terms of the the numbers that gives you for a big man like he doesn't block a lot of shots he doesn't give you a whole lot of steals it almost never gets you assist and the rebounds tend to come and go when you have you know towels that go bear out there but you know it's a lot of Threes he's basically hit at least one three and every game but one this season so yeah I think it's been slightly disappointing like he was great to be in the year and you know it's been a little bit more hit or miss since then but in general in a 14 team  league you're probably not gonna do a whole lot better  yeah he's still in my opinion too good per minute to drop with the potential of gobert or towns getting hurt and I get like you can't have guys on your bench you just hoping that other guys get hurt like that's how you have that's how you end up with like a Kong woo and Nas read on your bench and you have TJ McConnell on your bench in a 16 team or and you're like I'm praying that these guys are gonna get hurt like you you eventually just lose your league when you do that but to me Nas is still one of those guys where he's good enough to play on a four-game week when everyone's healthy and yeah you yeah  all right we gotta address this holder trade Josh giddey  I mean we don't have any more information than anybody else the leaks that they're looking into it I think it's it's not a lot to me that Josh giddey played on Saturday you know didn't even do the token you know hold him out to just avoid any PR stuff that would again I just speculating here but that would tell me that I think okay see at least feels like somebody positively about the situation I mean I don't I don't want to go into all the specifics who knows I don't  know I don't I don't see the Thunder doing anything unless the NBA or you know the legal system steps in right I mean we've saw it you know I don't want to necessarily compare it Apple to Apples to Miles Bridges but we have that same conversation coming into the year and it was like  should they do something maybe but unless they're hand is forced I don't know if they will yes um  I don't know if it's super relevant I at least add some contacts the Thunder I think I heard Zach Lowe talk about this or someone else the Thunder are very protective of their players towards the media you know they don't they don't like a lot of internal access the media they don't like the media prying in on the locker room and stuff like that so I'm not too surprised that he played um I don't think  look you should trade anybody if you can get comparable value  so  I think if I if you if specifically you because we're all gonna have different levels of worry like again it's tough for me to say but you might be really worried about it someone else might not be so you can take advantage of that within your league your best I think your best move regardless of how you feel about the situation  and is to Target a player on another manager's roster who you think is undervalued or  basically that's it you think they'd be willing to give up you know someone that isn't playing that well and you think that person that player can start playing better because I think giddy kind of is who he is this year so I think that's the move and you sort of had yourself against the possibility of suspension  it's worth donating that you know giddey  like the county stats are good so depending on what kind of League you're in like if you're in a points League you spend better than he has in category leaks he's shooting 42% from the field so that's going to drag it down but you know even the the counting stats are down compared to last year and just about every category so he's not it's not like you're trading somebody who's off to this like fantastic start and you feel like you're gonna take a big loss like if you have any concern that he's going to be suspended like you said there's there's a whole you know there's 20 players you could probably make a list of and feel pretty good about getting back I don't think you're gonna miss out on some like crazy you know second half run from Josh Getty so yeah try to get comparable value try to Target somebody with some upside but even even if you just get back like a relatively safe player and just kind of put this aside and don't have to worry about it anymore I think that's probably fine too yeah because sorry just for for more context like he ranks 100 40th and 8 cat Okay so yeah he ranked 73rd last year so if you think maybe let's say you think he can maybe get up to 703 there are guys right now like Austin Reeves 80 Seconds Keegan Murray ranks 91st um you know Deni avdija ranks 109th like they're gonna be managers who might think trading Deni avdija is worth the risk or something like that so that's just more context in terms of what he ranks yeah and I think giddy has bigger name value than fantasy value right now anyway so I might be yeah there might be managers who don't think it's a big deal and are willing to you know not really give you not like necessarily demand a discount I guess is what I'm trying to say all right Ryan asks would you trade Kate Cunningham Pascal seam and Herb Jones for Trey young in France Vagner in a points League  um  so  I her herb Jones is an interesting part of this I think that's like it's almost its own discussion because he's playing really really well right now so with the Steals and Blocks he's won the best defenders in the MBA he's his passing his has increased substantially the question you have to ask is like when the column comes back and when Trey Murphy comes back  you know I assume herb Jones usage craters I assume his minutes maybe are more like high 20s as a low 30s so you're right to me it's it's more so like you're asking about Kate in siakam for Trey and France I think I would rather have Cadence Yakima points League yes in a point sleeve specifically I think so and and then you know having the third player and Herb Jones kind of puts that over the top in a Rota League I would go the complete opposite side of this but in points yeah I would I would hang on to those three yeah we got another question just below this Trey Murphy we're stashing I also have herb Jones  yeah I mean it's hard to say I Murphy they just give us no updates I know they said he's not going to play I think they played tonight yeah they play at Utah tonight he's not gonna be back for that I think he's within a week or two so he's gonna be back soon I mean there's just so many moving Parts here right mccollum's going to be back in the mix later this week Alvarado's back that it really affects Trey Murphy but you know dice Daniels can kind of play up at the wing as well I think eventually  you know I think Dice and Daniels his minutes take a pretty big hit I think Murphy there might be a ramp up period I'd be pretty surprised if he's just playing 30 minutes at night do you think we ultimately get a pretty even minutes but between Jones and Murphy we kind of complete opposite players in some ways  so I Murphy is a pretty good Defender too so that's the problem it's like yet technically you're losing something because Jones is a better Defender but Murphy's also good on defense so I I won't be surprised at Murphy's playing like 30 to 35 minutes a game and Murphy's closer no Jones is more like 25 to 30 for further context I actually had  Murphy in my 12 team NFP Casey League this is with four bench spots and no IR I dropped him because I was dealing with so many other injuries and my team was bad and I just had to get I just I couldn't I couldn't have them on my roster buggy has top 80 upside for sure and I think you're talking about a 10 Team league I think he's still worth stashing unless your team is horrible like if your team is horrible you just need minutes but he's so close to returning I might just wait and see yes he's hopefully gonna return it within a week or two  all right we'll go rapid fire try to hit as many of the remaining questions as we can gonna be out of here at about an hour so we got six or seven more minutes would you drop shaking sharp for Jayden ivy  and this is a bit of appreciate question because obviously started the last three games he had 25 that was easily a season High the other night against Indiana had 17 before that I would rather have sharp I think they're very comparable if Ivy still plays this at this you know Pace going forward I don't I just think like the Pistons do something different every week you know and they still have guys that could come back and affect this rotation I think sharp is frustrating and ultimately you know pretty inefficient not a lot of nights and Simon's coming back I get that but I trust that shaded sharp is going to play  28 plus minutes most nights the rest of the way and I don't think that's close to a guarantee for IV  yeah I was trying to sort of warn people about the sharp downfall that I thought was gonna happen  I think they're both over rated fantasy players I'll start there but I'm with you yeah I mean look I've had a great game the other night yeah 30% usage rate they finally got their starting five kind of in lock I saw a great clip on Twitter I feel like I've said that three times this podcast because like him playing very good defense and that's really what Mommy Williams wants from him so I understand thinking it could it could happen but I would I would still lean and I don't think you need to drop sharp for Ivy  ivy Brad Miller I don't know former journeyman White Center Brad Miller or I just assumed Brandon Miller I'm your Brandon Miller for the short term I mean you're working on the margins here right I don't yes really love either these options I would  try to wait and see on the Mellow if you can like if he's gonna miss extended time I think there's some trickle down and that that helps Brandon Miller who played 33 minutes against Orlando last night I was after well Bella went out I would rather have Brandon Miller than Jade and Ivy I would too but I will say  it depends what short term you're talking about if you're asking  I just need a guide to fill in for three weeks honestly I might tell you look to see who has more games over the next three weeks and just take that guy because to me they're very similar like it's practically a wash to me and I I'm probably lower on Brandon Miller the most people so I would say just look at the game count if someone's got significantly more great games than the other one just go just go with that guy  yeah I guess I was really worried about the percentages with Brandon Miller and he's not like 47% from the field you know around 80 from the line 36 from 3 like that if that's not that big of a concern I got I think the counting stats are going to be there especially Flamel Mrs time but yeah it's not it's not a you know a hugely in favor of one of the other but I go Miller let's see what would you try to get to jante Murray for Paul George or would you stick with Paul George I mean chances are you could do this trade if you want  I think this trade is available for sure if you if you have Paul George I think someone would certainly consider that um  I  I think I would rather have Paul George but I understand why you're asking and I think it could end up anybody could win that trade because it's all it's an injuries trade I I still I think I would rather have George honestly yeah he's playing well enough especially post hardened that it's it's tough to give up on somebody who's basically been a first round player so far so yeah this is something where I would hold on to George for like another month and then if he still is not been injured close to the all-star break then maybe think about doing it for the stretch run but I wouldn't want to give up on George quite yet what are some Fair Trades to try to get miles bridges yeah I mean we touched on a few earlier I mean you're  it's gonna be tough to get up right now of all times right I mean I think the time to trade for him was before he came back and I looked great and if lamelo's out that's gonna push his upside even higher so  I think you know you're looking at either like two good players or one great player I don't know I mean I I guess the way I would look at it is trying to deal someone like Kawaii or George or you know Durant LeBron even not that I would do those straight up but I would I would want to be dealing an injury prone player who I am I am gambling in this situation that that player is going to get hurt  I think that's probably the move  or to use the name I used before like an app for me Simon's but I don't think it's done right now honestly good luck cuz he's Bridges ball on his mind I I think I think what I think when Nick said is spot on yeah you're gonna have to give up somebody that you probably don't want to give up but like I said I would I'm not saying offer Kevin Durant straight up you know but you know it's gonna be it's something again somebody that you expect to get hurt somebody who the person here who Kyrie Kyrie yeah I would consider that absolutely I think that's a good one you know and again if you're trading someone like Durant or LeBron or whatever you know try to get something else back in addition to Bridges but it's gonna take somebody with name value because I don't think any attentive managers trying to get off of him right now  would you take Keegan Murray or PJ Washington on your team thoughts on their upside  um I well I think I would rather have Keegan Murray  um he has more upside because he's more I mean he's a part of Sacramento's core now has he been able to really scale up his usage when needed do they trust him a lot with the ball no not really but that's even more extreme for PJ Washington like PJ Washington's mostly a spot-up shooter who can occasionally pump and drive and catch a lob here or there but he also needs lamelo I think to really help him there so I would take K Murray yeah I think Washington's been a better player so far I think over the course of the year I would give a slightly into Marie if you if you need any blocks you know watching it could give you that you have three blocks last night against Orlando it's not always gonna be there but I mean we think of bury as this guy who's always launching from 30 which he is but I mean PJ Washington is taking a ton of Threes I mean specially lately you know he's taking nine in each of the last two games he had an 1138 game against Miami a couple weeks ago so I don't I don't know that they're all that far off in terms of if you're looking at it from a three-pointers perspective I don't know I I think I might go PJ Washington it's tough It's pretty tough to say I've been I've been a little discouraged with Murray so far  oh yeah he's not shooting that well I just assumed that will pop that'll pop back up all right fair enough let's see should I trade Malcolm Brogden for Daniel Gafford category league and he needs blocks is that too much to offer  no I think that's fair you know gaffords minutes of course they're not consistent but to me this feels like his floor in terms of like his role this year and Brockton actually ranks below him in eight cat believer or not and is an injury risk and risk of his role you know when when Simon comes back and gets better or they try them so I would do that yeah I would I would take for their all right let's hit a couple more here who can I Target with Laurie Markin in my fear is that he'll be shut down toward the end of the season I'm trying to get a top 15 player with similar stats but somebody from a contending team  you know getting top 15 values gonna be tough just because marketing you know is closer to like late second round value at this point but I understand your concern I mean we saw it at the end of the year last year with the Jazz and the Blazers shutting shutting guys down and certainly it looks like they could be in that boat again  man I feel like you're either gonna have to take somebody who you know feels like they're a little bit lower upside or you know somebody who has like an injury wrist something like that I mean  I would love to say you could get you know like support bonus or Bridges like are those realistic targets  um  well bridges yeah I could see somebody who has Bridges being like  if someone's gonna be Laurie marketing for him then I'll do it so I would say yeah I mean I Bridges is fine um you know maybe like a Desmond Bane or a Tyler hero or something like that you know  yeah you're probably losing that trade but if you're that concerned like ultimately this comes down to you like I I think you're concern is fairly valid given what they did last year this might actually be a better situation for a two-for-one you might want to trade market in for someone else's like I don't even know what a good a good comparison would be um like you know two players and like the  like Myles Turner and Tobias Harris maybe that's not enough but that sort of a that sort of a construction two for one  yeah I say float some offers I mean it sounds like you're being realistic you got you know kind of your correct target range you know you could try damn at a bio I don't know somebody I mean he's having like kind of a best case start to the season maybe maybe his owner thinks that he'll regress but I think you are right in general to want to avoid that late season risk of marketing being shut down or just the Jazz being terrible I mean I think it's having a good year but you know there's a lot of nights where he's not playing that many minutes because they're getting house by 30 and the fourth quarter and he's got you know terrible Playmakers around him so it yeah I'm going through that with him I'm going through that with Aaron Jackson you know two guys that are kind of difficult to get off of right now all right we'll do a couple more it's Bobby Portis worth an ad in a 10 Team league I don't think so no I mean a nine cat he's definitely he's better in cats butt  no I don't think he is I mean he does fine but ten team that's pretty shallow you're better probably streaming the spot all right interesting question we don't we don't talk a lot about you know roster diversification I have three magic players should I drop one to diversify my team as Robin he has Suggs Cole Anthony and Johnathan Isaac  this is coming from someone who has 16 Team league has Jeremy Grant Deandre ayton  and who else do I have from that team I'm playing Simon's Simons Jeremy Grant and DeAndre and I wish I didn't should you should you diversify  well you don't necessarily need Jonathan Isaac so I think that's your spot like I don't mind having songs and Cole Anthony my concern there would be what happens when folks comes back  you know used to treat wise but I think you're fine with that construction you just got to be wary of the false thing and I again you don't need Isaac on your roster property yeah if that's if that's like the true concern then yeah just get rid of Jonathan Isaac and you're probably fine just kind of playing playing the matchups seeing what happens with folds and maybe you got to pick between those two each week which is frustrating but ultimately fine all right let's see  better 12 team category hold cool Bali PJ Washington Jaime Hawkeyes or Xavier Tillman for me this comes down to two of those let's say you  I mean Hawks is my probably my guy here as we talked about at the top but coolie to me is more interesting than PJ Washington or Xavier Tillman so to me it's between Hawkeyes and Kula Bali but you you like Washington more than I do  yeah I would say it's hot as her Washington for me I mean cool Bali I understand it I get the other minutes and they're on a bad team and you know that should help him in theory but yeah I just think there's gonna be a lot of really down nights for cool Bali and unless you you know you're just desperate for the Steals and Blocks he's just I don't think he's gonna help you a whole lot elsewhere I think the three-point shooting is going to regress at some point you know he had basically there's like three games that are kind of bullying that right now he's not taking that many I just don't really see there being a ton of upside I mean if we're talking you know like a keeper League or something then obviously that's different but rest of season for me Hawkes versus Washington is really close and I feel like I mean I'm probably like way too high on PJ Washington but the hawk is thing I just I want to see it we know when Heroes back and they have so many options like Cody Martin's missed a bunch of time to yeah and with the Tillman we check address Tillman I mean his our most recent note on RotoWire is returned not imminent so don't hold him um I mean he's he wasn't playing that well even when he was starting and biyombo is actually been solid for them yeah to piggyback off this Ryan asked Sohan or Jacques and attend team points League  you know where I stand on Sohan I'm not I'm not all that interested  maybe a slightly safer bet from a minute's perspective but I think is the better player  points League makes it a little more interesting um my  man you know so hands role is actually probably more stable and from like a Fantasy Point per minute perspective they're actually about the same  I might actually lean so hand here even though I'm a hawk has guy but but a team points League I think the format  liens that  all right good one to end on here Alex and ask you very simple question from carpal Flex  when it will Zach Collins stop playing with us uh maybe never um I don't know I mean I guess the I guess sort of like what were you expecting from Collins is sort of like the overarching question not to say like you necessarily drastic I'm too high he's ranked 85th right now I guess it's the blocks production right he hasn't been blocking very many shots lately over the past seven games zero point three blocks that's sort of a thing we've talked about it before in regards to Jaron Jackson though blocks come and go so you don't want to freak out about that necessarily play next to one banana makes the rebounds all so incredibly inconsistent in my opinion he's been fine so um hold them and just keep keep plugging them in yeah the last two games have been bad but before that I thought he had actually a really nice run I mean he had like a 10-game run where he was 16 and 6 you know averaging around the block per game you're getting some assists there as well and he's also been shooting the ball horribly he's like you know one of his last 11 from three so I think that's pushing the percentages down a bit Yeah I think you said it right I mean unless you thought that Collins was going to be like a top 80 or a top you know 70 60 guy which was probably unrealistic is that about as good as he could for a team that's super dysfunctional and is kind of just getting blown out half the time so um yeah I think you're fine was that college it's just you know a couple down games doesn't doesn't make a break the season all right guys we gotta head out we
