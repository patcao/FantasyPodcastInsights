if you  welcome to the RotoWire fantasy basketball pod Nick Whalen Brandon Kravitz here with you as we are every Wednesday morning around 10:30 a.m. eastern time Brandon suffice it to say we have a lot to get to I know our guys Steve Alexander he had Raphael Johnson on the Pod with him yesterday they were able to break down the Terry Rozier trade the wall offer some more insight on that I have a lot of thoughts this far as what that means for Miami and of course we got to talk Adrian Griffin and it sounds like Doc Rivers as well who seems to be reportedly I guess shakily reported the successor to Adrian Griffin in Milwaukee but we'll get to that in a moment branded first and foremost how are you man I'm doing great it's been a whirlwind these last couple of days and on top of it all we had some monster performances the other day in the NBA seemingly all happening at once so something crazy in the water the other night 39 from Tatum 43 from KD in a winning effort somehow Karl Anthony towns gets up to 60 against the Hornets and they lose makes no sense and be dropped 70 so it's been a while a few days I was far as my Magic schedule goes they played a back-to-back Sunday and Monday I had some golf tournament media day responsibilities so I was it was a whirlwind for me over a couple of days and now everything is just settled down the magic don't play till this weekend and I'm just smooth sailing so kick back relax and ready to chat with you very charitable of you to mention the Jayson Tatum 39 point game the other night that was you know I'm most NBA nights that would be like yeah that was the performance of the nights they got buried by child's getting to 44 in the first half like you mentioned a beat 70 but we'll look back on those in a bit I I'm catching a flight in like I don't know five hours out of here going to go into Arizona got golf on the books 54 holes over these next couple of days so this is kind of my excuse me my last work obligation before that so I'll do my best to not be like you know mixing in all these like golf puns because that's really all I'm thinking about is getting to warmer weather playing for the first time in weeks and also a little concerned about what the game's gonna look like yeah I so I and I'm not the goal for the you are but I love covering the sport especially when the Arnold Palmer Invitational comes around and they had their media day on Monday and you'll love this who went out to the course and every year they set up a different media challenge so they'll be just some sort of game that they create and there's usually some sort of theme to it this year we had to recreate Kirk Kitty llamas 50 foot putt to win he had a two-putt in order to win and he was like an inch away from the cup and the actual tournament and so they wanted they had us shoot from the exact same spot on 18 it was a really it was just a cool to sort of reenact that and try and hit it exactly the way that he did and I missed but but was close but those in golf I felt pretty good about this distance you know you gotta you gotta kind of hit the ball to the  left and then it breaks right but you don't hit it too hard because then you know the role will take you into the water so you gotta have a little bit of a little bit of muscle but touch you know it's like there's a fine line there but I think I think I did well even even in the midst but he missed too that's the thing you go back to last year so he's a pro he is he is I know the process very well for pets like that it doesn't always doesn't always go my way I would say that's a pretty glaring weakness of my game as you know we've played together before that's not an easy you know that's no easy yes I will say though I have sense obtained a new putter since we played in Vegas I was I was at the time using a mini golf putter after I you know my previous butter and suffered an incident where the head literally fell off and I actually kind of was putting okay by my standards with the mini golf putter but we're back to a standard one I'm no longer embarrassed to pull that out when I'm playing with people that I don't know so we're moving in the right direction there all right a couple business items to take care of before we dive in as usual you know what we'll talk some fantasy notes in the first half of the Pod and then we will take all of your fantasy questions in the chat over the second half of the Pod so feel free to throw those in there now we're not ignoring them by any means we will hit those we'll hit as many as we can over the second half so keep stacking those up in the chat there's always make for a good God were brought to you by Underdog Underdog fantasies the number one platform for MBA best ball and DFS player pickup

addressed by the way Brandon you can see my room the backdrop behind me continues to evolve we no longer have like wallpaper that's peeling off of the walls we got all that looks great well we're going we're going with more of an asylum look right now it's very white in here I have some of the other walls painted once we get back from from Arizona we'll finish it up so this will continue to look better and better and less and less like I'm in some sort of lockdown situation and just want to get out of the narrative on that eventually you know I'll have some member Billy and things of that nature behind me such as my Rasheed Wallace Beanie Baby that I dive into display how do we get we need to get yeah I mean at least temporarily could you put up like a Fathead or something like that there oh the blade a Blazers Rasheed Wallace oh yeah it's a it's a collector item number 7,154 out of 10,000 I'm surprised there that many that's wild I I assume this must have been a giveaway at some point but I you know I I'm sure you do the same thing every now and then I'll go on these freeze where I'm like trolling eBay and insights like that for just like random memorabilia and look what you could buy a Rasheed Wallace Beanie Baby for 350 you got to do it that's three dollars and fifty cents not 300 dollars to be clear  oh for sure that's that's a steal  Austin Beanie Baby Market  yeah she was Beatty baby all right I think you should put together like an entire mid-2000s All-Star team with Beanie Babies let's get four more in the rotation if that was if that's a possibility I am absolutely in that is there's a certain Nostalgia for people around our age with that era of basketball even though it was yeah it wasn't a Great era in terms of the overall Talent like I think we have like twice as much Elite in the league now as we did in 2002 you know post Jordan there was kind of a lull there for a little bit but there's something about like the uniforms the logo's the guys who were making all star teams at that time that is incredibly nostalgic in a positive way well that's your childhood right there it is right that's the heart of it  the my introduction into the NBA was the mid-90s so everything like that that's not touchable for me and I think you're you're a couple of years later in terms of your I was born in 92  okay yeah so I'm seven years younger than you  so that makes sense in terms of what we view as Untouchable Nostalgia NBA Perfection whatever you started with is usually the in your head the best version of it yes Rasheed Wallace in a Blazers jersey exemplifies the start of your basketball love yeah I was a tough one to explain to my parents like why I'm like why is it where she was Jersey on your Christmas list as an 8 year old in Wisconsin but anyway that we'll do a full episode on that at some point all right let's talk rows here he now plays for the Miami Heat this this happened yesterday morning probably about 24 hours ago got that that trade news Kyle Lowry headed out to to Charlotte doesn't sound like he's going to be playing for the Hornets at any point no surprise there I think they'll try to reroute him if they can I don't know like I think teams are interested in Kyle Lowry I don't know who's gonna be willing to trade for him given the number you'd have to be kind of sending out like a similarly bad veteran contract that you don't really want so my guess is he makes it to the buyout market and then that becomes interesting I mean obviously he hasn't really done anything the last year and a half like the numbers of completely fallen off a cliff but I think there's still some value with Kyle Lowry and I think you know teams like Philly and Milwaukee would be in the mix for him but obviously that's not the exciting part of this trade the exciting part is Rozier Landing in Miami he's having a career here man I mean I still think  you know you when you're first thinking about Jerry Rose here it's like all right yeah he's back to back 20 plus point game Seasons but he's doing in Charlotte does it really matter this team's not winning games I think he's been fantastic man 23 points a game 6.6 assists four rebounds super efficient by his standards you know shot 41% last year he's up to 46% this year free throw shooting is up three-point shooting is up I was on Alex yesterday on the NBA show like if if I Miami and I basically had a choice between training for Levine and Roeser you know I think coming into the year obviously everybody would have said Levine is a better player like they're at the very least comparable and I think Rosie is actually a better fit for Miami like he just seems like a heat culture guy and I think you know Miami's has a history of bringing these guys in elevating them to a new level and I think Rosie's numbers likely Fall Off you know as a byproduct of joining a much better team but fit wise I think this is a home run and Miami didn't really have to give up that much  that's the interesting thing about it and I've been thinking about that with all these trades that we've been seeing the Raptors guys that have already been sent away and and now with Terry Rozier it seems like the trademark it is really affordable this year we're not seeing any trades that to me seemed like like you're having to break the bank in order to improve your roster look at what Miami was able to do they were even starting Kyle Lowry anymore and they have seriously upgraded at the point guard position and all they had to do really was was move off of a 2027 first round pick and I don't want to act like first Trump picks aren't valuable look at what time a hawk is picked at the back end of the first round is doing for Miami so if you hit right those can be great cheap assets but you only have so many first round picks over the years they can really fit into a rotation so this is a huge win for Miami not only because you have improved that Kyle Lowry piece in your rotation but because you didn't have to mortgage your future in order to do it the Rosier part I completely agree I think he's a better fit than a guy like Levine would have been because he answers that point guard problem that this franchise has had for a couple of years it's the reason they were in the Kyle Lowry Market to begin with they've been trying to figure this part out Zach LaVine doesn't really answer that question Georgie is more of a combo guard but I think he can play that point guard position allows Tyler hero to play more off ball and I I think it's just gonna help overall he's a pesky Defender so you know that should be a hashtag Heath culture sort of a fit as well I think it's a win across the board for Miami fantasy was not as good for Terry Rozier but certainly an uptick for the Miami Heat yeah it's a downgrade fantasy wise for Roger but you know Rozier had also you know his numbers had kind of regress back to what you'd expect with a mellow ball back in the lineup I think part of the reason numbers are what they are the season is lamelo missed so much time and you know currently with that like PJ Washington's out or Williams is out Gordon hayward's out so it was it was a Terry Rozier show in Charlotte for a solid month and it went about as you'd expect you know last three games before the trade 17 points 19 points 11 points he was still taking a ton of shots usage rate was still up there I just really wasn't shooting the ball well he's one of his last 18 from three so I don't read too much into that but yeah I think for Fantasy purposes he kind of do the rosie run was probably coming to an end once available ball came back but this is definitely a downgrade I mean obviously you're so fine with them you know if you want to try to capitalize and swing some sort of trade maybe you could but it's not like this is a disaster necessarily for Rozier you know Miami now has a really interesting  roster because you have with Rozier now for like all four of your your top four Butler out of Bio here and Roeser all these guys kind of do it all right they don't rebound well for their position they all average at least four assists per game it's like you have so many options where if you're in a playoff game and Tyler hero doesn't have it well there's Terry Rozier or Terry Rozier doesn't have it there's Tyler hero like it gives them there is a little overlap specifically with those two players but I think it builds in a lot of insurance you know one of those guys just having an off night in you know Miami it felt like someone of a Cinderella run to the finals last season it's certainly difficult to replicate a run like that but they were also without hero for the vast majority of the postseason and you get him back you add Rosie to the mix like I think their roster is in significantly better shape now plus Hawkes of course way better shape now than it was going into the playoffs last year absolutely and look at what they had to overcome in order to get to the point where they were in the playoffs last year the Miami Heat we're playing team they had no business they had to knock off a number one seed or anything it was number two seed that in order to make it to that point and then and then eventually the Boston Celtics as well but yeah they're not gonna have to do that this year this team is probably gonna be in the playoffs not the play in and so they'll have better seating they'll be able to set themselves up for a better chance to advance without having to kill themselves in the process Jimmy Butler went into god mode last year in the playoffs but like anybody would that was playing at that level unless you're Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant or Lebron James and so that's the way that's the whole list what was that Rasheed Wallace overshoe of course yeah sorry I apologize Rashid please send my regards to the Beanie Baby You're gonna run out of gas and that's exactly what happened to Jimmy Butler last year I think this allows them to be in a better position when the playoffs start and then also make sure that you keep enough in that Butler tank because at the end of the day terms of how far this team can go it's all going to come down to Kim Jimmy Butler produce at that level when you need him to  I go back to you know what they gave up 2027 protected first Lottery protected in 2017 if it does not convey then it could get a little bit dicey for Miami it would become unprotected in 28 but that's kind of what you have to do in the modern NBA if you look at just about every team that's contending right now they're pretty highly leveraged to terms of future draft picks that's just how it works so I don't I don't have any problem what's the weather with the price Miami paid I actually was a little bit less than I expected and you know getting out of the lottery deal that's big he wasn't really giving them anything kind of disappointed in how that whole situation work I thought was a pretty nice fit on paper but you know you forget how many miles are on Kyle Lowry at this point in his career so pretty massive upgrade their I you know I do wonder if Charlotte could have done better obviously I'm sure they shopped the rosie around to some other teams but you know in general I think picking up that that extra asset I mean we're to me we're likely heading toward like kind of another full reset for the Hornets around the Mellow you know it's like just PJ watching it become available I think they'll certainly they'll certainly attempt to trade Gordon Hayward you know at his contract figure that's gonna be a pretty difficult one but you know right now it's like how many how many keepers are on this roster for Charlotte she's like obviously Brandon Miller's played well lately you feel good about the trajectory he's on the Mellow already a star in this league but other than that I mean I was like Mark Williams when he's healthy he's look fine  yeah there's I still think they're they're very much you know in the mix for trying to find you know their future number two number three number four type of guys I mean I bring an in Gordon Hayward a few years ago that was always kind of a weird move and never felt like it was gonna make that much of an impact but I think he could be next I think there could be a few more moves coming for Charlotte if teams are willing to pay up yeah yeah I think the only piece is in terms of the big names that are on the Charlotte Hornets that you can be confident aren't going anywhere would be Brandon Miller who has played really well as of late and lamelo ball they're gonna continue to try and keep him healthy and build the franchise around him as their star guard I don't know if Steve Clifford's long for the Hornets but that's probably a postseason move or an off-season move but this team has 10 wins so I think everybody everybody's on the Block and they're gonna try and position themselves for the draft interesting to see what happens tonight two of the worst teams in the NBA go head-to-head and you have the Pistons is three and a half Point favorites so have fun with that one but yeah I mean the Charlotte Hornets team I think you're I think Gordon Hayward is definitely gonna find his way out in and could even be a buyout candidate if if they don't end up finding a trade partner for him I think Miles Bridges is another one that if they can find a trade partner they'll move off of him too in thinking about the Terry Rozier part of it and why it was why they were able or didn't get a lot for him from Miami or anybody else that may have been in the market I think it all comes down to dollar  he makes 20 around 24 million dollars a year and he's done an restricted free agent until 2026 so you were committing years to Terry Rozier a lot of teams that get into the trade market if they're going to commit to several years down the road they want a superstar if not they want flexibility and that's the one thing that Terry Rozier doesn't really provide that's true he is under contracted almost 25 mil next year but 2526 partially guaranteed that's his age 31 season so I think Miami does have the reasonable amount of flexibility here and you know I think they view Rozier as part of this course so it's not like you have a problem with him being under contract Beyond this season and you know you're not you're not taking them up through like age 34 or anything so I again I think this is pretty clearly a home run for Miami especially when you factor in the fit of Rozier let's talk Adrian Griffin let's talk bucks here and then we'll hit some questions in the chat I've been waiting to talk to you about this and since I saw the news break you you're up in that area I need you to fill me in on what the hell is going on with this situation I'm in just pure speculation mode over here  well none of this is surprising to me totally honest it's not surprising at all it is it a little surprising that they did it you know in the midst of a pretty decent stretch you know back-to-back wins over over Detroit yeah the big win over the weekend as well I you know this has been bubbling under the surface since Terry Stotts was let go since three games into the season you know it sounded like there was a mini revolts against Adria Griffin's defensive schemes I think Milwaukee made the right move like I asked our guy barotha on XM last night straight up I'm like  obviously you don't want to fire your coach 43 games into the year that's not it's not a positive typically you know I think the only time it's really worked out was the David Blatt situation which was eerily similar although that was his second season and of course they brought in tyloo and went on to win the title but you know I asked him do you feel better about the Bucks chances to win the title right now then you did at the time eight hours ago when Adrian Griffin was still the coach and he said yeah absolutely how could you not right I think this team it's actually amazing to be that they're 30 and 13 while very clearly not believing in their coach playing you know the rock schemes on both sides of the ball and yeah I think that just speaks to the level of talent and the kind of season that is having where you know you could be poorly coach nobody could be on the same page and you're still the second best team in the Eastern Conference my read on this and there's been a lot of reporting in the last 12 hours of kind of thing some of the typical postmortem that you get in these situations I don't think anybody like dislike Adrian Griffin the guy you know I don't think this was a situation where they just couldn't stand him and you know nobody nobody was receptive to what he was saying I think they didn't respect his coaching Acumen right I mean all the reporting has been everybody gave him a chance everybody was patient and it just didn't work out so if I'm a walkie I'm okay pulling the plug at this juncture doing it early enough in the season that you can you can install somebody and certainly looks like it's going to be Doc Rivers stepping in which we can get to that in a moment I'm not sure how I feel about that decision but you know I I think rather than waiting this out you know obviously the front office was well aware of how the players felt about about Griffin as a coach  I think they knew it was a sinking ship right so it's a dramatic move you know it's going to cause Ripple effects it's gonna be a big story in the NBA all week I get that I think it was absolutely the right call for Milwaukee absolutely the right call  I think it is probably the right call but the fact that it's the right call and it's this early in the season you just passed the halfway mark you should take a good hard look at whoever made the decision to bring him in and I think that their job should be in question why move off of Mike budenholzer who has been a perennially successful coach to bring in if you're gonna do it and you bring in somebody who has experience that can help develop the chemistry between a pair of superstars that are now playing together Adrian Griffin obviously wasn't that guy because they made this decision so quickly I don't know what they saw in him from a resume standpoint a personality standpoint that made them say this was the right move so that is a huge swing and a miss and for you to admit that you made a mistake this early in the season especially after the coach has helped the team win at least we think 30 of their first 43 games it is a huge red flag for the decision making in that franchise look at the only two coaches and NBA history that have been fired quicker for their first stint with the team so this like David Blatt wouldn't qualify Mike Brown with the Lakers qualified  what was that John beilein that'd be my guess not on the list Jerry tarkanian in the 90s with the San Antonio Spurs started nine and 11 got fired after 20 games couldn't win over the locker room and he was having panic attacks on the sidelines the other one was Bob Weiss who coached the Seattle SuperSonics when they had Ray Lewis or not Ray Lewis Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis and they went he went 13 and 17 through the first 30 games that was it those are the two so nine and 11 13 and 17 with David Robinson on one team Ray Allen and Richard Lewis on the other so clearly there were expectations that were not being met that's the confusing thing about Adrian Griffin you're falling short defensively but how can you say the expectations aren't being met when you're the second best team in the Eastern Conference so I am miffed by this I get that I get that and Jon B line by the way he made it 54 games that's way longer for some reason I was thinking he got fired like two months in so apologies to the beeline family for Dragon him into this mess but I totally fair what you're saying you know the process has to be questioned yeah I think the reporting has danced around it in some ways I think it was the honest this decision right I think that I think the Bucks front office wanted to hire nickname I think you honest did not want to play for Nick nurse for whatever reason there's been Rumblings that it came back to hey I want to play for somebody who played in the NBA and Adrian Griffin technically did play in the NBA he was a decent role player in the in the late 90s and early 2000s he was actually on the the Mavs 06 team that lost to the heat in the finals which I didn't realize he had played like that recently which I know is yeah long ago at the point but nevertheless you know obviously the record is one thing but I mean you probably don't watch the Bucks quite as closely as I do obviously you're more of a magic guy but something was off of this team and something was off and again I give credit to the bucks for not just saying hey we're 30 or 13 everything's okay because it clearly wasn't it really was not I mean there's been some I wouldn't say off-court stuff but more like you know kind of weird moments post-game you know it's like oh we won but nobody really feels like we won yeah pretty openly talking about you know some of the questions with the defensive scheme in particular Brooke doing the same thing I think this was Milwaukee getting out in front of something that was not going to end well it wasn't going to end well there's no guarantee that bringing in Doc Rivers salvages this right I would actually I would actually be okay with just handing it off to Joe pronti like see if he could talk Terry stops to come back in now with no Adrian Griffin it seemed it seemed like that was a one to one issue I don't think there's some sort of problem between stops in the players or stops in the organization I think he has an issue with Griffin but I don't know that this Bucks team needs someone like Doc Rivers like Doc Rivers when he comes in he kind of becomes the the CEO the face of the franchise in  some ways and obviously that's still honest day you know the doc's not gonna overshadow them but I just don't know if that's the right type of Coach I think you need you need somebody who's just kind of focusing on strategy I don't know that the Bucks need the personality hire right yeah I mean Doc Rivers you talk about a guy that can ensure in early playoff exit and that is Doc Rivers that is that it's been consistent over many seasons now with him as a head coach he's still chasing after he that second championship and he's lived off of that that title that he got with the Boston Celtics for a long long time now basically since Adrian Griffin was playing in the NBA if you want to timeline it well and that was that was at a time and you know whatever got you know Doc's got a coach of the year with the magic as you know that was at a time when the league was  in my opinion a little bit Talent deficient you know the Celtics roster was completely loaded at that point right I mean you had kg Allen Pierce good role players as well and you know I I'm not fraternity take anything away from Doc but you know I think a lot of coaches would have won the finals with that Celtics team is what I'm saying and it's been failure after failure after failure since then so I you know Doc is a name absolutely if you're Milwaukee and you're looking to make a splash Doc Rivers is about as big of a name as you could bring in I just I don't I don't know that this is exactly what the team needs so he did play in the NBA so apparently that's a big deal to honest well you do need somebody now I don't think you can just bring somebody in that is that is like a dream Griffin in the fact that they never coached in the NBA I don't think you can throw somebody in in the middle of the Season that needs to learn how to be a head coach and all of the responsibilities and the Tactical nature of it and every just everything else it's a big job there's a lot that goes into it managing not only the personalities on the team but also assisting coaches and media responsibilities you need somebody that's done it before that's been through the car wash for that reason duck makes sense but it's just so disappointing  now with the benefit of hindsight you go back to the start of this whole process this was a premier job being able to coach Yannis and then they add Damian Lillard to being able to coach a team that had those two players on it you could have hired anyone you want to and they would have taken this job if they were available and they blew that opportunity so we'll see what they're able to do now you're right last thing I'll say on this I'm very interested to see you know is there an immediate change for the steam their home for the Cavaliers tonight A team that blew them out and cats have been blowing everybody out somehow of late so maybe I saw that first hand yeah I put narrow I put him in a fantasy lineup this past week just hoping I'm like all right if I could just get like five total threes on the week that'd be a win you know but yeah eight on Monday so you  spent a monster I don't know what's going on with the cats but I am interested to see is there an immediate change right like does this team kind of snap back to looking like they did the last few years because I think that's kind of the undercurrent from the veterans is like hey we had a really good thing going here and obviously fired the coach who was the head of that so there's going to be some sort of change expected but I think this was like hey we know what to do we have for the most part the same guys you know we think we could replicate you know how we were rolling in past regular seasons like it almost feels like the players  you know have their own system that they want to install right and I think they were trying to instill that I'm Griffin earlier in the year you know I think one of the biggest faults for Griffin offensively and you know the defense is a whole different ballgame but you watch the Steam and like I think if you didn't know who Damian Lillard was if you're just somehow blindly watching a Bucks game I don't know that you would look and he'd be like oh that's the guy that they brought in you know to be the number two that's a guy who's a borderline top 10 player in the NBA like he hasn't really been used that way and I think part of that credit today for I think he's going out of his way to try to fit in but he's not he's not really taking over games in the way that he used it there's been a few spots here and there but he's just he kind of just looks like another guy out there and he's he's a very high level guy for the bucks but I don't think that's how you want this team to operate you know I think we sometimes we criticize the my turn your turn type of offenses but when you have somebody like honest you have someone like game like I almost think that's okay and I like to see a little bit more you know a game as the featured option and I think we do get that by default  so I mean it sounds like they just maybe they don't have a good combo game but then but they also don't necessarily need to get in each other's way so interesting I will be watching tonight because I think this is this is tracking to be a Milwaukee Bucks blowout whenever players in any sport get their way when it comes to firing a coach they lock in to prove himself and the calves are due they are overdue up after eight wins the longest win streak in the NBA this season is nine so it's hard to get there and they would have to be the team that is as focused as they've been all year and at home I think this  this would be a Milwaukee blowout so I'll be on the Bucks minus six and a half tonight watching on league pass  unless it's on national TV  I don't believe don't know I don't know what the national TV game is tonight I would believe that is the map yeah no that one's not it's the Mavericks and the Suns it's a good one too yeah that's Banger all right let's get some questions in the chats schizo 09 says 12 team 9 cat League scoot or Grayson Allen rest of season  boy these these Blazers are a tough watch I'll tell you that  I think I'd give my shot to toot though I  you know I know the percentages can be a little rough around the edges but I think he's starting to put it together a little bit more and Grayson Allen is just I like Grayson Allen but if you're comparing the two he can fade into the background too much that that sun seemed that's rounding into form I would lean Grace and Allen partially as I've said on the show many times because I'm a wuss when it comes to these type of situations I want to say for option and I think that's great to Allen right and you know it's been on a crazy heater over the last few weeks and that's going to come back down to earth at some point but especially in a night cat League the turnovers were scoot are a big issue I mean that's like three to four turnovers a game sometimes more the percentages obviously have been terrible like his last 15 games have been easily his best with the season 14 points six assists that's great you know almost four boards not really giving you a whole lot defensively you know he has one multi Steel game in that span just by playing close to 30 minutes and he's 36% from the field 74% at the line on a decent value almost for free throw attempts per game so like in a points League I think it is defensible but I think the percentages in the turnovers really kill you in nine cats so we'll split on that one George says good morning Nick and Brandon Good morning George good to see you so George was also asking where where we're from where we are I'm in Orlando and Nick is in Milwaukee yes yes we've got the Eastern Conference covered on this podcast yeah golf season also very far away up here in Milwaukee but heading to Arizona we're getting South this weekend I can tell you right now we have like still eight inches of snow on the ground so we will not be playing golf in Wisconsin anytime soon atheist says what up dickon Brandon shout out from Jakarta Indonesia  it's 10:37 p.m. here wow all right shout out to you expanding the brand I love it yeah  and it either follows up with the question he says Josh giddey was just dropped in his league as he worth the grab this is a yahoo head-to-head 12 Team 15 category league and for context this is your typical night cat plus field goals made free throws made three-point percentage double doubles triple-doubles and fragrant fouls all right interesting he says teach you have a kanal would be his drop he has Halliburton on ill so basically what he would drop McConnell to pick up kitty  I don't think I would and and I and I think the Halliburton factor in your lineup is a big reason why a one-for-one I would rather have giddy than McConnell but when I I'm guaranteeing that I have the Pacers starting point guard I think that's more valuable than giddy so I would hold and then swap when Halliburton comes back in a couple days  yeah I mean the McConnell thing's been weird like I thought we were set up for pretty nice run here from McConnell with with Halbert out in the minutes of kind of been all over the place obviously he's been mostly coming off the bench you know even when Halbert now the other night he only played 12 minutes so I you know there's certainly some steals upside there's there's a little bit more assists upside with McConnell but I think in this situation I would just grab getting and you're hoping you know how Burton's back by the end of this week right it could be only two more games and then he's back in the mix and McConnell becomes a little bit more relevant especially in the 12th kiddie guy but I think there's there's a little bit more there and certainly going to be more consistency with him then there would be McConnell all right zip says hi he's in a 10 team nine cat Roto leak he's punting points and he does not need blocks so with that in mind what are our thoughts on potentially trading Trae young and Chet Holmgren for James Harden and Laurie marketing he says instead of hardened you could also ask for Halliburton or Curry so it potential Blockbuster cooking up here wow could ask for Halliburton or Curry instead of instead of James Harden I assume that that's what that means I like that yeah and it's actually when you put it the way that you do points that's primarily what you're getting from Trey young blocks get a bunch of those Shadow and so now we're worried about that Laurie marketing up the stat sheet love the way the Jazz have been playing outside of last night's disaster and yeah I'm I mean Tyreese Halliburton is such a fantasy monster I would I would I would go for Halliburton and marketing  personality but you can sell me on James Harden for the 14th time this year  yeah I mean really any of those guys are fine for me you know I I don't know that you necessarily need to make this trade I guess if you're if you're super heavy on blocks and you feel like you're okay there then you know parting ways with chat is fine marketing doesn't really block shots is just points rebounds threes and percentages there so I don't really have a problem with that I mean Trey young versus Halliburton versus Curry versus Hardin those guys are all in the same general range I think  excuse me I'd probably I'd probably prefer Halliburton the most out of those especially if you think he's gonna stay healthy so I would start there and then kind of go down the ladder you know you're buying somewhat low on Steph Curry which is you know we're speaking in Steph Curry terms so he's still an elite player but I yeah I think this is the fine deal giving your category needs  Ian says he's in a nine cat League he's got a trade question here should he trade dear and fox John Collins and DeAndre ayton for Tyrese Maxey and Jeremy Grant so I guess I shouldn't say I know which side he's on here but basically Fox Collins and eaten or Maxi and Grant which side you want  my definitely want Tyrese Maxey but I'm not really in love with the idea of giving up to hearing Fox I think I'd rather have the the first  end of the deal deer and fox John Collins take my chances on him and  and DeAndre eight and I know has been frustrating but you get him back in that lineup and he's gonna put up numbers with the Blazers I don't know who else is really grab and rebounds there yeah I'm with you I mean  actually the best player in the deal so I get the appeal I  you know the percentages are better you know there's I I'm not going to tell you that not go get Tyrese Maxey but I do think this being a three for two makes the makes a difference for me like I think I just rather keep the three side of this one and I know Aiden's kind of a depressing player to own and Collins is all over the place but I think on aggregate that's still the better side here Jeremy Grant super inconsistent not really as good of a fantasy player and category leaks as you think I mean he's outside the top 100 on the year despite scoring pretty well there's nice where you just doesn't really give you anything else so if you know there's a third player that you could attach you know to the Maxi Grant side maybe that evens it out and you know certainly I would again much rather have Maxi van Fox but yeah I would stick with the three player side of this one  you know ask when is the return of Evan Mobley and would you trade him for eight and John Collins okay so kind of a follow-up here no idea on Mobley Cavs have been playing so well that like we haven't even thought about mobile and Garland in a while there was a report about a week ago that Mobley had begun to it some conditioning work that was last Monday they said the the projected six to eight week timeline that we got in mid-December is still on track so that would mean that he could be back as early as the week before the All-Star break I wouldn't be surprised if they just take it easy and he's not back until February 22nd when they resume play against Orlando so that would be the Mobly side of things  I don't know man I  if you need the immediate help then yeah because I I think you know you're getting three extra weeks potentially out of eight in Collins  yeah I tend to agree I'm not in love with making this move February mid-February will be here before you know it but if you're scratching and clawing for wins you get to do what you got to do and you can certainly do worse than eight and in Collins but if you have a suitable replacement for Evan Mobley and it's just a it's just a bit of a downgrade from those other guys I wouldn't Panic just yet um he's clearly going to be a factor he's a defensive player of the year candidate type of player and I know the Cavs have played well with out of him but they'll welcome him back with open arms with news available  all right well hit a handful more of these before we head out here's a good one who would you stash for the rest of the season in a 12 team 9 cat League scoot Henderson DeAndre hunter or a sar Thompson hmm  um DeAndre Hunter is a sar Thompson I'm out on at this point  love what we got from him at the start of the year I think those days are over scoot I can't quit scoot Henderson so I had between I'd be between Scoot and DeAndre Hunter I think it just depends on what you need  yeah I I think if you're shooting for upside scoot you know if you're talking about somebody that is not gonna be in your lineup most weeks and you just kind of want the option to throw them out there that would probably my choice I get I'm not the biggest scoop guy I think there's a disconnect between like his actual value and his future as a player versus his immediate fantasy value but not out of the question that you know he could be good down the Portland you know trades about the Brockton pulls back on some other veterans you know we saw it with Shane sharp at the end of last year I've had that incredible like 10 game run at the end of the season so I don't know I would say either a star just because if you're holding somebody for like a late season cash in I just don't know like DeAndre Hunter what's the ceiling here right is he's like the 85th best player over the last few weeks of the year like I don't know they got City Pay they got jail in Johnson so I would go scooters are if you're shooting for upside yeah he isn't played September 20th but he is he's an excellent player when he's out there so that's the appeal year a fair trade  yeah I haven't  yeah I haven't thought a lot about Burke Lopez lately I as he faded into the into the the background abyss and the fantasy landscape he got a great start I mean he's still a top 30 guy on the year is Miss zero times but every game you know it's kind of giving me your typical Brook Lopez stat line you know underwhelming as a rebounder scoring down a little bit 2.9 blocks per game though and that's really what you're after is the blocks yeah  yeah the the books overall have been as good defensively his stats are still good I is Brook Lopez yeah I mean I think that's a fair trade  yeah yeah I think that's fairly your target getting the blocks with with Lopez and you know you'd be if you're selling rules here you're selling high but you know I also think we expect a bit of a come down you know now that he is in Miami you think people should wait if they're gonna if they want to trade for Terry Rose year wait to see depressed numbers in Miami a little bit of panic because  he plays a more efficient but less volume-based role  yeah  we gotta follow up from a detail by the way Brandon says he went to high school one hour south of Orlando and all right oh born Florida great beaches down there I'm sure that was a good experience  I would certainly imagine probably probably better than going to high school and in rural Wisconsin where there are zero beaches great experience love it wouldn't trade it for anything but no beaches all right good question about the Jazz who are the most valuable fantasy assets on the Utah Jazz for the remainder of the season and how valuable is column Sexton  I mean Jazz continue to play well I think  they're obviously not a title contending team so anything could be on the table as far as what direction they choose but I mean Sexton has been awesome over the last few weeks if you held on in the early portion of the season when they were playing him 17 minutes off the bench you've cashed in I mean ever since he answered the starting lineup he's been at 23 points two and a half rebounds five assists really good percentage is 5242.89 over the last 22 games for Sexton yeah I they've been starting Simone Funke oh recently they didn't knock down some threes so I I mean as long as they're gonna keep him in the starting lineup that's sort of an under the radar on and off the waiver wire kind of guy that you could look at we talked about John Collins as part of the mix but I think it's really just it's the big name so that that's what's been carrying the load for Utah they've been playing great marketing Clarkson and Sexton is really been the reason why they've been successful over everything else so I don't I'm not falling over myself just because they've been playing well to add a bunch of jazz players  all right we'll do a couple more and we'll be out here Guilford says you got Curry for some bonus in a 12 team wrote a league what are our thoughts  interesting deal yeah anytime you can add to sabonis some I'm a fan of that you know Steph  is Steph is still amazing but I think we're seeing a bit of a decline I mean definitely a decline with the Warriors overall  but sabonis is just such a well-rounded player and the more categories you got to worry about the more interested I am in Dumont to sabonis because he does a little bit of everything so I like it yeah yeah I've liked both sides of this I think they've been they've been very comparable this season  you know very different players of course like you know if you're if you're giving up sabonis your sacrificing rebounding sacrificing field goal percentage but you're gaining a ton in terms of Threes you know pretty comparable in terms of assists at this point but you know really it's the rebound it's the field goal percentage and so bonus does kill you at the free throw line too and 5.2 times per game 67% so if you're getting Curry you know it's a big boost in threes it's should be a big boost in free throws as well George says thoughts on Miles Bridges rest of season love owning him so far but just concerned with the two game week during our finals week in week 21 interesting yeah who would you target if you were to trade miles Bridges  so Bridges about 50th overall on the season I like him as well you know you do worry a little bit you know we talked about somebody that could be moved at the deadline if they don't want to resign him you know he's expiring after this year I'm super players in his range right I mean it's sounds obvious I guess but you know could you get could you get bam out of Bio could you get to bar to Rosen you know Anthony Edwards only ranks a few spots ahead of him probably can't pull that one off but maybe I'll be tough you know someone like Franz Wagner I'd have to take a look and kind of you know Zoom ahead in the schedule to see what the game weeks look like but yeah if you're if you're in a good spot and starting to look ahead at your finals week that means you're having a pretty good season absolutely yeah I'd be lying if I said I knew what the with the games track like for all these teams coming the end of the regular season but I think some of the names names that Nick brought up would be yeah phenomenal ads France Vagner I can speak to for sure and terms of just him coming back from injury and and you know he looks like his old self again and so I wouldn't be I think some people may look at the game log and and get a little spooked because of all that missed time it's nine games  and then came back it was a little slow out of the gate but I think he looks pretty good Brandon Ingram be another one love the way the Pelicans are playing as well Desmond Bane with all of the work that he has on his back now and who knows what the way that the Memphis Grizzlies season is tracking he can end up being a guy that lands in an even better situation Kate Cunningham back from injury tonight if you can find a way to get him on your roster at I'd be game for that too James asked should I trade Jaren Jackson for Ant-Man and then he followed up and said he's thinking about offering Jackson Plus cam Johnson for Anthony Edwards  even will it with attention attaching cam I think I'm okay with this you know Jared Jackson could very well go on a crazy run over the next month but the efficiencies going to be all over the place like the shop blocking is kind of falling off a cliff like when he has to operate as their number one option he's just not the same guy on defense and you could find comparable players in terms of what he does offensively like the whole reason you took Jared Jackson early in the draft or paid up for him in an auction was because you thought you were getting you know 2.5 plus blocks per game on top of everything else he does and that just has not been consistent so I don't I don't answer it's been a pretty big disappointment you know he ranks quite a bit lower than you'd think on the year I would I would rather have Aunt the rest of the way so I would do that deal  yeah and I think the reason why is just he's not really giving you a lot outside of he's got good scoring outputs but I don't think if you were to Compare the numbers that he was that he's been as prolific as he was a year ago doesn't really do a lot of the defense event because their defense is anchored by those Frontline guys and those bigs and he doesn't really have to do much so and the 3-point percentage is way down so yeah I I still like Ant-Man but I understand the question I think I think I would go Anthony Edwards and just kind of hope that there's a turnaround coming  all right last one then we'll get out of here is nurkic and Kennard for Donovan Mitchell a fair trade  I would say if you could if you're if you're getting down with Mitchell then do this deal right now I don't know that this was fair I don't Kinard yeah can Arch been better of late we'll see how sustainable that is like you know even over the last couple weeks when he's been taking off he's still like outside the top 100 nurse had a fine season feels like he's you know gonna get injured at some point like he does every year so if somebody's offering you this deal and you're getting Dava Mitchell do it I think if you're offering this deal to somebody they're probably gonna turn it down  yeah scoring assisting  steals you're getting a lot with Donovan Mitchell and none of that's going away it doesn't matter when Darius Garland comes back or any of that so slam the button no it's not a fair deal that's why you should take it if you can't all right thanks for all the questions in the chat guys you guys make this fun pod for us to do hope it's informative every week we'll have Rick kamla and Dr Ray back on the mic tomorrow afternoon or actually no tomorrow morning it should be around 11 a.m. eastern and then Alex barutha Ken Crites and Shannon McKeown coming to you on Friday they'll be talking all things waiver wire do a little weekend preview Brandon enjoy the rest of your week man I know it's been a crazy couple weeks for you but enjoy watching the Orlando Magic I will enjoy playing golf the next few days we'll talk next Wednesday  good luck out there
