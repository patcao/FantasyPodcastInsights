what's going on everybody Nick Whalen Brandon Kravitz here with you I always want to point your direction Brandon but it's like you know disorienting on my end and I'm always pointing the wrong way so I'm just gonna point forward and we'll just kind of go neutral we're here with you it's Wednesday morning we do this podcast the road a wire fantasy basketball podcast in fact every Wednesday morning Brandon I know it's been a crazy week for you you've been at NFL owners meetings you got an Orlando Magic game to attend tonight you know we're at the point in the fantasy season now where you know everybody listening if you've been listening you're probably you know lapping the field winning your league you're in the fantasy finals but you know these last couple weeks we're getting a lot of train and questions a lot of beaches questions a lot of questions so we are happy to answer those they're all in the chat but we'll talk a little bit about you know bigger picture items the NBA Playoffs what's going on this week and you know going to look forward to the 2024 25 fantasy season so keep the questions coming in the chat you guys make this a really fun pod for us to do each week we'll answer as many of those as we can throughout the Pod I want to Dive Right In Brandon  the Milwaukee Bucks last night my goodness there was like three separate times I thought this game was officially locked up for Milwaukee they led by 19 two separate times including like Midway through the fourth quarter  there are a couple games that are candidates for this title but I think this may be the worst loss of the year for Milwaukee uh yeah I don't have the ranking in front of me but it's certainly towards the top especially as they enter this part of the Season where they really need to start ramping things up so that they're the best version of themselves going into the playoffs this was one of those games that I had Circles of I wanted to bet the Milwaukee Bucks and just didn't end up pulling the trigger I was on a honest prop last night that was a point away from hitting which is so frustrating especially in the double overtime game over 29 and a half points the guys scores 29 and goes for a season high in rebounds should have taken the pra will live to fight another day but yeah I mean that was atrocious I had some sleep to catch up on last night I'm watching this game and it's a blowout in the third quarter I'm like good okay so I don't need to pay attention to this I'll just go to bed I wake up and look at the score and go what in the world happened with without LeBron James as a actor here Austin Reeves went crazy with the triple-double and I just what happened to the Milwaukee Bucks offense that fourth quarter was horrendous  it really was man and you know I've been the guy who's saying like yeah I really like this version of Dame that we're seeing since the All-Star break and that is true for the most part game is has looked more like himself you know Chris Haynes who's doing Sidelines for the game last night on TNT you know  some might say a great story others would say I don't know if this is ideal but basically you know there's a game a couple of weeks ago where you know Doc Rivers was doing offense defense substitutions at the end of the game as most coaches do and apparently Dame you know kind of gave him an earful and said look don't take me out man I live for these moments I want to be on the court defensively on the one hand I like that you certainly like that mindset from Damian Lillard on the other I don't know that I want him out there for key defensive possessions he's the efforts been there he's just you know he's not a good Defender right and we saw that last night you know that the Bucks not only could not score that was the primary issue they had four or five possessions with about you know with like under three minutes left for it's like if you just get a bucket the game's probably Out Of Reach and they just couldn't do it yeah I thought it was a stat line for honest looks great it was not a great Giannis game if you watched a specialty late kind of looked like he was out of gas maybe wasn't 100% missed a lot of what my sixth grade basketball coach would refer to his chippies around the rim including one where you know in regulation great pass from Chris Middleton kind of looked like Giannis was in the right position to catch an alley open and lay that in you know after the game he implied he got followed there was definitely a little bit of a hold and a grab by Anthony Davis I think that did affect Giannis but it just didn't really look like himself last night and the Bucks needed a closer and  you know Dame he hit a big three to tie it I think that sent it to the to the second overtime I don't even remember but we are game from Yannis weird game from game not a great night for Chris Middleton who of course you know gets a longer leash he's working his way back but I still think the decision making by Dame is a little off like there's there's some of these threes where you're like all right he's open and then it passed out the last second the times he decides to shoot is the times that you feel like you should pass so I could turn Brandon is that we're like 70 some games into the season and it's like the Bucks are still working out you know the crunch time offense and Middleton missing so much time maybe that's a part of it but man you know I would like to say you watch a team like Boston and you think they don't have these issues but Boston just blew a 30 point lead the other night to the Atlanta Hawks so maybe we shouldn't overreact yeah but they do poorly happens so few and far between we end up with question marks about the Bucks seemingly every other week if not more frequent than that and they're the same sort of questions that have been around since the start of the year whether it's been Adrian Griffin or Doc Rivers is the head coach we know that this team is not going to win a championship because of what they bring defensively they they change the structure of their roster so that they would be better in clutch situations on the other side of the ball and now when that side craters they don't really have an answer or a way to keep up and that seems to be the biggest issue Damian Lillard over the course of this past month is shooting 40% from 3-point range so you can't say the numbers don't back it up that is three balls and falling but just watching the it's it to me it's a confidence thing and I don't think percentages can necessarily back that up all his overall season percentage from 3-point range is as low as it's been in this many games played in his entire career so maybe there is an issue and maybe the numbers can tell a little bit of that story but more than anything it's an eye test thing I don't see the same level of confidence and assertiveness from Damian Lillard so whether that's a chemistry 3 or an age thing this is why I thought this time of the year this would be a great time to bet the Milwaukee Bucks because they are entering a portion of the Year where they should be more talented than every team they go up against and they really need to figure themselves out so they get to use this final 10 games as sort of like a preseason ramp up to the season that actually matters that's what makes last night's game so disappointing because it did seem like they were trending towards actually checking that box and then they blew it and they're right back to square one yeah I think there are a lot of reasons that Milwaukee made the decision to bring in Damian Lillard and of course send out Drew holiday maybe near the top of that list was you thought you were done with the you know horrendous shooting games from your starting point guard I mean you didn't bring Damon for him to go nine of 29 nine of 29 3/14 last night from Beyond The Arc 27 points on 29 shots I know it's just one game it'll be just fine like you said that the shooting numbers have been much better over the last month or two then they were during that two months stretch when he really struggled like I don't want to overreact to one game but yeah I mean these are supposed to be the day moments right it's like you had three opportunities in regulation at the end of the first over time and then you know when the waiting minutes of the second overtime where it's like all right this is this is what Dave Miller does these are the moments that James lives for and he just he just didn't look comfortable I think that's the right way to put it on the Lakers side of things when you got to give credit here I mean this is the second time in three weeks that the Lakers a beating the bucks without LeBron James Angela Russell did his thing you know we handed out the over seven and a half assists last night on the road to wire NBA show he didn't need overtime time in order to hit it but he is now hit that in nine straight games when LeBron has not played nine consecutive games that has been the lack of all locks when LeBron is out just whatever D'Angelo Russell's assist prop is take that he had 29 and 12 29 14 and 10 for Austin Reeves in 48 minutes and Andy Davis man this was one of those games in what separates Anthony Davis from Janis yokich and B Etc you know the the elite of the elite big men is the consistency is not there but this was one of those reminders of like peek Anthony Davis to me is is in that tier like we you know what when you get his best game he's just as good I think as those guys in only had four blocks last night it felt like more I mean in terms of shops altered at The Rim he was kind of limping around for the end of the fourth quarter through both overtime periods hit a couple of huge threes for the Lakers down the stretch he finished with 34 23 to assist two Steals and four blocks I think you could argue this was maybe his most impactful game of the entire season yeah and I think any coach that you ever talk to would tell you that the the block is what shows up in the stat sheet what doesn't show up is the fear that is Created from an offensive player after their shot gets blocked and they go it might have a some room to get to the paint and then they decide to jack up a lower percentage shot or pass the ball off that's that's the real impact of a guy that's blocking shots left and right and when Anthony Davis is on his a game he terrifies competition to going into the paint when you have your best offensive player in Giannis who lives there that creates and then when he's kicking it outside you get a nice cold Damian Lillard doesn't exactly create the best recipe for Success on offense for the Milwaukee Bucks  yeah so Milwaukee  11 games behind Boston Celtics have already clinched the number one seed in the East I think that was a foregone conclusion last night didn't really change that and I do still like the Bucks chances to be the two  but yeah these are the games that kind of stick in your crawl right when somebody asked hey can the books beat the Celtics you're like well these are the games that make you worried a little bit but I don't like him I don't think they can't either I think they can I don't think they will you know to me I would say I've been saying the last couple weeks I think Boston wins that series 7 out of 10 times what would you say  um yeah I'd probably bump it up one or two just to be different Ada 8 out of 9 8 or 9 times out of 10 yes certainly Milwaukee can win when you have a player that's as good as Janis and and another they can get as hot as Damian Lillard can but this Boston team just they're better defensively clearly then Milwaukee is and if they get into a three-point shooting contest with Milwaukee they'll win that too so unless there's just no answer for honest I don't I don't see how how Milwaukee wins four games out of seven against that team  yeah and certainly that was not the goal for Milwaukee to be like all right let's get ourselves a 10% chance to be the Boston Celtics this year I think you're feeling like that was at least going to be a 50/50 proposition but you know we'll see how our opinions change if at all of this next few weeks Golden State got a big win last night absolutely needed this one to Stave off falling into a tie with the Houston Rockets they now for the time being at least preserve their their one game lead for the final playing spot in the west they do play the rockets in about a week for the final had to head matchup still just kind of a weird game for Golden State and end up winning this one handy know Jimmy Butler know Tyler hero of course no Duncan Robinson for Miami nonetheless though I think if you're a Golden State fan you'll take it you'll take anything at this point not a great game from Curry though three of ten from three 17 points for him he's really slowed down over the last month  yeah and I'll see him I'll see him at the arena tonight so curious to see how they're able to bounce back from the second of a back-to-back not so much a bounce back in the they won but they got to get right back on the horse and travel North it's tough whenever you go back to back in general in the NBA but two teams that Pride themselves on the defensive end that kind of want to ugly up games I think makes life that much tougher you love when you can get these these rare glimpses of the past from guys like Klay Thompson and I think dream on green overall has been playing better and and doing what he does rebounding and passing the ball and playing good defense Andrew Wiggins a decent night last night 17.7 rebounds he's still feels like he's sort of Lost In the Mix but I think the when you get you get enough good performances from the old veterans Stars Jonathan kaminga to me is The X Factor to all of this but this team is still staying afloat because of what they have found they finally found something that I think is now reliable going forward in the future of Golden State whenever this roster looks like you'd think Jonathan kaminga sort of carving out that role for himself the way that he's playing  so Golden State's got the Florida back-to-back they play at your or Lando magic tonight still like what we're seeing from the magic man I I don't know if there's anything they could do to convince me like all right this team you know for sure is going to win a first round series I think you know it's been so long since this team has been remotely competitive in the playoffs that I think there's kind of a proven factor with Orlando but we've been tracking the the coach of the year odds as you know Jamal Mosley's down to six to one now about a month ago he was 52 to 1 so hopefully you heated Our advice and you know through that in maybe he could have it I don't know if he's gonna win it all it's like minus 150 or minus 450 excuse me which is ridiculous to me for a number of reasons I think there's too much talent on that OKC team I think you all mostly embodies exactly what the coach of the year award is but what is our state of the union on what you've seen from more Lando lately and do you like their chances to take down Golden State tonight with the rest of age yeah they're in a really good spot in the year to rack up some wins because they are they are young and inexperienced enough to not let the bad opponents come in and get down for those games because they still remember being one of those teams so they tend to get up for games like that and then when you have a game like tonight where you've got the stars and the building and some national Spotlight attention they tend to get up for those too my concern is that when the lights have been turned up the brightest this year so that hasn't really happened all that much for this magic team as good as they've been and they've been excellent on their home floor if you're betting them they're the best against the spread team in the NBA this year so you've been cashing tickets on the Magic in that regard but they were they were in Prime Time against the Oklahoma City Thunder a little while that was about a month ago when Shaq's Jersey was retired in the rafters and they got in the wrong font yes and they got smacked in that game there was another game where they were on NBA TV against the New York Knicks at MSG with a win would have taken them up ahead of New York in the standings for the first time all year they got smacked by the Knicks in that game so two opportunities in what you would consider sort of a playoff attention level environment and they did not show up for those games so what does this team look like when they get to the playoffs there are definitely still questions looming there I think anybody that would tell you you've got full on confidence they're going to press through at least the first round you just don't know until you see it they're definitely good enough to do it I think if they're matched up with the Nyx they do match up well with them three in one against New York this year in the regular season series so that would be my my State of the Union Address is this team is probably gonna rack up a bunch of wins to the end of the regular season they will be able to escape the play in and then you just keep your fingers crossed at the regular season version of this team is the one you see not the lights are too bright version  yeah I mean there are three and a half games clear of the final play in spot which is nice and they have a 11 games left you know mathematically speaking they should be in a good spot to to at least of that and I hope we get Nick's magic as our four five I think that would be a fascinating series that is he serious that would be played I think if it goes seven games I would say at least four games are played in the 80s probably yes yes I don't know but those are two teams that get after it defensively not afraid to slow the pace down whatsoever I think that would be a fantastic series a couple other big games last night we only had four on the Slate but they were all impactful OKC New Orleans was fascinating know Brandon Ingram of course for the Pelicans Zion massive game 29 and 10 10 assists that is five rebounds and three steals played 39 minutes I love the version of Zion now we're seeing right this is starting to look more like Duke's on and it's not only that the passing has come along and you know not having Ingram is a big part of that but defensively you know the numbers are starting to be there too I think that was one of  one of the primary criticisms number one being he can't stay healthy number two being he needs to lose weight but even when Zion was playing and playing well in years past it was all right we see the flashes we understand this guy's a complete believe she shoots 65% you can't be stopped in the lane but a big part of his Prospect profile coming out of Duke was you know maybe this guy's not like a great defender per se but he wraps up steals he can test shots at The Rim in early in his career felt like that was just not there that's starting to now become a lot more frequent for him yeah this is really the First full season that we've seen from him in good shape it for the first time since he was drafted in 2019 at the beginning he was just trying to figure out how to be an NBA player I think for anybody no matter your hype level and maybe Viktor wynd Benjamin that was standing it's tough to figure that out in year one then the pandemic hits that shortens the season and for the people I've I had a chance to talk to a member of the Pelicans crew the last time they were in town and he said that he noticed a really big difference from him after the All-Star break specifically because it was the first time that they they went a couple of weeks without seeing Zion in person where the next time you saw him he was smaller not bigger and this had been a regular problem that if Zion went you know if there was a break whether it be off season or all star or injury the next time you saw Zion around the building that man was ballooning up and then this was the first time where he he stayed at home all he did was work out and eat good that's all this man did during the All-Star break and you see the way that he's playing since then the fitness is catching up with him I think he's realizing maybe some of the people that are around him that were yesing him to death he had to sort of remove that from his inner circle and and now starting to listen to the advice of veterans on the team guys like Brandon Ingram and Larry Nance that are starting to coach him along as the sort of teammates that he should be leaning on and this is the kind of player that you thought you would get coming out of duke it seems like he's finally figured it out took a few years but the the potential is clearly shining through at this point it all comes down to this man wanting to put his body in position to play like this and right now he is but we got to give credit to the veteran influence of Cody Zeller I think for for getting Zion know straight narrow here but no it's been fun to watch man this this feels like you know pretty easily the best two months stretch of his career and you know we're not even that far removed like this past offseason of people saying like man they should look to get off science like man what can you get for Zion right now it's like well that that feels a little silly in retrospect when you see you know what this guy is capable of thunder and eventually now that he's willing to put the work in you know like when he wasn't you know I don't think it was that crazy but yeah I'd much rather put him in the gym than put him on the trade block and and it seems like that part worked out still 23 years old by the way you know we're not talking about somebody who's 27 here Thunder win this game they are still number two in the western conference right now they're half game behind Denver is there anything okay see can do down the stretch to to fully convince you that this is a potential NBA Finals team because you could just see this narrative emerging right like they're in all likelihood going to be the two seed maybe the three maybe the one that they're not falling low three you know that could mean a match up with Dallas that could mean Sacramento could be Phoenix could be the Lakers could be the Warriors you know like they took me kind of feel like this year's Memphis right where it's like oh man Memphis gets the Lakers and round one I don't even wear the Lakers favorite I don't remember if they were ultimately favored in the series or if Memphis was a slight favorite but there are a lot of people who write fully said Lakers are going to win this series I think okay he's better you know I I think they're certainly a better starting five than the Grizzlies were throwing out in the playoffs last year they were a little banged up but I feel like we're gonna go down that same road again and I think I trust okay see more than I do that Memphis team but as far as you know teams that are gonna win 55 56 games you know they've been in the top two in the west basically the entire year it's still feels like there's gonna be a all right we actually need to see it in the playoffs before we fully Buy in absolutely because it's a completely different game these teams that they're they're like the magic but better you know this is their upside is the NBA finals for Orlando's upside it's making it out of round one so this team definitely has the ability to get there but they both have the same questions okay you have been very impressive throughout the regular season what do you do when you're playing the same team every other night and and you're and you're not going as deep into your into your bench because your starters are playing heavier minutes and now that doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing for the OKC side because their starters are great but it does mean that you don't get to beat up on a bad bench because there's so many of them in the NBA you know okay see has been feasting off of that throughout the course of the year The Starters play Heavy minutes so you got to see if you play Kawhi Leonard and Paul George you're going to see a whole lot more of those guys what is that look like come playoff time to shake Jill just Alexander's play drop off or step up when you get to that stage those are questions that we would all just be venturing a guess as to what that would look like in more so than in any other sport you do not know what a team is going to be able to produce in the playoffs unless you've seen them in the playoffs before because it's just such a different game and that's the thing with the western conference is that the guys we've seen there are on bad teams overall LeBron Steph Curry Kevin Durant we're not really buying into those rosters right now then you have young teams that haven't proven anything Minnesota has not proven that they're offense will show up in the playoffs okay see we haven't even seen what it looks like yet the New Orleans Pelicans no idea what that what version of that team is going to show up in the postseason so if you talk about trust in the west I can't trust OKC yet I think they could get there but I can't say I trust them Denver as the defending Champions so that one speaks for itself and Kawaii is one of the greatest postseason performers I've seen a mine entire life outside of that I'm throwing my hands up when it comes to the Western Conference well even you know the Clippers are what 8 and 10 since the All-Star break yeah the suns are starting to fade as well I think we have more questions about some of these teams that we thought would be contenders and still are you know I'm not writing off the clippers by any means as long as they're healthy but it's starting to feel more and more to be like Denver is going to to be able to march through this and it's going to be a difficult road but I think you've we've seen a couple reminder games I call them from the Nuggets over the last few weeks where like okay this you know this team can turn it on when they need to you think of that went over the Lakers and a win over the heat the win over the Celtics which was you know one of the most impressive wins any teams had all season but yeah the West is deep but I it's just hard to it's hard to latch on to one of these teams right now and say man I could really see that beating the nuggets in a seven game series I will say for OKC and all likelihood they're gonna Dodge the Lakers and round one  I think that would be the nightmare matchup for them they're one in three against La straight up they really struggle with the Lakers size and you know that the fact that the Lakers if they if they get in will likely be the eighth seed and probably face Denver which good luck with that one but you know okay C stays at the two or the three there's almost no chance they would play La in round one I think they'll take their chances with a team like Phoenix or Sacramento or Dallas but those are still you know close to top you know toss-up type of series to me despite OKC being seven or eight games better than those teams in the regular season I will say I think in terms of the betting Market I think okay see seven to one to represent the western conference is still really good at I think that's the best betting value because of how good this team has been if they don't if they are unchanged from the environment of regular season to postseason they can they can win this it should be if you could promise me that they're going to play the exact same way it should be even money across the board between them and the Denver Nuggets in my opinion but the reason why you're getting that discount is that we've never seen them in the playoffs so I would personally there are three and one against Denver during the regular season which is interesting but I also think  who guards you'll get a playoff series right it's like I guess by default it's homegrown but they fact that they went out got Gordon Hayward at the deadline I get it he got a basically for free I just they needed a better backup Setter you know and I think they needed to plan for that potential yoga series or that potential you know Anthony Davis series and I just I don't know if they've insulated themselves well enough for that but I mean Talent level wise there's no question the other thing I would say and this is not necessarily a knock and this was the case for them last year for the most part they've been the healthiest team in the NBA you know I think they've missed like 12 total games among their starters and like Jalen Williams accounts for half of those chats missed like one or two games sga's missed one or two like that that's certainly helps right this is Benny a overall pretty healthy season for the NBA thankfully but you know when you're the healthiest team in the NBA you're naturally you know going to go into going to end up you know winning more games so that's something to keep an eye on you know as we get closer to the playoffs I do want to talk real quickly on Dallas Sacramento this is the first of two matchups over the next couple of days for these teams they are the six and seven right now in the Western Conference Dallas a game up by virtue of blowing out the kings in Sacramento last night 132 to  96 and this one was over early in the fourth quarter I think the kings are another one of those teams right and they're kind of like OKC obviously they were in the field last year ended up losing to Golden State I think we like what we see with the Kings everybody loves Jared Fox we love to watch the bonus another team that I just I don't see anybody saying yeah you know what Sacramento Kings yeah give me give me them over the Thunder give me that over the Timberwolves in a playoff series yeah well why would you you know this was a this is a team that if it seemed like last year was the year for them without hot they were to at least break out of the first round now unfortunately for them they ran into the Golden State Warriors who were not completely dead yet and push that series those an incredible series maybe my favorite of the entire postseason last year but this year there were almost across the board their middle of the road on defense and they've gotten a little bit better defensively than they were a year ago but not good enough to wear you say I just feel so good about what they're bringing on that on that end and offensively they've been kind of middle of the pack they've slowed the pace down they're not they don't score at that toward Pace they did a year ago I don't know exactly what has changed I think maybe they're trying to play more of a playoffs style if that works out for them then  great but right now there's no reason to watch King's basketball and go I have infinitely more confidence in them now than I did a year ago I thought they could be one of those teams that made a little bit of a run with the way that they played I just don't see that same I don't see that same group out there even though the personalities of the same all right let's go to the chat we'll hit a few questions here got some good ones we start with Will Max strewth played tonight good question  these questionable he's been upgraded to questionable from out obviously he's missed you know almost a month at this point he's missed the last 12 games for the Cavs  as we always say unfortunately we report the news we do not have any any inside sources at RotoWire but I think this is a it's a good sign you know when somebody misses that much time and you know they kind of been ruling them out ahead of time in you know over the last couple of weeks and now he's up to questionable so I think there's a real chance Masters place tonight good matchup at Charlotte if you don't play tonight I would say Friday against Philly makes sense and then they have a another game at Denver on Sunday so  you know if you're considering a putting him in your lineup tonight that means you're probably in a daily lineup league so  just wait you know wait till you have confirmation if you doesn't play tonight  maybe you have to consider dropping him because at that point it just becomes a two game week he's coming off an injury minutes could be limited but as of right now Max Drew is questionable Matt says what's up guys what's going on Matt who do you like better for a head-to-head points League Bruno Fernando or Wendell Carter Junior they both play three games in the next four days Brandon and I'll allow you to speak on Wendell Carter I'll give you some numbers on Fernando he's played 19 and 26 minutes off the bench these last couple of games 25 points 6 boards in a block against Charlotte 13 points three rebounds against the Celtics his values obviously tied to you know what's going on at the center spot for the Hawks and they will be without a yucca Kang woo for at least one more game he's game to game at this point could return later in the week my knee jerk reaction would be to say window Carter but let's say you you've watched him more closely than me  he is struggling right now and I think he was just reading the tea leaves that this is not inside or information but  I get the sense that when do Carter Junior was told to toughen up on defense because he's been he's been getting torched lately and we've seen his offense dip but I think he's looked better on the defensive end better when it comes to grabbing key defensive rebounds and things so I think some of his I think some of his Focus has shifted and we're seeing that play out in the stats I don't think he's playable in fantasy right now he's just not giving you enough overall production and it seems like he's sort of  he's deferring more than than taking an offense of onus onto himself so I would look elsewhere okay yeah it is a points league so I think you're gonna get you're gonna get a higher rebound floor with Wendell Carter but I mean he scored in single digits and four straight games so you know it I think one school of thought is to say well if you struggle right now it's got to continue the other would say well can't be any worse you know maybe there's a bounce back coming they do get the next three at home they play The Warriors tonight the Clippers on Friday Clippers are 28th in defense since the All-Star Break by the way I mean that seems like a tough matchup and in theory it is but the numbers would say maybe it's not and then a pretty good matchup against Memphis on Saturday so I do like the schedule here for Wendell Carter if you can go game to game  you know maybe you go for Fernando tonight because you know for sure a Kung was out and then if you have the ability to to swap in Wendell Carter for Friday Saturday because the Kung Fu could be back you know later in the week for the Hawks I would go that route a Christian says thoughts on Larry Nance Jr is he hold or drop he's getting minutes but he's basically just been doing cardio out there he's been going Tony snow mode Jonas found Tunis only played 10 minutes last night yeah lots on pack you in the values thing has been interesting this has been a recent Trend I mean 10 minutes is him kind of bottoming out against OKC and you know okay C tends to play smaller maybe not a great matchup for him but they are going a lot more matchup based with Valentine's and they were earlier in the season you'll get his last 10 games he's only averaging 17 and a half minutes you know he played 20 plus against Miami you know he's matching up against bam played 20 against Detroit the other night you know in jail during was out there but they seem to be a lot more comfortable rolling out Nance they have so much depth in that front Court they can play small they can go Zion net Center if they want to  you know on the nant side of things  I always loved the idea of learning ants I feel like I'm always holding him in bench spots in League's and I've never starting in the weeks I should and he's on the bench when he when he plays well  I you know he's played he's played significantly more minutes and values so that's what makes this tough I mean we're talking like more than double the minutes of Valentine's over the last week or so I he's just like you said he hasn't been doing anything right I mean he played 33 minutes last night and took four shots and grabbed two rebounds so  I I if you're asking you know do you choose between valence units and Larry Nance  I I still think that he's giving you better numbers even though he's playing like 17 minutes a game he's giving you more than Larry Nance I think he probably plays more minutes against the Bucs tomorrow they got Lopez they got Giannis you know you're playing a Boston team that has some size on Saturday  so I think giving given the recent track record even though the minutes are really concerning I still stick with Valentine's I think that's the way to go if you're if you look at what Larry Nance has been doing as of late I think it just reeks of somebody that you want to drop off of your roster and it may be on a game by game situation he'll outscore Valentina but will be enough to over  sort of compensate for what the upside would be a Valentino's does go off I think the answer to that would be no and you can probably find somebody else that you feel comfortable with that's floating out there on the waiver wire here in the playoffs all right can you Kenny says who is the best two picks for stocks steals plus blocks the rest of the week also worried who might miss games he gives us some options Horford aldama Isaac and Sohan he's in the semifinals of a nine Cat 10 team Head to Head leak so we're specifically targeting blocks and steals here I'll let you speak first on Jonathan Isaac who's been fantastic  yeah he's been great and we've seen him take some hard spills lately and over the course of the Season he just keeps getting right back up so there's still going to monitor him because it's all about having him ready to go for the playoffs they play three games from now until the end of the week I would be shocked if he played in all three so it really just I think if you were guaranteed that he's clearly the answer here because you know he's gonna get you a couple of blocks and hopefully a couple of steals along the way you do worry about that missed game so I would say Isaac does feel like a safe option just because while he's out there you know he's gonna give you those numbers but be prepared that he misses one game over the next three yeah yeah so the Celtics play two more games Wrestle the week with Horford you know that's a pretty low upside to me aldom has been been racking up defense of stats but they only played twice the rest of the week they played tonight against the Lakers and then Saturday against Orlando which is not a great matchup for Memphis so yeah I mean Sohan is it consideration here he's averaging about one steal a little over a block per game of late looking at the Spurs schedule they play three more games they have a great matchup against Utah tonight they get the Knicks on Friday that's a tough one and then Golden State on Sunday which should be decent matchup I would say it's between Sohan and Isaac for me when you take the schedule into account but  are you saying you expect Isaac to sit one half of the back-to-back Friday Saturday  he yeah he'll sit and one of those guarantee in that case I just go so on you know I take the guy that I think it's gonna play three games when everybody else on this list is gonna play too all right Paul says I have better players in my opponents do good but I have fewer streaming spots by opponent has 50 games to my 45 with Caruso and Jamal Murray questionable I have three more ads to use my droppable players are Lopez Bruno Fernando and Middleton with the very dry waiver wire what's the move here  yeah I again depends on your league size you know if the Waiver Wires dry I you know I don't know if there's a whole lot you can do here I mean Fernando if a Congo misses the rest of the week and you get three games out of Fernando playing 2025 minutes that could be pretty fruitful yeah I still hold Middleton he was bad last night but I think in general you know he's gonna give you what you need Lopez has been interesting lately you know really fallen off in terms of the blocks production from earlier in the season you know you look at his last 10 games one block per game 0.5 steals you know barely over 10 points obviously he doesn't really rebound you'll take the threes with Lopez but he just hasn't really been the same defensive Force lately they have two more games the rest of the week at New Orleans tomorrow at Atlanta on Saturday so yeah I mean if you want to throw some of the waiver options in the chat you know we could talk through those it's just hard to say who's out there yeah you know I'm just looking at some of the guys that would be commonly either available or worth picking up maybe they have already been scooped he would Highsmith has been stroking as of late this guy hasn't missed a 3-point shot and his last two games so that's somebody that you could look at I think he's rightly available Delano Banton out of Portland I don't think a lot of people are rushing to the waiver wire to go and get him but he's been putting up some numbers lately so those could be a couple  highly available players that you could look at that you'd feel better about today athiya asks is Grayson Allen droppable after Friday to get more games in for my semis against the number one seed this is a head-to-head 12 Team 15 category League you know I I guess I don't know what the parameters are it's like if I guess if you're looking for somebody who can give you more games this week specifically you know if you're looking for somebody who plays Saturday or Sunday in that case I would say yes because you just you know you gotta win your matchup right I mean the sun's do play a four game week next week so if you are able to advance you know you might want to out there next week but I think if it's all about maximizing your schedule and you know trying to survive in advance you got to think about it I will say there's not there's not a single team that plays a Saturday Sunday back to back so you're choosing one or the other right there's a bunch of games there's 10 games on Sunday there's only three on Saturday obviously we got college basketball going on this weekend so if you you know if you drop Grayson Allen after Friday's game at OKC I wouldn't say there's like one specific team or like go grab somebody from this team because they play both days but it depends on the waiver wire and depends what categories you need at that point so I would wait it out you know we'll see where you are after Friday's games if you are if there's like one category where you know let's say you think you can win blocks and you gotta drop Grace and Allen to go grab somebody you might block two or three shots on Saturday I think he got to do it yeah just be careful you got to know your league in this situation because if you want him back keep in mind he's playing four times next week so that that would it might be worth it to just hang on to him so that you don't have to worry about that because you're going to want him next week all right keep throwing questions in the chat if you got any more well we'll be live for another 10 minutes or so Brandon I want to you know start looking ahead to next season as we get late in the year you know again hopefully everybody listening is still alive but a lot of people maybe start to think about next season as well and want to talk about some guys who we may want to avoid next season you know it's because it's been such a healthy year it's really tough to to point to certain players like all right there's something I do not draft list next year I mean lamelo ball is the one who comes to mind for me specifically but most of the guys that you took high in your draft of paid off for you for the most part you know I its it one guy who does come to mind though would be Nicolas vuskovich I do Wonder it's like it's this the year that that Cliff comes you know after this season whether he remains in Chicago or not like it does feel like we're trending  toward him moving into a different phase of his career at some point like I don't know if there's another team in the NBA other than the Bulls that would be willing to hand him this night role that he's had this season yeah I wouldn't be surprised if moving forward Nick vujevich is a high price backup big in the NBA and he'll be highly sought after for that role but is he gonna get the kind of usage he gets in Chicago probably not we've seen now two stops from Nick vujevich and both teams tend to tend to have the same level of upside so having him as you're starting center obviously caps your ceiling I think teams around the league or smart enough to have that that one figured out but he'll still have value just not the same sort of value I know this is I'm maybe controversial I don't know but won't you be a little gun shy in the top five with Joel embiid next year  oh yeah yes absolutely I would first round pick obviously but I would I would hesitate before I hit the button next season I would too I hesitated this year right I mean I'm you're just waiting for that injury to come and obviously it did this season but he played so well early on that you still in some ways kind of felt like you got your value out of him I'm trying to see where he ranks in total value he put you in a good position but man you were never able to replace that no right I mean he's still a top 50 player which is crazy because he's played 34 games this season and he's still in the top 50 that's just you know how good he was during that span but this is exactly what you're worried about right I mean you just it's really hard to win a fantasy league when you're getting sub 40 games out of your you know your number two overall pick or whatever it is and I think the other thing is there's just so many options at the top right I mean it kind of mirrors if you play Fantasy baseball right now it's like you got Ronaldo CUNY as number one and there's like eight guys that could go and just about any order after that so it's like not only are you taking that risk on embed your passing on what feel like complete shirt things in lucid and  SGA and Jayson Tatum and yanis and even Stuff Curry who started so bonus it would take right tomorrow you're on the clock right now are you taking the way I play Phantasy I would take some bonus because I'm just you know waiting on that embed injury again and you know these are these are stacking up right these are cumulative things that have flagged and B these lower body injuries throughout his career and yeah he'll probably be fully healthy at the start of next season but this is just another thing that you know kind of add to the medical history so I'm not saying I'm crossing them off like obviously there's a spot that I'd be willing to take to well and bead but if I'm holding a top three pick you know it's okay it's women Yama you know if you're in a points League it could be honest obviously SGA is firmly in that conversation and feels like he will be for the next decade I I think it would have to be  I think it'd be outside of the top five to be honest and maybe even a little bit lower  I think that's the right range because you when yeah I'm you got guys like Tyrese Halliburton  you know the sudden you start to look up and go I I would just rather have this other player love what we've seen from a lot of these other guys Karl Anthony towns the season that he's had I don't know if you mentioned Luca but of course you know he'd be in that conversation but yeah another one of the names that stands out to me as far as a bigger name that I'm gonna be a little bit hesitant on would be Jimmy Butler it seems like at this stage in his career he is in playoff Jimmy mode and Miami's completely comfortable with that so we'll see what that looks like next season but they play maintenance with him quite a bit I know he dealt with some personal issues this season and all of that I don't know what all went on there but just seems like they're not in a rush to play this guy more than 70 games in the season  I don't think they're in a rush to do it I don't think he's in a rush to do it and you know I mean if you drafted Butler this year you know in some legs he had to spend a late second early third round pick on him and you know the same logic applies as far as you know picking in the top 10 versus the top 30 just there's so much depth in the league right now that you're you're passing on guys who you can almost lock in for maybe 15 more games than Jimmy Butler so I'm with you there what are you gonna do is Ion you know are we back in on trusting Zion is that are the days of the Zion draft discount now over oh yeah no those are done he's gonna he's gonna fly up the board and I will I will draft him with confidence and the same way that I you know it's trying to get ahead of it early in his career and then and then he got burned I think you've got a you got to let that water flow under the bridge so to speak he's back this is the guy that you thought he would be and the Pelicans are gonna lean into this they're not gonna not trust it this is what they need in order to be irrelevant successful franchise so as long as you are hearing reports throughout the offseason that this guy's staying in the gym you fire away with confidence  so he ranks as the 70th player in eighth category League's per game this year and you know that's weighted to certain categories so like the free throw percentage sitting at 70 for the year that brings him down the lack of three says the biggest thing but he's in the top 30 over the last month so I think we still do need to be careful because I think there is a gap between his real life Effectiveness and his fantasy Effectiveness because of those those two categories specifically but you know shooting like 77% of the line over the last month like that that to me is the biggest thing like the threes I don't know if that's ever gonna come we've seen Zion shoot threes it doesn't look great right he's never even if you become like a decent 3-point shooter it's never going to be at the volume that it's like really making a huge difference for Fantasy to me it's about the free throws can you get closer to 80% you know can you be a 76% free throw shooter next season if so more than happy to to consider him you know kind of around that like I don't know 25 to 35 range is there anybody else I mean there's some obvious ones right it's like Jordan Poole yeah I don't think he's gonna go in the top 40 again this year you know Kate Cunningham is an interesting one to me  the if you're in a nine cat League the turnovers have kind of been a problem you know that pushes him down the board quite a bit you know our rankings would tell you he's like the 96 best fantasy player I don't really know accurate that is but I still have my concerns about like it's Detroit gonna be a better team next year I don't I don't really know if they are right it's like  I don't worry about him being like shut down or anything like that but when you're playing with Julie guys around you it's naturally going to hurt your production so I am very interested to see where he goes like I still love Kate cutting ham the player but I don't know if he's gonna be in a notably better situation next year  yeah I'm how can you have any sort of confidence in what Detroit is building over there and he's someone that I was taking in the middle of round two this past draft because of the sort of maybe it was around three but it was early and I wouldn't do it again so he would definitely fall into that camp of guys that you know when it looks good it looks great but it's just not consistent enough and and we don't know a lot of those numbers that he has he should be putting up monster system numbers but when the guys around you can't score those tend to Sag a little bit and and we see we definitely see a lot of that I'm curious to see what happens with the Grizzlies guys next year in the draft because  you talk about trust I don't know how you can have any of that Jaren Jackson Jr has been doing whatever he can to keep things afloat I know you've been dealing with that headache all season long and I traded him for shangoo and which created another great we talked about a riser and next year's draft but John Morant you know where does the guy like that go we haven't seen him play meeting for basketball and forever it feels so that could be a guy that ends up in discount mode  all right we had a couple more questions and be out of here Matt says who would you drop out of we got three Pelicans to choose from Nance Marshall and Alvarado  I don't necessarily love any of these guys you know she Marshals somebody you know he's gonna pick up more minutes with no Brandon Ingram never has been all that consistent of a producer but he's gonna play 22 25 minutes a night you would think for the next few weeks I would say probably all Verrado in a points League I mean you're looking for the Steals and you know some marginal assists out of Alvarado but in a point silly that's a little bit mitigated you know he played 16 minutes last night in a competitive game we talked about Nancy you know it's been underwhelming with at least the minutes have been there so I would say to me it's between Marshall and Alvarado and I go Alvarado  yes I would I would agree they're bent should be so much better than it is and it kind of stinks but I think Alvarado and Marshall are two of the better players that they're that they're using and in that second unit  Christian says it's cam Thomas a hold or should I drop him for Corey kispert herb Joe Jones or key on Ellis he's in the playoffs 12 team cat League I'm worried about cams back injury  yeah worried about a lot of things with Camp Thomas I watched him live in Milwaukee on Thursday that the shot selection I mean not that I was surprised but my goodness seeing it in person it's like you can just predict when he's going to shoot and it's usually when he's as heavily guarded as possible he has questionable tonight against Washington they also play Friday and Sunday obviously take this you know as far as you can as far as waiting for that decision goes I think if he's out tonight you got to think about it  I'd probably go Corey kispert you know he's playing a ton of minutes lately he's been like the one guy who's not being you know rotated out for rest for the for the Wizards and these minor injuries that have popped up he's gonna give you three that's a specialty valuable in a cat lady kind of depends what categories you're targeting you know if you're if you're looking for defensive stats then obviously her Jones was probably your guy yeah I mean I love what I've seen from Keon Ellis I think the numbers back that up as far as the the win rate for Sacramento they've been on much better team in terms of the win loss column when he's been in the starting lineup but these been so inconsistent with what he's giving you in terms of fantasy Productions so I think I would tend to lean Corey kispert you know he's gonna Chuck it and he's one of the better 3.1 one of the more underrated 3-point shooters in the NBA so I would tend to lean in that direction I like the volume you're getting there  all right last one can he says he's in a 10 team nine cat leaked Rozier looking like a drop it yeah maybe I in a 10 Team league that becomes a little more difficult as always depends who's out there I don't know that I would really be dropping rules here I don't know if you're gonna do a whole lot better I know it's been a little under last 10 games 18 points five rebounds four assists I don't know it'll take that like the shooting hasn't been ideal 43% from the field it's not good but it's not killing you he's been good at the line three-point shooting spent a little iffy that's the three-point shooting against what's killed him lately it's one of his last 12 from Beyond The Arc I don't if you drop rows here somebody's gonna grab them right and he's got he's got two great matchups the rest of the week they played Portland on Friday they play at Washington on Sunday I wouldn't drop before those games and they do have a four game week each of the next two weeks to close out the season so if this is a league that goes through game 82 he's got the best possible schedule here so yeah it's it's been a little under because without Butler last night but I'm not I don't think I'm dropping rows here yeah he's not blowing you away but I think he's just victim of expectation he's still been a decent player he just hasn't been as good as we thought and with the opportunities that  he's being given with the heat star missing in action but not I don't think he's drawable all right guys that'll do it good question as always Brandon fun chat with you man I know you gonna be in the house for the Orlando Magic Showdown against the Warriors tonight so enjoy that thank you Carol bobblehead night by the way no way all right we're gonna need a photo about it please if you could tweet that out that would be fantastic well if Dr Ray and Rick
