welcome into a Monday edition of the RotoWire fantasy basketball pod Nick Whalen Alex baruta here with you every Monday afternoon Alex a lot to get to we got injury news we got player news to talk about some early Impressions post-trade deadline we saw most guys who were on the move on Thursday play at least one game with their new team over the weekend we'll talk about the unique schedule this week as well ahead of the All-Star break you need schedule next week really two kind of abbreviated weeks in a row but if you're playing in weekly leaks some things you need to be aware of okay see for example as just one game this week a couple of teams have three games where you know sending out our prayers to those teams that have to play on Thursday this week for some reason I never really understand like what determines which teams get the short end of the stick there first and foremost allies did you bet on the Super Bowl what did you do for the Super Bowl did you stay up through overtime how did it all go for you yeah I just just washed away at home you know no Super Bowl parties for me didn't place any bets down I actually listened to your podcast with I think it was The Bookies guys and John yeah about your like prop bet battle how would you make out on those  well we lost the battle I like to say we won the war but we definitely lost the battle you know something like that it's supposed to be a little bit lighthearted like we I'm not like these are like the 10 Best Bets you could possibly make you know we wanted to do a good mix of stuff like you know we put two separate Gatorade color beds in neither of those hit and you know nothing against John McCain he did the work on that you know the Gatorade we're wrong he put out some great numbers like I was 100% convinced it was going to be read and ended up being purple of course we did hit on our biggest bet was Chiefs to cover and we like the under as well so we did okay we redeemed herself after a legitimately horrific showing last year when we went exclusively with like long shot beds for like are we going to do is like hit one of these now we're guaranteed to wins we're picking stuff that's like 50 to 1 and I think we went like one for 10 but it was a weird game right I mean it's actually the first half we're not here to break down the Super Bowl but if you took like any sort of over for just about anybody but you want Jennings in the first half like all right we're completely sunk  right yeah I mean it was definitely slow first half kind of a dud but then you know I mean you get an overtime so at least things get ramped up a little bit and ends up being a fun Super Bowl  it was fun and memorable as always we are not here to talk about the Super Bowl you could catch more of that on Sirius XM fantasy I'll be with Jim Coventry announced the slavski all week our guy Jeff Erickson's out at the fsga conference in Vegas so Jeff Jeff will be having a good time there but we'll be talking Super Bowl looking ahead to next year's NFL season 7 to 9 p.m. central on Sirius XM fantasy big waiver wire weekend now we kind of primed the pump for this last week and I think you called this one of if not the biggest waiver period of the entire year so who are your targets who did you end up getting obviously the Super Bowl taking place well waivers run in a lot of leagues I feel like maybe leads to some confusion you know some people maybe forgetting to put those claims in I went I went sicko mode in the state league but I'll let you you tell me which players you were talking first yeah the stakes kind of a different story you know 16 Team league and the deadline wasn't insane so I you know like you went sicko mode yes but there weren't a lot of like I feel like moves that you absolutely had to do I mean I was you know I was I was cool targeting guys like well for the Jazz too you know the Jazz kind of they moved out fontecchio they moved out Cameo next there's like a tailor Hendrix thing keyonte George might get back in the rotation a little bit so that's that's at least one spot where I was like this is this is pretty intriguing for like a 16 team or to see what happens here I will say there were a ton of okay everybody in the league is going to be bidding on this player type of situations right I think he had to work the margins a bit more I mean if you're in a 10 Team league or a 12 team League I don't even know if there's anybody that you're necessarily rushing out to get you know maybe you're swapping out a streaming spot or your final roster spot if you have some injuries but when you're into 16 team or like the RotoWire stake League it's reasonable to be excited to land someone like Trey man out of Charlotte yeah as I was probably overpaid a little bit but you know we're getting to the end of the year I don't really want to leave any Fab on the table I think I paid four or five bucks for him out of 100 dollar budget I ended up getting Caleb Martin as well we got the Jimmy Butler you know leave of absence news yesterday morning we now know that he's gonna miss all their games until the All-Star break my guess is that Butler will probably be back after the break but we'll see I mean Martin still been a staple in that rotation even when Butler is out but he played well in Butler's absence yesterday  went out and grabbed you mentioned the Jazz Chris Don and he was kind of I would say Hero at the end of last year but he was somebody that I wish I would have been more aggressive on I'm not going to get beeped twice on the same guy you know blocks and steals specifically are two categories that I'm targeting in that League you know it provides assist as well I'm basically putting a says at this point so that doesn't really matter but really after the steals in Utah is one of only a handful of teams that has three games this week so I particularly wanted to get done in the lineup you know try to get a leg up on some guys and have a lot of two game weeks or even a one game week but yeah man Martin Kris Dunn those are my big three I did see fontecchio was dropped in the state League Bye by our good friend Gary he's doing better than me in the league so I'm not gonna tell him what to do but that was surprising to me I think I would be holding contact you know right now or trying to acquire him  yeah I mean the fact that he took 19 shots a couple days ago and the game against the Clippers that's that's a lot of shots for Simone fontecchio I I understand why you would be  nervous maybe to hang on to him or want to explore other options  it's just it's a tough game to drop him after I'm not sure I would have done it but I don't know I mean they're rotation the rotation is not the easiest thing in the world to figure out like I feel like there's a chance you know he plays 32 minutes off the bench um  I just I don't know like when  a sar Thompson maybe starts playing more minutes and then because at some point the Funko is 28 right like  he's not like a development priority but do the Pistons know that I don't know this is something that we have talked about and the thing is what something important to note I Isaiah Stewart has been out so what happens when Stuart comes back I think is worth mentioning  well I couldn't grind so they got from the Nicks at the deadline also is yet to play he's been dealing with a knee injury not quite as much positional overlap there but you know Detroit's kind of throwing things out the wall with their rotations anyways so I do think Quinton Grimes being out there definitely doesn't help but he was case you know started three games in a row we talked about him as somebody who could kind of retake off post deadline you know I I went hard on on a Mentos and props for that Sacramento game last week I think that was like Wednesday or Thursday but again if it was out of my car right this is the night he had four fouls in nine minutes and only ended up playing 27 minutes I think I had his blocks deals over in that game you know Portland kind of a similar story picked up four fouls really early still has played though 27 27 28 27 27 minutes over the last four games I think we'll take that you know ideally you'd like him to be I mean he was in the high 30s for a while if you go all the way back to early November when he was bursting onto the scene but he also had to stretch you know through December and much if you anywhere where you're just thrilled if you got to 18 to 20 minutes so I think we're moving in the right direction on a sar but yeah the Pistons remain a mess I will ask did you consider going out and throwing any claims in on beach in Charlotte who had a nice game over the weekend against Memphis 18 points 9 assists you know somebody who I don't think he came over from Europe thinking you know what I'm gonna finish out this  year for what whatever they are now like the 10 win Charlotte Hornets he was unfortunately for him banished to Charlotte along with Grant Williams and Seth Curry yeah I obviously did not consider it because I look I mean I there's a chance that yes this would happen you would play like 25 30 minutes in this game you know well guys are out trades are pending whatever but I I have way more faith in like Trey man because once lamelo comes back I think meech is the guy  who takes the fall because the horse the Hornets are just done like Charlotte's 11 and 41 yeah you're only giving minutes to meet you as like just to not be mean to the guy like just like let him get out there so I maybe they'll drop him I will get surprise you if they just like released him  uh I mean maybe three years three years 23 million dollar deals so I don't  I don't know if again I don't think he came over thinking all right I'm gonna join a good team I'm gonna be a good situation I'm gonna provide you know backup point guard minutes and it just didn't work out in OKC I would be surprised if they outright drop it I mean that would almost be a showing of Goodwill more than anything yeah you know to try to get him to a contender I don't know if he's really earned that I don't know what his reputation is you know playing a half year in the NBA but you know we have a question here he said should I add meet you or Trey man's from A1 I think we're both on team Trey man for now you know I I think there's like they went out and got Trey man right I mean obviously that was part of the Gordon Hayward deal but I'm not I'm not certain that okay see was like trying to get off of tree man I think that was that was like a semi legitimate asset that you have to give up to get someone like Gordon Hayward and you know obviously man was kind of marched alive there's a bunch of younger players in OKC who aren't really seeing minute and you know haven't really been a part of the rotation since early in the year and even that might be generous so it's not like this is a locked by any means but I don't know when lamelo ball is coming back I don't know if Bella ball is coming back we should have an answer hopefully during or shortly after the All-Star break obviously the lamelo's back in the mix and playing 38 minutes A Night Train man's gonna have a tough time but I'm pretty comfortable holding him in Australia's probably only in deep early to be honest until the Mellow comes back because I think he's gonna play minutes he's gonna put shots up yet nine assists in 27 minutes in his debut didn't shoot the ball well you know you're like okay 9 points whatever is one of five from three he's a good three-point shooter so I think they're actually is something there with man  I think there's something there a little undersized but complete shooting guard if he asked to and yeah I think again I really it's it's a really tough to evaluate how they're going to Approach meat Church hasn't been a great fantasy player either it's not like he's like been someone who  oh we just need more minutes from each which we just need 20 minutes from each it'll be interesting not not really he's like  you know someone who's averaging I think it's 0.7 fantasy points per game per minute which is horrible so that's something keep in mind he a great game obviously yeah man's got to be yeah already meteoro and man were the three most added players in Yahoo leagues as of yesterday so obviously they're going to be popular a bunch of people went out and picked up Grant Williams as well  I not super high on a great Williams obviously you know Charlotte cleared out a little bit of room in that front Court you look good I mean 15 and 8 in his debut played 32 minutes that was a great matchup against Memphis Yeah I think we're gonna need a few more games to see exactly how that front Court shapes up because yeah Brandon Miller and Miles Bridges those guys are gonna play Big minutes every night the rest of the way they still have Nick Richards I like Grant Williams a lot more now that I did at the end of his Dallas run when you just couldn't really hold him in any league but I'm still I'm still pretty skeptical that he somebody I would really be comfortable starting most weeks going forward yeah I mean he is only worth starting I said at this point when he gets like  stupid hot from three because he can't he can't create from selfie or for other people he he's a solid Defender but he's not like a steals or blocks guy the only time he held fantasy value all season was like the first 10 games of the year when he was shooting crazy hot from three and I was begging everybody to drop him like yeah maybe he'll take more shots with with Charlotte but and maybe some more rebounds here and there I just  I don't know I don't think you'll be a 12 team  must roster guy by any stretch  yeah I don't think so either looking at some of the other ads in the stake League this week there there was a pretty decent amount of movement you know I ended up parting ways with with guys like Sam Merrill who was you know 16 Team league just trying to get some 3-pointers he had been a nice run but I think that's probably coming to an end Jarred Vanderbilt you know who's injured somebody dropped him Hardaway in order to pick up taeler Hendrix that was the the legal leader Ryan poll so he's got he's got a little bit of leeway there you know I think if you're you know somebody who's maybe toward the middle of the pack or you know you're trying to climb maybe you don't take a risk like that but I certainly understand the appeal with Taylor Hendricks I ended up dropping Derek Jones in order to pick up Caleb Martin but you know overall I like I said there's not like the the one lead winner guy who everybody in your league is is kind of targeting I think people have their their Taste of references and at this point you know your if you're in a category League you're doing a lot of category watching right you know what categories you need you know what categories you're you're into the point that it might not matter the stake leaks specifically you just want to finish in the top half  obviously be great to win the league but it's a you know bottom half of the league buys a state dinner for the top out of the league and we're talking you know 300 plus dollars so there's there's significant money on the line here and you know as somebody who's hanging around that middle Zone you know I'm targeting specific categories and looking where I could climb up and that's where you know Caleb Martin and Chris Dunn specifically come in and even trade man you know I view as a steals producer did you do anything in your npkc or any other big time leaks you're in  no not much to be honest I just didn't have a lot of faith and Amy these guys to be worth like dropping some of the guys are already have you know to me there were no like  ads that were so obvious you know that I needed to do something major know I haven't done it yet I have lobello in that league in obviously it's just thinking me Minnie's played what 22 games I think on the year you're just not going to compete in a league like that when you're you know 13th overall pick is giving you that I'm still not dropping him quite yet I mean I was like at this point I probably should but it's like a league like that there's just there's so it's so unappealing to be like all right I'm dropping a little mellow ball to go pick up Chris Dunn you know there's there's that sort of Miracle Worker out there on the waiver wire we will let's hit a couple of The Listener questions out we could kind of mix these in as we go as always stack those up in the chat guys we will hit as many if not all of them as we can before we head out I do want to talk about the rookie class at some point so we'll get back to that in a bit but Dr D three one four so says window Carter Juniors on waivers in his League should I add him say 14 team points League he says Santi aldama or Josh Green would be the drops in order to pick up Wendell Carter  yeah we all kind of got excited when they Carter came back and had like an amazing six game and then he turned back into Wendell Carter for basically over the past eight averaging 11 and 6 with 0.3 blocks over the past eight games not great so would you pick should you drop potentially Alma or Josh Green to pick him up I I think you would probably be okay to drop Josh Green I'm not really a Josh green guy he's been in hot shooting lately when that normalizes a bit and and the and the Mavericks get healthier I think it's usage goes down and I'm not sure I would drop all dhamma either the way the Grizzlies are going with all the injury woes they're dealing with so I don't I don't think you have to pick up window coverage Junior  I think green versus Carter Junior to me is closed it comes down to positional preferences do you need a big man do you need more help at Center slash forward if he's eligible there near League in that case I would lean window Carter I'm with you I mean Josh Green shot like 60% from the field over that nice 5K run he was on came back down to earth against okay see in that blowout we in the other night 6 points at 27 minutes I do think Wendell Carter is going to be more dependable Dan Josh green but I I think I prefer aldama right now special with Xavier Tillman now in Boston you know the Grizzlies shuffled a bunch of pieces I not really sure how meaningful any of that was in the biggest indicator though is that he starting with Jared Jackson and Jackson's banana out you know over the last few games but the games of the house played he has started with aldama you know Obama's got you know double digit scoring and eight of his last nine he's averaging about 12 6 and 3 with some threes two and a half threes per game in that span not something the world on fire but I think I would prefer him I think it's going to be a little more secure then window Carter  our A1 says is Chris Paul worth an ad his return is 222 yeah I think we see Chris Paul probably after the All-Star break you know the last update we got was about a week ago he said he's making progress you know still you know was kind of nursing that that broken hand I'd be very very surprised if he comes back they play tonight at Utah He's not gonna play in that game and they have a back-to-back Wednesday Thursday  very likely to me that he's back either right after the All-Star break or sometime this month the question is is he worth an at  I think so on the season he's ranked 100 and 11th 8 cap per game so sure I mean go ahead and pick him up especially if you need assist but I will I wouldn't consider him a must add  blanket statement it kind of depends I think he's fine at a points League 100% you should have got him if you need assistance yeah if you don't eat assists you can you he's not someone you have to grab  all right our pal Matt will always give us good question on the stream he says Hey guys would you drop Dillon Brooks and Marvin Bagley to pick up a sar Thompson he's in a head-to-head points league on Yahoo Bagley is in his eye our spot so he would need to drop him in addition to Dillon Brooks to pick up a starter Thompson I'm not really  I'm not really a Dillon Brooks guy for Fantasy I think he's always been overrated in fantasy  Marvin Bagley should have the clear Runway to just be Washington starting center and he returned from injury after a four-game absence played only 15 minutes which is to meet you don't have to worry about that I think they'll just ramp him up but  I mean in 13 starts this season you know including actually we'll just exclude this past one the average averaging 15 and 7 56% from the field goal and points  yeah I would have badly  but okay sorry I don't know a star is the riskiest Stars the risk reward play so like I I think Bagley is actually I can't believe I'm saying this I think Marvin Bagley is the safest of these of these options  okay so you're saying if a scenario unfolds where you can keep Bagley but drop Brooks for us are you would consider that yeah I would do that okay yeah I think I'm with you either I mean it Imports League it's a little bit differently the you know some of the defensive stats the seals on the blocks with us are mean being a ton and category leaks but you know still have value in points I I just can't see the bearing is our tops I mean really like the foul trouble is almost what concerns me more than anything and that's been more of a recent thing you know it's not like he has this crazy track record of picking up vowels early in the year was a bit of an issue but he got it smoothed out but yeah I mean I just yeah I think the lesson is don't read too much into this last game by Bagley you know coming off of an injury you know should have been a decent matchup against Philly but you know I think you're right to point out that there is literally no competition for center right and in Washington Holmes we're Sean Holmes didn't play he was a DNA he was he was active and digging play so that that to me points to Marvin Bagley it 30 minutes again probably from here on  I follow up for A1 I said thanks for the advice appreciate the question nine cat 12 team should he drop December for keyonte George he said he's already good in rebounds field goal percentage blocks and steals he is in need of assists and points so it's basically who do you prefer going forward just somehow or keyonte George um  if you need assistance points I would probably go with keyonte George  just because for Chicago  assumed was not a great passer anyway and they have Kobe white and DeMar DeRozan gonna be handling the vast majority of playmaking there the Jazz  you know they triggered away two key rotation players I think they're 100% fine pulling the plug a little bit given more minutes to keyontae who is more of a sort of traditional point guard than to soon move  for me this comes down to which of those two categories do you want more because I think to give you more points I think it's gonna give you more reliable points he's gonna give you a higher scoring ceiling but he's gonna give you fewer so like yandere George is the guy if this is the category that you need to make the most hey in Gokey George if you think it's points to Sumo I think they'll be really comparable going forward and I would say just Sumo like if you're just saying you know independent of categories who would you rather have I would say to Sumo but if you're not worried about the field goal percentage and you're not worried about like turnovers and whatnot with Chia George then that that makes us a tougher question but yeah George for assists assume for points I'll give you the tiebreaker on George Alex if we if we need both manilla's Most Wanted brings up some some news we got a dice and Daniels about an hour ago he's got a meniscus tear out indefinitely you know well likely miss out at least a month the All-Star break helps minimize the total games missed but still a pretty big blow for a guy who's playing around 20 minutes a night  this does open some things up fantasy wise though for a team that has been a little frustrating because they have a lot of guys that we like and a lot of guys who are playing fewer minutes because they have so many guys so who do we pick up here he says Trey Murphy or herb Jones they're both available in his League  I  I would go Trey Murphy I mean Murphy he's been kind of hot and cold you know coming back from the knee injury but his minutes being down is the main concern I think for Murphy so I think I think his minutes could increase  and I think he has more upside than Jones because Jones not very good offensive player you know I wrote about herb Jones on our site last week as somebody who I was you know comfortable dropping for the right ad at the deadline since then he's trying to gather like three of his best games in the last two months which is usually how that goes when you write about a player who you're saying people should drop he's got five steals in the last two games prior to that though I mean the steals are blocks like that's that's what you're after with her Jones right I mean it'll give me some threes you shoot a good percentage but he's got to be giving you you know close to if not more than like two combined blocks and steals per game and he was out 1.1 combined Steals and blocks over a 25 game sample from mid-December until early February so yeah he's been better lately yeah he'll see more minutes you know if it's a category league and you really need defensive stats you could justify her Jones but to me you know if you're kind of looking at this independently you're taking that out of it I would go trade Murphy well I will say I think there's a really also a strong chance that it just the minute get distributed so evenly between like four different guys that could almost doesn't  matter like this could be a stitch because Daniel has been playing about 20 minutes right so this could be like four more minutes to train Murphy and three more to her Jones and five more to Jordan hockins and oh you know we'll give up a Rado another two minutes and and I could just end up being nobody yeah you're totally right you're totally right both guys Murphy and Jones played elevated minutes against Portland both played well so I don't I don't really know if you can go wrong here but I would go Murphy I think he has more upside all right follow up on herb Jones from Christian he says should I drop herb Jones to pick up Tim Hardaway Jr who we mentioned was dropped in the stake league and that's the 16th that doesn't mean nothing  you know I mean Hardaway is basically threes in points right if you're in a category leak so as always depends what you need if you need defensive stats go herb Jones if you just want the points threes you always been rebounding the ball pretty well as well for for a Dallas team that has not rebounded well although they should remedy that with the moves that they made at the deadline this is a tough one for me I mean  I I still think I want the the splash upside of Hardaway you know field goal percentage is another thing if you're in a category League Jones Is Gonna is gonna help you a lot more there but he's also not capable of you know going off for 3241 36 point games like Hardaway has in the last month  if I'm gonna points League I want Hardaway  if I'm gonna category League it just depends on what you need if you need defense herb Jones if you need offense Tim Hardaway it's almost it's almost just that simple  all right James says in light of the Jimmy Butler news again he's sidelined and definitely dealing with a personal matter they're calling it a leave of absence again I think we expect him to likely be back sometime shortly after the deadline so I don't think this is you know like a gold mine type of pickup here but if you're looking at this week Hawkes or Caleb Martin who would you pick up in Miami  this is this is an interesting question because we all so have Josh Richardson out for a few weeks  and we have Terry Rozier who is still were waiting on MRI results for a knee injury  so look I like us Hawkins more I think he's a better player but what we're talking about is also an addition to Butler being out injuries to two guards  and they don't really have backups there so besides Caleb Martin who is not really a point guard but it's like someone's gonna have to play there so I think I think Caleb Martin's the safer pickup and Hawkins hasn't played that well lately to be honest yeah luxury he has he's just been a little slow a little slow so I'm gonna lean Martin here I would lean Martin as well I think he's a little bit closer to a guard that Hawkes is although I think both guys by default will see more minutes you wonder is Haka is he focused on the dunk contest not focused on fantasy producing who knows Caleb Martin 13 games this year when he's played at least 30 minutes 15.5 points 6.5 rebounds three assists one steel and block combined 50% from the field 42 percent from three  so yeah I mean that's probably in line with if you isolate you know hot guys as best stretch but that came much earlier in the year I would go Caleb Martin it's closed you know certainly a month ago I would have said hawk has no question but like you said you just he hasn't played that well over the last couple of weeks so it's special if you're looking at short-term this week I would go Kayla Martin and yeah the rosie you're thinking is interesting man I'm glad you brought that up kind of slipped my mind I mean who knows that could go any direction right I mean I think it's very possible that he doesn't play this week in perhaps beyond the break  yeah he had just started to play better too so is kind of it's unfortunate for people who have been fantasy and it's actually worse because the Josh Richardson so you get kind of a yeah it's it's doubly bad who knows we could see more like don't get Robinson as well I think just the main point is like the heat up more options on the wing to make up for Butler's absence that they do in the back court for the double absences to Rosier and Josh Richardson  all right we got a streaming question from Dennis he says pick up Trey man or stream Malik Beasley for the next three games and this gives us a good excuse to talk about the schedule for this week like we mentioned at the top OKC is the only team in the NBA with one game this week so thankfully Trey man doesn't play for OKC anymore so you don't have to worry about that the vast majority of the NBA that is I think 2014 teams have two games and then we have Utah Minnesota Milwaukee Memphis and Golden State those teams play three all those teams are in action on Thursday so that's the Common Thread there so you getting you getting three games out of Malik Beasley this week or your picking up Trey man who has two games and presumably you know holding him a bit longer than you might believe I'm picking up Terry man I look Malik Malik Beesley is a you pick him up to stream immediately I want the potential upside of Trey man like you can look at I like I don't know if you're asking this because Beasley  is hot lately like beesley's averaging 16 points over the past four games you can go through Beasley's game blogs look at any stretch like five game stretch where he's making his threes and then look at the following five games it's like heels average 16 points and then he'll average seven points yeah and it's just I I think you just want the upside of of man because we just we talked about the beginning of the show lamelo who knows when or if he's coming back and even if he does I think Troy man could still see 25 plus minutes and  yeah I'm glad you brought up what you did with Beasley because I wanted to to read off it's basically you know you're targeting three is with Beasley right so here's his last nine games made threes one one one one one one one one three four six zero one over nine against Minnesota and then seven gets Charlotte in their last game so it's you're playing roulette there right you got three games so chances already hitting four five threes and one of those games chances already in another and then maybe two or three so if you really need threes if you're in a category League totally justifiable to stream Beasley because three games this week is in advance it's a huge Advantage more than it is in in other weeks but if you're looking more long-term than yeah Terry man is your guy  all right we got a trade question  Melissa's Most Wanted says my marketing and even shenzo for Devin Booker with this be too much of an overpaid it's a category League  that's an interesting I mean marketing is its chance marketing is rated higher than Booker is there I mean marketing is what 20 fourth and eighth cat and Booker is 15th cat  um  man  the thing is Steven chenzo was on such a crazy boost right now because of the injuries to Randall and Anna nobe both those guys might come back or hopefully coming back late February very early March  you know even shenzo might be too hot to give up right now because you might get another two three weeks out of this maybe that's the best case scenario  but I yeah I I think I actually might hang on to marketing and Booker here it's it's a fair trade I think like in general but yeah  well I think you also look at David chenzo's last game against Indy on Saturday and you're like well you only had 14 points you know maybe the run is over it's like we still played 39 minutes you just didn't shoot it well you know you didn't shoot it like he had been which is unsustainable I think we all know that but he had two of nine for three after going you know seven of 12 four of nine six of 16 for like he was taking like 15 threes a game  for like a 6K stretch which is insane and you know jillson missed a little bit of time in there too so there's some games where it was just like eight guys available and you can't take a whole lot from that but yeah I think David Jones was too good right now and the other thing is like I don't post to this deal for say especially if you have concerns about you know what Utah might look like later in the year yeah but the Jazz have three games this week so if you could hold off and make this deal and you know maybe a little more appealing like yeah I want those three games out of Marketing this week before I'm dealing him so something else to consider there but overall I don't I don't think this is a wild overpay I think I think this one that both sides would really have to think about I think chances are if you propose it it probably gets accepted but I don't think it's like an instant no brainer I agree yeah I would just hang on to my I would hang on to my guys  okay we got a pick one of the three question here from kagay he says zubac Ivy or pajam ski  yeah I mean zubac just came back from injury 20 minutes and back-to-back games on the whole season he's like just outside the top 120 so it's like yeah he should be rostered it but it's not the crazy but jumpsky man he's to play well I mean we just we talked about Chris Paul or earlier  Chris Paul coming back could cut into gems he's minutes I think I like gemski more than zubac in fan I see though just you get you get the like that Fringe triple double shot side and then Ivy man I've been calling like Monty Williams actually trust him  the Pistons Trade It Away by zdanowicz  and he's taking at least 20 shots and each of the past three games Ivy has so I think I would just hang on to Ivy I think I'd want to Ivy here  I think I want Ivy as well I mean last five games 26 points five rebounds four assists percentages are good you know the turnovers if you're in a nine cat League he's still turn it over a lot so that's something you have to consider the one pushback I would have on IV Alex is Quentin Grimes when he comes back how much does Ivy's roles suffer  I think Grimes is just not that good I gotta be honest I would take a stance here and just say Grimes it's just not that you just not that good or else he'd be played or you want to play for New York if he was good like that good not like and I think if he does take minutes from somebody he's gonna be taking minutes from like  like the like fontecchio may not play 32 Troy Brown played 19 last game so I mean you could find what 29 minutes for Grimes basically just like right there and Shake Milton also played 12 most Scala played 10 I think there's magnets for Grimes can be found without taking usage really away from okay Ivy all right obviously answer that in that case I think we litigated that one well all right we'll do a couple questions on bed bath are in here these are two that tied together so she'll oh nine says would you drop bathroom to add iodine 12 team 11 cat league so this is standard 9 cap plus free throws made and feels made and then we had a similar question regarding a couple of those same players bathroom to sumu oriente George rest of season in a category league so well we already talked about to move versus George you know if you want the points go with Io if you want the assist upside go with keyonte George I think I prefer to Sumo just straight up over those two but when we throw math into the mix how does that change things  man I wish I wish math would just like  get consistent minutes or  play well for an extended stretch I mean he did in like late January or excuse me late December early January but back-to-back games now it's 24 minutes 23 minutes  he was dealing with an illness so that's something to consider maybe this is this might be a Bi-Lo point but I think I would ultimately just rather have to soon move  what do you think  I think I'd rather have to Sumo as well I don't I don't think I don't think Rick Carla likes Ben math I think that has been a throughout this season and  you know at the deadline the what I think one of the more obvious like all right this guy's gone this guy should step up situation was the Pacers with Buddy hield going to Philly and we saw mattress but it's decreased over the you know their last couple of games right it just doesn't it doesn't make sense yeah he's one of those guys I have said this on the Pod before where you know he I feel like he has like three minutes to prove himself when he's out there and it's like if he makes a mistake he's just sitting for the next eight minutes and then he'll get another chance later on but like he just doesn't really have the trust right now of Rick Carlyle and you know even last year when he played really well as a rookie he was a much better real life player than he was fantasy player you know the percentages work great which is often the case for rookie cards he gives you almost nothing on defense he gives you almost nothing as a pastor he's an average ish rebounder for his position and he was also taking six free throws a game last year that's been almost cut in half this season so I would just I think the Bulls are just going to kind of Let it Fly here and no Levine the rest of the way is what would really break the tie for me there so yeah I mean all these guys are justifiable holds and I don't think you're going to be in like a disaster scenario with any of them but just assumed it was the guy that I would want their  Andy W says hi just joined what's up Andy thanks for watching so keep up the great work are there any under the radar point guards to add for assists and threes in a roti League  well I think Charlotte would be our first place to hit up right yeah Charlotte I would I would look into train man who we talked about earlier who just went to Charlotte from OKC we don't know when the ball is coming back even meat church we had a great game and his Charlotte debut kind of unclear what's going to happen there I'm not 100% convinced he's gonna continue seeing like 30 minutes but if you're talking under the radar that's that's certainly an option oh yeah I'm trying to see okay Dennis Schroder like he wasn't really dropped in that many leagues he's 73% roster and I don't think he qualifies as under the radar at this point I mean so many guards give you assistant threes right like these are fairly common categories for for most guards so it's mostly about finding some minutes  you know I mean Marcus Sasser in Detroit is like somewhat interesting he's you know when the minutes are there he's been really productive you know he had a 17 and 11 game last week but when Kaden ivr healthy and when Chris is healthy I think he's probably the guy that that maybe falls out there you know New Orleans with the Dyson Daniels injury again I'm not sure there's anybody necessarily under the radar like I wouldn't recommend going out and grabbing Jose Alvarado I mean you have to George we've talked about if you consider him under the radar maybe that's somebody but this is this is kind of one of the side effects of a relatively quiet trade deadline as we know and we don't have these you know perfect fantasy situations opening up all over the league I think if you're if you're paying attention like most of these guys have already been on your radar right like to say Jones trade shows like that's you know we kind of know what they are at this point oh yeah um yeah yeah I think I think all those names you mentioned are are mostly who we're looking at  yeah it's again it's just about some of those guys are off the waiver wire I mean Duncan shrew there maybe who knows um yeah it's just those are the most popular guys  yeah I'm looking at Yahoo's you know most available  players right now I mean  Spencer Dinwiddie maybe if you think he has a role with the Lakers I don't know if I quite trust that you know TJ McConnell obviously is always going to be in that conversation you know but again when the minutes are there which is a pretty big caveat for him so hopefully those are some names that maybe are available in your league speaking of the Jazz Alex says who do you think it's more run in silly season for the jazz keonte or done  I think both well actually end up playing a lot I mean if you're looking for a true and I'll be honest I don't love the I don't love the term silly season but I understand it and you know it's become part of the Lexicon so we got to use it  you have to George's like the perfect Silly Season guy right I mean young players team that doesn't seem to care if they're winning you know why not throw more minutes like I love Chris Dunn I still holding out hope for him from like that 2016 draft or whatever it was but you know he is turning 30 in less than a month so you know I don't know I don't know if there's a whole lot invested in developing Kristen no I don't think so it I was gonna break up the point you did is it done is not Don's older so there's just not that much there's not really a development priority there  all right good question on De'Anthony Melton you know a guy who's been injured for the most part it's not played since January 12th will sit out again tonight against Cleveland the Sixers also play Wednesday against Miami I think with the break coming up you you expect him to miss that game and hopefully he comes back after the break but Alex says what are your thoughts on Melton will he still be getting 25 plus minutes at night or my Better Off streaming that spot  I think he'll still be getting 25 plus a night yeah I think he'll still be worth frustrating and fantasy I think he could be a top 100 player you know the heel Edition is interesting for sure but it's nothing that can't be sort of that I think they can both co-exist and Kyle Lowry's there too we should bunch of Kyle Lowry's  not that good anymore and might only get like 15 minutes a game and may not really play every every night to be honest and  you know in terms of like trying to figure out  what Phillies rotation is going to be you know we've been seeing like  um well we should mention I mean campaign has been playing minutes lately those are gonna go away when belton's back KJ Martin I could see them you know I could see KJ Martin Smith's disappearing in the form of like Kelly oubre takes his spot and then Milton gets more minutes to backfill so that's a long answer but I think belt will be will be back  what are we projecting for Julius Randle to come back Manila Most Wanted says could he be back in early March  certainly could be I mean they just hadn't really give us a whole lot you know they said at least two to three weeks at the beginning of everywhere so obviously that takes us through the All-Star break I think at best it's not completely out of the question that you know he could be back before the end of February I don't think that's off the table giving the the timetable from the Knicks but you know they're  got a trend water as is and you look at the the schedule coming out of the break they have a winnable game at Philly they play Boston Detroit New Orleans Golden State so it's not exactly a gauntlet coming up maybe they are a little bit more cautious I think yeah if he's not back by the first week of March  that becomes a little concerning so you know tough to answer we don't we don't have any Insider info on that but early March would be my guest yeah could be back sooner I don't know James Chan says Caleb Martin or I think this is belal coulibaly rest of season  rest of season is interesting because if we're just saying the next couple weeks Caleb Martin for me for sure but the Wizards are kind of a skeleton crew of a roster at this point cool the Bali move back to the bench for their last game Saturday against Phillies still played okay  I just haven't really seen it with him I know like the good games have been kind of eye-popping you know he said some threes you took 12 threes a couple of games ago was you know he's putting in some defensive stats I just I don't see it being super consistent because the minutes have been there that's the thing  yes yeah I don't think we're gonna see a lot of cooling Bali  unless Jordan Poole or tyus Jones  or odia or kuzma basically like sit for an extended stretch which is possible that  possible but the right now you're safest back is Caleb Martin because we know Richardson's out Josh Richardson's out for like three weeks and Rose your could be out for longer so  depending on the Rosier news it might be like Martin by a lot  or it could be Martin by a little  another Julius Randle question Aaron says he's in a nine Cat 10 Team league should I pick up Julius Randle he's on waivers I would say yes I mean if you're in one of those legs that goes through game 82 like absolutely no question and you know if you got an IR spot you can throw them in there I would say yes I think I'm optimistic enough about his timeline that I don't you know unless it's a shallow league so you're probably dropping somebody of  considerable substance here to pick him up but I I think it would be worth it especially if you have a drop that you feel okay about  you would be dropping somebody good but there's a 10 Team league there are a million streaming options like you can stream  every week a lot with great players so yeah I would pick them up  all right we got an ESPN 10 team points Lee asks should I play Kobe white in a chewa over heeled and Reed  so I think this is for for this week  I would say yes  most likely all of those guys I believe have two games  so there's not yeah not a distinction there but heals played pretty well and Philly you know I mean there's such a skeleton crew as well right now that  stuff to know how much you should read into that but he has he's eight of 21 from three over the last two games he's got you know 43 total points he's handed out some assists he had forced deals against Washington on Saturday I would definitely play a 2014 right now yeah yeah this is Kobe white and and achua for me because all the games  the schedules equal so I would go with those guys they've been more reliable their usage is more trustworthy at this point yeah go with them  Matt says what are your thoughts on trading Kyrie for deer and fox in a points League Fox is a better playoff schedule  I'm on boarded this they're very comparable players in points almost almost the exact same Fantasy Point output per game and yeah if fox has a better playoff schedule I'm totally good with that  yep and Kyrie as a longer history of missing games and I not even just for like personal reasons I mean like Kyrie gets hurt pretty often so yeah the favorable schedule everything goes Fox  on tari Eason coming back is he worth the pickup for the playoffs starting to get a little concerned about our guy tari Eason he has not played since New Year's Day  He they're kind of just going game to game now with him I don't think we see him before the All-Star break he's already been ruled out tonight against the Knicks doubt he plays Wednesday at Memphis  I at this point I'm not sure he's worth a pickup you know if you're in a 16 Team league sure if you're in a 10 or 12 Team league I just wouldn't do it I mean it when you're out for this long I mean he's gonna end up missing basically two months and that has allowed a mental option to play a lot more minutes can Whitmore to play a lot more minutes like I just I don't think that just vanishes overnight one star Easton's back  no I I was I was concerned two weeks ago at least because they're being really  dodgy and vague about what this injury is no time table know specifically about what the injury really is  and he looks very good has top 100 upside  when he comes back he'll probably be limited there's got that to go through so I don't think he's a pickup but and like a standard League  follow-up quick on the dear and fox question he says Foxes in a big slump at the moment should we get worries with his lingering shoulder issue  I'm not too worried about it to be honest no it's been a shooting slump for sure but he's you know he's still producing and basically every other category just fine it's been basically what the last three and a half games he hasn't shot it well you know he had that huge game against Chicago at the beginning of the month and ever since then the scoring has been a little bit down so  yeah it's fair it's fair to question you know the 3-point shooting started off so great last 10 games he's got like 30% still taken a bunch you know to me that that would imply that he's comfortable I don't I'm not I'm not worried too much about that  no and we have the All-Star break coming up so he'll get he'll get plenty of time to rest his shoulder so I think he'll be fine especially after the break  what's up Tristan he said I just got here what did I miss can't recap everything but this is archived on YouTube me we put this out as a podcast as well so you can listen to it on Spotify Apple pods we do throw the timestamps in there right after we finish up we put those on YouTube so after we finish up go to our YouTube page like 20 minutes after and you could skip through and find whatever you want Calgary says can you guys see Andre Drummond getting more minutes and being worth a pickup  Lord I hope so that would be that would be huge for a couple of teams where I'm holding on Drake drum and deeper League's  I don't know man he plays 30 minutes and back to back games and he's down to 17 against Orlando  I I'm still optimistic what about you  yeah I think they played on this I mean they wanted to go with the two bigs for Minnesota and then they kept it rolling against Memphis I think he's back yeah you mentioned he's back to 17 against Orlando could he he could  Patrick Williams has been out that's been obviously a big part of this he could Patrick Williams could be back basically after the All-Star break  it's such like it's  there's no good answer here because if you drop them and then he starts seeing like they keep playing them more together with vooch 24 minutes and then it's like well you gotta pick them up and then he's trapped on your bench so  I think it's it's mostly unlikely that he starts seeing like 28 minutes or even 24 minutes consistently but maybe they'll throw out is like an option once a while because they did  I I would be I mean I don't think he's getting to like 28 minutes a night I think that's off the table but with Drummond you just need the 22 to 24 and he's still gonna be like a top 100 guy because of the volume on rebounding and some of the defensive stats so depends how bad you need rebounding you know in the league where I have him most notably rebounds are like the top category that I'm targeting so that's you know it's more he's more valuable to me there then that other comparable players would be but just just know that you can have to live with those 17 minutes 3 points five rebound nights just as often as you're gonna get the you know 20 points 13 rebounds like he had against Memphis all right good question from Christopher regarding the Blazers  how about this for under the radar guards look to Portland where everybody's hurt or getting shut down you brings up Ashton Haggins just a classic throwback name I haven't thought about Ashton Hagins in a while he's big time recruited that when he was at Kentucky and then Delano Banton as well who wound up in Portland after the deadline I think that's a good call you know I mean we went right to Charlotte Portland very similar situation you know Brockton is out with tendonitis and his elbow  gonna be reevaluated after the break Workshop by the way yeah we couldn't it's very possible that brought him just doesn't play again this year I mean I think the shutdown is coming for him pretty hard I don't think they're going to shut down scoot or Simon's I don't really see the reason for that both of those guys have been banged up lately but I don't view that as long term so if you just look at the last couple of games like oh Ashton Higgins he always played 51 minutes over the last two didn't really do anything in those games including a start against New Orleans on Saturday I'm not super intrigued with him and you know really unique player gonna have some size you know just somebody that I think a lot of teams have been intrigued and fascinated with over the last couple of years you know obviously Boston was one of those now is important if I had to choose between those two and a deeper League I would say Banton But ultimately I don't know if there's a ton here right now  yeah I mean they're not gonna shut down Scoot and  I don't know if they shut down Simons Broadband just got her because he shot so much yeah I yeah I'm with you I prefer Banton he at least has like an MBA history  is also intriguing on like a Steals and blocks upside he's shown some stuff so if you yeah one of those two guys I pick up and if anybody  I think the only stereo where they would shut down scoot is if he's like this foot injury that's costing the last two games it's like if this is something that's like kind of legit and it's like hey could play through it but you know maybe stop the best idea I could see that but I don't I don't think they would purely shut him down for like competitive purposes you know I think they would have to be a true injury there  all right Caruso or Trey man man we are we are really going in on trade man on the spot he says he needs assist so if you're specifically looking for a sis Alex Caruso or Trey man  well  I mean Troy man probably has more sis upside but with Caruso  Caruso was just so much more of a known commodity it's hard for me not to just say Caruso because I think they're going to play him down the stretch the Bulls have a legit chance of staying in the play-in I think it's more than likely they will be in the plans so I think they'll continue playing their guys and  I would just rather have Caruso  yeah I would lean toward that reliability too I mean Trey man could be a better fancy player the rest of the way or lamelo ball could come back in two weeks and everything we've said about Trey man is boot so I yeah I would just lean on the known commodity in Caruso I like you said the Bulls  for better for worse they are they're pushing for the plan so I don't I don't think they're slowing down on that anytime soon  Christian says I traded away Jaren Jackson Jr worried about a shutdown I think we've gotten this question on every single stream for the last two months and rightfully so it's a good question  I yeah if you can get comparable value I would do it man I've been in I'm in the spot in a couple of weeks where I just made a big mistake you know I wouldn't say reaching for Jared Jackson but making a point to get him thinking all right I got blocks covered is going to be great  you know he's been fine he hasn't been the staff profile hasn't been exactly what we expected it's been a ridiculous season injury wise for Memphis so I don't really fall and Jackson but yeah the shutdown could be coming at some point I think the question is what does the marriage for Memphis you know are they are they close enough that they could actually find their way into the bottom four because that's probably what matters most I mean they Portland could catch that they're only they're only like two and a half up on Portland for what would be the 5th worst record so that you know that matters there are some Lottery applications there I don't think they could get all the way to the bottom floor  I don't think so but  Triple J is kind of an injury prone throughout his career too and I think they're going to look forward to next year it's not like they're bad and they have not much to look forward to next year they're bad and they might be like the third sea in the west next year so I think they might try to protect them as much as possible so yeah I would  I would move off of him and try to get any top what 50 maybe even 60 player in return like if you can trade exactly  yeah I mean if you can trade Jaren Jackson and someone wants to give you like  I don't know Franz Wagner or Nick klaxon or like Jalen Johnson or something that range I think um yeah Jalen Duren maybe I could see someone maybe like this is risky but it's like you could just offer maybe you could just offer Triple J for Zion  and just that maybe that just the opposing manager is also kind of like a panic and it's like I don't know Zion I don't trust him I don't yeah I mean I think you have to know that you're if people are paying attention you know you're gonna have to pay a tax for the possibility that he's being shut down because whoever's taking him on knows that as well so yeah I mean you're not getting you know you're not getting okay for him he just kind of have to know what you're boundaries are but I would that's always aim high first and you know don't throw out an insulting offer but you know I wouldn't start by you know trying to get like the 80th ranked player if you get to that point maybe have to think about it but yeah overall don't mind getting off of him I think it's becoming clearer and clearer where the seasons heading from Memphis  to Wood says he's in first in his head to head 12 Team league four games up on second place but  five guys are injured and they're big ones and bead and an oblique capella Jimmy Butler cam Johnson should he drop any of these injured guys I think the only one you should consider well  okay you can drop cam Johnson don't worry about it do not worry about dropping cam Johnson go ahead and do it  and bead  but it's a tough one I wouldn't drop anybody else cam Johnson I'm with you drop him 12 Team league you'll find somebody who's doing as well if not better than him so I wouldn't worry about that  and be tough I'm gonna Dodge for a second I think capella is maybe maybe droppable if you absolutely need to I could I think there's an argument for it okay um  but and then indeed yeah I don't know man what so I  you know I almost need more information about your league because  some League's stop early like if you're League ends like I don't know March 26th or something like that  if you're a league ends pre April it probably is worth dropping him if you're League ends in April like if it goes to the final week of the season  it's probably better to hang on just to see but if you want to start by dropping cam Johnson and seeing where that gets you please go right ahead I would also semi endorse capella based on who's on the waiver wire and stuff but I don't know about in BD yet  this is kind of a sicko move but what you consider floating out like in a betrayed offer before you drop them oh  okay well that's a good point yeah not just for a beep but for anybody like if you can if you can make a quick trade for any of these guys just do that instead because they're gonna get because someone might pick up cam Johnson off a waivers or capella or bead or anything but yeah for indeed  see yeah try to trade him first see what's out there  yeah I mean like offering to the team that's in fifth place or something you know and you're like all right well I have no other path to climbing up here and you know I just hoping and praying that indeed beats the time line and you know I get three weeks out of them at the end of the year you know that would burn you of course but at least you're getting a return and set up just picking up the best option off the waiver wire but yeah I I'm a wuss when it comes to like dropping guys like a bead or lamelo or Desmond Bane or whoever it is it's like I just there's that fear in the back of your mind that you're gonna get you're gonna get burned on it later all right NBA Jay says hi guys good evening from the UK all right well International flavor here firstly thanks for another great show thank you MBA J appreciate everybody listening along says I hit with Jennings and anytime touchdown last night which was nice and my fantasy teams were fire all right  we love to hear we love to hear it talking Joanne Jennings anytime TV on the on the road to wire fantasy basketball pod I wish I had invested into one Jennings there was a time last night where I'm frankly looking up like can I live batch Jennings to win Super Bowl MVP kind of like it was heading that way and of course things took a turn but glad to hear a man hopefully we're helping you out on the the fantasy team side of things but I don't I don't think either of us were we're on Juan Jennings throwing and catching a touchdown last night that did not come up on any of the past pods  Paul says  should I hold GG Jackson Trey man and or scoot Henderson or pick up Wiggins pajam ski Milton keynote George off waivers 12 Team league categories so we've talked about a pretty much every one of these guys individually at some point I'm team holding Trey man for now although all these guys are pretty appealing even Wicked we've dog more than anybody he's starting to play better  Wing is the starting to play better but I don't I don't really want to like get twisted and try like convince me like tell people that I think he's like a top 100 player or like a must roster guy  because I don't think he is  yeah Gigi's been playing well man like I was a skeptic I was a hater some might say but he's playing fine if you don't mind a pretty drastic hits your field goal percentage man I mean Melton out of all these guys has the highest upsides so I if you want to drop  Gigi or trade man to grab Melton  I I think that's fine to do but I just wish  we had more info on Melton I mean it's a stress fracture and it's lower back  so like  it's just it's really tough we don't know we all know we'd come back they're taking a game by game which is really frustrating like it'd be so much easier if they were like he's out three weeks but they won't tell us so I I can't it's hard for me to give like great advice on that  yeah I mean so scoot is probably the guy that we've talked the least about of all these on the Pod and we did just mention you know he's missed two games there's the possibility of a shutdown based on injury alone they're not they're not trying to down if he's healthy there's really no you know reason to do that he has been playing better of late and seeing a lot more minutes that's how last four games before the injury 20 points five assists five rebounds she had a better from three too which is worth noting to see if that can continue he's interesting to me like are if you could say all right he's back in the next couple of games or he's back right after the All-Star breakout worst are you holding him over most of those other guys  yeah I don't I don't think you can drop scoot right now if you hung on this long or you scooped them off of waivers this is like the exact point of the year that we were all just waiting for brockton's hurt potential shutdown for those guys like yes you mentioned with scoot he has a fuk injury himself I gotta I need more information on the foot injury before I just like Drop scoot because there is potential for him to close out the year  playing very well yeah  we gotta follow up on Bagley knew was coming are we trusting back that much older drop you're the you're the resident Bagley guy Alex oh yeah it's here here we go um the yeah I got a hold of him yeah like he he missed four games and then played 15 minutes his first game back so um it was a back issue you know sometimes guys you know they need a little time off of that so  like I guess the thing is before he got hurt  he was only playing 24 minutes of game but he's putting up 29 fantasy points per game  and  you know the Wizards got nothing to lose here and he's got almost no competition so  if he keeps playing 15 minutes yeah drop him because that's insane okay if he gets like I mean for like a week and a half um but no I'm cool trusting them  we'll see if Rashawn Holmes enters the Knicks that to me would be the only deterrent here because before they added him it's like they literally had no other centers and they would have to give minutes to Marvin Bagley unless you're starting you know kuzma or Omari or whoever at Center if Holmes works his way into the mix then I'm out on Bagley if not you kind of have to be and just based on the workload  Christopher says Memphis reminds me of Golden State a few years ago when everybody was hurt and they ended up with a high pick and we're great again next year  yeah I think that's fair I mean golden state was like 15 and 50 I think that year that was the covid bubble season kind of a good year to have a Down Season didn't have to go to the bubble didn't have to deal with any of that just a weird year for the league and retrospect and obviously they bounced back in a pretty big way the next season and you know won the title to yours later so  Memphis you know should be able to bounce back right I don't think we've used this as like it's just a blip and if anything it results in them you know getting a high Lottery Pick and maybe adding another piece to that core they have says 10 team ESPN points League I want to drop trade Jones for Gigi for upside is this a good or a bad move a drop Trey Jones for GG  I think it's fine um  yeah I I think that's fine Trey Jones isn't really a points League guy anyway Trey Jones he's more of a category League guy  and Gigi's actually averaging more fantasy points per minute  and they're playing roughly the same amount of minutes these days  yeah I'm fine with that  yeah I think that's fair if your couch in the upside then absolutely going back to the wood the question about on you know who to drop he said playoffs began in week 21 and say three round playoff so it kind of depends how your league I know somebody's will count this week and next week as one this is technically week 17 in most of the leaks that operate like that that I play in so we'd be  I mean like we're looking at like mid-march yeah so on ESPN at least I don't think that's necessarily what league you're in but we want is March 18th through 24th  and then if you have three rounds that's the 21st the 22nd and the 23rd which means basically your last game of the playoffs is the seventh oh man uh yeah I I would be more  based on that I'm I'm leaning to where it's safer to hold him  but I would I like Nick said I'm with Nick on this see if you can trade him  to somebody for like basically their worst to starters probably  like consistent start the worst two consistent starters on someone else's roster and I think  I I think you might get someone to bite okay it's gonna be borderline  I think the big issue here is can you win the league assuming this is you know had to head right can you win the league without a beat like if a bead comes back do you need him like is he the guy who's  almost single-handedly carried you to number one in the standings because of how dominant he's been you know it's like are you getting enough upside where it's like yeah maybe if you make that move today maybe that gives you enough that you're able to hang on to a top two seed but are you making it through three weeks of had to head playoffs without a Beat  yeah this is a really unique situation because it's it would be much easier if it was like Justin Bieber that was hurt for you  for for us to be like you to get just to give you advice in general but the fact that you have like five relatively key players hurt at some point you're just gonna you just need someone to play for you and yeah I mean you can you can probably get by with some streaming and to some piecemeal stuff and just you know but again yeah  I don't know man tried to trade them  there's no right answer here there really isn't all right let's do a couple more and then we'll be out here we'll talk rookies on Wednesday with Brandon Crabb it's not gonna have time for that which is fine got a lot of good questions Dr a little bit about Grant Williams earlier but we'll hit this again 12 team category League do you like Grant Williams  for me I'm still probably out I mean he's in a  slightly better situation in Charlotte you know it's just one of those guys but you don't look at him like man what could he be you know like what if you just got 30 minutes it's like he kind of is what he is I don't think there's a whole lot of developing to be done there's not a lot of unknown when it comes to Grant Williams and you know he's  you look at one game they play with Charlotte 15 and 8 with an assist the other night hit three threes that's great that was a great matchup against Memphis most of the time Charlotte's going to be completely over batched and he mixed in these games every now and then with the maps especially early in the year I mean he was great like first two weeks of the season and he was still sprinkled those in once every couple weeks and then you know there'd be like six bad games in a row so I just I have a hard time believing that you know he's just gonna be a nightly 15 and 8 going forward so if I have to be in or out I'm out  I'm gonna be out um he does have two pretty nice matchups coming up Indiana and Atlanta so pick them up see what happens but I'm gonna say I'm out partially because  I  got I wish we knew if lamelo ball was coming back but but you know part of the reason he's a low usage player in general  but it's not like going from Dallas to Charlotte  I I don't think that's inherently giving him more usage because he's also stepping into a into a rotation that has lamelo ball I used to player miles Bridges takes a ton of shots and Brandon Miller's been cooking so Grant Williams is not I don't think he's gonna touch the ball that much more than he wasn't Dallas  when everybody is healthy for Charlotte  all right thoughts on Kelly Olynyk and Taylor Hendricks so we have one current Jazz one former jazz  I've been enamored with Henry's you know through the drop process I really liked what I saw from him I was  pretty surprised that he was just not a part of their plan like at all or early on and you know spend most of the year in the G League  I think at the end of the season there's probably gonna be a week where he looks really good I would probably rather have a Linux I just I don't really trust like it's still not really clear what the Jazzy would want to do like they're so pretty competitive they yeah it's like they traded Laurie Market in like they can kind of be as good as they want obviously there's a pretty defined ceiling there but they can they could go one of two ways and I'm not sure which route they're going to pick yet I I would prefer a Linux I think he's gonna give you a much higher floor week to week  I mean I don't know what the Raptors are doing either I mean good point but if they both played this if they both played the same amount of minutes I would much rather have a Linux  and as of right now it looks like they might play the same amount of minutes so Linux saw 22 minutes against team debut 1163 3 and 1 and you know they trade it away that young so that's 15 to 20 minutes a game right there that Jung was playing  and um yeah I mean the purple only played 21 and in this game so  I think  again I'll let us rest but he's the he is he is the upside play which is funny because everyone's going to think like a Hendrix is the upside place olanick is actually the upside play ah yeah the one that I will say about that Cavs game on Saturday they are down 20 going into the fourth quarter Olynyk played the entire fourth quarter so it only played 10 minutes through the first three quarters and the Cavs are just steamrolling everybody these days so it might not be the best sample you know I wouldn't be surprised if that minute split between him and portal is a little more extreme going forward when they're not getting blown out so that's something to keep in mind but I still think I mean it has been a really good permit a guy for most of his career and he just sometimes he's in a good situation sometimes he's not like every other year with him but you know Hendrix is basically played real minutes and like three games this year it's so hard to tell so yeah I mean I don't think there's ultimately gonna be a massive Gap but I personally would rather have a Linux  all right Devin says what's up Bros I'm going to sleepers League 16 Man game pick playoffs I don't know what's going on here basically my bench is Scottie Pippen  TJ McConnell Trey Mercy or Murphy Beach and Zach Collins any good waivers to swap any of those players for um  I don't I mean I don't really think McConnell is kind of be doing I am McConnell and Scottie Pippen was a healthy scratch on Saturday  so yeah that's I don't I don't know I mean pull up some decent numbers when he's been active so I'm not totally rolling them out but something to monitor  yeah I mean if someone's a healthy scratch that pretty much kills it  you know Zach Collins has been fine McConnell's actually been getting consistent minutes which is nice but yeah I think I think Pippin's the  the move here to drop if you got a DMP CD  yeah yeah I mean I would not drop Murphy right now is in light of the Dyson Daniels injury the rest of these guys I think are all justifiable is that Collins is just not been very good lately you know McConnell just kind of whatever else is going on in that backcourt he's still a good permit a guy and then meet you we're dealing with the one game sample so who knows but there's a you know he showed enough that I think you're you're at least intrigued by what he's doing last one and then we're out of here 12 team cat league would you trade deer and fox and Harrison Barnes for Devin Booker  yeah  yeah yes Harrison Barnes may as well not even be a name in this trade like you may as well just not you know I'm just gonna pretend he doesn't even exist because he's barely he's not you don't even really have to roster him almost at any league so uh  yeah do it  yeah I mean if you look at the last couple weeks you like oh here's the barn you know he's been a actually know yet what yeah I'm back it up on this completely he's outside of the top 200  in the last 14 days and that includes like that wild stretch so like no just don't even he doesn't do anything but score every now and then he's like a bad free throw shooter he's super inconsistent just really wouldn't really wouldn't worry about it so I yeah I'm with you man you could probably drop her some bars for somebody better and just do this deal straight up I mean if somebody really wants here some barns if they're aims Iowa and they're demanding hair some bars then sure happy to include him but I would just view this as would you give up fox or Booker and yeah I think you absolutely would all right last thing before we had out did just get an update Alex on Terry Rozier shops around here says and he heard Terry Rozier has avoided any major injury as the MRI today showed a sprained right knee he'll be evaluated week to week so horses tell the Athletics so no major injury that means no torment this case no torn ACL nothing like that that's huge but still gonna be out this week still could miss time after the All-Star break a week to week is not a phrase I like to hear no so  pick up Caleb Martin people are asking about hakkas versus Caleb Martin I think this is gonna make me lean Caleb Martin more  and yeah throw Rosie on your IR don't drop him  because he could come back and  it's possibly come back after the All-Star break I suppose but I would probably  I would hope I would put a realistic timeline like March 1st basically knowing nothing but just like the wording just think about March 1st  so schedule wise Miami plays Tuesday Wednesday this week so two games they play only Friday next week  so one game week coming out of the All-Star break and then after that they do have a four game week and another four game week after that so keep that in mind you know Jacquees Martin both those guys justifiable ads as we mentioned earlier Jimmy Butler you know out in definitely probably doesn't miss too much time and then Josh Richardson got hurt over the weekend so plenty of opportunity available in Miami all right
