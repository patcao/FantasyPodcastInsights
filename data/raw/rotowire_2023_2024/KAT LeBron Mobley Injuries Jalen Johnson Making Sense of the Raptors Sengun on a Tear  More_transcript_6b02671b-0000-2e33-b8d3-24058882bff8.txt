hey everybody Welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast  Thursday March 7th I'm Dr a that's right camera it's officially injury season in the NBA so let's Dive Right In  Rick Hamill it is Steve Alexander fswa Hall of Famer we're the ogs on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast and we got you and we're gonna have fun and we're gonna have some laughs but I am over it the injuries in this league right now we might spend the entire show talking about cat  Brawn wimby Jalen Johnson Evan Mobley half of my frickin team in the cam Dynasty I'm trying to win a chip here um last night I was not a good night for me when I saw Jalen Johnson go down I needed a long minute to process and and all of that I'm not in a good way as we start the show here so we're gonna offer the people a lot of advice and we're gonna get into this and we're gonna start with the gigantic news out of Minnesota with Karl Anthony towns I mean you I mean this is this is three lightning bolts this isn't one lightning bolt it boom boom this is like three lightning bolts right here Shawnee reports he's been diagnosed with the tournament is in his left knee he's out indefinitely um any rights to devastating injury in timing what a monster year blah blah blah woe writes of es PN and he's always urinating on everybody else's report so okay so this is what you get from whoa and I'll dissect it for you he writes a wolf star Karl Anthony towns are suffered a left meniscus injury but it remains unclear about how much if any time he'll be required to miss towns in the team are working to get full understanding of degree of injury and whether it demands immediate action okay so Sean's beat him to the scoop and this is what you get from whoa we're going to keep the door  open to impossibly missing no time with a torn meniscus come on bro  this isn't the playoffs which will beating against Atlanta okay where it's like it's the freaking playoffs you either play or you die this is not that level for Minnesota there's 20 games left in the regular season um but I mean the Dre I mean what are we doing here with with is Jaden McDaniels gonna spike is it is in Anthony Edward season I mean Karl Anthony towns I think he is going to miss some time here dude I don't think he's just gonna be able to play through a torn meniscus this is the injury-prone Karl Anthony towns were talking about yeah I was just gonna say if it was a different player you never know but it's cat  and it's tough It's it's sucks for Minnesota man and it and it sucks for his fantasy managers because things were going so well  why can't Minnesota have anything nice you know  but I think Daniels is going to be better he's gonna he's I mean he's worth having  a Edwards going to go crazy  Matt that's the bottom line and thank God they have Rudy gobert and the cats not their only big man you know  I think Kyle Anderson's a nice little scoop awful ways doc if he's out there I think I think Kyle Anderson's games going to expand now I'm trying to think you know now he's read obviously is I they might start Kyle Anderson and and keep Nas coming off behind the four and the five that's gonna be an interesting decision for Chris Finch to make but bottom line and I looked in the cam Dynasty and Kyle Anderson was already on a team it's a deep League guys 14 teams with 15-man roster plus IR  um or ill so uh so yeah I what how do you see that going starting as read or start Kyle Anderson I I don't know man I I know that people who have NOS Reed are very excited right now because  he doesn't well whenever cats out  I don't know if he's gonna start or not I don't know that it really matters but not as read  is the big winner out of this whole thing  I think Anthony Edwards is the biggest winner out of this whole thing I really do I think I may go 35 a game here with a Karl Anthony towns she may be going on an absolute Rampage you know he had the recent incident where he was late to the tip off and you know so you know when you're when you're like late to work or I don't know you just I always doc pick up my game after I screw up like that I was like dig deeper and do more and like you know work harder and just I don't know I pull more into it man I try to write the wrong didn't he really screw up though because he left the previous game at halftime to go see the birth of his kid  had a new newborn showed up for the next game  played you know some guys have a kid they'll take a week off know not am  I hear you dude and I'm not mad at him leaving it halftime of  I can't remember the game I just watched it like five days ago I think it was Saturday night can't remember the other played uh but but yeah I'm just saying I I think I think Ant-Man is going to go on a chair here down the stretch  and you think about the standing stock you think about like you said Timberwolves finches can't have nice things the Springs back Joe Smith to me it brings back step in curry to me and frankly doc this is one of the reasons actually this is the reason why I'm no longer a Timberwolves fan and I know a lot of people are going to be bummed out about that and it is what it is I I'm not gonna lie to you and so I'm still a Timberwolves fan I'm not I used to have pom poms and gear and all of that stuff um and get out I mean this is what you get this is every year  right around the corner it is waiting right around the corner for the Minnesota Timberwolves no matter how good things are they've been number one of the West most of the Year this is their best season and Doc in 20 years you got to go back to 2004 when kg1 MVP and they won the West and the regular season they've gone to three playoffs since then and they have won no playoff series since then  I mean they're in it dude they're in it  how far do they fall  they will not fall below the clippers but I think they're going to fall to three I think Denver and OKC will you serve them but I I don't see them falling below the Clippers how about you  Clippers join two and a half back man that's  I guess it depends on how many games he's gonna miss which we don't know  oh you don't have games  on a team with three Hall of Famers on it is not that much it's not a big Elite  it's I think it's well it's we gotta put Russell in the Hall of Fame too I think they have three and a half Hall of Famers  they got their bowling is what they're doing they're five like a 500 team over the last 12 games they're not balling gun matter boy James started left this game he left his game Over All Star weekend man he has not been the same guy since all right so Karl Anthony towns is out I so you agree with me the Kyle Anderson's a pickup if he's out there on waivers right you grew with me on that and I was read is way more of a pickup  but not reading going to be on waivers though right well what's not Reed's roster percentage in Yahoo I mean I don't even look because I just assume he's on everybody's team he's certainly not available in any League I'm in um  I mean it's not reach still on waivers people help me out here mine it might if he's 59% roster I'm gonna freak out nasri God bless type dude you're live on the air nazri oh my God I almost nailed it he's 62% roster doc okay you got me he's the pickup  38% of Yahoo leads don't have knives read on their team what in the f is going on with that dude I don't know it's always lower than you think it's going to be um that is true that is very true um all right doc let's move on to some of the other injuries here and I believe that this one is like kind of good news okay with LeBron James leaving the game last night I mean you hear that you're like how could that be good news um ESPN has a report that he and he limped off went into the locker room they look the Lakers were getting destroyed by the Sacramento Kings okay so there was a little bit of the Pull the Rope fat let go of the Rope factor with this um James said after the game and after getting examined he said I'll be all right it's just my ankle it's just what I've been dealing with before the All-Star break after the break I'm just managing it the best way I can oh he said there's no specific play that caused it he said I played the whole third sat a little bit to start the fourth one I got back in it just kind of what ever it's just something I've been dealing with I'm in a source familiar with the injury told yes PN the ankle pain is being caused by wear and tear okay and with the short and James said some games are better than others I didn't feel it at all against OKC and I didn't feel it at all until the fourth quarter tonight so each game each day is different um this reminds me of Kobe Bryant near the end of his career and listening to some of the quotes that he had about this some days he felt great some days he didn't okay um but but doc this is this is not MRI machine this is not Shams and woes with a big breaking news thing right this is like manageable um he might miss a game or two he might miss Friday's Showdown against the box and yanis but um I don't like and trust me I got in the cam Dynasty okay I need this man I am not I'm getting way more buzzkill Vibes on a Jalen Johnson Evan Mobley right now than I am LeBron James how about you  yeah I mean we walked off he wasn't really limping he wasn't mad  I think he was just done I think he was mad at the way the game went and  he was mad that his ankles hurting a little bit but  I mean this is  this is the least of my worries I don't have all the guys were gonna talk about today so let's talk about another one doc Evan Mobley and this one this one is spiraling in a negative way so I'm watching the game the other night they're thrilling come from behind win over Boston to Dean Wade of it all and Dean Wade spiked for 20 in the fourth because Mobley got her towards the end of the third it was a direct correlation um and he turned his left ankle doc coming down from a dunk all right I mean you see that happen all the time it didn't look that bad but now we get Sean he is saying he's likely to miss extended time um you know last night I was singing bottom lines report he's going to miss at least one week you have max strus out in definitely within the strain you have not even Mitchell out in definitely with a with a knee issue a bone bruise and he just had a PRP injection and so doc let's get to some pickups here the Ripple effects right you got Dean Wade is it possible pick up Isaac Korra was a possible pickup you have Sam Merrill who was oh for nine last night against the Hawks  how bro how the Hawks not the Celtics and drawing the freaking Hawks okay who you picking up out of that group  do you trust any of them I trust the coral right now  dude he's been giving you three he's giving you STEEZ STEEZ Steals and blocks his scoring his spikes since the guys have been out like I like a coral right now I really do Jared Allen went off  there is Garland's going to go off Karis Levert is going to be  when he's healthy  Carol's guys he's like every other every other game guy now Dean wait had a huge game and like won the game for the Cavaliers there today  and then he kind of disappeared for a couple games after that I  I don't know man I don't really I don't love Merrell I don't love Levert I don't love Wade  I guess the Cairo I guess he's got process of elimination here here's the thing with Dean Wade so I've got Mobley in the cam Dynasty right and I'm on this and I'm watching these games and I try to pick up guys you know the backup to an important guy like that right when warranted so Dean Wade's going off and I see him partying with Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce and it's a whole Cleveland Love Fest right and it was all awesome the other night it really was um but I I know doing I know Dean wait okay Dean Wade is not that guy Dean Wade is a spike once and then have three Doug games pipe the guy he has never been able to sustain a level of play in the NBA okay so last night this was the dean Wade game he plays 30 minutes he had seven points at halftime okay and so you're thinking oh 14 points okay that's a solid game worthy of a pickup he ended with nine points he had two points the entire second half my man played 30 minutes okay had nine points four rebounds one three nothing else no dimes no steals no blocks okay and he shot three of eight which is 37 and a half percent that's the dean Wade experience I am telling you people right now do not pick up Dean Wade okay he he's a streamer to me Doc he's a streamer you got a two game night or a three grand game night and you want to pick up a dude that might give you 10 and 5 you know because we're struggling and you know we're entering playoff time and ten and five you know doc I tell people all the time when you play that pick up game seven days a week okay and you've always got that one spot you're making sure you've got it filled okay let's say wade gives you 10 and 5 and let's say there's probably four nights a week you've got you your roster is full because there's a million games right  okay the other three nights when there's not a game well let's let's find 10 and 5 by 3 now you're talking 30 more points to your total 15 more rebounds to your total you might win the Weak by one rebound right that's why you keep making these pickups in these streamers are so important but I got Dean wait as a streamer right now nothing more nothing less  yeah I'm with you I got fired up about him after that  five three-pointers in the end of the game when he single-handedly let them come back but I didn't think about didn't pick him up anywhere permanently and honestly there's other guys on Waiver Wires I'm looking at and necessarily these Cavaliers because  they always guys are hit or miss on most nights  so it is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast Rick kamla and Steve Alexander Hall of Famer and AKA Dr Ray um you know there's a somber sort of tilt to the show today I mean it's just injuries Galore in the NBA and it absolutely sucks but it is what it is man we're real and this is how we're feeling right now and this is what you get um doc tell me what how you're feeling about Victor we've been llama right now he's been ruled out of tonight's game against Sacramento with a sprained right ankle that he rolled the other night when they were playing Houston he came into the Houston game very questionable but the shoulder injury which I saw in the San Antonio broadcast it wasn't like some made up you know whatever he took a shot a body to body with I believe a Pacer I can't remember too many games oh but my man's banged up right now Doc so how you feeling about when he is a Defcon one DEFCON 5 or not even at a Defcon right now  well  I know is he has to play nine more games to be eligible to win Rookie of the Year  and he's going to play those nine games because he has ended the Rookie of the Year contest over the last three weeks yeah I believe he has two man uh I don't I don't think he's banged up as they think he's gonna as they're leading us to believe he is I think they're just setting us up to  you know having playing half the rest of their games and when the Rookie of the Year rookie of the year is over it's done  as long as he plays those nine games it's his  and  but I I've got him on every roster and it's excruciating almost as excruciating as it is the list of my voice right now  doctor find we love you man um so  I don't think Wendy's gonna miss much time I have a little theory on Victor one Ben Young  I love this young man Victor one been Yama is an alpha Victor one Binya is a dog I don't know if you guys have detected the dog in him yet but I have he's got Dawg in him he's got Alpha in him he badly badly badly wants to win basketball game and a doc I believe that you know who's the most important player in really person in the entire Sports organization it is Victor wembanyama what do we know about the MBA the star player usually gets what they want if they want to tell the medical team that they're playing that night a lot of times they get their way okay he's a rookie has he got enough pelts on the wall for that oh he's Victor webmin Yama okay and he's in a small market and San Antonio to me is always playing the game of keeping him there and keeping him happy so doc I believe that Victor women is not gonna want to shut down and not going to want to go back to a minutes restriction and not want to go back to know back to backs and he's going to tell them medical team Fu I'm playing um and I he's not gonna tell the medical team that but that that's the vibe right I I don't know talk to me about those intangibles with Victor and how you see them maybe leading him playing more ball here down the stretch  all right I don't know man I kind of feel like they've seen what they wanted to see  they've got their ideas for next year  we got to get him through now 10 more games let him wrap up this Rookie of the Year award  and then the rest of it is just gravy now if he's gonna fight them and fighting them to play every night  then I could be wrong and maybe I'm just  less optimistic because I need women Yama out there every night if I'm gonna win 30 deep and if I'm gonna win my rock and rolly like I need him to play him sitting out tonight no bueno for my squads so I'm hoping he misses this game and then he's good to go but I am I am concerned  well I mean this is where it is man we're gonna get to some other pickups here in a minute but it's Buzz Kill Bill I mean it's just like it's like I don't know I don't want to use a war sort of an allergy or euphemism but it's like we're losing dudes here man and it ain't cool at all speaking of that Doc and I'm going to try to be as unemotional as I can as we talk about Jalen Johnson and his injury that he suffered last night so for me Doc I mean check it out back to back nights in the cam Dynasty Evan Mobley and Jalen Johnson okay and my wife is like are you okay I'm like I'm not I'm actually not okay I needed a long minute and I I don't even know if I ever really recovered from that um but not like um you know but it just it's really really bad right now okay and Jalen Johnson's been balling all Year's specialty now without trade young um I mean the Hawks are so screwed but then you look at them and it's them in Brooklyn for the last play in tournament spot I they're going to get cooked in that first play in tour I don't care who they play either of those teams is going to get cooked  so a dog take it from there man what do you make of the Jalen Johnson injury who are you scooping up talk to me  I hated the way it looked on TV I hated the way he reacted to it I hated watching him try to walk off the court it feels like I mean it's it's got to be at least three games he's probably on crutches today  it means saddiq Bey and DeAndre Hunter are going to both go off for the next week or two  um  I would say this is in the cam Thomas  realm cam is missed six games from the Nets  and I think  Jalen's Gonna Miss three to six for the Hawks  will they still be a playoff  hopeful when this is all said and done I don't think so  they are they will be though they're still they're three games up on Brooklyn right now and Brooklyn by the way is not going to tank they don't have their draft pick okay so Brooklyn's not going to take they're going to continue to put their best out on the floor as best they can obviously they're very ravaged with injuries right now on Ben Simmons is out for the year I'm getting retirement Vibes now on Ben Simmons he's got one year on his contract after this I don't see anybody in the NBA getting into him in the summer of 2025 maybe one team says screw it veteran minimum contract let's just see if there's anything left of Ben Simmons but that's going to be the landscape for him the back injury just will not let him play doc I am streaming tonight in the cam Dynasty Lonnie Walker the fourth  can I interest you in Lonnie Walker the fourth as at least a streamer does he have your attention the last game he played 30 minutes I believe he scored 19 he had to steal or two I had like four threes and he's a 40 plus percent shooter from 3-point range this year uh Japan for some reason hated him and never played him um you know Jeff Fox rotation sucked I think we've documented this but but I I'm streaming Lonnie Walker tonight I like that he's SF eligible supposed in addition to SG as well um and if he plays well tonight I may keep him for a minute here how you feel about Lonnie Walker  I feel like you're gonna love him one minute and not love him and the next its  a very  ruler coasters ride with Lonnie Walker  so you um and then when cam comes back which is hopefully soon because I know he's like  freaking weekly lineup all week he's in the three games five already uh no I think taking a one night flier on Lonnie Walker and if it works out you keep him in if it doesn't you throw him back it's worth a shot I mean dentist or  has been nice Dennis Smith Jr is interesting Ben Simmons is done the least surprising and least buzz kill buzz kill the injury of all time Ben Simmons  you know the one guy that's actually following the NBA script it's been Simmons  but what do you mean by that what's the NBA script  that he was supposed to be hurt and not play all year  there you go that's it that's what he does you know he his whole goal in life was to be the the number one pick  in the NBA draft and and signed a big contract  and have a great rookie season and other than that I don't think he had a goals  it is what it is man it's just sad yeah I it's Lonnie Walker does tonight I might throw him in a FanDuel line up see what happens I'm just saying I got a little tickle I got a little tickle on I was looking at him and Malachi Branham of San Antonio tonight as impossible streamer and Brandon's been playing pretty well but Brandon's not a three-point shooter and I'm I think I'm up to threes in my game this week and so I want to Puff that stat up a little bit if I can't um Brandon's a slasher he is not a three-point shooter he's becoming more of a shooter but he's not there yet I think he's gone 19 and 20 in their last two games you'll have no windy tonight right um and so maybe maybe Brandon will be Unleashed but he came off the bench in the last game and I don't I just don't trust it I guess in terms of minutes and you know if he you know goes to first first six you know well then that will pop you know push some other buttons and put Wesley out there or something like that I just I trust him over Lonnie Walker because the Nets are just stripped bare right now no Simmons um no cam Johnson and and I think I think Lonnie Walker has finally greenlit for some serious playing time what about Zach Collins Tonight with no wimby and what about Olynyk with portal done for the year well okay so you hit a nerve with a Linux I love Kelly oh absolutely love him he had a really big game the other night two blocks two steals I think some threes as well um in a really fat stat line um kind of like you put up a couple of years ago in the Silly Season with Houston before he moved on this is silly season yaka portals probably done for the year he's got a fracture of some measure docs I don't think he's coming back um I'm way more geeked on Kelly yo who was the other guy you brought up right there  Colin's  exact am I do like I do like Collins is a streamer tonight but but Kelly owes the get  yeah  I think Kelly is a pickup  I think Kelly heels more than a streamer doc I think he's the guy that is gonna be no I don't know I don't know about League winner okay but maybe you know we throw League  winner around you know  you know Rocky most was a League winner he was last year in football for sure but but Kelly oh doc I don't know about League winner but he's gonna be really good down the stretch I think he's Canadian he's back in Canada the team sucks he's gonna play it they just gave him money to Doc they just gave him  a petition the money finds the floor  yeah I think he's a good pickup  where we at on your on your schedule here I'm lost so yeah no don't worry don't worry about it man um Toronto is that Phoenix tonight so so Kelly O's a good streamer or pick up and in Zach Collins I mean it's sack sack sucks defensively okay so that's a good streamer right there I know you want to talk about DeAndre 8 and Doc so give me your thoughts on De out there in Portland um here on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast with Rick Campbell and Stephen Alexander what do you got to say about d8  I mean I did I just don't know what to say about him oh are we witnessing him being shut down is he coming yeah to play that's not Jared Jackson Jr showed up last night had a terrific line we haven't seen in four games he's got a hand wrist thing it sounds like they want him to play through it  I don't know he wants to play through it but I do know your guide you off reefs who you were tweeting about five or six days ago looks really good all right do I did some investigation and doop wreath and it's not you know he's a big man okay he's gonna be some blocks know he's a good three point shooter guys he's giving you the threes and the D Portland is right now fifth in the lottery standings dock at 17 and 44 they have a chance to get below Charlotte although  unlikely Portland the last two years has shut down their guys that was with Damian Lillard one of those years had a chance to make the play in tournament if they went for it they decided to pull the plug they've already pulled the plug on this year she didn't sharp is out Stuart Anderson is out Malcolm Brogden is out I was actually surprised to see Jeremy Grandpa out there for Portland last night on playing all these young guys and so I don't think I look like how you doing um so I I here's the thing with Deandre  doesn't have a motor he doesn't have a fluctuating motor he doesn't have a motor okay so he is going to have the opportunity to chill and beg money without playing he is all about that life dude he's trying to go out there and I don't want to turn an ankle on this horse bleep Portland team I think we've seen the last of DeAndre ayton this year doc which pivots us to do our breathe um a jumaane Kamara and a possibly a Jabari Walker um I think we all like wreath right now but to do those other two guys interests you right now and do you agree with me and my theory here the idea I think we've seen the last of the Andrea 8 in this year  wow I think Aidan's gonna play  I think Aidan's gonna come back and blood but  you know I wrote in my mail bag column last night or today actually should be up today on RotoWire  you know if you need to cut the Andrea  to get into your fantasy playoffs then you do it it's it's the time of the year where hard decisions need to be made and  you got to do what you got to do to get in and a guy last night was riding he's like man I don't want to cut the end right but I might have to if I'm gonna make my playoffs and if that's how you're going to have a shot to get in the playoffs that's what you got to do I do like do not breathe as a pickup right now he's been playing very well ever since tweeted about him I think scoot's done I think Michael brogden's done I think eight and is gonna play a few games here and there but he's  I I don't it's not gonna take much for a full on DeAndre Aiden shut down to happen I'm surprised Jeremy Grant still kicking a little bit I think Simon's is good to go and I think this the Llano Banton kid is gonna be interesting to watch down the stretch he's one of those deep sleepers that can make noise but he's stable very interesting Jabari Walker like you said to Monte Camaro he's healthy but  Portland is just a mess man what a mess there's nobody there that I'm like oh my gosh I have to have that player on my team except maybe Anthony Sonos and I I think I think they're going to manufacture an injury and shut down Simon's as well which they have done at least one I think both of the last two years Delano Banton I have my eye on him doc over the last four games stat lines have gone 197 and 3 with 3 threes and and three stocks 10 3 10 and 3 with one stock then the last two games 187 and 4 with a three and last night against Oklahoma City 135 and 5 with two threes in a block like we're getting there you know what I mean these aren't oh I got to get me into those numbers but they're they're pretty good and in Benton's big and I I've heard Sean she will have talked about him and he likes him and the minutes over those last four games have gone 20 13 33 in 29 and so you know those last two games pretty good footing in the rotation there in Portland I think if you're in a gigantic deep league and Vance on  waivers you have to pick him up right now like a 30 deep or a 20 Team league you should definitely be on a squad maybe even in a 16 Team league on he should be on a squad I'm Dr asking the question right here when we gonna see lamelo ball next year Dr Ray is when we're going to see the myth  AKA lamelo ball I'm over The Ball Brothers doc I'm over it lonzo's probably done and lamelo he just  he strikes me as a lifestyle guy like he's good  like what do you I mean I heard Steve Clifford about a week ago say you know he's still doing the same stuff that he was doing two weeks ago so there's no like acceleration of getting him back there's no like oh he's checking this box and checking this box and clearing down hurdle and clearing dad hurdle it sounds like he's like just stuck in rehab mode and perfectly okay with that and so I I questioned Love of the Game with lamelo ball I questioned motor with this guy and I know he's been off injured but my God like at some point you got to come back and play right right are you saying that lamelo might be like a guy that would  let something like some snowfall on the ground keep him away from playing and NBA game that's okay what I'm saying is this know was coming a garden variety thigh Bruce would probably keep little mellow ball out you know something that any player of any substance at all would play through right I got a fibers I can play through that right rub some dirt on it so I Bruce okay Mommy I would sit out with a thigh Bruce I hate it when guys sit up with diverses man that drives me absolutely crazy I hate it when DeAndre ayton misses games because it snowed  whatever  like like I have tried to trade for lamelo ball off of your team in the cam Dynasty right Doc and I've thrown you some offers they probably sucked I don't remember what it was I don't want him right now  you have them I don't know why I don't want to either  I don't want to guys a bomb he's hurt all the time um talk to me about Alpine the other night and Shen goon detonated again last night doc talk to me about your boy Alfie  well he went through a slump in February he was kind of like  he was on my one of my ESPN columns were I was talking about fallers and he was not playing very well and he was  his stats were down and all of a sudden Man March got here and that dude turned into what is it March comes in like a lion and out like a lamb is that what they say I have no clue  well  seeing you is crazy right now so he had the 23 19 triple double last night and it's three marks games he's 31 points 15 boards six times three steals uh he has two double doubles and a triple double and it's three March games my question is  how are we ranking  fantasy centers for next year because yokich has easily  without any thought process been number one for five years  and then after that you you've got guys that can fill the bikes but now you've got Wendy  you've got Chet  sabonis has always kind of been number two behind you it's in my mind the last couple years anyway I don't know Joe Ellen bead obviously but  you got some bonus you gotta be  but what do you do with  Wendy and Chet and shin-young  because she goon I think has a chance to be  just as good as joking has been next year I like this conversation um let me just spell challenge myself here doc I will spit ball with you right here I wrote down yolk it should be Davis Anthony Davis when beat shet sabonis cat bam and alpi let me just roll through here for next year yolk is number one I'm sorry he just is number two is Victor Whitman Yama Dre number three I would put Joel embiid who would I take number four out of this group give me give me Anthony Davis at number four at number five who am I taking out of this group um defense is becoming an issue here doc as I juxtaposed Albion so bonus rather in Chene I will still take domas over Albee then I will take LP at number  six then I will take Chet at number seven I will take cat at 8 and I will take bam at night so I got yolk I got windy I got him beat I got Anthony Davis I got sabonis at five sixes albies seven is chat 8 is cat nine is Bam you got any problems with that no but I think she should use gonna be better than that in the end and I think if I get the number one pick in my draft I'm taking Wendy and all of them over yokich yep  wow I'm wow I'm convinced  I'm convinced too um so he's at 2010 and 3 assists and three blocks and like one and a half a Steals and like one and a half threes I mean my God this sexiness of this stat line and it just keeps getting better you know next year doc we're probably looking to like 24 12 and a half maybe four blocks damn maybe two steals  he's not joking it's dude my man is gaining on yolk dude you know me with the with the fantasy gold you talked me into Wendy Bro you've talked to Raines I'm looking at right now I've got Yo could three on this season  and Victor is it 8 right now  and that is a rookie that is his rookie season  szn  hey my voice cleared up I can talk you that's not man come on man I'm taking we broke in some ground here dude we broke and I I like this isn't something that I thought about it all okay we're in the here and now we haven't gone to the playoffs yet docs hit me with the next year Bible okay cool let's go down this road let's hit this rabbit hole I mean I can't believe I'm here right now saying somebody other than yolk is going to be the number one overall pick next year  wow we have gotten here we have gotten some I would take Wendy over Luka I would take Wendy over SGA I would take when be over you know LeBron and Durant and all those guys  I think the only player you can you don't possibly  take Wendy over is yokich and I'm even taking one over you coach  because I don't care  um yokich is at  2.2 stocks right 1.2 steals 0.9 blocks somewhere right around that that area right when bee is next year might be at six stocks per game Doc Wendy is going to be unfair  he wasn't very he is unfair right now he's unfair right now but I mean the numbers are only going to get better this guy's gonna be doing quad a doubles like what quadruple doubles um I guess that's a completely stupid thing to say a quadruple double I think a quintuple double is possible with this guy um my God my God ah so on the fantasy on the road of our fantasy basketball podcast Rick Camilla and Steve Alexander Hall of Famer we have just Broken Ground here Nicole yokich will not slash should not be the number one overall picking fantasy basketball next year I can't believe I'm saying this right now weird  all right doc I want to talk to you about a couple of other guys here before we hit the the comments and talk to the people out here um I have dropped GG Jackson in the cam Dynasty  I'm over it over the GG Jackson thing youngest player in the league I know it's a dynasty league but you know my I've got a lot of guy I've got you know  I'm probably not gonna be able to keep him on what I've got on my roster right now so he's kind of in that pick up mode kind of in that um churn and burn little window that I've got on my team but doc here's the here's the the cold hard facts to the people  GG Jackson gives you about 11 points he gives you about three rebounds he gives you about one assist he gives you  no defense um gives you about 1.73 okay and here's where it really hurts his shooting percentages oh my God are they bad he shoots in the 30s you're getting a lot of 4443 for 10 three for eight one of nine blah blah blah I'm out um and I think the guys gonna be a nice player he can really stroked it he's got depth on his three ball he's a little bit bouncy I need to see more of that translate to the defense event like I got my eye on the Young fella but I have sent that kid back to waiver well you were the leader of the GG Jackson fan club  you were the one that have has analyzed his stroke his shooting stroke you have watched him grow up in you know you you just talked a lot about Gigi Jackson I knew it was gonna be a rough ride dude it's a roller coaster and now that you've gotten rid of him  you watched Triple J's going to get shut down and Gigi's gonna probably just be a monster um I I disagree and I'm not worried about that at all because Taylor Jenkins has GG Jackson in this Lane in this box he doesn't start he only plays like 22 23 24 minutes and I don't know and this is even when Jaron Jackson is out of the lineup he's still stays in that box I don't know if he's gonna get out of that box if you get here's the thing though doc even if it goes up to 33 minutes and he starts GG Jackson is still going to shoot five a 15 in most of these games right in the offense gonna suck because he's such a young guy yes Cynthia diamond is he won um and then one more guy I want to talk about with you the silly meech I want to know if he has your attention here I have picked him up in the cam Dynasty because um I think he's going to be kind of nice here down the stretch he was a rock star dock in Europe before coming over here like you're a league MVP level guy okay like the guy over there the  guy can play he's 30 okay so he's not some raw Rook this guy's a vet last three games um he is gone with the minutes 2835 28 he's been starting next to train man we already talked about lamelo ball I don't think he's coming back guys um and the last three games meets is gone 13 points 7 assists my thing just changed I mean 13 points 7 assists two steals one three the next game was 12 to and six with two Steals and no threes and the last game was 21.5 and 4 two steals one three made eight of 15 um doc he is he is not going to greatly impact the three-point line he's going to be between I believe one and one and a half threes down the stretch here he's not going to get up to two he's a really good steel guy and I went through his number his your old is European numbers he's a really good steal guy so that that's a number that I believe in okay he's an awesome dime guy oh so he's gonna be seven eight nine dimes and maybe not 9 like 6 7 8 9 times a game I think he was a really good score over in Europe so I do believe in a 15 to 20 window for him to score maybe it's 13 to 18 but you get my point here he's going to be putting some points on the board on decent rebounder about three a game in a pretty good shooter  overall like he takes good shots he's a driver gets a lot of buckets at the hoop um instead of just settling for jumpers so what this the ceiling meet you of Charlotte have your attention  the Sealy meets he did not but he does now he's on a nice little March run 1312 21 points  to steals a game  six assists like you said  not shooting very well from three so far not not shooting it great  from the field but  man they're giving him minutes  and there's nothing left to play for in Charlotte you might as well let him play I like it  they just traded for him and he's on a contract that goes beyond this year um and Steve Clifford is veteran coach and he likes veteran players he's  playing your boy Davis bertans dude because he's a vet and he knows what he's doing out there so I think I think you should just going to continue to play for Coach Cliff here doc let's go to the streets let's talk to the people man  my teams are being destroyed by injuries it's sickening  the ogs  Living Legends this is great there's no questions they just love us right it's it's it's great here we go  Jesus wants to know his cat a drop in this point  my fancy playoffs start next week  I can't do it yet I can't do it yet I need more news that whole wide piece of this thing I need to I need to know if there's  a real possibility that cat is not going to miss a game  it's just too early I I need I need a little bit more detail on this I  dock let's do some math on this dude we have five weeks left in the regular season five weeks this is a meniscus if you get caught even if he has the removal of the meniscus okay and there's a big difference here when you remove meniscus it doesn't grow back okay and it can lead to like dilapidation and it can lead to bone on bone Brandon Roy ran out of meniscus and had to retire um but when you remove the meniscus you get back on the court quicker when you repair the meniscus you get back on the court a lot longer out and so I don't know where they're at with this process right here obviously they're one of the best teams in the league there is going to be that urgency but if your car llanthony towns you're off injured you know do you want to take these safer longevity route and do the Long Haul we're done for the year so I don't know doc but that's what I'm waiting on is it going to be a surgery if so is it going to be a removal or repair oh yeah I don't know and I'm not I'm not dropping Karl Anthony towns  until I find out more information in it we should have more information  um today's what Thursday we should have more information by Friday I would think because there is a sense of urgency here like we need either get this done right now or we need to get him back on the court or we need to shut him down so I think we're gonna have some sort of answer  coming I wish it was somebody other than Karl Anthony towns though because  you know if whether he has it removed or repair it or just gonna play through it  there are other players out there I have more faith in to show up and do it every night you know  it's it's sucks man it really really sucks like people that have you know future bets on the Timberwolves and this kind of thing you know that that ticket that ticket tickets dead I mean they winning the West going to the finals all this it's dead it ain't gonna happen now unless cat plays through this and I guess that's possible go ahead doc  Pol today is my least trade deadline I really need you guys oh I was offered Jamal Murray and Kelly o Olynyk  for my Anfernee Simons and keyonte George should I take it um Paul I need to know if this is a dynasty League or if this is just a regular redraft league but it's redraft then I'm doing it  then I'm doing it I'd rather have Jamal Murray and Kelly o down the stretch than Simon's in keonte and it's not even close  it's not even close  I like keonte a lot the rest of the way these  two illness games have killed me I had to cut him  and I'm not happy about it  like you said Portland shuts guys down so I'm a little worried about Simon's  no it's or no longer the kings of the West and they they have to fight for everything they get now so I think Murray's gonna be out there I think Olynyk is going to be a good play in Toronto I like that side of this deal as well  take it this is this is a layup to me if it's a redraft this is a layup if it's a dynasty League  I may not do it but in a redraft it's a layup take it and run Dita wants to know who you like Gafford or Paul Reed and why doesn't Dallas use Gafford properly it's driving me nuts well doc why did Jason kids start Dwight Powell over Christian Wood last year  tell me  talk to me I don't know  okay because Jason kids rotation suck that's why dude I get it you tanked to get Derek Lively Derek Lively is a bouncy young big drawing comparison to Tyson Chandler I understand all of this I understand that Luca pardon me  Luca lobbing to Derek Lively it's happened more than any other lob combo in the league I understand all of it okay well who is a better basketball player right now doctorate Daniel Gafford or Derek Lively Daniel Gafford it's not closed Gafford should be playing to me 28 minutes and Lively should be playing 20 minutes and that's how you do it the old tips thing right where Robinson and heart and Stein and you just they just get the 48 and they don't play anywhere else and that's what you get that's what I would be doing if I were Dallas but Jason kids rotations have been mystifying for years now I say Paul Reed based on NSA Paul Reed and I don't see kids changing this and and giving us what we want he never gives us what we want so I would rather up all read than Daniel Gafford  if you watch Dallas play Gafford still really important to what they do  in real life and he's  he's contesting shots he's getting hustle points he's making plays but he's not getting enough minutes to really make a huge fantasy impact and I still don't trust evolve Paul but  I trust him I trust his rotation and his minutes more than I do Gaffers Jose says that Tyler hero was dropped is he a pickup  or guys I got Sarah Thompson Bagley or Middleton  I mean I don't want to mess with Middleton because he's hurt I don't want to mess with Tyler hero because I don't know when we're going to see him again  oh so I'm not picking up town here right now I want somebody who's healthy somebody's gonna play now that list I think all seraphim's man this is a tough one I agree with you doc but if you're in a position where you have maybe a d if you've got like a really small bench and your bench has to become starters and um you can't afford to mismon games then the hero pickup is tough if you are in a spot where you've got a deeper bench and you can stash some formats it allows you to stash some formats it's so condensed it does not allow you to stash especially if you're Hustlers like me and doctor and you want to win every night and every week um you know with with no exceptions I mean there's there's got to be  you know a mindset of Destruction out here you've got to want to destroy your playing again it's not just oh you know what I'll get them next week no no that ain't gonna work man um and most of the people here you guys are on the the fantasy savants like me and do you all understand this but if you have a deep stashables I don't think he's gonna miss a ton of time here um I had a hyper extension of the knee so that's always dicey here doc but Miami is in it they're trying to stay out of the plane tournament right now they're definitely not going to shut down Tyler here so I think he's gonna come back here at some point I would scoop him up if the situation was right all right we got one more than we're out are you trading what are you trading for nausea read right now I am I I think  if you can get nausea read for reasonable deal you do it  but his value is obviously a lot higher today than it was yesterday so you're going to be  paying more than you maybe should be for so it's kind of a slippery slope  and my trading for knots read it depends on what I'm giving up I mean I'm not gonna give you you know like a hot shot guard for Nas read I'm not even sure that knot is Reed starts I'm not  I it will he play more will he score more probably yeah but will he start and like really take off you know will he be the new starting for the Minnesota Timberwolves I don't know there's a better question here's a better question  who was the pickup with cat out now I was reader Kai and well it's not sweet but like I said I if not as red is on waivers in your league that's a bad look for your league but yeah I'd go Nas and then Kyle but I do think Kyle's a pickup  yeah um  I mean I would trade for Nazarene but you know it's such an open-ended question it's impossible to answer like what what exactly would I trade for Nazarene I don't know I'd have to think about that man look into it get creative do something don't offer the house and the car though you know what I'm saying because you don't know you can't assume that NASA is going to become a 20 and 10 guy all of a sudden you can't assume that man he may linger around where he's at right now coaches are weird man coaches don't like to change a whole lot doc um so they may keep Nas in the lane that he's in and put Kyle in that starting lineup let me look up something here real quick let me look up how many starts K A has versus notes and because I got a point to make off of that Kyle Anderson this year has started only four games okay so maybe I'm wrong about this speculation let me look at how many games not read has started in the Timberwolves have been really healthy this year not to started 0 games so when they've had optionality if a Jayden Jayden McDaniel  is out or something like that but you know he's a wing not a big so that that's not really a good comparison right there so I'm chasing my tail right now and all I know is I'd rather have knives read and I could see him going up by two or three points stock going up by a rebounder two but I don't think he's gonna just take off and go crazy here without cat I have a question for you  where was this John Collins in Atlanta  I John Collins is off my radar man I don't you sing me a song about jot J I know JC is your guy he's been falling  for six blocks here and I he if they're shutting everybody down no marketing just like you said and it's the John Collins show every night right now  and I fear he will be next in the shutdown process down there you go there you and it'll be a lot of Lucas cemani and you're my boy yours event I do like Omar Yurts event I do like that dude and sense of all the Double-Double she's gonna be a lot of those guys I don't know what you touched Julie team is but it's the Utah Julie team right now it's about to be  all right well that doesn't man we are at the end times people watching today that was cool we will be back Thursday to do this again  and I'll be back Tuesday with a special guest I know who it is yet I will try to make sure  it's a good one we will see you all next time Rick peace out Rock God
