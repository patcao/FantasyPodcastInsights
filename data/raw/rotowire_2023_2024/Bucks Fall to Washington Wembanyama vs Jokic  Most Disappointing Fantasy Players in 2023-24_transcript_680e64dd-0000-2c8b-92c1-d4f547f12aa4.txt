Nick Whalen braided Kravitz here it is Wednesday morning it's the road to wire fantasy basketball podcast talking all things NBA believe it or not and we had a busy busier than usual I should say Tuesday night in the NBA 9 games last night will go through all of our takeaways there I'm gonna do my best to bite my tongue when it comes to the Milwaukee Bucks who somehow lost on the road to the Washington Wizards last night we'll talk Rockets Timberwolves Golden State you know they got a win over Dallas they're in good position now to defend off that frisky Houston Rockets team we'll get into some surprises some disappointments from the fantasy season as we go more big picture of these next few weeks and of course look ahead to the playoffs Brandon let's Dive Right In man as my good pal on the XM show Jeff Erickson would say we got a rip off the Band-Aid when it comes to the Bucks and you know Dr Rivers last night said he called he called out the traveling party he didn't call out the team he said everybody that's with us we're not taking these Road games seriously enough and these are the games man you know it's one thing from Milwaukee to come up short against Boston you know to falter and get some of these big opponents every team has their slip-ups but you know I was talking with my Bucs Fan friends last night in and we were saying like these these games just felt like they didn't have it to the Bucks in previous years when this team was such a jugged in the regular season it felt like they would almost never be tripped up by a team as bad as the Washington Wizards and granted no Damian Lillard last night I think there are some caveats if you if you really want to make some excuses Malik Beasley went off two of 13 from the field one of 10 from Beyond The Arc he sunk both of my prize picks entries I had Malik Beasley a Corey kispert more on six Bates 3's  well they combined for 28 attempts  or excuse me no 21 attempts and only hit five of those and I also had Malik Beasley over 13 and a half points so that the usage was there as we expected but I actually I actually do think I don't want to you know be like Malik Beasley's the reason they lost this game but I do think Malik Beasley they're expecting him to be there knocked down shooter and I think it actually is a little bit underrated when you have a guy who you're feeding wide open looks throughout the game and this has been something that's played Malik Beasley more often than not it feels like since the All-Star break is he's had these really down games you know when you lose to a team like Washington by Four Points it's pretty easy to imagine like what a blank Beasley just hit two or three more of those wide open threes maybe that game's different with that said it shouldn't come down to Malik Beasley making a missing three-pointers when you're talking about the discrepancy between the Bucks and the Wizards right now yeah I blame the I blame the equipment guys according to Doc Rivers this is this is a team wide issue not just the players that are involved he said he's been taking notes I would love to take a look at that note pad what exactly oh okay the equipment guy is laughing let me see if I could judge that down I mean I clearly they have issues with depth I think is the biggest problem and some of the names look the same but the performance is are not and and you get that sort of variance with role players so you always have to stay on top of that aspect of team building maybe they missed done today divincenzo a little bit too much but you know Damian Lillard I don't think Saves the Day necessarily you got to be able to make hay with out him especially against the Wizards this isn't this isn't game six against Boston in the Eastern Conference Finals it's the Wizards they're terrible they just don't have enough guys right now that they can depend on outside of Giannis  and teams have learned you know they learn how to deal with great players Giannis can't beat you by himself and it's going to take a cast around to be certainly did and he put up huge numbers and was really good last night but you know he's not shooting threes he's not helping to Anchor that part of the game that is clearly lacking for this team they they've got problems and I don't know if I mean they're kind of running out of Runway here to fix those issues and I don't think Damian Lillard alone is enough to really I just don't feel good about them going into the playoffs  point I agree and I think a performance like last night to me is almost more concerning than you know repeatedly coming up short against Boston right I think there's there's kind of things you can poke holes in for each one of those Boston matchups and say well you know they were missing this guy whatever I think you know having a slip-up like this is these are the type of games that really make you wonder about their viability come to post season and I think the other part of this is you look at the teams that Milwaukee is likely to face in round one and you know with a bout six or seven games remaining for most teams it's highly highly likely that they will face one of Indiana Miami or Philadelphia and I don't think any of those are matchups that you love right obviously they have all this this recent history with the Indiana Pacers they've been a team that's had their number all year we know Miami I think we need to go into that that's been a team that's given Milwaukee nightmares multiple times in the postseason and then Philly I actually think Milwaukee matches up fairly well with the Sixers but it's not a round one matchup that you welcome right you don't want to face Jollibee and  Tyrese Maxey and we saw him beat you know return last night certainly played more minutes than I expected a fill it off you got the win over okay see no SGA and no Jalen Williams the good Jalen Williams that is for OKC last night so you know we do need to mention that but and beat play 29 minutes the biggest thing that stood out to be is he seems like he's still being officiated in the old days of the MBA 12 free throw tabs he was getting the classic MB calls some of the calls that feel like they've been legislated out of the game over the last couple of months and you know we could talk about it and what he looked like and you know what kind of Runway he's going to have going into the playoffs but right now Milwaukee is not looking at a cakewalk you know they don't have this like built-in ramp up here you're not getting the Atlanta Hawks or the Chicago Bulls and round one where you have this ability to kind of figure things out on the fly like they're gonna need to be locked in right away for round one oh absolutely and I think that even goes for Boston the difference is that we believe in Boston William Moore with what the hell consistent dominant they've been over the course of the regular season but if Miami ends up at that eight spot you think you think Boston's not a little bit nervous the team that here so right so they should be nervous and they're good and Milwaukee's not they're not I mean they're they're good and like record-wise 47 and 28 really good they are not as good as they are supposed to be and they don't look like a team that would be impervious to a first round loss right to any of these teams Miami can turn it on at any moment they did it last night Philadelphia Philadelphia is such a it is such like it's almost like a mirage seeing them as the eighth seed if Joel embiid is healthy all year are they any lower than three in the Eastern Conference so you've got a three seed essentially sitting in the eighth spot right now I think we would both agree the Bulls in the Hawks would be a miracle if they made it out of the play in tournament because the teams that will be above them are so much better Indiana I mean honestly even though they haven't won a game against the Pacers yet this year if I'm Milwaukee I'm praying that I get the Indiana Pacers just based on who else I'd have to go up against yeah I think you're right I think the Pacers are the team that you want here and again the Pacers have given the Bucks plenty of trouble this season I don't I don't think that's a cakewalk by any means you know Milwaukee last year best record in the Eastern Conference 58 and 24 lost in five games to the Miami Heat right so we've seen different variations of this Milwaukee look completely bulletproof last year they still get tripped up in round one now they look significantly worse in the regular season and you could you could absolutely see that happening again I do think we forget though you know honest best half of that series against Miami you know it was a disaster they still should have won the series I get all that but I think there are some caveats there I you know I texted my friend's last night I'm like the bucks even me like no enjoyment the season I was so so hyped up for the Damian Lillard experience and yeah there's there's been some moments you know I don't think Lillard is as I still think it's the right move you know I think if you I still think you have to do that I don't think there's any real regret there necessarily for Milwaukee but this this is not clicked at all in the way that we thought it would even when Willard spend healthy and he's I think he's is only nine games on the year they're yet to to really put together that dominant stretch where they've looked like this Milwaukee Bucks team of old especially in the regular season am I write them off no do I still think they're the team that has the best chance to beat the Boston Celtics yes but sitting here right now coming off of a loss to the Washington Wizards it's really really tough to have faith in this team elsewhere last night you're Orlando Magic we're not in action so we get to Jump Around The League a little bit don't get to end up beating the Spurs in Denver notion won't worry by the way you just six games in a row which is a little concerning I would imagine they're being cautious with him as the postseason approaches but still something to keep an eye on yoga shows for 4216 and six with a steel and two blocks another just outrageous performance by Victor WeMo who he did have 23 points on 29 shots he was two of 11 from 3 that he's comfortable taking 113 pointers I think that's generally a good thing for the Spurs but he did that 15 rebounds 8 assists nine blocks including a couple on yokich yeah it's amazing too if I watched part of this game and my eyes popped out of my head at least 15 times between the two of them up and down the court Yoko should do something amazing and then and then women would do something incredible and the other side and then when B would block yolk it I thought women Yama was doing a good job on Nicole yokich and then in this is how yogic works it looks like he's having a bad game sometimes and then you're like oh he's got 40 points tonight he's one of the few players that's able to usually if a guy's scores in that range it looks like he's doing it and you could just sort of like suntars his way to 40 points and 16 rebounds but I mean when bin llamas still has a lot of work to do I think you see that the stat line is incredible and and it shows what makes him special but he got worked by yoke at last night more times than not the block  shot shots are nice that's just one play what does it show up in the box or maybe it does because he had 42 was how often yoke it's just got whatever he wanted again women unless when he was standing right in front of him with his hand up yokich was was working him throughout the course of the night but look you're dealing with right now we're probably going to be the two best bigs or at least the most skilled most impressive in the NBA for the next five years and we've got a lot of matchups between those two coming up I cannot recommend it enough stop what you're doing that's the NBA league pass game anytime these two two guys play against each other they're just a joy to watch but women Yama don't let the stat line full you yokich work them and and I think he's got some work to do he does he does but you know nine blocks man it's incredible and ridiculous dude I and I feel like we do this on every pod now and it's mostly because I just love Wendy so much but I also don't love the when we nicknames I'm gonna retract that we now I'm trying not to call Wendy I think we need a better nickname I mean this I was telling this to Alex on Monday like I don't think we've talked enough about women Yama Not only living up to the hype but in my opinion vastly exceeding it blowing it out of the water both in terms of health in terms of total games played in terms of production just in terms of how it looks right I mean you think of the great rookie Seasons guys who've developed into some of the best players in the NBA there's been a lot of great ones right but I I think this is this is the best rookie season that I've seen it's better than LeBron's it's better than you know mellow who had a great rookie year Durant whoever else you want to throw on that list at least in my lifetime you know I'm not going to speak on anybody who debuted in the 70s or 80s or early 90s but this has been ridiculously impressive from webmin Yama from start to finish and you mentioned something  that makes sense with the okay kids right I think the best players in the NBA that's something that's emblematic of those guys when you reach a certain level that even your bad games feel like good games has been at that level you'll get obviously has been there for several years now you just don't really have bad games when you're like a top five player and yeah we've been out of you know 29 shots last night wasn't effective I get that he's almost at that point for me now too or it's like you see kind of feel like he's struggling and he's still putting up monster numbers even on his down nights yeah it just everything just comes so naturally to him and and the way that he gets his teammates involved keeps things open for him I saw a past that he made last night that  you know it it's not going to be his biggest highlight reel pass but it's such a good example of what makes him so dangerous he was he was delivered the ball from the top of the key and he passed he passed it to the corner I forget who it was probably Porter  before the ball was firmly in his hands he was dishing it out to the corner you can't defend that he knows where he wants to go before the ball gets to him and then is able to make the pass quickly they're not a lot of guys in the NBA that can do that that decisively that accurately and that's what makes him special so he's he's dangerous I'm not telling you anything you don't already know I would try to look up is he's Victor Windham the biggest runaway rookie of the year that we have ever seen now I wonder  who else even compares um in history this hat and you know it's tough to it's tough to pull that off the top of the Dome like that but I think just the point is there's probably not anybody and NBA history that that pulled away the way that he has in his first season yeah yeah it's tough I mean I'm looking at the list right now and you know somebody who somebody who jumps out to me pretty clearly is Chris Paul in in 2005 2006 The partially because that was not was not a fantastic draft it was basically the Chris Paul draft he got all but one first place boat the other one to Darren Williams Daryl Williams actually finished sixth in the voting so I don't know what happened there that was probably a Utah voter but that was like one of the biggest Landslide Rookie of the Year votes that we've seen and Chris Paul obviously was amazing right away as a rookie right I mean in terms of the advanced metrics like he was putting up like elite windshear elite four windshield for 48 right away I'll give you one guess by the way who finished number two in rookie of the  Year voting that year he was a then Toronto Raptor I of course think of him as a Milwaukee Bucks but he bounced around for a while  he sniffed like an All-Star game or anything like that this was behind Chris Paul yes and I'll give you another hint he played at UConn  you know I'm gonna kick myself because there's an I feel like I have a name on the tip of my tongue and I can't I can't come up with it  one last TNT he famously tweeted from the locker room in the early days of Twitter  at halftime  Charlie fill it away ah damn it  Charlie away by your 2006 Rookie of the Year runner-up I think Luca by the way in 2019 that was that ended up being a landslide he had 98 of 100 first place votes but  there was some Trey young momentum right me Trey started that season so poorly and played really well down the stretch I mean he got a couple of first place votes I don't maybe that wasn't like a crazy crazy Landslide but it was it was pretty clear by the end of that season that local was the guy yeah and that that would make sense I don't know that you look at the past some of the past names you'd probably have to go back Wilt Chamberlain I'm thinking we were in a live in the 60s for this was actually in the first I remember that year I mean like it was yesterday you know Shack in 9992 93 probably ran away with it back then so not that a lot of camping rookie of the year now Karl Anthony towns in 2016 swept it he had a he had every single first place vote for zinkus was second you'll get ironically was third obviously that was not the Oak Ridge that we know now little Okafor got 34 second place votes to give you an indication of where the league was at that point but you got to forget like I remember and they still do this you know the annual NBA GM survey there was like a three or four year period from like 2016 to 2019 where there's always that question of if you could start a team with any player in the league who would it be and I remember cat being the resounding answer for a couple of years yeah  yeah how times have changed but he's you know cats had himself a nice little year what do you I guess Victor women is going to be the most common answer next year when they have this survey  he's gonna be the most common answer for several years as long as he stays healthy right I mean I don't say yeah I don't think there's an argument for for anybody else right I mean and Joker just in that old right Dodge it is still in his is like early to mid-20s like there are other guys you can make a case for but I I don't see how it's not Victor webinar Rookie of the Year by the way has been off the board for over a week now at DraftKings like you can't even bet anybody else it's going to Victor web  yeah you'd have to bet like a thousand dollars to win a penny at this point if they even put it back up but they're not going to if you've got 100 million dollars maybe  you could win ten dollars the Vegas later tonight I was  then of the venmo you some cash yeah I'll throw just one tiny little cup of water on the web banana hyped right and just to keep things reasonable here because I think you have a you know you're not off the rails here but I think you've lost your faculties a little bit when it comes to doctor women Yama I'm not  the one thing that I will say that has we have not seen yet and it is just year one so I'm not panicked about it but where I paused is it has not translated to anything yet it the stat line is tremendous and not a word player I mean right now you can't say yes to that I also don't blame him because the Spurs are terrible I see you rolling your eyes I don't I'm not playoffs this first two years but LeBron 135 games in his first season  and Victor whimmy yamas gonna have to struggle to get to 20 this season so that's my that's my only hesitation is let's it looks great and the stats you know fantasy reality fantasy was this is a slam dunk there's nothing you could say that to Doc what he has done but we haven't seen it translate and twins yet that has to be the next step now thats not all on him most of its not but he's such a unique player does that style translate to winning basketball I I'm not saying he's not a winning player I'm saying  that he can't be a winning player I'm saying he's not yet because look at the record I mean it speaks for itself at these it's not like you said he has been he has exceeded the hype which means he is doing amazing things but those amazing things aren't turning into W's in the win loss column okay first of all Lebron had helped right he had Ricky Davis he adds the join us oh goskas he had Carlos Boozer none of those guys now you're right you're right if you want to play Devil's Advocate I get it web pajamas seventh and defensive win shares he is 20th in total win shares which is actually higher than I would have guessed to be honest quite actually no that's that's not correct he is 28th and 4th I was like the wrong column which is tough when you're on a team that's winning like 16 games you're just not gonna pile up that many win shares so that's part of how the stat works but now I think he's a winning player dude I don't see any any thing about Victor women Yama that's not a winning player and to be the passing is the biggest I guess surprise for me we could pass a little bit but I mean he's now routinely putting up these like five six seven eight assists games on a team that's terrible and blows a lot of assists for him on a nightly basis like he's not he's not a yogic level passer nobody is at that size but he is well well on his way to being one of the better passers I think at his position in the MBA for a long time and I always say that's I don't think that's something you can learn there's not a lot of guys who come in and you know put up like one or two assists and then three or four years later all the sudden they're averaging seven assists like you just kind of have that or you don't anybody who's played basketball you kind of know what you either have the vision or you don't you can't really learn it and I think he absolutely has that like not only you know is he comfortable scoring for anywhere I think he's you know on his way to being the best defensive player in the NBA I think he's really really really Advanced as a pastor for his age yeah there's a lot that he does really well but like last night they they had a lead against in the Denver Nuggets are so much better so this is probably unfair but look I can only assess what we what we're watching in front of us and the Spurs are bad but they had a lead they had an opportunity to kind of flex whatever muscle they have and when banana put up all these gaudy numbers nine blocks you give up 42 points to Nicole yokich last night this is the best defensive one of the best defensive big men in League I know it's yokich but like still this this is you put yourself in an opportunity to win a basketball game up against one of the the most dominant big in the NBA you put up the numbers and it didn't translate into anything so that's that he's the next hurdle for him to climb and part of that is going to be having a better team around him but I also want to see him actually  make these numbers mean something we've seen guys every single year in the NBA we talked about them on this podcast guys that put up numbers we love those players not everybody that puts up numbers translates to winning basketball games he probably will be I would I would bet that he becomes that but right now you can't say that he is because it hasn't happened yet okay last thing I'll say on this then we have to talk about some breaking news for the Charlotte Hornets  I think the league is so deep now that it's it's really tough I mean it's always been tough there are very few rookies who put up great numbers and are also on a good team you know that's just by virtue of having the number one pick right I mean do you typically go into a terrible roster that's like most quarterbacks struggle early on in the NFL because you're on a bad team I think it's harder than ever to pile up with like I'm surprised by the way that the calves 135 games LeBron's rookie year I did not know that but the lead was also terrible talent wise depth-wise in 2003 compared to where it is now it's like where do the winds come for this for this first team right there's there's like five teams in the NBA where On Any Given night you're like yeah to see the Spurs win in this game I mean they're eight and a half 12 and a half Point dogs every single night because there's just not that many cupcakes yeah and I mean they've they've got a beef up their roster a little bit I want to see what women looks like when he plays next to at least one other player that you would consider to be at least in the consideration of an All-Star vote Midway through the season it's it's unfair it's unfair to judge him I admit that but I can't we again we can only do what we can only assess what's in front of us right now how does he play off of somebody else women Yamaha has nobody to play off of he plays his game and then hopes that the scrubs around him do well from three and that's about it that's the game and he didn't even have his full a lot bit of of player the Sohan didn't play last night you know like so I started for the year  well yes so I mean you're not gonna get him again it's all on wind beneath so the numbers are gonna look great but  minus 9 in the Box Score Nick  that's the that's the count for something by the way we do have I know this is not NBA related but I know you're not this is not good for the AFC South you could I'll let you break the news stuff on digs is just traded to the Houston Texans I know you had I was I went looking for the Charlotte Hornets news and I get this thrown in my face draft pick compensation is what Adam Chef there's reporting it's not what he expand that's that's gonna be a loaded offense I know man  um you'll hear more about that on the the RotoWire fantasy sports Today Show on Sirius XM coming up in about an hour but the Charlotte Hornets breaking news is that Steve Clifford will be stepping away after this season he's still going to coach the final seven games so don't be alarmed it'll be out there it's gonna be a nice little farewell to her for Steve Clifford he's gonna move into a front office role don't blame him this is got to be a horrible team to coach I would imagine he's just burned out at this point but it makes sense right I think Steve Clifford it's like with the Piston when the Pistons brought into Dwayne Casey and you're like what do you think you are right like what why are you bringing into coach this roster it's like Steve Clifford is kind of a mismatch with what the Hornets have going on right now oh absolutely I lived that first hand my first year with the magic was in 2018 so I got to know Cliff well and then he was not in when they when they traded vouch Aaron Gordon and Fournier even though it was the right move and I think even at the time most Magic fans can get on board with that because that team had a specific ceiling but that was a playoff caliber team even if it was the eighth seed and that's what Steve Clifford was into he wanted guys that were veterans knew how to play the game would lock in defensively you know Aaron Gordon look up the player he's become with Denver those are the guys that he wants to coach the second they blew up the team  he and the management crew over in Orlando said they decided to part ways because Clifford didn't want to be part of the rebuild they didn't fire him that was because that was his doing so when you see things go south as quickly as they did in Charlotte it doesn't surprise me at all that he doesn't want to be in on that I just hope that he gets another opportunity because I think Steve Clifford is a really good coach but what are you supposed to do with the magic team that blows it up you're not going to win there and a Charlotte Hornets team that kind of forced to go into the tank again because of lamelo balls injury  all right let's hit a couple questions from the chat here A Guy Kenny says he's in finals week Keon Ellis has been lacking do we hold a replacement in a nine Cat 10 team had to head League he needs assists Steals and Blocks he's got two ads left on waivers this potential options you bet two GG Jackson Jake laravia branding Clark or Max troops any of those names jump out to you um yeah I mean Keon Ellis had a couple of nice moments all these guys feel very similar to me as far as just not being able to rely on them night to night but Gigi Jackson I think would be the one that I would go after  his roles so carved out with Memphis and he's I think he's a toughest player they got right now points wise rebounds I think I would I would tend to lean in that direction for the full array of stats  yeah I think it raining Clarke got the minutes I would go that route but I don't know what they're doing with him  right I mean he just came back from a serious injury and you know he's a veteran they don't really have reason to push him Grizzlies play tonight at the walkie then they play a back-to-back Friday Saturday so as Kenny notes in the chat I think there's a decent chance Clark sits one half of those of that back to back  so that that probably eliminates him I mean again in a points League GG Jackson would be my answer he's been super consistent the minutes have been there you know regardless of who's in who's out with Bane and Jaren Jackson and those guys he doesn't really give you much on defense he's the assistant been okay you know two three four per game probably closer to like two and a half on average but if you specifically need defensive stats I don't know if that's necessarily the play that too in Detroit yeah he's gonna give you the defensive stats you know the minutes might be a little bit up and down he's not really going to do a whole lot in terms of assists Pistons play tonight at Atlanta and they have a back-to-back against Memphis in Brooklyn Friday Saturday which is a pretty appealing schedule yeah you gotta like that yeah like that yeah I actually think that might be that might be the move and you know with Detroit again it's gonna be unpredictable you never know who's gonna be in or out but you know they already put out that you know Kate Cunningham might take a rest day tonight wouldn't be shocked if they did the same thing with Jalen Duren although you know he's been out there when healthy but yeah we're at the point in the year where we're telling you to go pick up Jim as he met you  Christian says good morning fellas good morning Christian thoughts on dropping Brandon Miller for PJ Washington I'm in the championship and I'm worried about Miller missing time or being shut down so both of these teams are on a four game week Charlotte has three remaining games they played Portland OR Lando OKC no back to backs this week so you know I don't know the Brandon Miller's been insulated thus far from any rest right like the only games he's missed or when he's been hurt he is questionable for tonight with an ankle sprain so keep an eye on that but in terms of just evaluating these guys straight up Washington has three games left at Lana Detroit or excuse me Atlanta Golden State in Houston are the three remaining opponents for Dallas Mavs still have plenty to play for right I think that's the the big difference here is that Dallas is sitting in the five but they're tied currently with the Pelicans who are in six they are only up one game on Sacramento and Phoenix so they need to keep winning to avoid falling into the plans Zone I think if you're worried about the security if you're if you have any concern about Brandon Miller missing time whether it's tonight or Beyond tonight I would just I would just go PJ Washington  yeah I just I'm not buying into PJ Washington's a fine option and we'll probably give you better we'll definitely give you better defensive stats if you're looking for that but I'm not really trying to move off of Brandon Miller and I think if they were going to shut him down they would have done it already what why why do it now  Kenny also notes that Wendell Carter Junior is on waivers but he said that feels like a trap coming off the back-to-back big games let's say you ah yeah I would tend to agree with that let me Let me refresh myself here with the schedule you know you would think that I have this stuff up oh yeah that's right it is a trap that's Memphis important people of course he's gonna have big games he's going up against valentina's tonight that's not gonna be easy and then yeah you Charlotte and Chicago  he could have a couple of he'll have a couple of nice games in the next four but probably not going to do much tonight and you're right I think you're a long you're thinking along the right path here in that it's probably a trap  all right let's talk a little bit about some surprises and disappointments from this season keep throwing questions to the chat guys if you're if your fantasy league is still going we're happy to give you any advice over the next 10 15 minutes here before we had out we talked a little bit about this on Monday you know guys who Alex and I talked about it more in a team context you know as far as which teams have been disappointing you know on our show on NBA Radio we hit the teams that are either going way over way under their win totals but I want to dig in on some individual players and we'll start with the disappointments and I do what you know injuries that happens so I'm not gonna say like obviously about massive disappointment but there's a reason for that you know Jaren Jackson to me is he has a really been injured but you know the grizzly season just fell apart in such a disastrous way that you couldn't really expect him to produce in the way that we expected but the guys who were top of mind for me McCall Bridges Laurie marketing Walker Kessler for sure Jordan Poole although he is the 70th ranked player in total value and a cat he hasn't been quite as badly and you barely missed any time so if you actually held on to Jordan Poole it hasn't been as bad as you might think  I think scoot Henderson has to be on that list as well and I know a lot of people and you know I was telling people just don't draft scoot because rookie guards aren't that good that's one of my few like Victory laps I could take this season but it's been worse it's been a lot worse I think that we expected especially that he's had important my take on School Henderson he should have stuck with the name Scooter do you remember when he was going by scooter like s c o o t a like no search like if go read about him find an article from like 2021 he was he was scooter that's what he was listed at as two four seven as a recruit and now we scoot do you think of it do you think that would help this field goal percentage I think it would help to feel what percentage I think it would have cut down on the turnovers  yeah I got a good a good up close and personal view of scoot Henderson the other day at the Kia Center for magic Blazers and he is a roller coaster ride of a basketball player super exciting to watch flies up and down the court looks like you got shot out of a cannon that guy cannot shoot and he is the only one on the team that has not figured that out  DeAndre ayton at one point passed him the basketball and I swear looked at him and just shook his head before he before scoot even jacked up and Ill advised wide open three that clanked off the backboard and he just knew like I have to pass this because you're open and this isn't going to go well I think he's an exciting player but he's got a figure out what his range is because he is blissfully unaware of that right now he's definitely on the list and unlike you  I bought in before the season I thought we were gonna get like a mini Russell Westbrook and well we gotta did  they got like Dollar Store Brooke this is what I got yeah we got Lakers Westbrook  exactly so I think you nailed a few you nailed a lot of the right names there I think Jaron Jackson Jr is an interesting one because I can't tell if it's on him or not he has not had a good season right but the Memphis Grizzlies haven't been anything close to what they were supposed to be because of the injuries that they've dealt with so is it circumstantial or is he tailing off as a player that's gonna be one of those interesting things to to think about where do you fall on that thought I think it's circumstantial um you know I I overpaid for them in an important auction league so I feel like I'm a little jaded on Triple J and the way I constructed my team in that League was all right I'm gonna dominate blocks like I got gobert for what I thought was a really good price and ended up being a great price because he stayed healthy and he's played pretty well this season but the way I built my team was like all right I'm getting I'm penciling in like at least two and a half blocks per game out of Jaron Jackson and that to me is what what stands out is like his scoring is up like 4 points per game the field goal percentage isn't as bad as you'd think like he was a 51% shooter last year that's not really who he spent you know throughout his career he actually doesn't shoot a great percentage for a big man 44% to me is fine like the free throw percentage is up compared to last season the free-throw rate is way up it steals production is up his assists are up the rebounds are about what you'd expect but the the lack of shot blocking to me is that's the the singular big disappointment which Aaron Jackson because you thought you'd be getting you know some of those like five six block games every now and then and you know Morant Bain smart all those guys missing time just kind of washed out the season I think I think Steven Adams being out of the lineup is huge specifically for Jerry Jackson because you watched these games and like Jared Jackson's not operating the way that he was last year when Stephen Adams was healthy for most of the year right like they he can't really play his like shot blocking specialist role with the way that this roster ended up shaking out  you would think that he would have just gone into swap mode but yeah he just finds himself out of position I don't think he looks right but I'm willing to kind of just let the season be a complete wash and and see if they're able to bounce back and get back to what they were this is a team that we thought was going to be able to take over the Western Conference for a couple of years and or at least be one of those perennial contenders are they able to bounce back to that when they get there a lot of guys or is that time passed you know so most likely they'll be fine but won't know it until we see it I would say I would throw another name out there what about Trey young Trey young is a guy that would drafted in that top 15 range and if we were if we were redrafting with what we know now I don't think he's still goes I don't think he's still goes that high  right so it's bad luck I mean he was he was the 11th ranked fantasy player per game and still is this season so I actually think he's returned value and he was fantastic right I mean he was leading the league in assist you that almost 11 per game giving me one and a half steals 26 points over three threes per game I actually disagree I think before the injury he was he was living up to the height he was somebody that I would have preferred to take over Jerry Jackson you know it's like if you're picking 11th or 12th there's you know early in the second round I think I think he makes a lot of sense like I actually think fantasy it's been a weird disappointing year for Atlanta as a team but Trey young the fantasy player I think before the injury was was right where you'd expect and maybe even a little above that  yeah I guess I'm a little bit Jaded by what their season has become but yeah it's numbers wise when he was out on the court just not a you know he's he's dealt with his injuries in the past but it feels like it's really starting to pile up you can point the way of another Trailblazer and that's an easy thing to do DeAndre eight and I have my list yeah yeah they're really I mean really because for any Simons is somebody that people invested in I was high on shade on Sharp coming into the season none of these there wasn't really anybody Malcolm Brogden returns some value for a minute but you know and then you end up getting like the the waiver wire guys how many different questions have we've gotten about do operations you know but in terms of guys yeah that you that you spent Delano banned by the way that guy can play I like him he's got to get yeah I think he's gonna I think he's gonna be on the Blazers for years to come  he is a quintessential Blazer I feel like he's a fan favorite type of guy right yeah bounced around a little bit but I do feel like he has found a home there a couple of guards that I'll throw out there what Darius Garland I know he's had injuries as he's been the case the last few years but I mean it's like he was being drafted inside the top 40 often inside the top 40 or 50 and even when he's been out there he's been like the 70 to 70 best player per game like that's been really disappointing I do think there's a very good chance to Donovan Mitchell is somewhere else next season so I got Mitchell I would add Donovan Mitchell to the list he is on a per game base it's not as disappointing as Darius Garland but his availability has been spotty at best and this is a slightly down here from what he's done the last couple I have per game wise he's number seven player in a cat so like he's like Trey young to be where it's like yeah he's played 51 games that's super disappointing but what he's been out there he's been a machine so it depends how much you you factor injuries into the equation when you're talking about a true disappointment what about Steph Curry  little disappointing you know guy was still going and round one and in most drafts he ranks about 25 right now on the year in per game value still giving you a advantage in threes and category League that's the big thing right you're getting almost five threes a game about a curry still getting 26 points but the assisted down he's not really giving me anything in terms of steals field goal percentage under 45% you know still a lot to like we're poking holes in an elite player here but I wouldn't say it's been a slam dunk gear here for Seth not his best I think it's sort of opposite from what we've talked about with Trey young and Donovan Mitchell and I'm docking these guys for not being available Steph Curry has been available just so you're getting a slightly lesser version of what Steph has been over the course of his career but you're getting him  you get to keep him in your lineup and to me you know ability availability is one of the best abilities and so I'm not overly disappointed I think at this point in his career you gotta expect a little bit of a drop off if you draft him 36 years old I mean this trees don't grow to the sky I will say overall General Health of injury Pro and Veterans has been one of my positive surprises this season big time I was off I was off LeBron I was off Kauai I was off Kevin Durant you know I think even like Chet homegrown and Victor webmin Yamaha there are major questions about how many games those guys would play you know Chet you forget obviously is not a true rookie missed his entire rookie year with a serious foot injury he's been extremely healthy I think he's only missed like one or two games women yamas barely missed time you know you can throw Paul George into that equation Anthony Davis obviously has missed like four games all year so we've had players like Trey young like Donovan Mitchell like lamelo ball who sunk your season but the guys that we thought would play like 55 games for the most part of not  and and that's why I'm curious where the conversation went between you and Alex and in regards to the team side of things because because we've seen a lot of those key veterans stay healthy this year we haven't really had massive disappointments I think outside of the Memphis Grizzlies an obvious one that their season hasn't looked anything like what we thought but outside of that who's really that disappointing and I think a large part of their being not that many disappointments in the NBA the teams that are bad are the teams that we largely expected to be bad and that's because the best players in the league of stay healthy this season yeah you're correct about that I think you know Memphis is the obvious one and I wouldn't even call it disappointment it is just horrific injury luck I mean that's about as bad as we've seen in recent memory I think you know some people would say the Lakers but I mean they're all like a 47 win Pace right I mean they're they're basically going they're probably gonna fall short of hitting their windshield which was 47 and a half but they're 10 games above 500 and I think the fact that they've stayed healthy and they're not going to hit that wind total you would say yeah maybe that's a disappointment you know there's many games as they've gotten out of LeBron and AD but most of the teams ahead of them all so stay healthy right I mean I think that I say it all the time there's so much depth and so much Elite and the NBA and it's like it's hard to look at the Lakers and and say yeah man they should be up in second place right now there's so much better than Minnesota or OKC or the Clippers or the baths like those teams all that funny Veil and in their own right I think Golden State that was one team we both agreed on you know they have 41 wins it's been disappointing Milwaukee feels like you're sweating hairs you know for a team that's sitting in second in the east  it's been disappointing man they're gonna fall way short of their win total um you know I think I think the the really bad teams have been worse than we expected like all of Charlotte Washington Detroit Portland San Antonio all those teams are going to go way under their projected win total Charlotte was 31 and a half 31 and a half and I don't think they hit that with lamelo it's a big obviously not having a huge you want to talk about a guy we don't know if he's a winning player I think lamelo's on that list so yeah I'm talking about that numbers left and right yeah the bad teams being disasters as a supposed to just being bad teams that that to be has been one of the disappointments and part of the reason though if you want to let them off the hook a little bit is that the good teams have been as good as we expected them to be to the point where the Golden State Warriors are setting in 10th and the Western Conference and you can't confidently tell me they're not gonna make a Deep Run in the playoffs we just don't know they've been disappointing as far as the overall record but you still enter the postseason going yeah they can make a run so you were saying that about the team that's the last spot in the Western Conference so if everybody's staying healthy and the teams that we expected to be decent the teams we expected to take a step forward you know like the magic we expected the magic to be better there are a couple of wins better than even the most optimistic person would have thought but still pretty much in line with what people thought and so that's going to keep everybody else down a little bit but this is part of the reason why I'm not Victor one but niyama it as great as he has been the Spurs are worse that we thought they would be which means that is part of his year One resume  all right man I know you can't do it yeah I know yeah no you're cutting me off you're cutting me off because  I got I got to go eat I gotta get ready to talk to find digs on the radio I'm depressed about what this means for the Jags and for the AFC
