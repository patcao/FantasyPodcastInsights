hey everybody I'm Steve Alexander Dr a welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog fantasy and FanDuel  it's Tuesday January 23rd I'm doc he's Roth  we're gonna have a lot of news cover there's a late breaking trade that just happened you may have heard something about Joe L&B  let's do it  Rafael what's up man welcome back to the to the attic it's been a while yeah it has um thank you for having me you know  looking forward to it you know it's been a while since we spoke and so we got a lot talk about apparently so I guess so I doubt we get to everything that's on the the agenda for today but for those you don't know and I worked together for years and NBC Sports he still there doing his thing you follow him on Twitter I think he's at Rafael J yes yeah man I I miss you and miss your lawn crew on Friday afternoons  yeah yeah wait we're gonna deal with them anymore unfortunately so yeah all right well let's get to it Ralph I awoke from a slumber a little while ago and saw a trade alert on my phone  the Miami Heat have acquired Terry Rozier from the Hornets  for Kyle Lowry my favorite player and a 2027 first round pick and then I saw an update from loads that Charlotte is not done yet they're going to just try to compile as many future assets as they can for the trade deadline  yeah so I think from Charlotte's point of view it's all about the draft assets they're not going anywhere anytime soon I think it would help whether we're talking like the bill to their franchise or even fantasy basketball if there's some clarity on Mark Williams he's been out for Lord knows how long with the back injury don't really know how long he's going to be out for and giving how well he was playing before the injury he looks like a key cog in their rebuild so you kind of want to know what what you're dealing with their I think at this point  I think lamelo ball and Brandon Miller probably the two locks for that they're rebuild right now but  that Williams question kind of lingers I think Rozier obviously we can talk about him a bit more in depth I think that's a big move for Miami is they weren't getting much from out of Kyle Lowry he'll help with this spacing he's in the midst of a career in terms of points per game so I'm looking forward to see how that fits because they clearly needed to make an upgraded to point guard position and I think they've done it  you think you think Terry Rosie's numbers take a hit  um  maybe a little bit you know he's averaging little over 23 points per game you know you might take a slight hit there and maybe the assists as well so 6.6 per game just because you have other Playmakers there but I think he'll be able to make up for another area like the caching shooting numbers weren't good and Charlotte I think they'll be better playing with Jimmy and Bam and Tyler Hero on Miami so  let's take a slight hit but I don't think it's going to be anything for Fantasy managers to be too concerned about oh yeah I kind of agree I think it'll take  a slight hit but not enough that that fantasy managers can Panic are really do anything about it it's not like you're gonna  run out and try to trade carry rows here right now probably but um yeah it'll be interesting I think it makes the heat a better team I mean heater already really good it  you know they weren't getting a lot from 30 8 year old Kyle Lowry or however old he is  um he's here 36 of 38 he's old so having Roger in there really make some a better basketball team which I think is the key there maybe this hurts Tyler hero just a little bit  I don't know yeah  I don't think there's  been a lot worse for forever and all I think Roger comes out of it okay I think everybody on the heat comes out of it okay gives him another body to play with when Jimmy Butler takes two days off every week so that'll help to  all right all right moving on the last night did you get to watch Joe L&B play basketball last night yes yes I did watch the whole thing do you know who was calling that game of sparrow ditas 3D was on the sidelines who was the guy who was the color guy that kept saying cooking he cooks I was watching the Sixers feed so I don't know I know as an NBA TV Game as well so I don't know who's calling for them yeah somehow I ended up on the NBA TV feed and the dude kept saying I'll give you ready and he's gonna start cooking and he some form of the word cook like 15 to 20 times while we were watching my wife finally goes who is that why is he talking about cooking so much MB finished with 70 points 18 rebounds  and that 41 in there all right  18 rebounds five assists a steal a block  at 20 251 shots 21 to 21 21 of 23 free throws scored more points than anybody ever has in a Sixers uniform passing Wilt Chamberlain the only other guy that ever had a 7015 game that I know of is Michael Jordan so and being was just abusing women Yama using the entire Spurs team like every shot he took was from the free throw line yeah it's not that little pop that little range pop and  it was just it was money it was butter yeah  yeah it was it was pretty ridiculous she had a feeling he was in for a big night when they asked right Popovich before the game what is defense are strategy was and he really didn't have an answer so you want me to sit up here and light it they didn't have an answer she noted that 15 footer was was money all night  no the first ever 1778 and 51 and NBA history  it's it was absurd what he did and it's Victor Wimbledon had a good night too I think he scored what like 33 or something like that he played well it just said  guarding Joel embiid is above his pay grade right now and there's no one in a leak and really stopped him so  yeah it was just funny to see some Sixers players getting booed for taking open shots during the fourth quarter when Joe hadn't reached 70 but I'm sure they'll clean that up well my son was sitting there he wanted he wanted to see 81 what are you doing like tired I think it was in a can you know a house took one how far on airbag so mad soaring got mad everybody's yelling at the TV like oh you know seemed like they took forever to get him back in the game but other thoughts on NBA  the January that he's having right now is just stupid 40.3 Points 11 rebounds five point four assists  one point one steals one point six blocks  shooting 54 401 and 87  the 87 from the line is huge because he's going to line you know 20 to 25 times every night people are like it's not fairy shouldn't be shooting that many times but Jana tooth only makes half of them though so that's different Sixers six and one during the show I mean is this the greatest month in the history of fantasy Hoops we've ever seen a player have it's up there for sure and it's funny that he was really good in December too but I think a lot of those games are against like the Pistons and wizards so it's kind of like okay maybe if the schedules strengthens up a bit you know the numbers may go down he's just kept on rolling I think the only thing that would probably stop him from another MVP is the games limit I don't know if he's gonna be able to play 65 games if he does  he'd be hard pressed to find a better MVP can it because that team's been improved as well so you get the team success to individual success  it's all there just a question of whether or not he hits 65 games  yeah um another thought that ran through my head is I was watching that game is what is pop doing and and that runs through my head every single time I walked the Spurs play basketball this year like is he taking is he trying does he care was just five year 80 million dollar contract extension of money grab like like what what are what is pop doing  I think he's coaching I think it's more of like an evaluation type deal like he's definitely holding guys accountable you see a couple guys get cussed out throughout the course of the game last night for Mr Simon so what have you so I don't think it's a matter of you know kind of mailing it in or just taking it payday it's just a completely different situation than he's had in Seasons past I think the one my biggest critique would be having trade Jones or coming off the bench for as long as he did he's clearly the best playmaker on that roster  and when you're trying to cultivate a town like women Yamaha I think you want to make things easy for him as possible with regard to how he gets the ball and where he gets it and that wasn't happening early in the season so I think if you're going to be critical of Pop of anything for anything it would be that I trade Jones getting hurt late in that game last night is a concern Jeremy sohan's played better basketball but I don't see him as like a primary playmaker in any way you know shape or form so I think pops fine you know it's a young group he's doing more coaching than he has you know in most of his prior Seasons but yeah I don't think he's mad at it at all um speaking to Trey Jones he went down with the right for with a foot injury didn't look good the way he was rolling around on the ground and hobbled off  so hand has been the point guard for that team for about half the season he had 14.6 boards for assists a block and three triples um they could throw Blake Wesley out there and start if so if Trey Jones is going to miss time what are you what are you doing if you had a move to make right now as far as picking up a Spurs point guard  um that's probably  take a roll of dice on so had you in hopes that he is like a supplementary playmaker and not the primary guy because like I said another I don't think that's in his makeup right now  I'm not touching Blake Wesley or Malachi Branham I think those are both like wait and see type guys see if they do over the course so like five games you certainly afford to do that because unless you're playing like a 30 Team league I don't see the point in adding either those guys right now  yeah I'm not messing with Wesley I would pick so hand up as insurance right now if you've got Trey Jones I've got him a couple teams and and Trey was playing better too like he's playing pretty good lately so that's kind of I was kind of sad to see him go down I hopefully he's not  too hurt  what what do we do about keldon Johnson man he got moved to the bench for 12 last night 8 points two boards I mean is this rock bottom or or is it going to continue to be kind of shaky from Kelvin  I'm not reading too much in the last night just because he missed a lot of time with a chin last race so I think that kind of skewed his numbers and that regard only played 21 minutes he's gonna he's gonna approach 30 minutes per night when healthy  it's not a great situation with him coming off the bench  but I think it's kind of it doesn't really strike me as being too different than what he was the starter you know he is barely like a one one twenty-five 150 players are starter he's just outside of that range right now  you know I don't really nothing nothing much really changes for me with regard to Calvin Johnson be honest with you okay yeah I mean I I wish she was starting  he has been  trending down I would say but I mean I don't know that there's a lot of any of us can do about it my last first question I need you to look into your crystal ball rough is is Victor women Yama gonna play in a back-to-back on Friday and Saturday against Portland Minnesota be the first time he'd done it since Christmas right before Christmas and also pops said that he's gonna you know that the back-to-back band on wimby was going to end very soon do you think that's true and you think you might play him back to back this week  I think it's true I just don't know if it'll happen this week  Portland you got I don't know it's too completely different matchups like Portland their Center position they've got DeAndre but  I don't know it's  it doesn't hold a candle to Rudy gobert and Karl Anthony towns so I think if they're going to try to steal one more rest day it might be that Portland game just kind of getting geared up for for Minnesota okay uh Ralph Underdog

creeping up  production was creeping up he's mostly just a points 3's and rebounds guy right now anyway but back to Earth on Monday night with 0 points  five rebounds in 19 minutes and then there's Alec Burks who I picked out of the Pistons play four times this week about Burks might have a good game or two out of four still got time for that to happen last night was not one of those though he hit three of 12 shots all three of them or three pointers he had 9.2 boards three assists  Sasser got hot  hit 1997 scored 23  Sasser could be a silly season here in my opinion what are your what are your thoughts on some of these Pistons guys that are just super hard to predict  a certain is a firm hold for me I haven't rostered in a couple weeks he's averaging 0.8 steals 0.9 blocks per game on the season he's another guy that I think is gonna kick up the production later in the season I think after the trade deadline I don't know if Alec Burks is going to be there after that point  he didn't play well on Monday but he has been on fire recently I think it's kind of  gotten him on the radar more contending teams that maybe look at the upgrade their bench before the trade deadline so Thompson's a hole for me Sasso I have him on a few watch lists I think that's what I would do right now as well as he played on Monday  the minutes haven't always been there even with killing and Hayes not really showing much maybe that changes pretty soon but yeah I think right now sass or someone just to keep an eye on and outside of times if you haven't rostered I would not drop it because I think he's gonna be someone who can blow up later this season with that defensive potential  I'm a big fan of outside Thompson I just wish the Pistons had like a stable rotation for him to kind of flourish him  it's interesting he's kind of a polarizing fantasy player because my guess last week Yuri  I was like are you holding upstairs and she's like I can't afford to I'm trying to win my league um they're not playing him enough minutes and the Pistons are have this weird win now mentality with a team that is not going to win now and they just keep playing the same guys over and over again and a lot of those guys are not kids it's like both Hand by Donovan and it's just been weird so you know a lot of people are like no you can't afford no hold on Sarah Thompson you're like  I'm absolutely holding on Thompson I kind of like after the trade deadline know maybe maybe the Pistons will finally throw in the towel on the season after the trade deadline and let all their concert play I will say he was playing well in the last three games that I was disclosed to jumping back in but now I'm kind of out again but then again he got picked up in that league so I don't I don't have access to them anyway over in Cleveland Sam Merrill  got hot hit 8 to 13 threes  26.3 rebounds and assistance of Steel  I was kind of shocked to find out that he's scored in double digits in four straight games now off  decent Morris decent assists hits a lot of Threes is he automatic pick up right now and why is he why is he coming on  I think so part of the reason Karis Levert's been out the last two games with a wrist injury so  is even more need for his perimeter shooting ability within that offense Cleveland's been rolling you know recently I think they won like eight in a row  they've got better shooting you know in terms of Maryland three-point shooting he's provided  I think he's someone that you have to pick up right now we'll see what happens once to get Darius Garland and Care silver back in a rotation but for now Meryl someone that I would definitely pick up if he's available I don't know when they're going to have  Charis vert back full time he just cares Levert plays about as often as Jimmy Butler knows he'll come in and have like two  great games score 30 and 1 and 22 and the other and then it'll take a game or two off and then it'll be back and then it'll disappear like he's really tough to get a to get a feel for I like Meryl I think he's a sneaky sneaky pickup right now that not a lot of people are talking about so um  over in Orlando Wendell Carter Junior has been starting  markelle fultz move back to the starting lineup and then disappeared one game later and get some rest let me see Jay is 17.7 boards and a steal over his last five or you are you all in on Linda card Junior right now  yeah it feels like he's gotten back to where he was before the injuries and turns of minutes and place in a rotation so yeah I'm in on window Carter Jr figuring out who's backing him up is in a bit tricky I think it's been more more recently go go kind of slipped out of the rotation out of playing well as a starter after playing well as a starter when was out but yeah I think Carter's pretty much the only one you can truly rely on the center position on Orlando right now  I agree with that and then our  how many point guards is too many point guards for the magic I mean it's it's kind of a mess the fultz and subs and  Cole Anthony are you messing with any of them  maybe sucks yeah sucks Anthony coming off the bench has been good but I think that's that's another team I'm watching it to trade deadline because they need perimeter shooting and as you mentioned they have a surplus of point guards and I'll say his name is come up in some trade rumors so maybe he's the one they try to move but that medical history that kind of wonder what type of value they would get in return for him I think if anything they're going to need to add a shooter a reliable shooter at the deadline and one of those guys maybe gone I don't really see them moving on from sucks or Anthony at this point  yeah I don't know what they're gonna do is they sort of have a log Jam  similar at point guard with the Pacers and Hawks have at forward like Something's Gotta Give on those teams they need to move some pieces around to clear up clip space for the the Ballers to ball the Memphis Grizzlies rather are very interesting right now  my man Vince Williams Junior had 18 and 10 last night Santi aldama has been starting at 10 points four boards for assists steel Luke Kennard  19 points 7 boards five triples  Xavier Tillman who a lot of people were picking up instead of all dhamma  total dud David Riley had 9.8 boards GG Jackson  went on that two game Tear and now is been down for three three straight grain games he did have  21 minutes 7 points 5 boards  still on the Block and three  and then Jacob Gilyard only getting 13 minutes is Ludacris to me I think they should be playing him who really guys you like in Memphis and out of that out of that crew  Canard and Vince for sure can I get five three pointers last night it's kind of a defective playmaker for them right now giving all the injuries they have you know at the point guard position so those two for sure I think the thing with Tillman he's been dealing with lingering knee issues so he got off to a good run when he was in the starting lineup then he had the missed a couple games so I think that's why it's been so difficult to rely on him and fantasy just because when he gets rolling Neeson this creeps up and he has to sit out a couple so that kind of probably boosts out demo a little bit here  John Contra blocked five shots apparently last night I don't  that's not really reliable production from him you know Kudos from forget it done but that's not something you're not gonna expect like  five Total Defense or contribution from him you know on a nightly basis much less five blocks shots so for me it's Kenard and Vince Williams right now in terms of you know must haves on that roster and I think comcar and I'm sorry I missed those five blocks  conquer is playing in front of Gigi and you know a lot of people are not happy about that where are you with Gigi did you get excited after this first two games and pick him up or were like and this seems like a flash on the bay and he's gonna be back Julie you not you not take that bait I didn't yes he's largely just a score at this point you know it doesn't  he got hot you know he went in the feels like leather mode in the shots just happened to go in so I think that was why I was hesitant on him I think he's someone that after the trade deadline it's another player you may want to look more into in terms of fantasy ads but right now  not really dealing with them  moving on to the Hornets PJ Washington 57 shots two triples  12.7 boards three assists stealing block know Mark Williams know Nick Richards so I loaded up pjw on my FanDuel team yesterday I faced a guy that played Joe Ellen bead and I lost father like seven points so didn't work out but it was not a bad call and think  is PJ Washington and automatic pickup right now  thank you have to be is what are your other options there you know with Richards out with Williams we don't know when he'll be back you're not going to add Nathan Mentor JT Thor you know that would be the ultimate scraping the bottom of the barrel type situation so yeah it's PJ Washington or you just look at another team for Big Man help  Brandon Miller hit 11 of 13 shots  27.3 boards to assist one steel three triples  last three games he scored 27 23 and 24  um and in the words of my son last night is Brandon Miller good  yeah he's yeah he's definitely good I think that Rochelle tray is gonna boost him even more  one last person to take away scoring opportunities from him  and Brandon Mueller is going to be someone that his fancy stocks going to be you know through the roof for in these upcoming games here I think  Beyond him maybe you look at like a Nick Smith Jr for later in the season but right now it's pretty much all Brandon Miller in terms of you know fancy prospects and Charlotte  yeah I like that take rough like Target him and trades right now like go get Brandon Miller because somebody's gonna have to score in Charlotte and it ain't gonna be Kyle Lowry tackle millions in prizes all playoffs long in FanDuel fantasy contest if you're new to Fantasy there's no better time to get in on the action because right

playing any FanDuel  I'm absolutely terrible at Daily fantasy so try to keep a little money in my pocket I got you me and my boys play like a there's four or five of us we play every day two bucks and then we do five dollars on Fridays I thought I had last night  I thought I had last night man I had pjw had some some Luca going I had some  some big numbers Highland up the MB going for a 107 or whatever it was FanDuel points she's kind of kind of ruined my dreams thanks to my buddy Keelan Coach Kayla Mark Minnesota Timberwolves why didn't we get to this Center well I don't think it was near the same level as what we saw from embiid Karl Anthony towns hit 21 of 35 shots yesterday 10 three-pointers  10 to 14 free trials he had 62 points 8 boards to assist  now it looked like cat had a chance to go for 70 also and he just had a fourth quarter meltdown did you watch that game yeah he just kept forcing it trying to drive but wasn't getting foul calls wasn't getting anything really working and they just kind of fizzled out lost the lead and and then lost the game pre disappointing turn of events for the wolves  yeah Chris Finch absolutely lit into his team in the postgame press conference  no Mike Conley out there you know hamstring issue  they didn't look very good I know cat head 44 in the first half but it felt like  some of the guys were fully engaged I thought Nikita Alexander Walker at a good game feeling in for Conley so if you streamed him he got some decent value there with the 18 points but Anthony Edwards things three of 11 from the field had a level in the assist but maybe he was a little bit too deferential to towns offensively maybe that has something to do with it but I think if anything they may have underestimated Charlotte team is 10 and 31 on a season  they've had that knack for kind of taking teams lightly you know at times I know their record doesn't exactly show it but they've struggled with some teams that did you probably blow off the floor this season so  Town's got the 62 like you mentioned tailed off late  I don't know I think once commonly gets back out there to be a bit more focused in terms of what they're supposed to do out there  hey Connie was just resting ant Edwards look terrible um Conley actually look good he had that that cool vest on the week the wovens best and the crazy pants and props to Mike Conley man I kind of thought he was done but he's he he's driving that train and they're still the best team in the west right now and  apparently  aunt and the rest of those guys can't play with him because Aunt was terrible three of 11 like you said 9 points  11 assists I love Anthony Edwards he's having a great season I had they need they need Connie out there to study study that ship and keep control of what is going on it'll be I can't wait to see what happens in the west as far as where the Wolves finish and how they do in the playoffs it should be pretty fun for the Dallas Mavericks we got the return of Luke 33 points season High 18 boards 13 assists  two steals  Rob my big question on Lucas he is he gonna play on Friday against the Hawks  and he's gonna play on Saturday against the Kings because I am going to that Hawks game with a sword and I are in we're going to see Luca we don't want to know the situation where we get there and he's not playing  I need your help  I think he'll play  not like I have any like inside information or anything but I just think he'll play  I don't know they got Phoenix on Wednesday so maybe that's kind of something that may be a factor depending on whether or not he gets out that one healthy but true I think it'll be out there  yeah he gets on a Wednesday healthy I think he'll be playing against the Hawks his only visit here this year people want to see him Tim Farley Jr kind of ball on having a good season Kyrie Irving when he had what you know he was out with that injury for a while but he's playing really well the Mavericks are better than I thought they were going to be um are you surprised by the season Tim hardaway's happened  really you know I think the role whether he the few times he's been able to start or primarily coming off the bench he's able to just come in as a shooter you know and I think that's his comfort zone he shot the ball well he didn't have like I know usually he'll have like a slow start to the season that didn't happen this time around so I think that was encouraging for for the Mavericks and fancy managers  I'm all in on Tim Hardaway Jr I think he'll be fine the rest of the way too  I think so too he's been better than guys like Brad Beal and some other players so  good job to me Hardaway we got good Kobe white last night 26 points 10 boards nine assists two steals for triples  10 of 14 shooting  when good Kobe white is good my my Thirty Thirty deep team is really really good rock and I are playing each other this week and 30 and  man if if I get good Kobe white combined with Victor women Yama four games then then I'm tough to beat but Victor  Victor's missed six games a lot of those were three and two game weeks so had a lot of rough luck with wimpy so far in that league but  I love my team I've got guys the play a lot avoided injuries I just can't get over the over the hump but Kobe white was great last night what I wanted to talk about is Alex Caruso a 15 points four boards three assists three blocks five triples and I owe to Sumo 611 shooting 13 points two steals a block both of those guys have been really good for like the last five games  have you picked either of them up and do you want to pick either of them up  I'd say Caruso if anything because he's starting to see me I think he had a good night again in Phoenix but I think his potential is kind of depending on who's out like Patrick Williams being available I thought kind of satin 2 is value a little bit but they both had decent nights on on Monday so  I'm more of a crucial guy just because he started in  I prefer I prefer him personally  you know in January I think um yeah for the month of January Crusoe is averaging 1.8 Steals and 1.3 blocks  that's no joke right there like I I think Chris is the pickup too I think you look at the numbers over his last five he's a fine pickup also both of them are gonna play because know those Zach Lavine yeah I like Caruso a little more than the Sumo for the sons  well I just gave it away but did you know Grayson Allen is the only guy in the league shooting 50  is it 50 40 and 90 or 50 50 and 90 I think he was at 50/50 and 90 now he's down to 5149 and 90 but and what a season Grayson Allen is having it  yeah  49.1 from 3 so yeah he's pretty much a 50/50 90 guy he's been an excellent pickup for them I think this is kind of what they envisioned maybe not to this level but he was a valuable pick up in that trade net three team trade they got involved in with Portland in Milwaukee so  he's pretty much a must roster guy at this stage which is something that not too many of us envisioned before the season started so kudos to Grace now  yeah make sure he's not floating around on your wayward he should be rostered everywhere at this point he's been hot the Suns won six straight  seven and three over the last 10 that quietly creeping up in the west they're not to fifth place who do you have coming out of the West off the teams in order right now or the Wolves Thunder Nuggets Clippers Sons Pelicans Kings Mavericks Lakers I still like Denver I think they have the best starting five in the west you know the bench is a concern but I believe they'll be able to get things in order between now and playoff time  as much as I don't want to fully believe in the Clippers I think it may be different this time around it looks like all the pieces fit together the key for them is going to be getting a Visa zubats back healthy and getting him a good stretch of games for the postseason but  I think the nuggets and Clippers end up playing in the Western Conference Finals that's pretty much how I see it  Minnesota Oklahoma City I can see them going and runs as well but I like I like Denver to come out of the West again  I'm going with the Thunder winning the West  I think the suns are becoming scary just like the Clippers are scary the Clippers the Clippers look real to me  you know ever since he got over that initial blimp with James Harden and they just nobody wants the Clippers I think you as long as Brad Beal can stay healthy nobody wants son's so it's gonna be interesting to see what's happening there do you have coming out of the East after that Philadelphia run I'm still got Boston yeah I still like Boston I think if anything Philadelphia Maybe  in that truly in that mix I think that's what we all expecting in terms of that top three Boston Milwaukee and Philly  Milwaukee's defense is a serious concern but Philadelphia I think  if they can stay healthy they may need one more like bench piece but in terms of those starters especially in bed and Maxi if they can stay healthy  they look as good as they have during MBS running in Philadelphia they need anything Mountain back yeah that'll help too I mean that would solve a lot of problems right now it's embed its Maxie it's Tobias Harris and then it's  just a mishmash of stuff um speaking of Boston is Derek White's kind of been in a funk lately he hadn't been playing very good just who we got for the rest of the season I know Jalen and and Jason both scored in the 30s last night at White's been kind of kind of funky lately is he is he good is he gonna bounce back or is this what we got  I think about bounce back um he had the sprained ankle is Adam for a game I think he'll be fine it depends on what you expecting of them like if you're expecting top 50 value you may be a bit concerned I was expecting more like top 75 so after they added Drew holiday so I think it'll be fine person  all right let's talk about Sacramento Kings Harrison Barnes last night out of nowhere  and I mean nowhere 32 points  four Boards of Steel four triples of course he did it against the Atlanta Hawks because they that's what they do he had scored a total of 10 points as previous two games  are you gonna put him on a watch list and keep an eye on him where is this straight up fluke  I'd watch list them at best I actually have him roster North 30 people so  did you have going last night yes I did yeah I think they're playing four games this week so he's actually playing three games but it worked out well for me but yeah I think if you're in a standard League I would say watch Liston because I don't believe he's obviously not going to put up 30 points on a nightly basis you know bonus had a quiet night offensively against the Hawks so that's not going to happen very often you're kind of hoping that Barnes and kind of settle in that 15 you know to 17 point range with good rebounding numbers but I don't even know if he's going to give you that so yeah I think he's a watch list guy right now  so Ralph your 30 deep team is Ty Halliburton Devon vessel Josh Hart Darius got Jeremy Grant sorry I'm sorry Harrison Barnes Clint capela and do a brief  for 30 team  draft that is pretty amazing that is yeah that is very good why is it say that my battery is getting ready to run out okay so that's pretty strong that I'm going up against my team is dear and Foxy white Payton Pritchard Austin Reeves Derek Jones Junior  ham Tomas  victoriana and Zach Collins also a pretty formidable Squad we got a 6-3 lead after last night but that's gonna change tonight you've got more guys going but this should be a battle man and 32 is really fun when your team is good and healthy it's not fun when you're number one pick goes down and your team stinks so you got lucky that Halliburton was only out a couple of weeks and not a couple months that's good that's good for you it did do get lucky there um some good luck with that this week Marvin Bagley  he was all the rage from a minute in Washington when Daniel Gafford was that was a concussion Gafford is back are you still holding Bagley or you picking him up or you dumping him where you go back  I'm holding it you look at their Center rotation where else are they going to turn you know so I think he's gonna get a good 20 25 minutes for game and depending on what happens with gaffer throughout the course of a matchup you know foul trouble injuring of the light so yeah bagley's a hole for me if he had he picked him up  you just never know and he's obviously gonna play Rotation minutes there too  yeah I got him in a Yahoo my other Yahoo league and  I'm just gonna hang on him because I don't know I don't think there's anybody better on the waiver wire for me to go get right now  he's not gonna be a superstar we've got it around but he's gonna be he's gonna put up serviceable numbers and be worth hanging on to you so totally with you on that I'm hanging on to Marvin Bagley is Cam Whitmore of Houston the Houston Rockets guy we need to be keeping a close eye on right now  I would say so um yeah he didn't play well in that spot started over the weekend against the Celtics but  he's been on a decent run a double-digit scoring efforts before then and the tari Easton situation in terms of his leg injury that's a little bit concerning whitmore's minutes to pick up with Easton out and I think Houston's one of those teams is probably going to Trend downward within the west of some of those you know  more experienced teams kind of kick hit their stride you know down the streets and season here so I think what more someone to definitely continue to keep an eye on  have you give an up on Tori Eason yet  not yet if you can stash him in an eel plus font I would consider doing that but if you don't have the room to do it I can understand dropping him I just haven't given up on him because of the rebounding and a defensive potential when he's on the floor  yeah I I gave up my I didn't have room to hold him anymore he hadn't let him go but I love to eat and man he's been hurt all year and it's just it's stunning look good to me Ralph LeBron James is out tonight with an ankle injury  are you messing with taurine Prince a really hot tomorrow or chair advanto or  do you just sit back and watch the Anthony Davis D'Angelo Russell's show like what's gonna happen  any kind of depends on what you may need you know for your team in that matchup if you're in a category League like if you need three pointers maybe you lean towards Tori and Prince I'd expect him to be back in the starting lineup  and then LeBron's absence that probably keeps really hot Premiere in the starting lineup for another game  I don't know I  it's gonna be a heavy dose of AD and D'Angelo Russell Russell's been on fire recently so you know but  yeah I think if anything you may look at those other options as potential like matchup place like what do I need within my roster within a within this week before deciding on which one to pick up  okay let's answer a couple of questions from the viewers will go for about five minutes here and then shut it down a default is here every week says it stinks that  thigh Halliburton is going to miss at least three games because they brought him back too soon just to play with Pascal  I missed that if that's the case is how he ruled out  for three years he's gonna miss his third  I'm not sure I didn't see that either so well he missed one right yeah yeah he missed one the other day maybe that dropped yep there it is  at least three games so yeah that's damn that is great here 30 yeah that's  great way to finish off the morning but um yeah that's tough I think now you got TJ McConnell back on the radar  yeah he's the better pick up and Andrew hard when we talk about streaming options in Indiana but  if you can't get McConnell maybe roll the dice on  on them hard and a deeply but yeah  yeah I'm a TJ McConnell guy to um sorry to break the news to you that way I paid I paid to send that in so I can shock you right after I gave your fantasy team all that hype all that love now I'm just marveling says I was offered deer and fox for Don and Mitchell take it or pass I'll tell you what I've as a deer in Fox guy and 30 deep  his free throw shooting is just awful and his field goal percentage isn't that great at times either like last night was not good I'm like what are you doing dear and like just make free throws bro  yeah I'm passing in that Mitchell's been rolling recently  they appearance had him as the point guard you know with no Darius Garland I think that's been huge for him in terms of being able to make play even more plays than usual with the basketball in his hands so yeah there's no way I trade Donovan Mitchell for deer and Fox right now  Brian be giving us some love the boys are back recent pickup a Brandon Miller looking good so far yeah we talked about that oh there's nothing left to say like congrats he should be good to go Guilford Wong wants to know thoughts on Jordan Hawkins I know Camlin and I talked about him a lot last week came up was all in on Jordan Hawkins he said he is inside that he was gonna get on this plane time  he's been okay they need a shooting you know that's a starting lineup that really doesn't offer too much so Trey Murphy Jordan Hawkins those are guys that definitely see figured bit more prominently in the rotation as a season continues to wear on and obviously that wild card that is designed Williamson's health  you know that's something always taking a consideration too so yeah I like that Jordan Hawking's call  Zach says triple Jerry Jackson junior Devin Booker  for Donovan Mitchell and Pascal siakam  it's a good one to go out on this gonna make my head which I did this do you like I think for me it's pretty easy I think I like the Mitchell see I come inside just because I I don't know that JJ's Gonna Keep playing for Memphis this forum of the Memphis Grizzlies yeah right too much longer yeah that's my concern too like the other three guys in this scenario all have something to play for you know throughout the remainder of the Season like  I don't know Memphis doesn't really strike me as a franchise that would like blatantly shut guys down but doesn't it probably wouldn't take too much to figure out an injury to and I need to get that cleaned up or take a couple weeks off you know between now and the end of the season so yeah I think I would lean Mitchell in siakam and that scenario what happens without Halliburton for Seattle Christmas something to keep an eye on in the short term but I think long-term I would go Mitchell in Seattle well now we need to hope that tie however and misses three games and he's good to go like that that's where we're at because if you missed more games who's Awards  he's words are in Jeopardy me that's 65 game threshold and then you know the whole reason Pascal siakam is there for the Pacers trying to win now yeah and they need help and run the show to do that so they get they're gonna be super careful with the probably coming back this time last question um Jerry Lynn  man a bio or Scotty Barnes straight up I give me Scotty yeah I think it's quite clear that they're building that franchise around Scotty Barnes Bam's clearly a focal point in Miami but  yeah I think I would go Scotty for sure did you know Scotty Barnes is a superstar in this league  did you know Scotty Barnes is running the show like that rant that their coach went on the other night yeah and he was he kept talking about Scotty Barnes like that was that was my favorite coaching rant maybe since playoffs and Jim Mora yeah it was a good one you know he certainly got his money's worth he ain't
