hey everybody I am Steve Alexander Dr a that is Bob Rathbun the voice of the Atlanta Hawks for Bally Sports welcome to the to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast sponsored by Underdog Vivid Seats and rival fantasy today is Tuesday October 31st which is also Halloween  Bob and I are getting ready to do this so you ready Bob I am ready doctor it is good to see you my friend  all right Bob you know when you and I first met it was probably about 15 years ago you sent me an email after something something ran in the AJC and I was thinking about that because the picture  they used for that article me I was holding my son he was like a little like infant six months year old I don't know how old he was he's a little kid and he drove his car to school today and he's driving himself to the dentist afterwards which means I don't have to do any of that but it just it just shows me how long you and I have been buddy well it is one of my most fun things about doing this job a meeting great people like you and I have been a huge fan from day one your knowledge and expertise in this is mind-boggling and I I just I learned so much from you all and you Steve in particular and the fact that you're an unabashed Hawks fan makes it all the better  well there you go we've got the we've got that's switched out the Deion Sanders jersey for Dominique good I was all fired up about Dion before the season started and then everybody else became fired up about Dion and it's sort of jumped the shark and become like almost too much yeah but I'm still happy for my I think he's doing a good job and he's gonna he's gonna have success of that program but it's basketball season man we gotta get the dominant Jersey up here there are some things a doctorate that you just you can't really mess with and  a Nick Jersey is one of them I mean that that has to take up a special spot on the back road there  well yeah it right that's that's the journey you can hang you can hang on stuff and whatever else but that corner belongs to the Hall of Famer well this this is my official headphones holster when I'm not wearing them where it is the dominant shoe it's always it's always just an arm's length away no matter where I go yeah uh all right so before we get into some Hawks chatter I'm going to remind everybody to like And subscribe to this podcast keep us going it's a good time I want to keep doing it before we get into James Harden and before we get into the Hawks  you have an off night right like there's no Hawks basketball tonight I assume you're not getting anywhere are you are you fired up to hand out some candy tonight I am so far it up we're gonna have the fire going on the front porch  because there's going to be cold tonight and I am as soon as we're finished here I am headed to the front yard for leaf Duty and I got to get the yard straight and then make a quick run to to get some candy and off we go I can't wait because I love seeing the neighbors kids come by it's great are you going are you going all in on the candy are you gonna make it are you going like full size Snickers are you not chance on the on the treats here I mean it's this is serious business you know when they bring their pillow covers as bags you know it's it's serious and you got to fill them up okay what's your address yeah if anybody can figure out where Bob is and you want to full-size Three Musketeers I think that's the that's the place to be and because that's the thing when you take your kids trick or treating the kids want to find you know that house that hands out the full size candy bars and not an apple or you know yeah oh no no help you crazy no no none of that  and and we encourage our trick or treaters to grab a handful and it's not one per cricketer oh yeah you get you get the full monty here you know you're only a kid once so you gotta you gotta yeah it sounds like I need to come trick-or-treating at your house tonight yeah they are really restrictions I have is if you walk up you know in a 76 is Jersey uh I send the dogs but everybody else is fine  speaking of spooky things and Halloween Bob James Harden snuck out of Philadelphia this morning at 2:30 kind of like this Colts snuck out of Baltimore back in the day Firkin cork Moss tried to hitch a ride  but both teams didn't think that would be a good idea so he's gonna stay right where he's been trying to get out of for the last five years that's one of that's awesome one of the funny things on on Twitter X this morning is Firkin Kirk Moss was trying everything he can do to get involved in that trade in he just couldn't do it the other funny thing I saw was Bob you know the old saying the two happy East days of your life or when you buy a boat and celebrate as somebody said the two happiest days of being an NBA fan is when your team trades for James hardening way so that was fairly entertaining I thought but what any thoughts we've got you know details are still coming in you and I were asleep when this was going down we haven't really had a chance to study this thing but basically we've got Westie you know Russell Westbrook Kawhi Leonard Paul George and James Harden all together in the same rowboat I think the only guy missing is quiet is a Kyrie Irving  yeah that would really make it a five some um it's it's flashback to OKC right putting the old band back together get rust and Westbrook and and hardened together  I don't know doc this is  you know this is not the James Harden of Years Gone by  this is  he's still the bull dominant James Harden but he's not the James Harden that we remember as MVP and scoring champion blah blah um and you got like three guys that are bald dominant on this team so I I don't know tyloo deserves better he's a Fabulous Coach really good really good and to try to make this work on the fly as is going to be very very difficult in my view  Philly is going to be better just because the distraction is gone  people are going to find out Nick nurse can really coach and  you know Covington is a guy that he can utilize used to be there right he was a Philly guy at one point know you know he's the ball do the Dirty Work you know that Philadelphia make come out  I mean they're they're this close away from being three and oh so  I think like you said you rid of that distraction yeah that's a clears the air and everybody can take a deep breath and we don't have to then on to answer questions about James Harden every single day exactly and Bob honestly I'm just happy that Ed Williams one of my many bosses was a sleep at 2:30 in the morning so he didn't make me start filming videos about James Harden at 3 a.m. and try to break that thing down so yeah I it's gonna be an interesting experiment I doubt it works there is a part of me though the things what if they all play the right way together and figure this out quickly and it could be almost like a Olympic team experience I don't I don't know how that would happen  but  but they're not all gonna play those Steve they go you know Kauai is going to miss his 30 and Paul George will miss his 30 games and hardened will take off every once in a while and I don't know how it comes together and this actually gives them more of a free pass to take a night off I mean I could see Tyler just being like all right Westie you're off Tuesday Paul you're taking Friday off which is exactly what the league doesn't want  oh man yeah it's at least it's over how about that that's the best part of all  and I know you don't play a lot of fantasy sports but you're I also don't know anybody who says dialed into the rest of the league you are outside of a certain Atlanta Hawk right now who's got me super excited I'll talk about him in a couple minutes yeah are there any non Hawk players that you've seen play on TV or in person this year that year you've been impressed with or surprised by yeah well Jalen Dern and Detroit you know and this is what I love about fantasy basketball  because you all  that are involved in this  comb the box scores and look at these results like like I do and we do for the hidden gems and for the guys that are on the rise and for anybody who plays on the Pistons these days the national media is sound asleep  they're not paying attention they're not watching the games but I tell you what Detroit's got some great young Talent that's fun to watch and it's going to be great to watch these guys rise over these years I think during his is one of those guys you know sitting next to Nick every night you get a unique perspective when we play these teams because he can look at a guy and say this this cat can play a little bit let's keep an eye on him which is gives you that perspective that you don't get a lot of different places right but Nate can identify them and he's that's a kid that that need took a look at I he's a tremendous rebounder I mean my goodness he could rebound out of his area  great timing you know young legs right now I really like him and he's just one of of several of these young cats but I my I really do have a deep appreciation for the for what you do and the fantasy players I just won blowing smoke I mean you guys study this all of this and it's and I learned a lot about the league just by following  awesome um yeah during has been incredible I was looking at the league leaders and blocks and Duran is it I'm thinking he's at three a game I also noticed the Scotty Barnes of the Toronto Raptors is blocking three shots of game right now which is  crazy he won't be there at the end but I'm kind of keeping an eye on blocks because I've got a I've got a  jersey bet with a buddy of mine I've got women Yamaha and he's got  Walker Kessler for who has more blocks this season so trying to keep an eye on what's going on there um happy for the for Walker Kessler you know Newnan Georgia guy you know great family kid got a break and took advantage of it you know caught fire at Auburn it really fun to watch  did you see this cam Thomas thing coming out of Brooklyn  I didn't not really can you never know  you know it I I always say it's the Fred Carter  syndrome you know the worst team in the league has to have a leading scorer you just never know who that guy's going to be you get rid of all your stars you start this rebuild and and this guy sort of appears out of nowhere seems to be a high volume shooter  I mean he's he is getting up but no I did not see that coming he's getting them up but he's doing it at a nice percentage yep he had three 40 point games in a row last year like we saw flashes of this last year and then this year you know everybody was talking about mikal bridges non-stop on that team because he had such a phenomenal run when he got the Brooklyn last year people were really talking about cam Thomas but then Nick Claxton got her and Cameron Johnson got hurt and  cams just been out there going crazy so I I'm all about it I'm I I actually drafted him in a couple weeks and it's  it's kind of fun when that happens but all right well let's get ready to talk about the Hawks but first we're going to talk about Underdog

can read it I can read a script I I played some Underdog last night actually and I I needed two LeBron three-pointers which I got I needed like 42 combined points assists and rebounds from Anthony Davis which I got  I needed 19 scoring points from Franz Wagner of the Orlando Magic  he had 16 going into the fourth quarter I'm also I need to three pointer from France I'm good and he shot five of Seventeen for the game never scored another point oh and that that was a tough that was a tough Underdog defeat but  I still have fun watching it  trying to happen  it's a it's it's interesting to me how you can put these kind of weird combinations together  and get a big payout okay to me that is like really interesting and Joe had Joe burrow the Cincinnati Bengals quarterback thrown one interception in the entire game on Sunday I would have I had a ten dollar investment in a five lugger and I would have won like 300 bucks wow but he didn't he didn't throw an interception yeah but it's fun it's fun being able to do these prop these props where you can just sort of pick and shoot it's like going to the shopping shopping center right just pulling stuff off the shelf right cool your Atlanta Hawks yes sir last night I'm sitting there watching I'm got Luke on one TV I've got the Hawks on one TV I've got football on another TV  the Hawks are down 21 nothing is going right and I almost turned into a different game but I was like my man is coming on the show tomorrow I need I need to stay with him through this difficult time  and then what happened  Deontay Murray happened  he had one of the greatest quarters in Hawk history last night he hit 11 consecutive shots to start the second half and the the interesting part about it to me was that nine of them were jumpers you know you just don't see that guys who put together streaks of consecutive field goals made are generally around the basket you know you mix in three or four dunks and blah blah blah that wasn't the case with Murray he was hitting threes he was in mid-rangers he was getting to the rack for sure but to hit 11 in a row they told us that in the quote modern era which means the play-by-play era which started late 1990s this was the best quarter in Hawk history for a player which is saying something we've had great guards come through here and you know what praise done has been phenomenal of late but DJ had it going and it wasn't just his offense I mean he was really good on Edwards last night played a great game it was it was really good stuff  I was gonna ask you about Edwards because I noticed you you need  talked about it on the broadcast and every oh you still there I am I'm here  okay all right Hamilton something got sketchy there like when I was watching the broadcast  Leaf fella broke up  Anthony Edwards was kind of balling out in that game and going off and doing whatever he wanted to do and suddenly you were like where did Anthony Edwards go and I was like where did it Anthony Edwards go I suspect some of that was Deontay playing defense it was but they didn't really look for him it my view I mean I get so focused on the ball that I don't see what's going on  and the other four positions but um  it just seemed to me like he didn't get the touches in the second half like he did in the first and he was cooking I mean 20-point first half look great shot a high percentage and of course he's you know if you're not aware you know he's an Atlantic kid coming back home to play and was juice here last year had 32 in the game the Minnesota one in this building and so last night was just more of the same than all of it just stopped  and  they  knew they were going to cool off I mean you're not going to hit 60 70% of your shots at an MBA game over an extended period of time so we expected a little drop off and halftime is usually the time that that happens  but what was so interesting last night is that they could not  restart the engine  um and yes the Hawks picked it up Murray got hot but when Minnesota tried to  to like the flame again it just wasn't happening and then they they fell apart I think the Run was  at one point it was 60 to 20 he probably you probably have it but it was I think even bigger than that but it was about a 40 points swing  yeah it was crazy one of the most incredible runs I've ever seen  it really was because the Hawks  were down 21 and then they were up 21 like it all happened so fast and then Minnesota couldn't even hardly react to it yeah all right so  you're talking about trying to find Diamonds in the Rough and fine guys who are going to get hot before they get hot and one of those guys plays for the Atlanta Hawks I Jalen Johnson looks like a different player to me this season then he looked last season like Nick is talking about Jalen Duren passing the eye test like that guy can play a little bit when I see Jalen Johnson on TV right now I'm like man that guy looks good like he just looks confident healthy super athletic and and just he just looks like he wants to go out there and take over  you Dale to  confidence  which he had none of  the first couple of years we said him down to College Park he starts to get his feet wet and one thing I think for fans to to check out these young guys is one they do go down to the G League keep an eye on him see how they do  do they score in big numbers do they fit in do they help the team win and those that do  a year or two later you may see them arrive on the NBA seeing and I think Johnson is one of those guys you know he did not play a lot in college he left Duke very early on he was not ready for the pros his rookie season he got the season and he needed at College Park he got a little bit of his little feet wet last season but still did not shoot the ball well  but the Intensive work that he's done and the Hawks have done and what Quinn has done with him since taking over is to infuse that confidence you can do this you can play this style and now you have a six foot nine Wing jumbo size Wing that can run I think is going to develop into a very good outside shooter in time  but he's getting to the rack these dunks have been amazing he gives us a an athletic player that we just haven't had that size that can run and do things block shots and and rebound a little bit he's really coming on So You identified a gem and I think he's going to get a ton of minutes Quinn believes in him he wants him out there we're kind of stuck in this threesome between jail and and Hunter and saddiq Bey and I think Quinn will at least early kind of rotate the three based on the matchups but if Jalen keeps playing the way he's playing he's not coming out of that lineup well he did not start in game one so you baited and then Jalen started after that he started last night I don't know how I don't know the way he looks right now I don't think you can take him out and speak they looks pretty good Off the Bench I think yep I might be even a better role for him and then DeAndre Hunter who a lot of hawks fans  over the years have lost patience with and like it's I feel like this is the year for DeAndre Hunter to either  turn the corner and be what he thought we what we thought he was gonna be or  Hawks fans are just going to be like we got to move on this guy I I would bet on Hunter  and I'll tell you why remember where he played his college basketball  Virginia right  it's a you know we do not do this at Virginia  and I you know it's no indictment Tony Bennett's a great coach and a national champion but you know they play a system and and Hunter you remember he was a red shirt in college which never happens for an elite player and then played two more years after that was hurt came back got on the national championship Squad he's got a winning pedigree it's very quiet don't let that deceive you he's very intense competitor he's a lot bigger and stronger than than you think he is until you see him up close  but here's the thing about the coaching change here this is another one of the guys sort of like Jalen that  when you have your shot  Let it Fly Quinn does not care if you miss seven in a row  all he cares about is if when that ball comes to you and you're open you shoot the basketball  and what you start to see  with Hunter  is  oh  it's okay to shoot this oh okay  and I think unless I miss my my bed on this one doc this is gonna be another guy who is going to be consistent three-point shooter when you look at Hunter's career in games that he has taken seven or more threes and I think it's happened about close to 30 times in his career his three-point percentage is just right under 40% that's pretty good and I think he is going to be as the as the weeks go on and he gets more comfortable he's going to be taking seven eight nine threes a game because he has permission to shoot them and he's a good outside shooter and the other thing about the perception of Hunter I think is you know we moved Heaven and Earth to get him you know basically the number four pick in the draft so with that comes the expectations and I think he may have suffered from that a little bit plus he's trying to figure out how to play with Trey and you know the whole bit about the acclamation of the pros going through coaching changes and what have you but he's got a guy now who believes in Him wants him to shoot the basketball and you know if you've got him in one of your League's hang on to it I think he's in for a pretty big year nice and I think you looks he's off to a good start I he's off to a better start than I think I thought he was going to be so good on DeAndre Hunter up the NBC season the NBA season is here on behalf of our friends at Vivid Seats let's get one thing clear

comment on I forgot to do it I'm gonna do it now you said sitting next to Dominique is a unique experience  and when Dominique launched his Brooks line of shoes they were called the Dominique uniques  I don't know if you do that or not I did not I I bought a pair of those in the in the store and I had I've got ads that still say unique for those Brooks hit but his books were called unique's which I thought that was funny when you very nice  uh what's going on with Trey young do we love Trey young Hawks fans huge tray young fans are they do we not know about Trey young how likable the guy is he where are we yeah I think it's another situation where you have a player trying to adapt to a new coach and a new system  this is  this is a work in progress okay  Trey  in my in my opinion  was a guy who played one way his whole life from a time he was a kid in growing up a Norman Oklahoma  High School AAU that one year at Oklahoma early on in his hocks career  he played one way well dominant do everything the passing the scoring the whole nine yards  doesn't have to do that now he does not he has a better team around him  and Quinn recognizes that and Quinn is trying to find that balance for Trey  for bleeding the offense to shooting to passing the whole nine yards to get him to to play defense all of those things and sort of a work in progress and I'd be honest with you you know for somebody who watches this every night this team it's fascinating to watch Quincy Snyder is one of the most unique coaches I've ever had the pleasure working with now I've known Quinn since he was a junior at Duke when I was doing his games on the ACC pay so we've we've known each other a long time  and he's so smart you know you look at his educational background both of his parents were teachers his dad was a coach he is a he is a thinker man he is he's got it figured out and  I think the greatest thing for Quinn is this communication skills and this is something that he's been charged with doing to make it work with Trey and deshante but Trey in particular is to listen Trey you've been this year third coach you were working on your second you know two and a half general managers you know it's time you're getting paid you got your max contract now how can we funnel all this into winning and leading  and this is what Quinn has been charged to do  the constant and I mean constant communication between coach and player  film  interaction with his teammates practice court  in the locker room  what you'll see I believe is the the growth sort of the rewiring of trees brain if you will  to good shot bad shot to extra pass don't don't make the pass play off the ball and this is all a work in progress you know really four games into this stuff and breaking some old habits developing new habits  and I think in a tray is amazingly talented kid to do what he's done in this league and his size is is unbelievable he's LED this league and total assist for two straight years you just don't do that if you can't  really play the game and he's so special as a passer but I think Hawks fans like him I think Hawks fans get frustrated with him but I think they liked him and I think they they're good they're gonna like what they see  let's come back and chat later in the season and we'll see if Trey becomes that all around guy that I think he will if we win  and he continues was he second of the League this morning in a still yeah I was going into last night he will he'll be back on the All-Star team  and more maybe with him  the same guy that we have the block bet with we had an assist bed and I I got the first pick in the first thing that came out of my mouth was tray and maybe my buddy took Tyreese Halliburton and I think my buddies gonna win because helbert is one and Trace to in assists right now or at least that would total as of last night I thought we're doing average per game average okay well you know we haven't shot the ball well  it when we start shooting the ball well trying to assist total go up  it sounds like you feel like the well I think an important part of this and I didn't even have it down to talk to you about but you already talked about Quinn a little bit but the fact that Quinn is really just now taking over this team like last year was a warm up just getting his feet wet in Atlanta like this is totally different now it's his team now it's his system so it is it is probably gonna take time for everybody to get on the same page so my first year with the Hawks was 96.97 and we started on Two And 156 games and I remember Lenny Wilkens who was our coach then telling me I mean what a my first year in the NBA full-time and I got Lenny oh you couldn't me you know ten times all the favor he I remember him saying to me don't judge anything or anybody until we played 20 games  he said you'll go through enough  Home Road back-to-back good opponents bad opponents you'll see enough in those first 20 games you'll have a pretty good handle on your team and I would say that to all fans whether you play Fantasy or you're just an MBA fan withhold judgment until 20 games and then see where you are you know everybody is now like the Celtics you know everybody thinks oh my God you know he does oh just wait for single so get hurt  they have no bench these things play out they they have been the last how long  10 years a very good regular season team uh but I don't see that next Banner hanging so I mean it's a long season but I would withhold judgment that's good advice 20 games fantasy managers should probably take that advice sometimes because you know we live in a Twitter world now it's like what what have you done for me like last night and if if last night didn't go well you're looking for something else the next day so it's it's hard but for non-patient people to be patient in this world but one more Hawks note and then we'll look at a couple of tonight's games and then lets you get let you get to your Halloween chores click kompella and a young kid combo coexisting  at some point a convo was going to take over when is that going to happen and is it happening right now or is Clinton still firmly in French in the future where  I think  yes to to most of that yes on Yucca will be the big man in the future yes capella is a drenched what you're seeing is another  another aspect of the coaching change  was was there a more dominant  I shouldn't say dominant was there more frequent pick-and-roll team than Atlanta last year right we probably ran more picking roles than anybody yeah if not number one close  and most of them were capellan tray  one five pick and roll  and one thing that Quinn wanted to get away from was our complete utter Reliance on a pick-and-roll to start every offensive possession in the half court  and you're seeing Troy play off the ball you're seeing read react you're seeing a lot more passing and movement well the one guy that affects is going to be Clint capela right he's not probably going to get as many touches and as he has in the past so when it comes to his numbers they probably will be down just a little bit but he's still a fantastic rebounder he anchors a backline of that defense he blocked shots hit his ability to keep the ball alive on the offensive glass is really a unique skill that he has so you know if you're asking from a fan of fantasy perspective I think his numbers might go down just a hair but if you're asking from the basketball and Winning Side then he's just as as big a piece as ever but it's a different shift it's a different Focus Now by Quinn trying to implement more of his schemes that makes sense yeah yeah so it really doesn't to me speak to a decline of Clint capela I mean he's 29 years old he's still in his prime but what it does suggest is a little different shift and emphasis the unique thing about the Hawks is none of our fights really  shoot the ball you know Clint's you take him out of the restricted area and we're in trouble and yetka developing a 3-point shot but not there yet by any means and Bruno you know is only going to be out there and blowouts or somebody gets hurt so unlike many NBA teams our fives don't shoot threes mm-hmm so we've got to figure out a way to get them involved and keep them involved without running pick and roll every time down the floor so that's that's one of the things I think that's happening in that Center Spot I also think getting rid of that that pick-and-roll every time scenario  takes away some of the predictability and it changes things up and but it allows for Johnson Hunter and these guys to get going which is your seeing now in the first four games  Lebron vs Jordan Magic versus bird Barkley vs Mikhail basketball

you about it I'm not gonna lie it said before the season tips off you see me adjust that on the floor and just a true Pro right there any further Okay so  we're almost done I think we've hit the Hawks pretty hard we've hit the hardened trade let's look at tonight's games there's only three games tonight you're gonna be handing out candy yeah you have the DVR  who we got one of those games is Victor Wendella and his Spurs against the Suns have you had a chance to sit down and watch women Yuma play yet  I have seen one half  but I've seen a lot of the cut-ups  I'm gonna tell you who he is I'm gonna tell you who he is  but it  remember now the game is played differently than it was back then  but this guy reminds me of Ralph Samsung if  Ralph had been allowed to do what Victor is allowed to do today you would have seen it 40 years ago with Ralph Sampson what was Ralph 7273 I thought you said seven seven four okay maybe seven two I don't know you know but well over seven feet  could shoot it from the outside could put it on the floor could block shots I mean but it what the game one played like this Ralph Sampson ladies and gentlemen  was the three-time Nesmith college player of the year at Virginia that's only happened one other time in History Bill Walton  he comes to the pros he's the Rookie of the Year with Houston the second year in the pros he's the MVP of the All-Star Game his third year in the pros he takes Houston upsets the Lakers and goes to the NBA finals  then he falls hits his back the injuries started to take over and And Ralph's career what like that but coming up when he was a kid Harrisburg Virginia going to UVA that's what he was when you see Victor Windham you know my Ralph Sampson history is is kind of extensive because I saw him play in Market Square arena in a sweet 16 I think a regional in like 80 I don't know what year that would have been 83 Maybe  um yeah my buddy here maybe Paul petrata herb Patronus dad took me and Paul to see that I don't even think I knew what I was watching but I I knew that he was taller and everybody else and he was a freak and then didn't the Pacers lose a coin toss  and get Steve's to panic in the second pick and Ralph went to Houston first and if that stupid coin with a landed heads and a Tails Ralph would have been a Pacer through my whole childhood what's that would have been cool and then Ralph Sampson was the guy the first player I ever noticed when I was at a Pacer game that threw his wristband into the crowd or gave his wristband to a kid which Sparks my mind to like oh my oh my Lord I need to get a wristband from a guy like Ralph Sampson that's started my whole obsession with NBA basketball memorabilia and and meeting players and all that stuff so I love comparison and I love their Samson don't you think oh yeah it's a good it's a good comparison in like you're talking about it's a totally different game back there they're not gonna let a guy as tall as Ralph Sampson stand out there and shoot threes so they may not have even had a 3-point line yeah I that was right about the time it was coming in was it was right around what they tried that Short Line  then moved it back but anyway I mean you know you talk about the three just a quick aside they talk about 3-point shooting  if it had been a thing back then like it is now Larry Bird would have set every three-point record out there  you imagine with his range are you kidding me but it wasn't a thing Curry Steph Curry takes his many three-pointers  in a month as Larry Bird took an entire season right right that's taking nothing away from stuff or clay or any of those guys  no but Larry you look at Larry he's only shooting like two a game right it's it's wild because you think of him as like a 3-point champion and the contest and you know always hitting threes but he hardly ever shot right so anyway so Victor one minyama and Spurs are gonna get blown out by the Suns tonight do you think the sons are the best team in the west or you think no I did not I think the Denver Nuggets are the best team I  and the depth  which is you know a big thing in the regular season not so much in the playoffs but still you gotta have somebody I'm I want to see a little bit more out of Phoenix 20 games 20 games remember yeah but I love Denver I think this cat yoge come on come on  I mean he's not even in shape  he's funny he's so funny he's so cool he's just here he is and he said what what's one Benn Jama got to do he's got to get fatter  yeah I love him I don't know I don't know how anybody who loves this game  would not do whatever they could do to go watch him play in person  you know as you go as he goes around the NBA and he's close to you go just go and he's gonna play he's no load management with this guy he's gonna play and it is spectacular to watch him he sees a different game than most of us the other two games that are the Knicks and the calves and the magic at these shorthanded Clippers so that'll be interesting to see what happens there I'm gonna pivot something I did not write down to talk about but I'm sure you have some thoughts on it  we have an in  season tournament start  where a bunch of teams are going to play like Fridays and Tuesdays every game on the schedule is part of the tournament gives an added Edge to each one of those games I think it it could create some some extra activity  how do you feel about the in season tournament are you a fan are you excited are you like this is different and I know I I am excited to see it work  you know if it doesn't work  then no but I think if it does Catch Fire sort of like the play in you know there was a lot of misgivings about the play in tournament and now I think because we had  was at the first year we had Lakers Warriors in the play in is that right I don't know but we had we had Lakers Warriors in a plane yes I believe we did and that of course captured everybody's imagination and sort of gave us a lift for what the play in could be that I think now is here to stay  and it gives the the better clubs a challenge to get in that top six which is good  but I'm interested to see how the the in-season tournament works I'm really interested to see what's going to do to the schedule  you know we've we've played with these 30 teams 15 and 15 sort of a balanced schedule okay you're going to play everybody in the West for us and the East you're going to play by the West twice home and away and then in the East you play everybody four times two and two except for 14 teams two teams You'll Play Once at home and twice on a road and the other two you play twice at home and once in a row and it's been that way for years but that not so this year  if you'll notice when we get to the first week of December there are no game scheduled  well that's because these teams that make the in season tournament are going to play quarterfinals the 22 teams the don't make it are going to have games rescheduled  and that's how we're going to get to 81 and 82 and the championship game of the NCAA tournament will be an 83 game that will not count the regular season standing but what's going to happen is the league is going to take a look at this inventory of games I is the last night the 28th of November the last day of the in season tournament that they've got to sit down they got to sit down and figure out okay  who's playing where are they playing how are we going to make this work  if you don't make it  you get one home game and one road game  to be determined and they may say to the Hawks say we don't make it and they say well  you know sorry guys but to make this thing work you got to go to Portland  really  um you know your home game is going to be against  Throwdown out their New York so the next are going to come three times to Atlanta  that's kind of crazy and the reason I bring this up is because when we get to the end of the year and we start figuring out tiebreakers for who's gonna make the top six who's going to make the play in tournament who's going to get in get out  this is going to throw a entirely another wrinkle into this but for the tournament itself I mean give it a shot you know they want people watching the return so far of the Stars to playing regularly has been a bonanza for the league ratings you know generally what's the old line the season start to Christmas right that's what you've heard well they want to change that and this is a part of that change get the stars on the court forget the stupid load management and get you guys out there and have this tournament to spark interest in the middle of football season you know I'm really glad I asked you about the tournament because I in the past at my old my old gig that ended a year ago I was the schedule guy I was in charge of the schedule grid I wrote all the schedule breakdown columns I I was more dialed in to the NBA schedule than most human being should be probably but now that that has changed and it's not my specialty anymore I I really haven't paid any attention to the schedule and I didn't realize that there was a whole week in the summer that we don't know the NBA schedule yet so that's right not only is that a huge impact to actual NBA teams especially if you get if you say Hey you get to play this really good team at home and you also get the flight out of the West Coast so congratulations it also is going to impact of fantasy a lot because guys you know some of your guys are gonna get extra games that you don't know are coming um that week so and check your check your league for that 83rd game because the two teams that play it in Vegas for the in-season championship that will be an 83rd game that will not count in the standings will the stats count you know in your league I don't know so you might want to ask whether or not those because those teams those only two teams that'll affect but still it'll be some players that you may have on one of your teams yeah and if the Nets happen to be in that tournament that means an 83rd game for mikal Bridges once again because we know what we know he's not sitting out funny story last year  he is  gets traded  he had missed a game since junior high school yeah  and he is a nervous wreck because the trade hasn't been finalized and he cannot suit up for Brooklyn  and he is in agony because he thinks his streak is going to end  but then the league called and said listen because of the way the schedules are you're going to end up playing 82 games I think he ended up maybe playing 83 he said 83 yeah you're gonna end up playing 83 your streak is intact even though you're sitting this game out here's like how thank God yeah well and that's the thing Mikhail bridge is cares like he cares about that streak and he does not ever want to miss a game and if every NBA player had that mentality we would have never heard of load management and I tell you it's changing because the guys like Bridges because the guys like Anthony Edwards they went to that sham of an All-Star game last year and Anthony Edwards said I'm not participating in this I'm not playing this  get somebody else this is a joke and a travesty and so what the league do  they call it crap the you know picking the players and all that nonsense East West let's go  now we're the pendulum is swinging back the pendulum is swinging back  all right there gonna yell at me if I don't wrap this up so Bob go yelling you you demand oh you know I get yelled at I'm I've been married for 30 years I get yelled  thank you so much for coming on yes I always learn a lot when you're here and it's you're just you're the best my favorite play-by-play guy in the league so feel the same way about you um I'm Dr a that's Bob Raffin go find
