hey guys I'm Dr Ace Alexander it is Thursday November  16th and this is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast award-winning sponsored by Underdog rival fantasy and Vivid Seats  that's what camera we're gonna get to this after a busy seven night  seven night seven game night in the NBA here we go doc let's start with the Draymond Green suspension here there are many fantasy embedding ramifications of this he got five games from the league on NBA Radio yesterday me and Antonio Daniels chopped this up and I said he's gonna get between three and five games I thought the number would be three I said the max would be five he got the full five so as we talk about that to me this is the league saying we are done enabling this awful Behavior by Draymond Green because the Warriors continue to enable him like a spoiled child who's going the wrong way um you know they they didn't punish him uh well they find him but they didn't suspend him for the punch on Jordan Poole he was there on ring night and Steve Curry even after the you know events was saying clay shouldn't have been thrown out of the game and defended dream on green that Rudy had a hand around clay and all this kind of stuff so I like that League banged on Draymond Green here and gave him five games because the Warriors would not have given him anything if it were up to them but Steve let me give you one more thing to to chew on here and we'll get this rolling um Draymond Green is a droppable player right now in Fantasy Basketball in the right league if you're in a super deep you're not dropping Draymond Green you need to hold on to it but if you are not in a deep leak if you're in a waiver Rich League okay and and maybe with the s u s p he can't be slid out of your dudes and into an i&j or something like that that's just kind of jammed up with five empty games from Draymond go ahead and cut him guys his numbers absolutely suck doctor's you know and you vote Charles Barkley talk about this he is the master of the triple single and I'm out on Draymond as a fantasy player man he's no longer doing it for me  I've been out for a while I'm not sure I was ever in my buddy Jalen Johnson like three seasons ago had Draymond on one of our office teams  and I mean we were getting trade offers every week and nobody would ever take it he had drain on his team the whole the whole year was kind of stuck with him you know and the whole Optics of that thing it I don't know that he was like cutting off the air supply to Rudy gobert just the look of it and dragging him across the court like that like it just didn't look good I mean I'm not surprising got five games I just posted a montage on my Facebook page which I needed to figure out how to get that on Twitter X good luck of all the stuff that Draymond all the just Dirty Cheap shots just just stuff he does he's done over the years and it just keeps happening over and over and over again as far as fantasy ramifications go though  I mean the guy scores like what six points a game seven points a game there's the rebounding is down there's just nothing nothing to love there for me anymore and I and I'm with you if you're in a week in a league where you need guys to play every night you know in other words if you're not a rotilie I mean you're dropping Grandma I let somebody else deal with it  he said nine five and six on the years he's under one in both defensive categories he's shooting below 50% guys he's aging and getting worse not getting better all right so let's talk about Dario Sarge and Brandon put Jim ski and it's it's like spelled pod Jim ski but the D is silent for everybody out there it's projecting okay um Dario saric to me is a must-have pickup right now Doc ah he already started that Minnesota game with Draymond Green all right so he is going to be a starter playing 30 plus minutes Steve Kerr loves him okay uh 21 points four rebounds four assists two steals three threes in that game against Minnesota and his numbers have been when he gets minutes really good and  look I I like sorry doc you know he should be Center power forward eligible in a lot of leaks here I went ahead and picked him up I'm in a and kind of a waiver Rich keeper league and I had a who did I drop for him I picked up quickly last night because I wanted some threes thank you quick he was fantastic last night at Atlanta that was a solid streamer um for your boy Camp um I dropped him this morning he picked up Sarge because it's a light night we got two games and search might have some staying power on my team here with the five games that dream on green is out possibly be on that but I'm just kind of looking at this five game window right here I think starts is going to be pretty good I mean he's going to have to play with Draymond not there and  starts has been flirting with this all year he's actually having a good season and we're so used to him like having a good game and disappearing for a week and and then coming in and doing something but I tell you what like it feels like her is not ready yet to just go all full Jonathan cuming with us which means homie Darius gonna be playing a lot of minutes the other thing  that we need to wonder about Golden State is when is Andrew Wiggins gonna wake up and get out of this funk so tell me there's only dude I'm out I'm I I'm folded my cards man I'm out there is a ton the love about Darius sorry right now so and we looked to see how you can throw here you went back to SARS like do you know he's gonna pull out of this I do you think he is I don't know man I thought he was going to but you know  Bobby Raffin says we need 20 games I don't we're getting close we're gonna close I'm getting to the point where I was giving Wiggins the benefit of the doubt I would throw him in a DFS lineup or take a swing at him and Underdog or whatever I'm just I'm 2 point where I'm staying all the way away from him until further notice until he shows me something because it's been bad the only downside with these guys and I was Golden State plays three games next week and three games the following week a lot of teams play four times and those weeks that makes you know Dario and Pudgy a little little shaky if you can drop Andrew Wiggins as far as I'm concerned right  um guys she's shooting uh let me let me think here they played a couple nights ago I believe this is an updated stat 15% from 3 point range  15% he's averaging like 10 points for rebounds one assist no defense at all okay and he's a defensive player so it's just it's very very weird here it's super funky Klay Thompson sucks now Chris Paul sucks now Andrew Wiggins sucks now the only guy on this team that's cooking his step Curry and you had the other night in that Minnesota win Sarge and a branded pajam ski hit for 20 points it was the first time all year anybody other than step it for 20 points Wiggins didn't do it clay didn't do it clay didn't do it Clayton do it right and pajam ski here doc K in the Minnesota game took off 23/7 and 5 one steal three threes made 50% of his shots and took 18 of them  Steve Kerr hand picked pojem ski oh you're thinking what about Mike Dunleavy Jr cammies the shot caller of this team know he's not Steve Kerr is the shot caller of this team without the title and I believe that's why Bob Myers is with the ESPN right now I think there was a little power struggle there you know Kerr wasn't playing the picks um that Myers made and I think that was just a whole thing in Meijer like cool I'm out I'm going to ESPN I'll make I don't know five million a year on the desk over there on to put up with this garbage anymore but Steve Kerr hand picked poached okay and he talked glowingly about him after the lost in Minnesota the you know the fight game the other night so to me Doc he's here to stay and I can't say he's a 30 minute player moving forward but to me he's a half of the game player moving forward at least write 24 minutes um and you bring up a great point about comingo you would think that would dream on out coming up right green lit and here we go and here's the tick off of Jonathan comingo Steve Kerr only kind of  half like Jonathan comingo right and incoming is not bringing defense he's not bringing the rebounding that Steve Kerr said he wanted from him yeah he scored about 12 a game okay cool I mean it's really not that big of a deal here but talk to me about poetry and are you geeked are you leaving him away verse where you at well I think we needed  to take a deep breath on post because  the game before that he played one minute right the game before that he played eight minutes the game before that he played 11 minutes the game before that he played eight minutes so what happened in that game on Tuesday that could have got him in the in there for 39 minutes well  Draymond decided to drag Rudy go bare across the court by the neck clay decided to grab on Jane McDaniels Jersey and not let go and then when McDaniels retaliated they both just went Darko Milicic on their on their jerseys number when he ripped it off on the on the sidelines anyway so those two guys got thrown out they're already down players and Poets got hot when Kurt him in the game and he stayed hot and he looked incredible and I like the fact that poaches a curved guy I personally need to see this at least two more times before I'm going all in because you know those guys come back the other thing we haven't even mentioned yet is Steph Curry's not playing tonight right he is out tonight yes against the Thunder they say it's a short-term thing with the knee he had an MRI it feels load management e to me Steve I'm not worried about Curry long term I'm not are you know no but  tonight like four games late no Curry know Draymond  are you  do you trust Klay Thompson and Chris Paul enough after you just got done dissing them would you put them in a DFS on tonight no are you going Pogues and finding other guys  in a DFS who would have to come down to pricing and all this kind of stuff and you tell me it's gonna be cheap it's pojo A4 is he a 3800 player a 4000 players supposed to like a 10,000 dollar player  if he is I'm into it right and and Sarge would be a guy that I look at as well maybe he's at 5600 or something moderate right where you can get them in there and get some goodies um doc Chris Paul his shot is so broken that he passed up a 10 footer in the clutch against Minnesota the other night to pass to the corner torch and he got the shop blocked by goldbear Chris Paul doesn't pass down 10 foot midaz that are it wasn't butt naked wide open like gobert was gonna get a handout but Paul could have shot over that it wasn't like a contest like his shot is broken dude not even the three I mean I get that he doesn't have the legs anymore but he can't he's not even shooting the mid-range shot of effectively anymore and play tops and Doc let me make a point to you here Klay Thompson is a brand name version of Tim Hardaway Jr that's all he is right now 14 points nothing else no boards no assistance no blocks no steals he's like 2.43 per game the percentage is sucked like 43 overall 34 something from three these are Tim Hardaway Jr numbers you can get  this started with Junior  Wilson is doing what Clay Thompson is doing right now your boy don't get Robinson is doing what Klay Thompson is doing is to answer your question poach is 5300 at FanDuel that's that's kind of pricey what is what is sorry  sorry I just saw that and he's a 57 okay I like Sarge more at 57th and poetry at 58 but I it depends on the rest of the slate and how that all Stacks up poaching 508 doesn't doesn't like bother me it doesn't buzz kill me but I like Sarge better at that price all right  yeah I was thinking about rolling the dice on clay and wing and stone but  and Chris Paul because there's just not not games but  I think you've talked me out of it I like you said with Wiggins right um like these guys are garbage right now I I just I can't go in okay see by the way doc can you know this they play defense man sjs a great defensive guard giddy's long he's not a great defender but he's long and can get in the way Lou Dora is obviously a phenomenal Defender and he'll be on trying to think of the new construction here um he'll probably on Klay Thompson don't you think try to put a blanket on him keep the confidence low all that kind of stuff and nevertheless this is not a great matchup for all those Warriors that you're talking about here um so doc let's move on man and let's talk about what do I want to go next here let me do this let me do this yeah hit him hit the people man Underdog fantasies the number one platform for NBA best phone DFS player Pick'em contest if you have

five-leg Harley out there four of them had a hit I needed Keegan Murray to get one steal right somebody comes down the lane puts a knee and Keegan Murray's chest they take him out of the game take him to the locker room and they're like we don't know if he's gonna come back or not we're in the fourth quarter  I'm like that's it dude I'm gonna be one steal away from betting two dollars to win 87.50 right well Murray comes back and the game  gets the game clinching steel I think LeBron got him or Anthony Davis I think he got him in his but anyway got the game points to steal the light went up green I got 8750 last night it was phenomenal doc you are the man congratulations on that dude um it was jaxson Hayes write big old gangly arms and legs jaxson Hayes coming into the pink Keegan Murray like you got to have some serious iron nads to stand in front of jaxson Hayes at a full run Doc that's his Brave is running with the bulls and pump Lotto or wherever the hell they do that is that the city is that where the Bulls come on I don't know I don't know I don't know anyway you know the running of the bulls thing right where these these people go out there and get trampled by like why are you doing this why why are you subjecting yourself to this horror and and and you know death and dismemberment I don't get it man um all right let's reel it in here and I want you to tell us a little story here doc about miles Bridges um I know you're kind of interested I'll say in his return tomorrow coming off of suspension now the plot thickens here  because Gordon Hayward I know I roll right another injury right hamstring strain he missed Tuesday night's game Brandon Miller Miss Tuesday night's game of the left ankle sprain and I believe dot correct me if I'm wrong he sprained the ankle came back and played and then went back out with the same injury which is not good right that means he's going to miss some time most likely here but if and I don't I was on checking this out I don't bought a 45 minutes ago and I didn't have and it's early right it's still 117 a.m. eastern time they're probably a shoot around right now so we haven't gotten news about Hayward and Miller if they're going to play tonight or not but they might not so it appears the runway has been cleared for Miles Bridges to join the starting lineup with PJ Washington what are your thoughts about this man  well it's interesting like he's he's sort of been a forbidden Topic at certain places  with all the legal issues going on and nobody wants to you know get into all that I don't need either I don't I don't really want to do that either but it's far as just from a fantasy perspective everything I heard and read in the last two days is he's going to play he's ready to go he's been working out with the team he's going to play a significant role with that team PJ Washington has had some big games but he also has had some Duds I don't know that he's the end-all be-all to their needs it forward and the last time we saw miles Bridges and lamelo ball play together they were both going off and Miles Bridges was really starting to ascend  to become a really good fantasy basketball player so  I mean I think if he's still sitting on your way for you pick him up  you see what happens I don't I don't know how he doesn't go off I mean he's got a lot  he's got a lot of a lot of work to do to get back in the good graces of a lot of people so I I kind of think he's gonna come out go off  so Terry Rozier is out as well doc as you know and that will create more shots more point of availability for Miles Bridges so up me one second here  sorry guys still dealing with some after effects of an illness doc look uh  I'm kind of I'm kind of in a stay-away Zone here because I think temporarily he may be able to get busy a little bit although we could have some Rust that we've got to knock off he hasn't played in the NBA in a long long time and eventually Rozier is going to be healthy hey what's going to be healthy and then they're going to audition him before they trade him and you've got Brandon Miller of course you got PJ Washington so we're kind of crowded here and I don't know he was 20.7 rebounds and three assists with other goodies in that popular a couple of years ago and I'm not sure he can get all the way back up to their but I do understand you being you know optimistic about him in that kind of thing and I'm not going to rain on that parade it's just I don't know I'm just not really feeling it man I'm not um let's talk RJ Barrett here doc a it's Rick Camilla and Steve Alexander acha doctorate the Rotoworld fantasy basketball podcast RJ Barrett is having a career year doc career high numbers in points 22.6 assists 3.1 across the board with the shooting splits 49.50 85 all career highs he has missed four games okay including last night's win at Atlanta which was the first win this year for the next without RJ Barrett then a one in three without him so he's been a very critical player for them missed the last two games of the migraine and doc I don't believe those percentages are going to hold up right I don't it's gonna shoot 50% from three for the season but he's off to a great start he's got my attention um I do have him in a couple of weeks here and I'm not typically a Barrett guy right very low in rebounds assist blocks and steals that's an issue for me um but he's young he's got upside he's hitting this threes and I don't know I'm kind of hoping for more  in the rebounds is this block steals probably few to leave but he's still a young guy I don't feel like the puzzle is totally complete on him yep but where you at with RJ Barrett  well it's really interesting I got a male bag question about him for the little wire mail bag calling that just went up  on the side of a few minutes ago and started looking at it and really the only big difference between last year and this year is a 5% jump and his field goal percentage and a 3-point jumping is scoring um the rest of it is all not that different and  last year he's like 25th round fantasy player right now he's like five or five or six  round five or six so for for just a bump and field goal percentage to have that big of an impact on where these rankings put people in the way the algorithms work  again I think you have to take everything with a grain of salt and like you said  regardless of how well he shooting it or how many points you score and he's still not going to get you rebound she's still not going to get you assist the numbers are going to come down a little bit but the fact that he  is adding value to a fantasy team right now is supposed to  dragging you down last year is something and the fact that the Knicks are winning when he's in there like you said he's young guy still developing he still learning it's a step in the right direction for sure and I think it's kind of cool that you know if you've got RJ Barrett on your roster this year you don't have to ask yourself why good point and good line um he's averaging 22.6 per game this is not waiver wire stuff he's got to be on a team and he's like some other categories but 22.6 points per game is too high the scoring average to be on waivers so he is on waivers and he it depends like like I said in a waiver Rich League I'm in one of those leagues bear can pop up on waivers he's almost like a high-end streamer in this league I'm currently rostering him but he's in my outspot because of the last two games being missed now I want to tee up without any intro at all on balali the rookie out of France played with Wendy last year with the Washington Wizards go tell me about it I love him I had him in my ESPN column yesterday as a one of those on the stream team for yesterday he's played very well in four or five straight games  he the Wizards are awful they have nothing to play for kulae is fun I think the fans in Washington are really getting me high in the fantasy Community is figuring him out he still very available in both Yahoo and ESPN and I mean the steals the defense there's three there's some blocks there's some rebounds there's some points lots of minutes I just think I just think it's time to get this kid on your team's name is below cool about Ali A lot of people have heard of him or at least hadn't told a couple weeks ago so I I'm picking him up everywhere he's got a dope name belali totally cool name um guys this is top 10 pick Washington is heavily invested in Bilal he has to play in a tank year for this downtrodden team doc here are some numbers on below because I'm with you I'm totally with you on this um last four games he's been 10 plus points in each game he's been 28 plus minutes in four of the last five great source for steals in threes he's averaging two plus threes and one plus deals over his last five games and this is with you know like good minutes not great minutes um and since we're on the topic of the Wizards here for a minute  I am so disappointed in tyus Jones and Jordan Poole Doc and I are in this league called 30 deep doc helped created way back in the day 30 teams and they're all industry people okay this is a badass heavily competitive league like this is an example of how competitive this league is okay so I'm watching the Grizzlies Lakers game the other night and I see Marcus Smart down in a heap he blew a tire right and I'm like who is this Gilyard guy right don't even really know who the hell he is like this Keon Ellis guy was Sacramento who is he why is he and David Mitchell's wife's weird right anyway this Gilyard guy from Memphis okay I go to waivers in 30p I'm like he's definitely got to be out there right thinking all right smarts out Jaws out roses out you know maybe we get some goodies here he's already on a team in a 30 Team league okay so I have tyus Jones in the 30k and I drafted him I didn't like go big on him but I drafted I don't know doc forth or 5th round right like he was supposed to be one of my look I saw  16 17 points six or seven assists probably a couple of Threes per game probably right around 1.1 steal something like that maybe not the best efficiency were on a bad team here but like good points good assist good steals good threes right doc he has been awful last night Ty's Jones 123 and 2 in 22 minutes and that's the problem and I think your boy below Kula Bali is pinching on the minutes here for tyus Jones Delon Wright was before he got injured and so the ties Joe we talked about Jordan Poole and what a disaster this has been for him okay but to me Ty is Jones has been as big if not a bigger disappointment and even Jordan Poole they're both incredibly disappointing and I just stuff floating around today on the web about Jordan Cool goofing around during a timeout not paying attention to the coach and there's reasons that Draymond Green punch him in the face and he's poisoned the team like yeah I just thought he was going to get to Washington and be like okay I can be the man here I'm gonna be the man and he just he's been terrible and then tyus Jones same thing I mean I thought we were getting a Super Value pick at point guard advertise Jones and we're just not like and cool about it I think  like everything is wrong with those two guys is everything that's right with cool about it cool about always roster did 7.5% of ESPN leagues right now which means you go get him in almost every League I looked it up all so RJ Barrett is a 68% at Yahoo so they're I mean they're leagues out there were RJ Barrett is just sitting there  Rick

indeed it's Rick Hamlet it's Steve Alexander acha Dre on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast how much staying power does Skylar maze have the shooting guard who's now the point guard of the Blazers because brogden's out scoot is out and Anfernee Simons is out and Chauncey Billups is their coach and can't play anymore um doc I just dropped Skylar Mays this morning again in this it's an eight man keeper league and it's a weird setup but what the hell I like keeper on Dynasty League's I don't like just regular redraft leagues anymore they bore the hell out of me um  and so I had Skylar Mays I benched him last night for quickly because I wanted some three scholar mazes in threes okay that's a problem for me at a small position you got it three give me one a game he's not even doing that not even close he's at zero point seven threes zero point seven blocks 0.3 steals over the last week which is for games guys that's fantasy gold that's the stuff you win with and so he's going 11 points 3 rebounds 9 assists the assists are really the only difference making category here from Skylar Mays but if you're not giving me fantasy gold it's no bueno and I really can't do business with you so I dropped them this morning for Dario Sarge again this is a waiver Rich League not a super deep League um but where you got here with Skylar Mae stock are you rostering him are you holding on to him where you at  I wish my internet was working a little more slowly than it is right now I don't know if this video sucking up all the bandwidth and I can't do anything here I think Skylander maze hit two three-pointers last night if I'm not mistaken and I think that was part of my underdog win possibly I don't know I just know he's going to get a ton of minutes I like to double doubles he put up when he first got out there I like his aggressiveness watched him play a lot he takes it to the rack I think Steals and threes might be coming if they're not there already and I I just think there's gonna be so much opportunity for Skylar Mays to run this thing for a long-term that you know I get what you're saying you're in a 1808 no it's a no no it's an eight keeper league so I shouldn't even said it that way I think it's a 12 team league but but it's so weird League doc it goes you start pgsg SFP up and see that's you start five guys and then you've got five bench spots and then you got some injured spots so um it's it's it's kind of a cool setup it's different I'd like to have some utils out there right so you can kind of Stack either small or stack  big and go that way but it's a five-star league but it's a 12 team League okay but regardless he's played 30 minutes 30 plus minutes and four straight games two of those games he was awesome the shooting was great he didn't hit any threes but he was shooting me shot six of them in the first two games and the double digits in points in assists the last two games he hit seven of 21 shots that's 30% that's not great hit a couple of Threes last night averaging like I don't know 7 points and seven assists in those games so  he's one word good game from turning this whole thing around we've had two good ones too bad ones I love Skylar Mays I'm in I'm in for Long Haul I think he's gonna I think he's gonna be um one of those guys we look back on is like he's one to pick up some of the pickups of the early season  okay I am I'm rostering Skylar in the cam Dynasty our Dynasty League it's a 14 team or I am still rostering him in that League um but I got some guys that are hurt right now so when Brogdon gets healthy like I'm just gonna cut bait to me Skylar maze is a temp um if you're in a deep league and you got maze keep them okay but if you're in a waiver Rich league and you know like it's a light night tonight you need to go for a search or a pajam ski because they're playing tonight I would say go ahead and drop Skylar Mays for one of those guys so me and Docker a different streets here when it comes to Skyler maze now let's talk Clippers doc okay and this will merge fantasy and reality a little bit how much are Kawhi Leonard and Paul George and Julian the system as in James Harden saying I'm the system which is garbage he was the system in Houston he hasn't been the he hasn't been the system in a while okay what a joke um he's so delusional he's so arrogant he's so narcissistic and he's such a choke artist um but Paul George has expressed frustration on the court and in post-game pressers koi Leonard left  the locker room after the lab after the loss at Denver without speaking to reporters Russell Westbrook didn't sound about the hardened edition when it first happened there's no love fest going on here um I have a prediction for you doc they are a game or two away from bringing Russell Westbrook Off the Bench I believe Tyler with the losses keep coming coaches get to a part with like I gotta make a move I just gotta shake it up what we're doing isn't working so if you've got Russell Westbrook brace yourself for a benching I believe it's coming and I do not believe his benching is going to go as well as Austin Reeves has with the Lakers because reasons numbers have taken off as a bench player I don't think that's gonna happen with Russ um George is still having big games right he had a big game at Denver the other night including the wedgie on the game tying potential shot there but hard and quiet in Westbrook are all kind of canceling each other out right now their numbers are always down and Steve I told Steve Ballmer not to do this I told your boy  Steve Ballmer I know your buddy is with this billionaire I told Boomer not to do this on NBA radio and probably hear as well doc um but he did it anyway okay you're owing six with Harden on your team Owen 5 with him on the floor I hate to say it DOC but I told Steve Ballmer so  well and  we all know going in this is gonna be an interesting scientific experiment something on Twitter about  some Harding out Madden through a chair that may have  may have bumped into one of the other stars on the team and made them mad I don't know if that's that could totally be made up I have no idea  all I know is that on ball sacks Sports I don't know okay is that where you saw that I don't know where that was but all I know what I do know is those guys have got to be like why is hardened here we haven't won a game since he's been here  Paul George has had two like really miserable games with hardened around Kauai disappeared in the last one  I mean I can't imagine that any of them are having fun and just having the Persona of James Harden there and like you said out of touch with reality in the premadonna and the attitude and I am the system like it must be so awkward to be in that awkward in that locker room right now they should call the awkward room and so the locker locker room  I like that we got jokes here for you here on the road our family it was decent man it was decentral I stumbled all over it I  look for me the Los Angeles Clippers who by the way I believe they're going to take an L tomorrow night in an in-season Tournament game at home against the Rockets oh the Rockets have won six straight games the Rockets are really fun and they're starting right I mean and it's there's some cool stuff going on the Pacers write my Pacers doc I had them in the playoffs before the season began uh I mean I was wrong about some stuff but I I was high on the Pacers man and I'm they're my Pacers they're my Plucky little little team that could Pacers man I'm digging what they're doing for sure um my my bold prediction for ESPN was it the pace is going to win the east  what are you serious it was bold they wanted bold I gave him bold but yeah I've been I'm I like to I like to make that the boy  my boy um the Pacers are so freaking deep that they just bought out Daniel Tyson he'll be a Clipper I said Jackson who's a shop blocking monster can't get on the floor unless Jalen Smith is injured um jerus Walker a top 10 pick doc I don't think he's played a minute this year maybe a couple in garbage time and then Jordan and Laura is a good player can't find any burn for him and then you have like the layers of starter's and second unit right the Pacers are deep and talented and well-constructed with vets and young dudes and that guy freaking Halliburton man hole I mean I almost want to cuss about it I'm so excited about Tyrese Halliburton like I'll say holy cow okay instead of something else but we're talking about 25 points almost 13 assists he's leading the league in assists by like two and a half over Trey young actually after last night pardon me that might have changed a little bit but  doc Tyreese Halliburton is not going on the door of top 10 players status in this league he is not going on the door of an MVP candidate right now that's how dang good this guy is been given it to Joel and beat the other night and that went at Philly remember the scoop shot against him that was cool it has stepped back three um the clinch the wind Tyreese Halliburton is taking over the league right now Doc  yeah and I mean we knew this was coming when he was going three four five six in fantasy drafts I mean that tells you you know people who pay attention to numbers and and know what's going on saw this coming and I still can't believe the Kings gave him up but the Kings you know they had to get rid of him to let the air and fox be the air and fox and the air and fox has been fun and the big man Simon is playing well for the Kings the Kings have turned the corner the Pacers are turning the corner so at first I thought it looked like a big win for the pace but it's kind of a win for both organizations I love Tyrese Albert know I mean he fits so well in Indiana I think he's made a home there fans loved him and he seen the seemingly can't do anything wrong right now and I do feel like like Halliburton and Anthony Edwards are are both just about ready to take over the entirely yeah SJ as well and obviously that party got started last year but these guys are amazing man all right doc let's go to the streets let's check out

arena speaking of rival challenges Rick I know you have a new topic but how disappointing was  Chet versus Wendy the air tonight it was a big let down for me  sad  why I mean they let down they let down the president of the big man Alliance Shaquille O'Neal Shaq calls himself yeah I think he does this too right the president of the big man Alliance I love all Shaq's the best man  Shaq was  like he was like a disappointed dad  after that game that because I don't usually watch I mean those are my guys right but I don't usually watch pre-games and in bridges between games but for some reason I had that on  and and Jack was what was me about Wendy and chat any brought up a great point they don't guard each other die is that Collins is the five for San Antonio Chet's the five for okay he's he's there banging against each other occasionally on a switch you'll get women Beyond shed but it's very few and far between man and both guys did not have good games it was an awful Dreadful basketball game oh when when it was announced the Trey Jones and killed in Johnson were out I was like San Antonio's got no shot in this basketball game tonight and I felt like San Antonio played like they had no shot in that game they were a lifeless carcass of a basketball team  agree all right move on what we got  all right let's go to the streets here oh and let's go let's go back to the beginning here um do I drop but hold on second what let's pull this one up okay Mr a says so we got docket and we got mystery how about that we got do I drop Rockton for keonte that's a good question this is a good question why would you have to drop Malcolm Brogden as my question he's been out long enough he just recently in the Yahoo leaks had the i&j put next to us as opposed to the queue and then the O when he doesn't play all right now he's in jail we can move into the i&j spot and just stash them so to me this is not a drop situation with Malcolm Brogden and hell yes giddy up on keyonte George where are you at with this doc  well if he's asking about dropping Brogden he probably can't put him on the IR so if you're a situation where you don't have an IR  and you're just eating Brogden games I mean Brogden is going to be out a while right I don't like we're gonna see Brogden for several weeks and keonte is on fire I want you know I went from me and like who is Beyonce to why is there a hyped about keonte to oh this is intriguing to I need this guy on my team because like was that last Tuesday or last Thursday we were doing this and that was the day that keonte started like like right when we were getting ready to talk about him so uh yeah I'm all in on keonte if you have to drop Brogden I think you do it I I hate it I don't want to drop him but you may have to um I agree with that and think of the thing with Brockton is his value is it coincides with Scoot and Simon's being out so when they come back Brogdon will come off the bench he'll be more in the  15 for in five range is supposed to the 20 you know five and six range or something like that without those guys so if you have to drop Brockton all right then go get keontae George um 20 Team league here in this is aeon doc let's pull this up give Eon some love 20 Team league got Dre 10 cats with Tex should I trade him um your league Awards text okay that's a hockey like penalty minute thing weird unusual um should I trade him I mean that green right now he doesn't get that he doesn't get that many texts does he I mean dang the last two of the last three games he's been ejected so yeah you're banging right now but  I doc I gotta be honest okay  I invented this sport this thing that we're talking about a tech League you give this man advice I don't have advice on a league that has technical fouls I've never done illegal like that we are in the weeds right now man  yeah I don't know it's 20 it's 20 teams and they give credit for detectives I I'm just hanging on it I'm hanging on the dream on in that in that scenario  20 Team league too man all right with Dachshund Alexis right there the heady heady analysis here on a technical foul League you'll learn something you learn something new every day um ion also says um is is aeon takes us out of The Twilight Zone and back here to reality thinking about trading him for keyonte George or Bilal coola Bali who in the hell would trade keonte Georgia Bulldog cool about for Draymond Green okay like again are the technical fouls from Draymond Green literally like a Difference Maker between winning and losing for your team every week like is it like that so um but I would trade dream on green to get into either of those players absolutely  yeah I mean  to the technical foul league is funny like Brian Rosen we're so and I have talked about years like starting just the weirdest Fantasy Basketball League ever and only do like per minute and like all the stuff that like only offensive rebounds count only it's fine like weird stuff and just have just the most bizarre fantasy we can't it sounds like eons ahead of us though he's already there  good for you you're in a different League here man um and I'm not saying I wouldn't plan a tech League I just think it's unusual and that's fine but he on thanks for watching us here on the road of wire fantasy basketball podcast and thanks for the questions and good luck to you my friend alright we've got fantasy Hoops Noob who says thoughts on Jabari Smith and tari Eason don't go first on this one man well answer this in the mail bag from fantasy Hoops dude it's exact same question it's on road to wire right now  like I said in the in the reply you've already Smith was a number three pick for them tari Eason was like 17 ish I believe Jamari Smith is getting 25 minutes game Tyson's getting like 17 I think all of the focus is let's develop jari Smith he's more important to us at I just think I don't really know what the question is here but if you're trying to decide which one of these guys is gonna have the bigger future in Houston I think it's Jabari Smith  I love them both okay but Tara Eason is planted on the bench barring an injury they're they're starting five is Ironclad and it's working Shen goon Jabari Brooks and green and Van Vliet um frankly it's it's one of the better starting fives in the league I love the blend of athleticism and grit and old and young and shot making and defense and they really cover all the bases here guys  Jabari Smith is in a bad spot he is in a hard spot to develop here now that they went out and got email docket and Dillon Brooks and Fred vanvleet and Jeff Green okay because they're playing and they want to win and that's all bad news for Jabari Smith Jabari Smith needs to be on a ass rotten team where he can play 30 to 35 minutes to get a ton of shots blah blah blah that ain't gonna happen guys what you're getting from Jabari Smith right now is what you're going to get from Jabari Smith barring God forbid an injury to one of these guys and Tori Eason I love him okay I think tari Eason has a chance to be a star in this league okay like like 22 points a game goodies he's a really good defensive player he makes three he's a high-energy athletic guy I love tari Eason and he's planted to the bench and I'm in Thompson is going to come back and be off of that bench I know this Houston thing is nice man I'm really liking what Houston has going on but those are our thoughts there on Jabari Smith  and tari Eason now let's get one more in here doc let's go to mall lapis and Paul says Beal should I be worried  it's mall right Mall  mall you shouldn't be worried you should be hitting Defcon one okay boom where's the panic button I'm punching it I'm pouncing on it okay got doc you already know this man I mean think about this bill was reported by Shawn sharania to be playing last night with book with the rant the big three here we go the whole thing right and then we get the news from Sean's that Bradley Beal is not going to play and we're gonna have to push off the debut of the big three again um I am so upset with Bradley Beal right now um I have them on the on my cam Dynasty team  I feel like I've got a carcinogen I'm like basketball team right now like I please somebody for the love of God come get Bradley Beal off of my team I tried to trade him I did I went all the holy and I did not ask for all that much nobody biting I mean nobody biting even our boy Eric Seitz who is a season ticket holder for the Phoenix Suns and footprint Center didn't want anything to do with Bradley Beal and I knew at that point I was screwed and you can't drop him he's too good right you can't trade them you're stuck with him that's where rabbit Bradley Beal mall that's where we're at Andy's walking around with one leg and now you know he's got a back problem and his backpack acted up again yesterday that's why he didn't play in that game you know his next leg injury is just around the corner like it's and now he's and also like the whole thing about Bradley Beals game was he was the guy in Washington he was the man 30 points a game and back to back here's now he's literally like the third or fourth best player  on his team and I just don't who would be better than him why is he just their third best player who would be the third finding August 3rd gonna put Grayson Allen over Bradley Beals every time this point is more valuable to the son he's been really good I got to give that he's a dirty ass cheap player but he's been really good for Phoenix hey you know they're sharp game last night have Eric sites ranked his sons and I bet you feel it was not number three my man Doc it's always a blast hanging out with you here on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast man anything else you want to tell the people before we sign off no I think I'm good I was hoping we would have time to get into the in-season tournament all right we we do tell him a spiel about the in season tournament what you guys are my buddy Jeff Snyder who I've played in a fantasy league with since 1990  three somewhere in there and he was like man I love this in season tournament a little text threaded for our family group and I was like I think it's kind of dumb he's like why do you what do you have to be a downer about something that I enjoy and I'm like well that's not that I it's people Joyce Dr Ray I am Joy I was like I just don't think most people care about it I don't even most people understand what this cool play is I don't think most people care and he's like well I'm really into it because the Pacers are too annoyed and as I said there it is I go what is the Pacers were owing to I don't think you'd give a rats you know what about in season tournament if you're team was not too no because he's a huge Pacers guy loves the Pacers like you and I like to Pacers um but different like he loves the team whether there's money or fantasy or anything but he just loves the Pacers I'm more of a guy a guy like I love players and I don't really like your Timberwolves guy I'm a hawks guy but  I don't care as much as I used to about the team I care about players and therefore the NCAA tournament to me personally doesn't mean that much but if you love the Utah Jazz and they're doing well in the tournament go watch it have fun get into it enjoy  I like it um I like some of the courts I hate some of the courts Utah's court with the pastel purple flush the Bulls court with the red on red on red on red flush um really like Phillies score with the blue and red contrast really like Boston's Court the Lakers court the Buck's Court um the Pelicans Court Luca complained about it I loved it it was psychedelic it reminded me of like a dead show back in the day I dug it man it like took my like took me to into a like a mini basketball hallucination or something I don't know I dug it look doc I understand what you're saying and I understand people like waiting and seeing on it and walking into it not running in on it um you know I mean I personally work for the league here okay I'm with NBA Radio obviously we're very tied in with the National Basketball Association I worked at MBA TV for 17 years so I've been a league guy for a long time here and blessed and privileged to be able to say that and live that life so I'm very I'm very Plus on it I'm very Pro on it but I do understand people like waiting and seeing on it and stuff like that um I like the debates that it's generated you know what the chords and is it gonna work and frankly is an MBA journalist it's awesome doc because these are look it we don't want to be too quick to jump to conclusions about stuff right so it makes it hard to talk about the league every day in a spicy entertaining way so it just gives us one more thing to talk about one more thing to get geeked about one more thing to sell to the people um and so I as a broadcaster and NBA broadcaster I'm really really enjoying it man  um and that's not just you know sort of the you know the employer employee kind of thing I mean I'm watching all these games man and like I'm watching them on nights when it's not an in season tournament night doc but um I don't know I'm digging it man I'm having fun with it I'm looking at it like glass half full not glass FM well and I'm not even looking at glass half empty I just think a lot of people don't care but there are people that do love it and that was the goal of the league I mean the league the NBA doesn't want people thinking the NBA starts on Christmas day which correct you know and this is in a way going to help that and also I think it's gonna be different I think once pool play is over and we've got the teams that advanced and then we have more of a we can set up brackets you can probably do more betting on it make it more interactive right I think once the playoff portion of against here it's gonna be more it's gonna be more fun  and for those that you know I'll just let you know real quick 30 teams all competing in group play there are six groups there will be six group winners and then there will be one wild card from the East one wild card from the West to make up the eighteen quarter-final and that will be single elimination knockout up from that point forward with the final four being in Las Vegas so um I'm fair to partly geeked about it I really am but maybe I have to be anyway for Steve Alexander acha doctor a and her whole crew here wrote a wire I am Rick Hamlin thank you guys so much for watching and listening and making your comments we'll see you next Thursday at 11 a.m. eastern time right here on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast bye
