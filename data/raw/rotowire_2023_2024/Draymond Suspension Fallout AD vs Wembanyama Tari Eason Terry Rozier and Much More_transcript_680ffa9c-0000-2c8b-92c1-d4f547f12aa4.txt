hey we're doing it live it is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast today is Thursday December 14th I'm doc that's Rick we are getting ready to talk about fantasy hoops and a guy named wimby went nuts last night  right after the sweet sweet  jam it is Rick Hamlin it is Steve Alexander acha doctor a worthy the ogs this is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast doc you had me absolutely cracking up through that hole open right there I love a doctorate called open um it's it's it's different man but you man how you doing dude let's get back to work here let's have some fun the people are already filing in here we got Clarence beaks we got a free key a lot we love you all man keep coming in here asking us questions we'll field those questions but how the hell are you dude well I'm Dr a cold open is a very special thing because I do absolutely no thinking about it or what I'm going to say until I'm actually live on the air so anything can actually happen in those and and they're usually yeah I don't know they're they're funny funny how you mean funny like funny haha  anyway Draymond Green is making noise I'm okay man my voice I did a little regiment get my voice in order for the show I've got at least 40 minutes in me so let's let's roll let's roll man let's roll all right let's start with this dream on thing let's at least touch on on Wendy and Davis even if it's I mean we can't offer you a lot of fantasy advice with these guys um they're both Sensational okay but maybe we can do an all about it a little bit but Draymond Green guy's been suspended indefinitely by the NBA for obviously clubbing nurture upside the Dome the other night with the closed hand with the with the Open Hand um you know another ruthless stupid senseless violent act by Draymond Green um it better be 20 games okay before they let him back in and let him out of the Penalty Box John Moran got 25 games for a second infraction Draymond Green has 487 in fractions okay he needs to sit in the Penalty Box for at least 20 games um I'm not saying he should never play again I'm not saying that he should miss the rest of the season although I wouldn't be mad at that ruling I would get it um but I'm tired of Draymond in this MMA bull crap doc I am not a fight game guy okay I used to be big into boxing with Tyson and Sugar Ray and Thomas Hearns and all those Legends man boxing doesn't do it for me anymore none of those other sports like we're we're stopping on a dude's face and he's bleeding out what are we doing here and it's in Vegas and there's hot he's everywhere like what are we freakin doing here man I don't get it anyway randomly is the 487 infractions the actual number or is that a guest guest it is okay it's a sarcastic number dude it might be accurate though it's actually not that far up I should have gone with like 1975 right that would have been like all right now you're just being funny wow docket actually thought that 487 might might be the actual number here of infractions by Draymond Green who knows if you include off the court stuff and who the hell knows but doc I wanted to get that off my chest um if you want to attack the suspended indefinitely thing you go down that road at all do it or we can spin it and talk about fantasy basketball beneficiaries of Draymond going bye-bye for a while  well and not only fantasy like let's count the ways this makes people's lives better all right Steve Kerr does not have to deal with Draymond Green for the next month or however long he's got to be he's got to be feeling good about that Steph Curry does not have to deal with your name on green or the distractions to come with it Zach Wiggum one of my best friends  texted me last night he's like Draymond Green out in definitely I can finally cut him and sleep at night so fantasy managers right they get to drop Draymond Green they feel better we get to watch The Warriors and get to see guys like Jonathan cuminga and our boy please go out there ball out now because draymond's not out there slowing down the offense and clogging up the middle and ruining our nights like everybody wins Rick literally everyone wins um I like to take and I like how you spun us around really the basketball Universe right there now Steve Kerr is all butt hurt and boohoo about this right I mean he is the Draymond Whisperer he is he is the the biggest to blame for the enabling of Draymond Green and the creation of this monster that we now have and and enabling that has been cosigned by the MBA let's remember people Draymond Green um  punch Jordan Poole and practice a punch that pulled didn't seek him and he sucker punched him okay the Warriors find him internally we still don't know that number they didn't suspend him the NBA could have suspended him that did not suspend him okay so the NBA is culpable here as well in terms of cosigning  I'm not saying the NBA wants this Behavior but the NBA should a bang on Draymond Green well before this indefinite suspension okay so I want to make a point here doc about you know some beneficiaries and stuff like that um Jonathan kaminga in Chris Paul okay uh specifically starting here with Chris Paul I traded him to Ken Crites the K train in the cam Dynasty and and that move is not gone my way I traded him because Draymond came off of the go bare suspension and I knew that Paul is not the same dude when Draymond is there they don't need as much from him okay uh wasn't in finishing lineups for the team and so is weird right so I traded him to Christ and and thinking to Dream On would be back and playing and Hubbell offense and all that kind of stuff that happened guys Chris Paul is now going to be the Hub of the offense okay I don't know if he's gonna start we'll find out tonight against the Clippers um but it doesn't matter he's going to play 30 plus minutes he's going to finish games okay like he did the other night in the who they played it was at Phoenix the other night it was the nurkic like he did the other night he was with the finishing group um and so I think Chris Paul Doc is gonna flirt with double doubles give you three four or five rebounds give you you know one to two steals um you know the three ball was a disaster in the first few weeks of the Season he's now got that dialed in um you know the middies where he comes off the screen and gets you going downhill and pulls back you know what that little fade away from the free throw line he's back in Rhythm on that and so I think Chris Paul's totally ready to go here and in Jonathan coming up doc I he's very light in the blocks and rebounds and drives me crazy because you're long and you're an athletic dude okay he's got a ramp up that part of his game but this is a guy that's going to flirt with 20 points every night here without Dream On yeah I think I think for me my my pickups is pajam ski for first and that means that this is what have you done for me lately that game that Draymond got thrown out of prezenty had a great game and a double-double score more than 20 points you know three weeks ago you were like time to pick up a jet ski and roll with him well now it officially I think is I think every single Warrior benefits from the absence of Draymond Green really from top to bottom but I like Jim he quite a bit I think who mingi we're finally gonna get to see kuminga play at least  and I'm with you he's big man stats are light he plays more like a shooting guard than a power forward  but he looks kind of like a power forward so I wish he was more aggressive and you used his body more and then I think Darius sorry homie is gonna is gonna get some run and all three of those guys all four everybody we've talked about I think is worth a look at least of their City on a wave of wire yeah the Chris Paul thing was maybe just food for thought right he's not on waivers um but if you have him I mean you you are going to you you've really stepped in not a pile but you stepped in a pot of gold here Chris Paul's going to be fantastic now just quickly here on Anthony Davis and Victor when Benn Jama and you know a lot of times in the NBA these days they hide players on defense you know for all the soft wussification stuff and we have switching rights we don't always get the point guard point guard matchup we want and all that okay well we got it last night Anthony Davis against women Jama and Victor is now the center for the San Antonio Spurs and they were playing against each other driving into each other fouling each other making shots over each other oh my God was that fun last night document add hit him with 37 points 10 rebounds and four steals when he went 30 points 13 rebounds and six blocks okay up when he hit a three  where's up my note here ah 104 to go um hit a step back three over Davis to make it a four-point game you know here we come and see that a chance to tie on a wimpy three that missed but doc that was the good stuff man um you know NBA TV should take that one you know their game of the day that they replay or the Marquee matchup or whatever that was entertaining delicious basketball dude yeah and you know I had wimby in a FanDuel lineup I think he had 70.6 points oh my God I also had Chianti George in that lineup he had minus two points because he went down with the ankle after just two turnovers at the beginning game Wendy was enough to overcome a minus two from one of my nine players to have me win money so oh wow I was pretty fired up I love wimby I drafted him everywhere he's on my 30 deep team he's on he's on my main rock and roll team he's on all my teams and  you know he's the first round him and Chef both are just balling out it's it's awesome to see  um  when he by the way did you see add go down with that ankle sprain  um yeah I did I did we know the ground like banging the court and look like  I can't believe he got up right well he look I will he's different okay this year he's different he's got this hip injury that's been going on a few weeks right he just talked about any tweeted it again the other night against Dallas he's playing through it um what you're watching here guys is competitive greatness what's your watching is the guy who's tired of the narrative around him and he wants to smash it in a million pieces this is the good stuff this stuff should be applauded right here we've got all these guys missing all of these games and I know Davis has been a huge part of that thing over the last few years but I mean doc obviously we followed about bouncing ball every night for every team um but the Lakers are a team that I don't miss a minute of games okay uh the Nuggets who else is on that list um the why my blanket on this so watch the Bucks every night to be honest same thing anyway um the Lakers are one of the Warriors right just to kind of watch the car crash every night anyway let's move on to some stuff here it's Rick Hamlet it's Steve Alexander Dr a right here with you guys on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast we are the ogs now Doc take us a little farther here on keyonte George you've been very hot on him I'm hanging in there for dear life in a keeper League I've wanted to drop him because I've got kind of a glut of a point guard and shooting for shooting guards and and I don't want to drop keaney and I still have it but now my and I've only got one IL spot in that League it's not my league it's somebody else's league but it's like a really the Wayward wires really rich in this league right they want to have that churn and  burn and so I may be sending keonte back to waivers unless you reel me in here and say no for the love of God don't do it  yeah I mean I'm not gonna do that I haven't even looked into the injury that much he is not traveling with the Jazz for their upcoming two game Road Trip report read that RotoWire blurb doctor write that includes Thursday with the Trailblazers and Saturday with the kings that is automatic  like this is crunch time you need these games this weekend Everybody Plays four times this week like you missed one game from keonte last night now you're going to miss two more that's that's a one game week and it was a bad it was a bad one game if you can afford to drop him the teams that play three times the rest of the way I picked up  Jabari  from  Portland Jabari oh I was like you picked up Jabari Smith what kind of league is that yeah Jabbar Walker from Portland Portland plays three times and I think the warriors were the other team that still has three games left this week I went to pick up some Warriors and they were all they were all gone man it that my wire has been picked clean but uh yeah I I think if he's out the next two games this week and you're trying to win a head-to-head matchup this week you dropping and you you move on I mean guys here's the thing uh I this is a very unusual League I'm talking about here okay we have a 10-man roster and we start Five Guys PG SG sfpf Center okay with no utils know you know forwards and guards it's very bare boned okay it's like an old school fantasy football league without PPR right okay so I joined this league and I'm currently cooking it um you know I've got Trey young and dear and fox I've got Jamal Murray I've got us our Thompson keyonte George Malcolm Brogden so you can see that I don't have room for all these guys and and now George I don't know like this is this is a tough one here right like what is Malcolm Brogden coming back to die you know what I'm saying Anthony Simons is there now she didn't sharp is cooking um am I going to get 28 minutes off the bench from Brockton doing his little his little line drive you know push set shot you know that little Brogden shot that he's got that's so good um you know order do I hang in there with keonte I it's a tough decision to make an underwater  bogged on our show with it but just to give people the idea here you're basically holding onto George just move them to your IELTS body or your IL plus spot keep it moving here but I have a different decision to kind of go with here on Colin Sexton somehow I was able to just pick them up and and one of my leagues I don't remember which one um and and I think he had 26 last night he is green lit here guys um you know Clarkson's on the shelf right now the Jazz are a team that's intake mode um their coaches spiraling out of control on the sidelines right now will hardy that's a joke by the way but I did see him pretty hot last night in that Nick game which by the way was a win for the Utah Jazz now Doc let's get to a cam vetted guy and I scooped him up in the cam Dynasty last night I dropped Isaiah Stewart for him and his name is tari Eason of the Houston Rockets okay I love Charlie Eason in the pre-draft process coming out I don't watch a lot of college basketball but watch highlight videos of these guys and I watched tari Eason I was like I love this guy the activity the length the shot the motor the IQ he is a 2N player email doca freaking loves him okay he's a first round pick so we got draft Capital which creates an anchor to submits okay um and over the last two games he's got 25 and 14 a block in a steel 33s the game before 18 and 14 two steals two threes he's a Fantasy gold guy um he's a three block steel guy all right and Rudy gayish all right for you old heads can go back remember how good of a fantasy player Ruby gay was Terry Easter reminds me of Rudy Gay he will jam it down your throat he will give you that dunk on he's grimy he'll get defensive stops and I love him Doc and the only concern I have here is I'm antonsen  who has missed the last game maybe the last two games I think he's got an illness and so he's gonna play but here's the thing Jalen green is unnoticed for email doca we seen the deployment or lack thereof we've seen the minutes we've seen the bad shooting lines from Jalen green email dokka ain't playing that he ain't playing that if you are not in the Foxhole fighting like hell every minute of every game I got somebody else that's gonna do that okay and so I'm all about Tara Eason Dynasty league for sure um I think Ken Crites might have dropped him I want to I want to actually look that up and I Love Ken and I'm like calling him out but I'm just like because I I did him a favor with the Chris Paul thing okay that was a bad trade for your boy it was and so if I find out the tar he was dropped by Kent's I'm gonna feel a little bit better about that currently grimy Chris Paul transaction right there I hope I just poached through the waiver wire Tori Easton from the great Kent crates but anyway doc I just want to long spiel right there I freaking loved this guy um and I think he's got staying power for the present and obviously the long-term future  well he was sort of the centerpiece of my male bag column today on RotoWire there's 10 questions in this chat room about tari Easton right now I didn't know you were going to talk about Tyson I just threw up a tarry Easton question from dump force and he just so happened that you talking about Taurus and now what I love about this question from doug force is I'm doing everything I can to get tari Eason and I started Thompson on my team right now so how do you decide which one of those two guys you want I think I'm going with All-Star I mean just because Detroit Detroit rotation is not as deep as Houston's auster there they have nothing to play for in Detroit there's no reason Thompson shouldn't just go off so I think he's got an easier route to Fantasy goodness but tari Eason his last two games 25 points 14 rebounds 18 points 14 rebounds but before that it was three nine and six points the boards are there eight eight seven but he's really kind of blown up these last two games and like you said a man Thompson was not playing in those so  I'm with it I'm with you I love tari Eason I'm gonna try to pick him up where I can I'm not going to cut somebody great to do it and I would rather have all set our Thompson over Terry's so I agree with everything you said right there here's the thing guys all we need is 24 minutes a game from tar Eason so we need we don't need 30 minutes a game from this guy okay there are some players that are so wound up and so good um that that 24 minutes is going to ring the bell for us here are we going to get like you know the full expanse that we want no but he's gonna be legit for you look at his game log okay and I want you to look at every game where he plays 20 or more minutes all right because that's the model here fat line fat line fat line fat line and it might not be a fat line it might be like a 10 point eight rebound two assists one block one steal one three line right okay touch in the box score in a multitude of ways and then but we still have this upside here about email doca and you know how he's deploying guys and holding guys accountable I don't I think he's firm 24 minutes a game guys and I think he can help you um even in that regard now we talked about Oscar Thompson obviously doc we've made this very very clear here on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast I love amen and Oscar Thompson okay um I would be buying their basketball cards if I were in that thing and so I'm I'm head over heels in love with both of these basketball players and so yes if he's on waivers your league is weird um yes pick them up he was out of the starting lineup right and now he's back in the starting lineup and Monty Williams says the worst rotations in our league and has all year and and I don't anticipate that change but hopefully um he just keeps off our in that starting lineup which he should now Doc I know you want to talk about Ben math and here so what take us into this conversation well I have a question for you first Jalen green let's go back to him for a second  he's like 19th round Fantasy Valley right now  are you dropping Jalen green no no no no no no no no no his coach here could you drop Kaylee Greene I mean Benson  your team and what's on waivers but just blindly with an open canvas no hell no here's what's going on guys I we all know what's going on all right so let me let me address the elephant in the room here the Rockets good okay they're no longer can we cuss on here probably not they're no longer just don't just don't drop the big ones that they're no longer or they're no longer an issue team okay  think about it like Jalen green hot shot draft pick your team sucks you're gonna get all the shots all the freedom you want yeah you're gonna put up good numbers that in case this year guys they brought in Brooks they brought in Van Vleet they brought a new doca they brought in Jeff Green okay they're talking about through the papers bringing in another guy all right  this is not hey let's showcase Jalen green this is we're trying to win right now kick everybody's ass right now they're three and one against Denver this year guys okay email udoka does not care about Jalen Green's feelings he does not care this is not um a daycare this is not Pre-K okay emoto's playing tigers that are going to help him win period all right so Jalen green better get with that or his minutes are going to be weird and Doc what it's going to take is the defense event he's got a crank up the defense event and then the offense will come if Jalen green thinks he's going to get back in in his good graces by putting the ball in the hole he is so dead wrong okay he met is old I love email go I freaking love email what a Higher by the Rockettes man so anyway uh no I would not be dropping Jalen green definitely hang in there with him but he's in a weird spot all right talk to us about math well first gonna talk about Underdog

subscription and the positive bonus Rick you know I love the band pavement I had my boyfriend from pavement Optimus tanovich on the show on Tuesday  I mentioned Benedict Mathews name and he went nuts he's like oh my God I love math and so much that's my guy he's so awesome he's a Pacer fan he is kind of a Pacer fan yeah and patience and Grizzlies he likes uh but yeah he he was all about math and he went into this Soliloquy about how buddy hield is is not playing all that well and he's got that weird a weird place on the team where like I think Buddy hield knows the Pacers are going to be good and he needs to be there to contribute but he's also not happy about his role and Mathers a guy that's standing in buddy heels way so I just think math and I think you have 30 the other night he had he had decent game last night but Matthews just a guy that that I'm I'm pretty high on right now I'm really enjoyed watching him play and I think he's he's gonna be a pretty fun fantasy player for the next 10 years  all right so I agree with most of that doc you know I I'm a big Ben math or in fan packed 12 player of the year the guy is a liquid bucket okay and he is playing for Rick Carlisle  Needle on the record that's the buzzkill I love Rick Carlisle I'm buddies with Rick Carlisle I think he's an amazing coach um but he's he's old school he's a hard ass and no not anymore baby  not anymore I'm sorry about  dude they don't play defense  okay let me I understand  no he doesn't he he's fun right Carlile now Stacy it's a new guy we're not going to play defense we're just gonna go out and run with Tyrese Halliburton and Matthew and Milestone we're gonna run as fast as we can and outscore the other guy every night I don't care if they score 140 on us we're gonna score 150 on them it's like a different guy it's like he turned over a new Leaf I love this Rick Carlisle I used to you heard the story that shoe story where he tried to sell me his shoes treating me like yeah you mean to me in 1983 or whatever I don't care I love I love the new Rick Carlisle new and improved fund Rick Carlisle he's gone from me  you know grumpy like Thibodaux and old school to be in super fun like to do that 17 year old kid that coaches the Miami Dolphins  oh my god oh okay doc I mean I I like I like the ring I did um  and I like the Mike McDaniel reference I love my McDaniel I mean what  what is with those like sunglasses he's wearing they're like Elvis I it's so weird and so awesome all right now let's talk some real stuff here do you think will be topping is happy with the minutes he's playing this year yes or no  come on I don't know exactly the number of the answers no Obi topping needs to get paid over topping its 30s happy with his playing time this year no do you think Ben matheran is happy with his playing time this year  I  think Matthew  no he's not he's he's coming off the bench behind buddy hield right now there's no ways happy with this is neb heart happy with his minutes no um and so the point I'm making here this guy's aren't getting minutes seeing where else either he'll be topping played six minutes a game for the Knicks okay my point is they traded for him right and my point is Obi top and wants to play more minutes right and my point is that we want Obi topping to play more minutes so we can see what the hell we have here right  um Rick Carla has a super super deep team and he's trying to win and and if you are not like look let's look at it been matheran here the minute fluctuation because I've got the last five game fluctuation here he's 25 37 30 24 27 25 okay um the points have gone 16 9 20 30 40  pretty good my point is I love Ben matheran I don't love his role right now um they got to get buddy hield up and out of there okay they need to trade him to a contender that need shooting like the Lakers and and give Ben Max were in 30 to 35 minutes a game that so but he's not doing that right now that's why I say where Carl has a buzzkill for Fantasy because he's got to know his team he's too deep at every position and you know my guy Isaiah Jackson right I want to see Isaiah Jackson play it just like I said with dude before I just need to have to game for Isaiah Jackson 24 minutes a game I'm telling you this guy's flirting with double doubles and giving you three blocks a game in 24 minutes a game guys but Carla thank you and that out all right so I'm not I'm not as hot on Ben maths here let's go through some of our waiver wire picks here doc um and you know I you've got your list here I came up with a few extra guys so hit whoever you want to on your list right here sing a song for a doctorate on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast well I think I think how many how can this is not going away  you watch Miami play he looks like a leader out there looks like a veteran he's involved in everything they're doing and I was a little worried you know when they get fully healthy how because he's going to go away but I'm starting to think he's not going to go away and then Bilal cool abali for for the Wizards you know he's not he's not making noise he's not in the headlines but he's scoring a double figures every night he gets deals and Blocks he's  he's more helpful to fantasy teams right now the guys like Klay Thompson Andrew Wiggins and Jalen Green speaking to Andrew Wiggins  I don't even think Draymond leaving can help anyways so there you go have at it um you are absolutely hilarious Andrew Wiggins look I dropped him in the cam Dynasty for rui hachimura I was streaming last week to try to keep up with my opponent it worked to a degree I won the game five to three but I lost the two categories I was chasing points in threes it happens sometimes and I was like wow um I just dropped Andrew Wiggins for a streamer and my streaming Theory didn't even work that hurt um and then I keep watching these Warriors games and I'm like cam you're good bro don't worry about it sleep well at night this guy is a shell of his former self he is going through the motions and he got benched the other night right so that made me feel a little bit better about it what will be interesting Doc is if you goes back to waivers in the cam Dynasty and the decision I made there and I tell you what I ain't dropping Tara East and to get back into the intro Wiggins business I could tell you that right now so my way my waiver wire is set up here with Dante frickin' man Dante Exum he has been since  Sensational in these games without Kyrie Irving guys Kyrie Irving reportedly is in a boot and using crutches hello is that ringing any bells and Defcon ones for you guys it is for me doesn't surprise me Kyrie Irving is a game misser you can't rely on this guy he was on the dead to US list at the beginning of the Season you know Doc and I talked about guys we absolutely possibly will not draft I haven't had Kyrie Irving on a fantasy basketball team in a long long time  Dante accent the fourth quarter against the Lakers the other night should have been your cue where's my phone let me check the waiver wire in my league okay and if not do it now Dante some premium pickup blocks steals threes rebounds to say he is putting it all in the box score right now um Kayla Martin all right and when hero comes back and obviously we got the zip injury to Bam on a bio um it'll be really interesting to see what school does with Caleb Martin Jaime Hawkins and Duncan Robinson and Kyle Lowry when he's got his big three back and he's probably going to find it enough minutes for all these guys because he's badass but we've talked about Hopkins before I told you last week before whatever none of this guy's got staying power man he's got the anchor of being a first round draft pick I mean we all love the hot guys out of UCLA for your guy to the heat I mean give me a break dude it's a matte it's a basketball match made in heaven it's like competing Philadelphia it's a great match okay um but I really like with Caleb Martin's doing right now he had a kind of a Down last game I think that Charlotte game the other night but the previous games were packed with goody goodness okay Isaiah hartenstein if you're a little bit light and blocks maybe you lost Evan Mobley right and you're kind of dealing with out him from a minute go get hartenstein his lines are not going to wow you he's gonna be one or two blocks a game seven eight nine ten and maybe plus rebounds know three no steals is gonna score 7 points a game okay but he's just doing dirty work stuff and so if you need blocks you need rebounds and he's on waivers he's the guy and then we've talked about Ethan and comingo so and you kind of went through did you go through your whole drop list right here and you mentioned Duncan Robinson I've got Duncan Robinson on there too um as far as an ad I mean nothing wrong with his been fun Tyler hero coming back is gonna is gonna be interesting to see what happens getting the big the big three back together and Miami's not going to be easy though I mean when are we going to see bam out of Bio in Rick  like I it's he could have said no they said no time table so I enter December is on the table like bam said something recently I've never had this injury before so I don't know and that's concerning right because now he's gonna be in his head about this stock right and it's a hip so that you know like movements and twisting and all the reactive stuff it becomes very very difficult so I have no idea but it might be a minute here I mean they look the reports are there's no timetable for bam out of BIOS return that's not good  I also want to come in on Kyrie Irving  you know he had a foot problem coming into the season good point he's he's been doing a decent job of playing through it and being out there on most nights he's missed a few games but I was like okay he's he's trying like he's trying to make this work and then the play that he got hurt on dude he was sitting on the court with his feet his toes up in the air and Dwight how just fell directly onto his extended feet I like when I saw that happen if somebody if someone dropped you onto my feet like that I would be in crunch on crunches for like six months I probably be I'd be done my legs would be broke and I'd be done so and so I mean I get that he's hurt but he is hurt and that's why Dante Exum and in some extent JJ or Jalen Jaden Hardy is also a guy in a deeply that you want to think about guys I've got on my cut list right now that's a great point about Jaden Hardy by the way I want to cosine that I'm a big Jaden Hardy fan he's a bucket getter go ahead dude Marcus Smart with John Morant coming back and what Six Days Seven Days it's almost here baby I'm kind of fired up about the return of the job me too and JJJ well we were worried about Jaron Jackson Jr for a second dudes balling out and said  I've got this stock in cam on the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast shut up shut your mouth so Marcus Smart's already hurt he's already down he's on your injured list you just keep in there but I I don't I don't foresee him bringing a lot of fantasy goodness with John ramp back  Cole Anthony with markelle fultz on the verge of a return Anthony he's kind of in waning lately anyway he's had a couple games but he's also been all over the place you can't really rely on him I think it's time for him to go bye-bye  Kevin Durant Bradley Beal  we finally saw the big three along with Devin Booker last night for Phoenix Eric Gordon missed that game that was probably a mistake on his part because he may not get his role back I don't know what his role is going to be now that they're healthy so I'm I'm fine with dropping Gordon right now Derek Jones Junior bye bye Zach Collins is an interesting one Rick you mentioned that Wendy's the starting center now you did not mention that Zach Collins is coming off the bench here and I had like eight points and three rebounds this is a guy that I was counting on for like 15 points and nine boards every night and I don't think we're going to get that now that Wendy is taking over the entire world all right so let me take these one by one um you know you said it with Marcus Marcus just leave them on your injured spot I actually disagree I think Marcus Smart's going to be good with John Moran you know he'll do the 12.5 rebound I don't know five six assists it's a sis will come down from the Boston days he'll be at one and a half steals I believe and he'll probably one and a half threes I think Marcus Smart's gonna do what he does just kind of like he's not a waiver wire guys not a great fantasy players somewhere in that middle ground totally disagree on Cole Anthony I do not think he's a drop definitely hold him they just paid him he's guaranteed of minutes on this team he is arguably the best six-man in the game right now with Reeves and Nas Reed and who's the other guy Tim Hardaway Jr like that's kind of the cluster for six man of the year right now so I love you but it is agree with you on that Gordon I agree Derek Jones junior is hurt all the sudden I agree Zach Collins to me as a whole because Gregg Popovich is just literally throwing crap against the wall and hoping it sticks um I love Poppy's the greatest coach of all time in my opinion and he sucks this year with this team I shouldn't say it that way you know he doesn't suck I just don't think he's doing a good job coaching this team all right it's very unorganized we're changing lineups all the time we're always like resting dudes and basil Off the Bench I just don't like it okay Wendy's kind of just freelancing out there why don't we run offense through him like all the time I mean what the hell else you gonna do it's the developmental year this is basically a seasoned scrimmage us anyway off my soapbox Collins is a hold and so the the drops I have doc are Isaiah Stewart of the Pistons and I just don't know what the Piston seeing this guy and you look at it's like 10 points seven rebounds no defense at all it's giving you about 1.43 which from a PFC all right I mean that's kind of helpful there on the percentages are not good and it seems like the play and the production and the minutes are all kind of started to dip like because Monty Williams has taken about out of Jade Ivy he's taking a bite out of Killian Hayes he's taking a bot out of Oscar Thompson how dare you I mean he's taking a bite out of you know Jalen Duren to a degree a huge fight on a Bagley and why is man the one that you know Kate hunting Ham's good to go right but the all the only other guy that he didn't take a bite out of yet this year is I said Stewart and now he's starting to do that and so the other guy's Russell Westbrook um and I love Ross and I can't believe I'm telling you to drop arguably a Mount Rushmore guy for stack guys in the NBA and we're talking about LeBron yokich Wilt and probably Ross and I feel like I've got a name that's escaping me right now because you know and I this is an amount Rushmore that's talked about a lot but the Mount Rushmore stack guys all time in the NBA go catch has to be on that list Wilt obviously he's the goat of Stack guys okay the guy average 53 a year in scored 100 in a game look at hello 27/7 and 7 every game of his life and the most points all the time and then you were says the all-time triple double leader and all the amazing stats he's done averaging triple double four out of five years what anyway  take it from there doc but Russell Westbrook despite all of that glowing thing stop I said is a drop right now Oscar Robertson I think you were feeling Maybe  um he's right there he's right there man um Oscars right there it's a good call there's a good call there's a gentleman playing for the Denver Nuggets named Julian strawther  dude went off on what Monday night six threes five steals yeah that was the Hawks game I was watching that game he was everywhere that was amazing and then he played well the next the next night he's out of Gonzaga he's put up back-to-back good games he plays tonight I don't remember who Denver plays tonight but he plays tonight Rick I'm gonna be watching the first half of that game and Strother goes off I'm gonna pick him up I just feel like  Denver Denver  they could use some new blood in there I just think he's a good player you know if Michael Porter Jr would decide if he's going to score 30 or go one for 12 On Any Given night that would really help us all out I think um the the basketball world and then the outside you know the casuals got to look at that in the NBA Finals right I mean literally the Nuggets won the finals despite Michael Porter Jr he was not having a good run at that point and then obviously the playoffs he had some big-time games that kind of thing but Doc is right I mean he's on a yo-yo right he's on the great game horse horse bleep game yo-yo but I'm a big Julian strawther fan um he's not like a hot button pick up guy for me because Michael Malone is very hard on rookies but here's the thing that Michael Maloney needs to get over he's got a play Julian strawder half the game and just deal with the mistakes because their bench sucks all right there at the bottom and bench scoring or they're like 27th or something like that and in strawberries is a stud he's got a wetter he's active he's long documented the steals the other night and and Malone's got to get him up to speed for the playoffs you know the ball players tell me Doc when you're a rookie and you play a lot you're rookie year by the time you get to April and and in June met in June and that kind of thing you're not a rookie anymore right you've been through a season um I mean it's so it's obviously kind of a ball player phraseology here but you get the point he's got to get Julian strawther like that where when he gets to march in April he's like and nothing but a thing man whap right in your face you know late third one point game you know seating on the line against OKC or something like that and you're at okay see whap hit a big three time out thunder right nuggets on a 91 run something like that he's got to get strawberry up to that level and so I've drawn 30 deep Doc and he's just been chilling on my bench all year and I've got a Josh Green issue right now he's on the Shelf so I would love to put straw in the starting lineup for him and I depending on the results tonight and then over the weekend next week he'll probably be in my lineup you if you have stronger on 30 deep you're gonna be watching him closely tonight because if he makes it three games in a row tonight like that's my sign like okay it's time it's time to roll if he disappears and crawls back under a rock that's fine too Rick you answer a few questions oh absolutely I'm gonna start I'm gonna start and go ahead and you find your next one because you're not gonna be able to help with this one John Utterback wants to know what is my voice regimen when I woke up two hours ago I could not talk like  could not hear anything coming out of my voice I was wondering if I was gonna be able to do the show well I went to talk about I got me a burrito  covered that thing in Tabasco sauce I sucked it down drank a bunch of Gatorade  worked some things out and here we are baby I'm back thank you thank you talk about well I mean that's quite the plug right there really was um I I love me some Taco Bell I get cravings and I just gotta have it um all right so I'm glad we settled that and I'm glad Doc is feeling better he got the voice quality up and all that kind of stuff so let's go back where we going here let's go back to the beginning here what do we got here we got free key let's bring up his comment here what's up fellas fantasy heathens Bruce Brown shade and sharp or tari Eason gotta drop one in a nine cat Bruce Brown is your drop right there to me um he's he's a reality player he's not a fan he player to me I mean he has spiked games and if you're wondering about streaming Bruce Brown pick a big game okay pick a game against a rock star team and that's a game where Bruce brown rice to the occasion but gets tricky because we had that game last week Doc in the NCS and tournament guess what he had to guard Damian Lillard all night okay and that to  Stats so Bruce Brown would be the drop there for me yeah I think I already answered that in the chat and I was all Bruce Brown all day on that too side note about the Pacers dude Giannis dropped 64 on them last night like when when you're setting your FanDuel lineup and the Pacers are playing take everybody who's playing against the Pacers because they are going to torch them and the same goes with the Atlanta Hawks you want to play the big names against the Hawks and the big names against the Pacers because they are sieves they don't care they don't play the it's just all day did I say override your  question yeah you know what you know I'm gonna I'm gonna let you I'm gonna let you do it you are you you're on the question game here because yeah was setting up the next question but you do it you got no one I'm doing though Rick so uh who's the priority add with dream that's not the one I was looking to add what I just put up because I don't know what we're doing here well we can't we can't talk about this already it's not Biggins it is not Wiggins  for me it's pods  let's see here um  the priority ad for you it's well Chris Paul's already added for me yeah for me it's coming yeah because I think put Jim ski is is going to ebb and flow with the shooting of Klay Thompson we saw the other night Klay Thompson soft again and curl was like bye and he finished the game with pajam ski but if Clay's on a heater and he's having a 27 point game he's on a 913 and all this kind of stuff and he's going to be in there okay so I like poach and I think he's a pickup but with that question right there comingo would be the guy a yo-yo wants to know Derek white and Max struse for Pascal siakam  I wouldn't mind talking about Pascal siakam for a second why we're doing this why is that tough  that's tough um  oh man that's giving a name give me the name Rick  what do you mean  I went past I want past calcium I'll fill in the hole with somebody off the waiver make it work  I love yeah I'll rock with you I mean I'm gonna get the best player on a deal type of guy and I think she can maybe moved into a spot where he's more motivated and maybe more spotlighted um because I  could be a landing yeah it all though that would that would that would that would that would buzz kill me significantly because if they trade for Pascal shocked him Jalen Johnson  I do not want Pascal shock of traded to the Atlanta Hawks I will be severely bought her if Pasco see I can get straight into the Hawks just saying I want yeah come the Hawks I think the Hawks need a guy like see him and this guy's young Rockstar they got DeAndre Hunter and City Bay running about they got seat Bay and no DeAndre Hunter and City may get get out document you're my fire up another one here maestro  I agree with you by the way I'll package white in stroots to get into Paschal I will do that I will cosine you on that dude these are all questions about Camilla and Tori Eason it's crazy  okay here we go  how about  who to drop if Marcus Smart is active Brandon Miller tari Eason Malik Beasley or Max druze 14 teams  ah bees  bees bees be the drop there it is Ivory and it's not even it's not that close  I mean I'm not Tori Eason is his arrows pointing up Brandon Miller his he's too he's too  too much of an unknown too much upside to be throwing a throwing out and Max Drew says had some big games and he's got a big role in Cleveland I think I kind of like Beesley but Beezy will get you three points one night and 17 the next whatever what else we got here see we got one more and then we're going to be at 50 minute Mark we can get out oh here we go alright this is a good one trade Scary Terry  Terry Rozier while he's hot  what do you think  no  I'm a Terry Rozier guy hey guys what is lamelo ball coming back to play  I'll wait um hey who are the backup one and two on the Charlotte Hornets  I'll wait they got to have massive minutes and massive games for Terry Rozier just to literally have a competitive game in the fourth quarter I I am not a selling High here with Terror Rosie  I'm holding him I'm playing him I'm getting the goodies he's fantasy gold guy doc big steals big threes my guy  I am open to all discussions regarding Terry Rozier if I had him and somebody came to me and said hey what do you want for him I look at their roster and be like  I just looks good what about this I I agree like Terry Rozier is in the Premier spot he could possibly be in on any NBA team and on any NBA roster like he's in the spot he needs to be in like you said who are the backups there nobody knows nobody cares that team is one how many games how many games they won nobody cares nobody cares nobody cares that they win or lose like it's just Terry Rose your show out there and lamelo ball you know big baller not gonna see him for a minute  those shoes do some Wonders on those boys how those shoes work out I love him it's it's so sad I hope we're not going on basketball tragedy Boulevard here like we are with his brother Lonzo who I loved as well hey we're doing one more I lied  because this one's too good this is Admiral Nita  trade Michael Porter Jr  to get our guy 11 points a game  the weirdest dude in the NBA Jordan Poole  F know again like if we're bar stool I'm cussing around here like f know who wants anything to do with Jordan Poole right now arguably the worst contract in our sport no motor um all pouted up in Washington it's your team dude or at least he says it's his team which kusum is probably going uh it's not your freaking team dude it's my team anyway um and by the way he may be shut down here doc right for the last four or five weeks of the season is Washington tries to get better on the ping pong Race So ping pong ball race so yeah no no I'm holding I'm holding MPG Jordan Poole  last night  three of 12  oh for five Fourteen Points ties Jones your guy  your boy tasty ones 13 points six assists just awful man it's so bad also on a closing note  have you looked at the standings in the NBA lately what do you mean every day what is going on dude  the Orlando Magic are in second place so my boys watch yourself watch okay see Thunder from my boys  what is happening they're playing defense docked at the best defense in the league Rudy gobert took his head out of his you know what he's playing ball this year and cat is healthy it's cool I like seeing different teams up at the top and  uh definitely eye-opening when you look and see the rebuilding Orlando Magic up there see this Pacers team that I love so much up there got the mini timber wolves  with a two and a half game lead on the nuggets and everybody else  like 17 and 5 that's impressive we never talked about  well because we're fantasy guys but you're taking us into a reality combo here and I like it um the magic are the toughest team in the league okay Joe Ingles blue attire the other night came back in the game and played Paula Bank Carroll blue attire the other night came back and the game and played Jalen Suggs blew a tire last week looked really bad came back after missing like two games these guys are nails man nails they are tougher than your favorite team and your favorite players I promise you that they're the toughest team in the league okay I love the Orlando Magic they're playing defense they're balanced you've got these Rockstar forwards by the way the whole fultz thing Anthony black has to keep that starting job okay like let's not get it twisted they're not winning a championship this year folks on and expiring contract black is an awesome glue guy um who's just making all the puzzle piece is fit I don't I don't need more helpful is coming down hill on this team anymore you got so you got col Anthony he got these forwards Wendell Carter Junior somehow someway it's going to come back Goga Batavia by the way it's been a beast a low-key Beast for the Orlando Magic and they have arguably the best bench League I could go on and on and on and on and on and this is nothing to do with me being two hours away from Orlando okay I freaking love this magic team and I would be saying that if I was a Nova Scotia  hit the Subscribe button hit the like button go to rotowire.com
