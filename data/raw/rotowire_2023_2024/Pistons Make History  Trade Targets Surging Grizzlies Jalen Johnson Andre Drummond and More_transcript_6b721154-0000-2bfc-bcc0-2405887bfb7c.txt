my parents house but what yeah what part of the holiday very big of me I thought it a lot of ways to you know be the bigger person and not bet the NBA on Christmas Day  we got right back into it last night I had I had Moses Brown props going I had Jabari Walker props going you know got them in late had to had to really go heavy on that at that Portland Sacramento game last night  well that game delivered too so there were a bunch of Oddball names that you could have scored some wins on Via Underdog but I'm just shocked to hear that you're not betting on NBA Christmas it's like  I mean that it's it is akin to opening your stocking this is not I know this is part of the process I know look that's why people are trying to talk to you is the like that that's the art that we should perfect at this point look  it's on me all right I need to be better I have plenty of irons in the fire on the NFL action on Christmas Day I didn't feel like that too double down at this point but yeah we'll be back into it this week I'm not worried about that already got some things fired up for tonight no wrote a while NBA show by the way if you are listening to that I'm Serious XM NBA we're off this week we will be back starting after the new year but good to be back with you Brandon I know you were sick last week hopefully you're recovered I know you're still in the latter stages of that Illness but it's not pretty good to me uh yeah it took me out I have a four year old he brings home all sorts of nasty germs thankfully he got sick too he's all right and it's taken me tomorrow will be a full week since I got sick and I still don't feel like I'm at 100% but I'm close enough to talk some NBA Hoops so this is actually the first bit of like real on air work I've done since I got six so this feels good to get the juices going I got my cup of tea here I'm ready to talk some basketball I love it we're high energy you know normally we're doing this POD at like 9:30 a.m. my time so I gotta like made lines of coffee I got a really get into the Zone but doing this middle of the afternoon there's more bit more energy and yeah so we will be going for about 45 minutes here we got a heart out around 3:30 p.m. Eastern so keep that in mind if you're listening live and get those questions in if you have any fantasy questions you have any players you want us to talk about teams you know start Sid anything like that just throw those in the chat we will hit those over the second half of the podcast thanks to those who've chimed in already limbo boredom hello hello to you Paul hello glad to see you guys in the chat and again get those questions stacked up we'll hit those rapid fire style in the second half of the Pod random we're gonna talk Pistons we're not even gonna talk fantasy what it comes to Detroit because we had a record broken last night I was on on Sirius XM doing our football show with Jeff last night gotta be honest and a pretty tough time paying attention there were a couple times where he would ask me someone I'd be like wait what oh yeah sorry I'm glued to Nets pistons on league pass yeah this this is a tough one to stomach if it far from fantasy this is very much a reality that the Pistons are dealing with a league record 27 losses in a row and it just doesn't matter who they're going up against or even what their guys do the fact that Cade Cunningham was as dominant as he was last night dropping 41 points this man is doing everything he can to drag this team out of the doldrums and they just don't have a real NBA roster we like some of the names that are on this team we certainly like Cade Cunningham but man they have so much work to do and it starts up top I mean I blame the players partially for the losing streak that they've gone on but they're not the guys that put this team together that's the front office Monty Williams so I think his head should be on the chopping block here we fire coaches for a whole lot less than this and 27 losses in a row that's just tough to Summit heads need to roll well the problem is they paid module Williams like what almost 80 million dollars yeah it's one of the highest paid coaches in the league I think he's got to be the highest paid coach right with Monty Williams I'm just saying he should be part of the conversation he said like if you lose 27 in a row I think everything is on the table right I don't think there's anybody who is safe here maybe other than Kate Cunningham and I know there's there's been some chatter of look do they just go like full Mega reset and you know even trade Kate cutting ham which I don't think they would do you still on a rookie contract I think he's been good enough that you view him as a foundational piece and I don't know that he's necessarily complicit in this you know certainly he played one of his best if not maybe the best second half of his career last night trying to build them to a victory but really man I mean it's it's Kate you know having Jalen Duren back you know it's certainly helped them I think that's kind of their level they're not they're not just getting like completely housed every single night like they were a couple of weeks ago they've been more competitive but you know guys like Isaiah Stewart Jane Ivy they've been up and down you know the bench unit really for Detroit  that's what they get killed right you look at some of the starters like even Isaiah Stewart didn't play well last night he was still plus 12 you know Kate Cunningham + 5 Jayden Ivy plus 12 the bench unit every single night you know they they were up 22 to 8 last night in the early going they put up 31 points in the first quarter I mean it was basically a best case start by piston standards and then you bring in the you know Kevin Knox James Wiseman Alec Burks I'm Ben Thompson unit and those guys immediately blow the lead I mean that's that teams don't have depth we know that but I think that's really what separates this piston Steam from teams like you know Washington and Portland and Charlotte and San Antonio not that those teams have great depth but the Pistons are basically rolling out G League are coming off the bench  yeah I would I would throw back to those people that say oh you got to blow this thing up when you're already at Rock Bottom how do you bottom out I don't know understand what you could really do for me here this is a team that is still going to have it's not like they're spending a ton of money they'll probably trade bug zdanowicz but we've been saying that for a year I just don't understand what you can do other than make better decisions and that's not a bottoming out process they're going to have one of the top picks in the draft whether they trade a couple of their key pieces or not they've lost 27 in a row with the guys that are on the roster if they want to lose they're doing just fine at accomplishing that so I don't really see how hitting a reset on and already Rock Bottom roster is really going to help you here you gotta identify I think up he's two at the most and then just figure out how you can start to just to rebuild around those guys or if you're gonna trade Kay don't do it under the guise of we're blowing it up do it because you don't want to ruin this guy's career do it do it out of Charity it's the giving season let's find somewhere else for this guy to play basketball he is a treat and I know I think at this point do we all want to see the Pistons win are we in Arena agreement are we cheering for Detroit  we want to continue yeah I want to see a continued I don't I don't really have a whole lot of sympathy here I feel bad for Cade obviously but you know I think there's some hubris here with Detroit right I mean Detroit Weaver was talking pretty confidently about this roster this off season and I think I think they thought they were going to be way way better than they Bend and to be that that kind of adds to the comedy element here it's a good point to bring up though because you know they have this three game stretch and they've been staring it down for a couple weeks where it's like all right that you talk game felt like the one and obviously they love that one slip away everybody expected them to lose on Saturday in Brooklyn they did and then you know put forth a good effort but obviously couldn't get it done last night so they have the record I guess at this point I don't care if they win I just think if it's rare to have a team even in position to set a record like this so I wanted the next to win last night just because we were so close to history and it might be another like decade before we have another chance at this so the fact that the record has been set you know maybe I'll back off but I mean they play at Boston tomorrow they're not winning that game so that's gonna push the street to to what 28 after that Toronto used in at Utah maybe maybe at Golden State at Denver Sacramento and then they are home for the San Antonio Spurs January 10th so I think your circle in the Utah game your circling the San Antonio game as the possibilities they do play Washington in mid-January as well so I I don't I don't think this is a street that we're still talking about like at the end of January they're going to find an opportunity here that like I said they've been playing more competitive basketball over the last couple of weeks but man I mean this could this could easily stretch into the 30s I mean with this West Coast Road Trip coming up  yeah and I mean the Detroit Pistons now are you know they're etched in history with what they have lacked to accomplish here I think what we're looking at here is like a second wave of an in-season tournament where you don't want to be the team that they end up beating so every game they enter into is like a one and done tournament because you don't want to be the team that that allowed them to get that Victory and yeah you could you could look at the schedule say Utah to be the most likely we know how this works it's gonna end up being one of those teams like a golden state you know what are those teams that should I don't think Boston they're too fully formed but it'll be one of those teams that they're not supposed to be and the taking the that Squad down and it'll cause chaos within the room of whoever it is they defeat yeah you're right I mean I think with each loss it becomes increasingly more embarassing if you're the team you know it gets to them they they stop that streak I think it was day Ron Sharpe last night for the Nets who said that post game he's like yeah man obviously we did not want to lose this game he's like when I was out there like oh I think he said he was going 110% when he was on the court last night because you don't want to be the team that loses we'll talk about some other you know fantasy Fallout from these last couple of days obviously we had a robust Christmas Day slate we had a bunch of games last night as well  you know I made a critical error in one League Brandon I was at a funeral yesterday I was running around driving all over Wisconsin the last couple of days got to be honest was not like Mega locked in on my fantasy rosters getting everything in order before you know Monday's games so I kind of already missed my window  I did not start out Andre Drummond I did not get them in my lineup and Andre Drummond had the game last night 24 points 25 rebounds three steals two blocks even through an insist hit both of his free throws 11 of 13 from the field I feel like this is going to be the turning point in that League where I look back and say man if I had just started Andre Drummond during week 10 man I would have won the league but we're looking at a nice little window here for Andre Drummond do I guess I'm glad that I have him on a roster like he's somebody that is in deeper formats you know at this stage in his career like this is a 16 Team league you're never gonna feel great about rostering Andre Drummond am I get some Chuckles for people in your league when you go pick him up but you know these are the opportunities when Nicola boost Now set to miss some time where you know even these last few seasons when he's moved into this you know backup role he's playing like 12 minutes off the bench he still has games every now and then where he'll put up like 8 points 15 rebounds and like 14 minutes and kind of remind you that he's a permanent monster and the Bulls are saying Nicole the booster bitch out at least a week you know I think it was jams or was she said it could be seven to 10 days  we've already kind of been down this road was Zach LaVine this is a legitimate injury for boosted Edge I don't think they're just holding him out but for a team that you know it could go in any direction really as the trade deadline approaches you know I'm not saying you know grab Andre Drummond and start him the rest of the way but this could be a nice like two to three week window for drum and if this boost of each thing ends up being more than a week yeah specially if his matchups are his favorable as they were last night the Hawks aren't a team that's chock-full of size so he was able to get a bunch of easy rebounds and kind of rack up his stats doing that Andre Drummond it was awesome that it was able to turn back the clock toy that he was this is not a player that is in the thick of his prime when we when we saw Pistons Andre Drummond that was a guy that could do something like this like once a week he's old by the way so like statistically he might be in the thick of his prime well like he doesn't look like it you know like he feels like Andre Drummond's best days are behind him I saw the stat on sports center today that flashed the players in league history to that have the most 20.20 rebound games in their NBA careers and he's on a list of  names that are like Hakeem Olajuwon and Wilt Chamberlain and like those kind of guys by the way Sheila O'Neill was not Dwight Howard was on the list Sheila O'Neill oddly enough was not but Andre Drummond one of those guys so maybe he can give you this one more time but I'm not I'm not exactly sipping the the Andre Drummond Kool-Aid and we know that he's atrocious from the line too yeah yeah that's the thing I mean he doesn't take that many anymore thankfully but you know if you're throwing them out there in a weekly doing this hack a Drummond will become a thing again I know I know that's that's the that's the rub here I want to back up to Christmas Day Brandon and we give more shine to Jaime Hawkes than I would like to thank any other podcast in the the NBA space  my goodness man he keeps pouring it on no Jimmy Butler know what you lmb you know some of the luster had worn off of this this Sixers he showed down Miami ends up getting a 119 113 win but 31 and 10 for Hawkes with two Steals and an assist 11 of 15 from the field eight of eight at the free throw line I mean this is this is very quickly to me you know developing from oh you know fun story landed in the right spot we'll see how it turns out to like a guy that you absolutely have to be rostering and I know it you know Jimmy Butler being out of the lineup for the last three games that helps but he just played so well that even on a team that is so deep and has like three or four guys on the wing that you never really know what the roles are going to be I think he is he is locked down a major major spot in this rotation going forward and it's still feels like we haven't seen them fully formed because as soon as hero and out of Bio come back that Butler goes out and you know there's going to be some ups and downs for Hawkins but this is been incredible man like I was watching the highlights or watch part of the game and then watch the full hockey is you know YouTube highlights it doesn't make sense like it's almost it's almost Luca to me like here's a play like Dodges are not saying that but when you watch Luca you're like what is it about it like why is he able to get by guys he's not fast he's not quick like you just it just works and Hawkins has kind of that same like Mystique to his game  he does this is a guy that knows exactly the type of player that he needs to be in order to be successful he's incredibly efficient and in I do think even though it's been overused so much to this point already the fit is such a big factor in all of this because he really is the perfect Miami Heat player and this is a team right now where I'm gonna buy Jaime Hawkins stock because this is a team that's not exactly all that deep and you know you think of Miami as this team that always has this great bench look at some of the guys on roster this is not a deep Miami Heat team they lost a lot of pieces last year Caleb Martin has an exactly picked up where he left off in the postseason last year so I would expect this to continue for Jaime Hawkins and I think he can be a star in his role whatever that role might be for the Miami Heat moving forward yeah worth noting you know Cliff brings us up in the chat thanks Cliff that killed Martin did get banged up he is doubtful to play tomorrow night so that is that's something to monitor Robinson's on the injury report as well Jimmy Butler he's questionable we don't really know when he's going to be back in the mix but that's that's the thing with Miami and you know part of the reason that I you know in during draft season at least like kind of stayed away from a lot of those debt pieces for the heat was it was just like I don't know I'll just gonna work out like are they each gonna play like 18 to 22 minutes it's gonna be really frustrating but it's actually kind of been a gold mine for Fantasy because one of these guys at least one is always injured and you know feels like if you're if you're riding the hot hand at the right time you're kind of getting a free ticket to like 30 to 35 minutes at night and that's what it's been lately for High may Hopkins yeah we'll get to some questions in the chat in a bit thanks everybody for chiming in there keep those coming we'll go rapid fire through those questions over the second half of the podcast Brandon we we saw your team in action last night the or Lando magic taking care of business on the road at Washington or Orlando now 18 and 11 on the year nice night for Franz Wagner nice night for Alabama Carol both of those guys have been carrying this team  so Anthony black you know have I would say arguably the best game of his career pretty clearly statistically last night 23 points 6 boards for steals did a five turnovers but nine of 13 from the field four of six from three thoughts there I I just assumed you know we're going to get a decent amount of questions on all right do I rush out and grab Anthony black it was great to see and it's not like he can't do it again but I would not expect that sort of shooting performance they left him wide open all alone on an island from those Corner spots where he likes to shoot his threes I see him at the now called Kia Center man that's going to take me a minute to get used to yeah my Center he practices that shot incessantly I mean the guys will workaholic so it's not it's not a shock to see that it paid off in a one game scenario teams are still going to Sag off of him and let him have that shot because he is a good finisher at The Rim he can get teammates involved but that shot it's not broken but it's not something that really he can rely on but it's one of those things that you're Pro NBA player because they're Gonna Leave You wide open you have to take the shot and and eventually you got to make him pay he was finally able to do that with this stat line but what I like more than anything else is the Steals and the  rebounds the fact that he's getting those to me are more repeatable that sort of stat line can stick more than anything else but the 3-point shooting you know if you take that away it was a it was a good stat line nothing great what I rush out to go grab him on the waiver wire probably not but he's gonna get started minutes for however long it takes for markelle fultz to come back which by the way I still have no idea when that's gonna happen I mean it was what five weeks ago that we started this conversation about folks like yeah could be any day now and here we are I mean this is this was something that I think initially where like maybe one to two weeks and they're I mean if you are you privy to any real updates are they still taking this game to game is he being evaluated frequently is it just kind of a hey tell us when when the swelling and the pain goes down situation  I mean you know I'll put it like this if I were given real good solid behind the scenes information I wouldn't be able to share that but I have not been given any of that so I can tell you that that is not there's nothing I mean I'm even holding back from you we're just not getting any information and I think that that speaks volumes because  it's not like he re-injured his knee that's the thing I keep going back to he didn't have a moment where he got banged up again you know I think a lot of people are removed from the situation further than I am that they just so well he had a knee injury and it must have happened somewhere this is just a swelling issue from a knee injury that took place Nick in 2020 won  so yeah we're almost like it feels more Brandon you know it is a couple days happy New Year everybody so this feels like a chronic issue  is he gonna come back at some point yes but I have I have no confidence at this point that he's gonna be able to stay on the basketball court because he's not able to get back onto the basketball court and he never even reinjured his knee  let's stick with Orlando for a moment and talk about Wendell Carter we got a lot of questions about him these previous weeks you know should I grab him a lot of people dropped him early in the season you know only played I think five games at the beginning of the year didn't look great in those five games and then you know missed a month and a half with the injury he's now but back for four games he was immediately reinserted into the starting lineup but we could go against Miami he started all four games since we're turning production has been pretty underwear man you know decent rebounding numbers I guess that's about it if you're trying to find a positive there but despite starting you know he's still basically playing like you know 18 to 21 minutes most nights he's never never been a super high volume shot blocker that hasn't really been there it doesn't give you steals decent passer for his position but again not something that you really zeroing in on as an impact for Fantasy but do you see his role increasing like is this still kind of a ramp up process or are we just talking about somebody that we can ignore for the time being in most Fantasy League yeah I would lean towards ignore and it's not because he's not a good player I'll lean on a branded and Nick classic he's a better real life player than he is a fantasy player I think it has more to do with the guys around him than him himself he is in a three-man center rotation right now how many guys how many teams are on the league can say that they're running an effective three man rotation with their Five Spot in the magic filled equally as good about all three of these players so I see no reason why they would get away from that Wendell Carter Junior is the most the most skilled overall of the bunch more Vagner brings a sense of effort and tenacity that you kind of need you need that nasty on a basketball team and you know to bring that sort of attitude he is the guy that that instills that Goku bata's the best defender of the three of them and if you look at the plus minus the net rating for The Magic when goes on the floor farts seeds the other two so you can't  get him away from the basketball court  but you're not going to stop starting window Carter Jr so the it's a three-headed monster this is the fantasy football version of having three running backs and you don't want to start any of them yeah I think in this situation it's like the Baltimore Ravens and I think Wendell Carter is like justice Hill where it's like even even though like there might be some weeks where he might get the most carries he's not really doing a whole lot with those cares I mean we saw we saw Vagner and Batavia outplay him in like half as many minutes off the bench last year right I mean I I'm not really touching Wendell Carter I went to pick them up a couple weeks ago in one league and I've already dropped in there I just don't I don't really see it I want to talk about Jalen Johnson real quickly he made his return for the Atlanta Hawks was right back in the starting lineup 10 points nine boards four assists last night against Chicago played 29 minutes good timing for DeAndre Hunter to get hurt you know I think we'd be having the Johnson Hunter Sadiq Bay debate right now but the Andre Hunter is gonna miss out at least two weeks undergoing a feels like a pretty minor knee procedure but this is one of those things Brandon we seen this so many times somebody's been in the past he's dealt with lower body injuries would not be surprised you know if you remains out beyond that two week time table so either way I mean Jael Johnson to be played so well I'll play it on there I'll play bait in the season like he was a guy that I'm comfortable throwing back into the lineup but should have a really nice Runway here now with no DeAndre Hunter for a few weeks yeah and and you nailed it like the guy that he was before he left with that injury is somebody that you want you want shares of love what I saw from Jalen Johnson earlier in the season it's just one game back is the stat line that blows you away no 10 points nine rebounds four assists not bad by any means but I think better days are ahead before he left he was averaging close to 18 points per game for about a five-game stretch so this is a guy that can be really effective in an offense that you know outside of Trey young the they might feature him from time to time and he'll have his opportunities to fill up the stat sheet moving forward no doubt about it  and other strange news we somebody brought this up in the chat thank you limbo Aaron Gordon gonna miss some time you know we had the Andrew Wiggins slamming his hand in a car door injury a couple of weeks ago I think this has supplanted that as the strangest injury so far on the season Aaron Gordon had 21 stitches to address lacerations to his face and his right hand which as you know he's a right-handed player after getting mauled by a dog over Christmas so I don't really miss this story where the hell is this yeah just came out a couple hours ago I don't know exactly when this happened obviously in the last day or two I mean he played out Christmas day so I had to be in the last like 36 hours at 1632 minutes yeah this is this one I'm not a huge dog guy man you know I like dogs I don't want a dog my own I don't want to be worried about being attacked mold in my own home we have no no reports as to the name of the dog the the type of dog the make and model that we're dealing with  able to I don't think that's gonna be the first bit of info to fly yeah his name was Phil yeah that's what you will yeah it's not some sort of like intimidating name but you know I assume this is pretty serious dog regardless Aaron Gordon's gonna miss some time again we have no idea how long kind of reminds me like the David and Joker fire injury that we were dealing with in the NFL earlier this season obviously he played through it but Aaron Gordon is going to miss I would imagine at least a week you know looking at their upcoming schedule they play a Thursday Friday back to back against Memphis in OKC got to imagine he misses out both of those games they played four games next week including New York steak at Charlotte they're at Golden State then or Lando in Detroit so you could be missing out on a four game week for Aaron Gordon they don't have another four game week until I think it's not until like February so bit of a light schedule for Denver through the month of January but you know the question came through in the chat you know is there is there an ad here is there a way to capitalize those four fantasy I I'm not really sure you know Aaron Gordon did miss four games early in the season and and they they went with Justin holiday in the starting lineup for some of those games you know not really somebody to Target in my mind you know Zeke nnaji is kind of the name that comes to mind but it's not like he saw a notable increase you know looking at those box scores right now he was still you know kind of hanging around pretty pretty minor minutes off the bench I don't I don't know if there's really an obvious pivot right I mean the nuggets have some young players who I think are going to be interesting as they mature and as they see more minutes you know strawberry Christian Braun guys like that you know Peyton Watson I guess is the guy who you know positionally would seem like maybe he could he could step into more minutes he didn't really see a tangible boost when Gordon was out in late November but he's also been playing you know around 20 even close to 25 minutes and a lot of games lately so if you have to pinpoint one guy who I think benefits most from a minute perspective it's probably Peyton Watson  yeah but I mean Aaron Gordon was is like the 5th option on this team and he just he gets his just based on being in the right spots he's an NBA veteran and he's a talented player so nobody is gonna step in and just automatically get his stat line because they'll just ignore whoever it is that's on the floor in place of Aaron Gordon I'm not really interested and I just see a boost in all the guys that are already rostered more so than a natural replacement for Aaron Gordon yeah you know I'm looking at we have a good you know on-off differentials page over at RotoWire you can find that in our MBA stats section and you know it there's just no there's nobody that really jumps out right you know I think Zeke nnaji per 36 is the guy that sees the biggest boost but really really it's the only Oak you know his usage you know jumps pretty significantly like he's averaging eight more points per 36 two more assists per 36 with Aaron Gordon off the floor this season you see a mild increase for for kcp see a mild increase for guys like Reggie Jackson and holiday and even DeAndre Jordan who you know maybe sneaks it a few more minutes if they want to go big or maybe they kind of go with a smaller lineup and stick DeAndre Jordan in there as a backup when you could just off but yeah the nuggets are unique team and I think you're right to bring up that you know Aaron Gordon is not a guy who's hunting shots right he subsists on you know Cuts I mean he's he's career has been completely changed by playing with Nicole yokich and you know he's an offensive rebound guy he's an energy guy it's not like you're saying  all right you know here's like five three-point attempts and 16 shot attempts that are now off the table I know it's appealing from a minute's perspective because you know that is 30 to 35 minutes that you're taking out of the rotation so in a deeper League I think maybe you take a look at Peyton Watson but there's nobody that I'm really excited to go in at that's all his question on the I think it was on the chat that said Julian strawther I know he was a guy that got us all excited for a minute and preseason  kind of a similar build  yeah yeah I mean straw there's such a different player right I mean he's he's a kind of a three-point Marksman you know kind of more of a I would say true shooting guards small forward whereas you know Gordon feels like he's really solidified as a four and early in his career they tried to you know get him as more of a ball handling type you know I think maybe develop him as like what palate Bank Arrow basically has become and I just don't think that was ever his Niche you know to me he's just I think he's like he's like a junior version of like Shawn Marion right that's kind of what you're asking about  that's exactly who he is yeah all right let's let's talk a little Lakers real quickly I don't have a lot to say here I was discussing this with Alex on the exam show last night and yeah I think weirdly the Lakers in the Suns to me are like having parallel Seasons you know Lakers lose out Christmas Day to Boston they're now 16 and 15 they have cratered since the NCAA tournament that felt like it might be kind of a galvanizing win for them it has not been sons are now 14 and 15 after losing to Dallas pretty handedly on Christmas you know both of these teams Phoenix specialty is in a bad spot right now obviously they're under 500 they'd be out of the playoffs they be out of the play in right now if the season ended but they're only a game behind the Lakers so it's not like they're out of this both of these teams like obviously they need to get into the tournament Zone more than anything and I think they will but it they're tough team to evaluate for me in the regular season because we saw it with the Lakers of specialty last year right I mean they were to me they were more of a disaster in the regular season then they've been this year and they still clearly have that switch right I think deep down is even though they say the right things and then they want to win as many games as they can they are a  get us to the playoffs and then we'll show you who you are type of team and I'm starting to feel the same way about Phoenix I mean that the question is to either these teams have deep rooted enough issues that you actually worry about them not making the postseason field I don't worry about them not making the playoffs but I would worry about them being early outs in the playoffs and I think Phoenix is my bigger concern because they've already pushed all of their chips to the middle of the table they don't have any other moves that they can make I think the Lakers could still fine tune some things around LeBron James and Anthony Davis they still have pieces that can be shipped off and turned into a different type of asset for this team I don't know what Phoenix could do other than moving off of The Big Three that hasn't really even played together right so they would be hitting a board on a project that hasn't even started yet I worry more about that because those guys can't even get on the floor together and and the idea of bringing Durant and Booker and be all together is we don't need a bench well now when those guys are out you do and you don't have one and so they think that's the reason they're struggling the Lakers it's more of an age thing and they need  that third piece D'Angelo Russell can be that sometimes Austin Reeves is showing that he can't be that quite enough they need to find that other guy and the they still have the ability to find that via trade the other La team the Clippers they're 18 and 12 they've been on a heater over the last few weeks got an easy win over the Hornets last night that was with no Kawhi Leonard but I'm looking at the fantasy rankings eight cat per game over the last month  Kawhi Leonard number four overall James Harden up to number five did you see this coming for Hardin like were you buying in on him yeah I know the I was doing some drafts like the last week before the season started I want to say James Harden went 58th in in my nfb Casey and I was I was ready to pop them I wish I would have got him in a couple of leads out of discount I thought he was being wildly undervalued at there was concerns about City out games things like that but you know I think Hardin has always been that guy like wherever he's ended up even if the team is greater even if his reputation is taking a huge hit like he is always always been a fantastic fantasy player arguably a better fantasy player than he is a real life player and he's a great real life player but did you think he would reach this kind of ceiling at La and his work ethic personally but it just seems like his lack of commitment to the game of basketball and really just wanting to be a lifer and be out there and play no matter the circumstances I felt like that some point that was going to catch up with him and with his talent starting to deteriorate just slightly I thought that maybe it would be now but I jumped the gun on it he's still the exact same guy at least in the fantasy world I'm having a hard time separating the two I think playoff James Harden has his definitely etched to certain memory in my brain but James Harden is a guy I've got no shares of and I'm just sort of watching it from the sidelines but credit to you you were on that from the beginning that this is a guy that even in the landing in La where with these three guys healthy it's only one ball to go around that he would still be able to put up a good stat line night tonight I promise I didn't bring that up just for just for you to praise me for being in on James Harden who I did not leave it well he deserve all right we got about 10 minutes left let's hit some listener questions if you're if you're watching live on YouTube or on Twitter fire some of those in the chat we will hit as many as we can before we head out we got a question from limbo he says would you add Nick Richards or Pat Williams tomorrow is in a Yahoo points League Jalen Smith and Vince Williams are interesting picks too obviously you know Mark Williams this banged up for Charlotte so you're looking for replacement there Pat Williams maybe see some more minutes when to call the voice out of the mix on Levine still out obviously all these are pretty relatively on appealing you know you're you're likely in a deeper league if you're making some of these decisions but you know if you're just looking to stream for for one game or for the rest of the week any of these options really jump out to you Brandon I think I want to tell what I'm seeing with Chicago because I A lot of people are gonna get really excited about Andre Drummond they're probably gonna start playing some of his props and all of that there's no chance he backs up this performance was with another one or he scores  no zero percent chance you're heard it here first but they play the Indiana Pacers and there are always stats to be had going up against Indiana so I would go Pat Williams I'm going Nick Richards if Mark Williams misses that's that's the big thing you know he's he's more day to day at this point obviously we know who's Savage is going to be out for at least seven to 10 days whereas Mark Williams has been day-to-day but you know to me Nick Richards is the Clear Choice here if Mark Williams misses another game you know he's now started eight in a row during that span you know he's averaging nine points nine boards one and a half blocks that's about all you can ask from a streaming spot and he's been even better over these last two games back-to-back double doubles at three blocks against Denver before Christmas so that's where I lean on that one all right Paul asked these have been my three trades this year can you please rate them so he is traded marketing kuzma and melting for Tatum and Shen  tyus Jones and Jaime Hawkins for Kobe white and sharp and Chris Staples porzingis for Paul George and Brook Lopez so we'll start with the marketing Tatum shingo in one I would give that one in a  A plus  you got you got Jayson Tatum and help her in that feels like a major win and now all the sudden they're starting to they're starting to distribute to the production with the Washington Wizards we're seeing ties Jones play much better basketball would you agree with the grade yeah absolutely I mean marketing really good player obviously I think who's been a lot better in fantasy Than People realize and you know Milton had a nice run for a while as well but I think you got the two most Dependable pieces in the trade and he got the single best player in Jayson Tatum and I you know what kind of worried about marketing as the season comes to a close if they you know end up pulling back on his minutes or resting him later so yeah B plus or an A minus for me on that one you know the Kobe white thing people keep asking how do I sell high and Kobe White's like I'm riding this out man and you know I think depends when you made that trade you know if you got him you know when Ty's child was not playing well or you know before jaquez truly broken out I think that looks even better but Kobe White's not somebody I'm trying to sell like if I could acquire Kobe white for basically two role players and as much as I love hockey he's still ranks outside the top 100 on the year he's been awesome but you know he's not caring you in your league whereas copy white if you if you drafted him you know late or you picked him up early or you traded for him early I mean he has been you know a borderline League winning type of player so I think you did  really well on those first two how about sharpening us for PG and Lopez  that feels like a sea I don't know man I well you know I yeah but I don't know I'm always way too high on chat on Sharp now he's dealing with injuries so I'd bump it up to a bee  I would give that one a B plus honestly I mean Jade sharp was awesome early this season when he was playing like 45 minutes a night but like you said he's injured is production has gone down since Simon's came back you know scoop at a nice double double last night he started to play a little bit better and with porzingis like he's been great when he's out there  always worried about the injuries you could say the same thing to some degree about Paul George but he's you know consistently been a much better fantasy player Dan porzingis and you know Brooke Lopez I don't like over the last month I think he ranks outside the top 16 but always kind of a weird player to evaluate I don't know that the algorithm is all that kind to him because he doesn't rebound he's not like a big time scorer you know fairly low percentages for for a big man because he takes so many threes but he's like the league in blocks so I think you did pretty well there so nice work All Around by you Paul reshaped the entire lineup with that yeah I wish I was in League's I were doing more trades I I've been sending out trades left and right in the stakely and just haven't been getting too many bites Cliff says is there a possibility the food injury could Linger on to him being traded do I pick up Drummond mmm  well definitely pick up drumming for now we talked that through earlier in the Pod absolutely go get him like you know like Brandon said you're not getting 24 and 25 every single night but  you know he's gonna he's probably going to average easily a double doubles as long as much is out I think the bigger question is could you see this lingering you know toward the trade deadline  yeah I mean he's a trade candidate we're not that far away from it but this is only supposed to be a one week injury so I'm not gonna go overboard on that I don't think they hold them out that long it's not like he's not exactly a problem childhood she's like the easyest guy in the world to get along with so I don't think that's gonna be an issue if and you still want to drive up that trade value keeping the guy on the bench is not a good way to do it  I have to just don't know how many teams are going to be interested in Boots I got I think there's a lot of teams that would like to add him it's just like how many teams like all right we need like the worst defensive Center in the league to push us to playoffs right it's like don't worry I worry that if you gets traded it would be into a smaller role you know where he's got to be used in spots for for a better team like I think he's almost in a best case scenario for him right now where he's at in his career with Chicago would you drop D'Angelo Russell for Brandon pajam ski who were referring to as airpods I like that you will note that I do not have my airpods yeah that was sort of a source subject guys I got it right here I opened him up as I always do right before the Pod there's only one airpod in here I don't know where the other one went so I'm going back to these these lame wired pods but yeah I would do that right now I think I would I mean it we kind of always do that the Lakers were gonna sour on to cancel Russell at some point got off to a great start if you got like two good months out of him great I mean he was fantastic through the first like three or four weeks is really but I mean he's they've kind of Russell Westbrook him right now I mean he's played 35 total minutes off the bench over the last two games if you extrapolate out to the last 30 days but Jem ski ranks like almost 50 spots higher than him in eight cats so I would go pick up ski  yeah I completely agree he's been one of the few bright spots of this Golden State team outside of the obvious candidates and they need as much as that as they can possibly get dream on green is out who knows how long and and they're going to need more pigeon minutes I like the way he's playing even when dream on green comes back it really seems like they've found something in him all right we'll hit a couple more here nerdy nerd says Ivy or Exum rest of season is in a nine cat 12 Team league  strangely fair question nerdy nurse I shouldn't be but it is yeah I mean obviously I think there are a lot of people that didn't even know Jade Dr Jackson was in the NBA until like two weeks ago he is obviously played better than Jane ivy on balance you know rest of season  I hate to say it I think I would maybe still lean Ivy obviously exim has benefited with no Josh green and more importantly no Kyrie I think not knowing when Kyrie's coming back that's the biggest thing if you know if if we can say Kyrie coming back next week that I would say Ivy but if this extends you on other month which who knows with Kyrie then I think XM is the guy I want the short term but I do think rest to see season there's probably a little bit more there with Ivy I have no interest in putting Jaden Ivy in my starting lineup at those points so if you need help now Dante some has to be the guy and we're looking at tonight I've seen the latest injury report I know Luke Cage was questionable at he still questionable going into tonight so he's somebody that can help you out immediately if Luke was not playing I would expect a pretty good stat line I would say the good thing about Ivy is he's not killing you in percentages like he was last year so like even if you go that route and obviously there's gonna be some ups and a lot of downs he's shooting 46% from the field he's at like 80% at the line so I think you could live with it more than you could in years past  as Cole Anthony a keeper in the category League will fultz cut into his value thanks guys thank you and for the question I'll defer to you on this one quick I don't think Markle folds cuts into his value Cole Anthony is pretty solidified as what he is he's a microwave Off the Bench so if that's something that appeals to you as a I don't know your keeper situation but I would say yes if you like what you're seeing out of Cole Anthony now it's not going to change  all right a couple more than we'll be out asking for a friend she got offered balance shooting his for her Jaron Jackson but she wants to counter that to get Austin Reeves with what would you guys do yeah I would not trade Jared Jackson straight up for Val Judas I know they ranked fairly close on the year you know Jerry Jackson's been disappointment he still the better player he was way way better fancy player last year there's still a lot of value there and terms of the blocks I would yeah I would you got to get in attachment if you're making that deal and you know I think Austin Reeves makes that more fair I still I don't know if I really want to make that swap but definitely don't do it straight up we don't get enough asking for a friend question here on the podcast that's great yeah I love that but how about by the way you and I have not discussed this with each other  John Morant and his injection into this Memphis Grizzlies lineup has just I can't remember the last time I saw a star reinserted into a lineup so seamlessly where they're right back to what they were the last time we saw John with the Memphis Grizzlies it's truly amazing yeah four know they beat the Pelicans twice they beat the Pacers they beat the Hawks big one against the Denver Nuggets on the road tomorrow I think that will be maybe the first real test and they do a Marcus Smart back as well that was something we didn't mention he came back last night right back in the starting lineup I think you know he's not nearly as important to the team as John ramp but  you know some of the feelings that they were having to throw big minutes to over the last couple of months obviously Marcus Smart goes a long way towards so on that up all right last one and we got to be on our way out Milton or pajami in a pointy so we already said we would take pajewski over dangelo Russell how about melting  I think I'm still going to Jim ski I am feeling the buzz like what I'm seeing right now in Golden State and like we said they need somebody else to step up and become a bigger part of this office and he's doing that for them I think Steve Kerr is really going to lean heavier into this guy yeah I'm on pajewski as well you know the thing with Belton is he's so valuable and category leaks because he's you know like 1.6 1.7 steals per game that diminishes a little bit in points League you still get still get you know points for the steals but it's not not quite as useful and you know projects he's been great in that area as well you know you look at his last 10 games he's at 1.9 steals per game he's got a steal a nine straight at five Steals on Christmas Day against Denver so even if you just break it down to that category I don't think there's really much of a drop off there at all and with pajewski you know the percentages of been pretty good so far for a guy who takes a lot of tough shots 40% from three 46% from the field but at a points League I think I like him even more you know I think there's a higher floor there so I would lean I would leave for Melton and I would take pajam ski over Russell as well  all right we got to get out of here Brandon I know you got family stuff to attend to enjoy you know the rest of your time away from your full-time radio obligations I got to get to a dinner and a couple hours here I got some fell stuff to pound out so well ended here we will have a pod tomorrow we'll have the usual waiver wire pod on Friday as well and then coming back from the new year will be back in full swing with five episodes per week so thanks to everybody for tuning in thanks for those of you through questions in the chat Brandon and I will be back next Wednesday
