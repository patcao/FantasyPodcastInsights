of the way Alex good to talk to you again man as you can see it's very sunny here in the greater Milwaukee area as I continue to piece together my new office thought we ordered blinds last week and I'm sitting you know watching the Lions 49ers game with my wonderful wife who my love last night and she's like oh yeah looks like I never actually ordered those are still sitting in my car so I'm being blinded I can't even see my second monitor because the sun is hitting it directly but hopefully in like 10 minutes or so on the Bumblebee low enough that will have a little bit better visibility but how are you how was your weekend I just assumed you watched plenty of basketball and plenty of football watch blade basketball caught some of the highlights from the football game yeah I'm gonna see a pretty pretty standard weekend for me just kind of hunkered down at least the weather's getting a little bit better here in Wisconsin the snow is almost melted actually you know we I was in Arizona last week and we were coming back from the airport on Saturday afternoon and I said to Molly it's like this is this is like the time of year where if you're visiting Wisconsin you're like why would anybody ever want to live here because like the highways are just like a gray brown sludge there's like whoever these people are that like throw stuff out of their car I don't understand littering specially on a highway insane but it's like just like kind of garbage there's like sticks all over the place like this is this is the depths of living in Wisconsin and the month of February is like the absolute worst but you're right we've almost been scared to look at my weather.com app for the last few weeks but we're creeping up into the 40s in the Milwaukee area big weekend of course in fantasy basketball talks some waiver wire I already got a couple good questions in the chat as always throw those in there  second half of the Pod will take as many live viewer questions as we can I want hand out Alex Hamm sickle mode whatever you want to call it on the waiver wire this weekend particularly in the stake League basically swapped out my entire bench we have a decent amount of teams on four game weeks so it made it a little bit easier I think to pick and choose and kind of decide you know which of these lower level players are worth a shot but I ended up I ended up getting Harrison Barnes who you know I I know what I'm walking into here by buying at the absolute Peak on Harrison Barnes I think I only paid like four or five bucks I thought it might take a little more to get him based on how good he's been for the last week but Harrison Barnes does this once or twice a year right where he'll go like 15 games in a row without scoring more than 12 points and then he'll remind you for a brief period why he was the number one overall player in his high school class  yeah very bizarre season for Barnes who you know like have a pretty pretty nice stretch like when you started with Sacramento this is technically his Worst season probably since like his last year with golden state but like you said he's really turned it turned up his scoring lately Kevin herder has turned up his scoring lately so yeah I think I think the Kinks are probably looking for something a little bit different because I think they realized if if they can continue playing the same way featuring the same guys the same ways that they were going to probably continue to be very middling but they're you know they're turned a little bit of a corner here at least with some role players playing better yeah I mean kings are on a four game week so that was part of the thinking with Barnes and again I'm trying to you know temper my expectations here like if he just has 120 point game in the next four I feel like my my Roi is going to be decent there I ended up bait with a couple of guys who just you know weren't major contributors I picked up Cody Martin as we talked about on the Pod a couple weeks ago immediately got hurt you know even when he's played he's just been pretty low level you know that's a decent blocks of deals games but those are pretty hit or miss so didn't think twice really about dropping him dropped a line right who I always like as a steel specialist but he was basically playing like 8 to 12 minutes you know you just can't really do a whole lot with that in addition to Barnes I got purchased at chewa I'm trying to like blocks and rebounds or two categories I'm trying to move up in this league so was pretty happy to end up Landing a chew up payed a couple of bucks for him went out and got Jared Vanderbilt from the Lakers as well who's played really well with late playing more minutes defensive stats have been off the charts I don't even think I'm gonna end up starting Vanderbilt but field a little bit better  about my depth in that league did you do you have any thoughts on any of those guys are any big additions you made um no I think those are all solid guys to add in a 16 Team league who may have decent like rest of season value like Cody Martin is kind of interesting to me I don't know what they're gonna do with him at the deadline I kind of part of me worries about him because he's 28 and maybe they would ship him off and you know he's been injury-prone lately so they're gonna shut them down but there's another part of me that's like what if it just ends up just ends up being 35 minutes of Cody Martin after some other guys are trying to get away and he ends up you know returning like top 100 value from basically here on out or after the trade deadline he returns top 100 value that's on me I guess that's a risk that's a risk I'm willing to take when it comes to Cody Martin you know and on the achua front I think here's the guy I was most excited to get obviously he's played well lately and you know part of that is Isaiah Hodge Stein has been some time you know he was he was back on Saturday it gets Miami he played only 16 minutes kind of hard to gauge you know after missing two games with an Achilles injury which can be something that makes you a little bit but then we got you know the Julius Randle shoulder dislocation we finally got a time table today I think we probably just see him after the All-Star break I think that would make the most sense so should have a nice little run here where to you know even if he's coming off the bench you know behind Isaiah hartstein just looking for rebounds look for some blocks and he's you know a pretty high volume permitted guy in both of those numbers Vanderbilt has been going nuts I mean I kind of wrote him off earlier in the season I've always thought he's been a little overrated you know like when the Lakers first got him you know there's like oh man this is perfect defensive Swiss army knife and I just never really  got it you know it even in like in the playoffs last year when they were rolling he was only playing like 20 minutes a game like just didn't really seem like they trusted him all that much playing times been up a little bit lately you know double digit scoring in three straight rebounds have been there yes 10 steals over his last three games so again like like most wave or guys in a 16 Team league you're kind of buying high and not necessarily expecting that to continue but you know if I'm targeting rebounds and defensive stats I just wanted another option there yeah I think it's true of front I'm curious to see how tips handles the Randall injury I think it'll just be more like Grimes and Josh Hart and Dante even shenzo I'm kind of worried that she was gonna get stuck but again you're talking about a 16 Team league I think you need to take the chance to like five to ten more minutes a game and then for Vanderbilt yeah it's like he's one of those guys who can run hot and um yeah the Lakers are still kind of searching for answers right so I think he could be part of that because he can play  store the three through the five small ball 5 and certain lineups he's pretty versatile and that way yeah so not a great three-point shooter or anything but a decent pickup for the size League you're talking about  yeah again this is our 16 team staff Insider League very competitive you know everybody knows what they're doing you don't really steal a lot of Bargains in this league yeah I accounted for like a third of the transactions this week which is usually not a good thing you know that usually doesn't mean you're like in the field but some other notables our guy Ken crates you host on Friday he dropped branded pajam ski picked up Larry Nance James ended up picking up over the topping George's knee Yang was added Porter was dropped I thought one pretty interesting one Shannon who's doing well in this league dropped Mason plumblee you know plumblee had a 12 and 12 double-double over the weekend but he dropped him and picked up I'm at Thompson from Houston it Plumlee has been a little underwhelmed like he'll have like a zero two and two games you have a 20 it's just really hard to like predict what's going to happen and I don't know Shannon's team in Saginaw he might not need the rebounds but amen Thompson he is seen what is this double digit minutes and eight straight games averaging nine six and three with basically two and a half stocks which is which is fantastic he's at one point one fantasy points per minute on the season so um yeah I mean I used to  you know we're Houston it started the season so high and they are now down to 21 and 24 and some of that like they've been missing tari Eason Dillon Brooks missed a decent among the time they haven't been especially healthy lately but I think Thompson sort of forces Wayne to the rotation at least until Easton comes back but I really am getting worried about the season injury because it's it's really non-descript like lower left leg injury management and he's just been out for like a month yeah when it transitions from like a day-to-day injury to injury management that's that's usually not a great sign he's already been ruled out for tonight's game has not played since New Year's Day so I think this could be one of those things where even if he's back in a week or two you know maybe as a lost or spot the rotation but he kind of lost the momentum that he had picked up in December and early January and it might be hard to to kind of grab that back because when he was playing well I'm in Thompson was either still out or just working his way back from that early season injury so it kind of might be an either or situation if speaking of the rockets in my nft I went out finally dropped Marcus Smart I think it's time yeah we talked about the risk reward there I just don't think the reward is all that high I think it's in the rebel possibility that he just like barely plays and maybe not even again this season depending on where the Grizzlies are although that pretty respectable you know so it's all these injuries had I mean they're still 13th in the Western Conference but they have it been this complete disaster like we thought they might be but I grabbed Camp Whitmore  in place of Marcus Smart added Kevin herder in that league as well and I think everything we just said about he said and I'm at tops it kind of applies to Whitmore too it does another guy who is exactly at one point one fantasy points per minute we know he's a scorer he's a top what would you say like he's probably a top 10 talent in the draft that slipped because of like injury concerns so you know we know that that possibility is there spent some early time in the G League yeah numbers of the cheek by the way like yeah not afraid to shoot the ball  of course um it is another situation where it's like  Jalen greens minutes like there will be nights where Jaylen green I'll play 39 minutes and you play 27 minutes um and you know there been moments where Jabari Smith's have been up and down like I think you may go to searching for answers again and what more his ability to just put up points like I If it's between jail and green and cam Whitmore they're both producing so little in anything other than scoring that's like you might as well just play the one that's hot  if you're if you're you know yeah four game week coming up for the Houston Rockets I mean the the vast majority of the NBA has four games this week I think 22 teams are on a four-game week and then we have 18 teams on a three-game week no two Gamers so that's a good thing but Atlanta Brooklyn Chicago Dallas Detroit Golden State and New Orleans and Toronto are the three game weak teams so yeah one of those weeks where you know not ideal to you know have Luca carrying your team although you know what he's doing doesn't even matter obviously you're still starting him into three game week but yeah schedule wise you know not something that you really had to factor in all that much and unless you're really working in the margins did you did you do anything notable in your nfv KC or any other big time leaks  I didn't I've decent benches and those in most of my League's and keeper league on I pulled the plug sold off use of nurkic looking to move off I you know Anna nobe has been kind of Hit or Miss for me in terms of if I want to keep her or not feeling some offers for him but in my in my in my nfkc league we had a 51 dollar bid for for Josh Hart again this is with 1000 someone had Vanderbilt someone I could whip more nemour full Scott picked up wagons got picked up Asda Harrison Barnes for six dollars so yeah pretty active a lot of the guys we touched on already I think you're getting picked up a lot of leaks oh no it's somebody grabbed Desmond Bane in my NFP Casey I think we noted on the pot last week that he was dropped a week ago I thought about it you know I mean he was out there somebody somebody got him for two bucks you know it's like yeah it's a thousand dollar budget it's not like you had to you know spend 400 dollars for it so I think for that price if you were like I have so many injuries on my team that I couldn't really afford to do that and you don't have an IR slot and NFP Casey so that was really the deciding factor for me but if you have a healthy team and you know you're willing to kind of wait this out with the All-Star break coming up I don't really have a problem and again if you're in a league with one or two IR slots then I think Bane is a high enough upside player to me relative to someone like Marcus Smart that I'm if I could afford it I'm more than happy to hold on to him and just kind of hope that you get even 15 games later in the year  yeah he should be picked up if again if you have the spot for it there's no reason not to if you're not gonna do anything with that bench spot anyway um I guess the best case scenario he comes back like the last week of February right after the All-Star break  yeah if you can if you got the spot grab them uh did you think about adding John conchar anywhere he was he was not picked up in the stately he was on my list it was kind of lower in my in my waterfall so I ended up not getting him by virtue of picking up some of the other guys that I mentioned earlier but you know he started now six games in a row the scoring has been very underwhelming the rebound he's kind of been all over the place he had an 11 point 10 rebound double-double last week kind of out of nowhere then of course one Rebound in 26 minutes the next night so that's not necessarily sustainable but you know kind of blocking a ton of shots out of nowhere and he's always been somebody who's stuck in a few blocks here or there but he had five block game against Toronto early last week he had multiple blocks now and in four of his last five games I was a little bit surprised that that oh no somebody did grab never mind right Paul who's actually leading the league got John konchar and this is why I didn't get him I paid nine bucks out of 100 dollar budget  uh yeah Ryan is a a decade listener to the Friday podcast and I suggested John Contra last week off the way that advice man I know I got really gotta start yes I don't even know what the term is for the yes give him back advice I so yeah I mean I think Contra is a decent ad I didn't have anybody I really wanted to drop for him I would have thought about Horford and I would have thought about dsj but that's pretty borderline to me but yeah I think he should be picked up in 16 weeks I think the blocks are probably too hot like I don't think the blocks are continued like the way they are but he's just kind of been like a guy who I made this joke about tail me at one point where it's probably more accurate for someone like konchar where it's like points rebounds and assist you just like grab three Dice and you shake them and you roll them and that's the number he has in each category it's like any given you could have you know two points seven rebounds want to assist and then he'll be nine assists nine rebounds one point you know he's one of those guys a stick with the Grizzlies you know GG Jackson played well yesterday I'm still skeptical of fantasy wise you know it's been very Boomer bus to the minutes have kind of been up and down but look pretty good yesterday against Indiana 18 points one steal one block four rebounds hit a couple of Threes six of nine from the field 29 minutes for him off the bench and Vince Williams you know we've talked about a lot over the last couple of weeks I think we identified him as the guy you know if you're trying to go all in for for one Grizzly and obviously you've missed your window at this point but you know post-market smart injury post has been dating injury I think he's the guy that not only looks like he's going to be you know somebody who's a potential League winner but you're going to go down as one of the bigger waiver wire ads of the year but also somebody who now becomes pretty interesting as a future piece for them because they've they've tried out a few of These Wings you know it has been playing well of late as well you know been in the starting lineup playing some more minutes you know so are Williams I don't know what's going on with him you know lottery pick out that long ago kind of a weird pick at the time looked okay as a rookie and then it's just kind of fallen off the map these last couple of years and then Jake Miller if you have been been injured and has never been much of a fantasy guy but Williams 20 points 8 boards and then assist eight of 12 from the field played 36 minutes that was a team High yesterday and you know really since all these injuries set in he's averaging 17 and a half points seven rebounds three and a half assists 1.4 steals 0.8 blocks and Judy 54% from the field  yeah I wasn't 100% convinced that Williams but he proved me wrong the Grizzlies ended up giving him a three years six point six million dollar contract in January talk about a talk about a steel it looks like at this rate but he was mid second round pick yeah and you mentioned I mean someone of these other guys that got drafted by Memphis just had not really worked out like you know Little Arabia barely gets any time and Rowdy they I mean they waved  I can't remember his name now Loftin they just waved and they just waved lofted so it's nice that they got Vince Williams in there I think he will be a nice future piece for them and you mentioned GG Jackson too like I don't know what to believe what GG Jackson like he's gonna get up shots but  his efficiency is like issuing you know 52 50 72 right now after shooting terribly in college  which could regress and then if that regresses he's on a two-way deal they could just send them to the G League once everyone is healthy if anyone ever gets healthy for Memphis I think he's a fine pickup and like 16 teams like we're talking about deep stuff but if you're in like a 12 team or it's just I don't think I would even bother with with GG Jackson to be honest no not at 12 Team league I just I don't I I think most of his his work has come on the scoring side of things you know and I don't think he's providing a whole lot else to the point where it's been consistent enough that I would add them in like a 14 or 16 teams so no I would I would not be really adding him in deep performance right now all right let's hit a couple of questions hope those will continue to roll in keep throwing them in there guys I think so this question from mustache I think this is in reference to the thumbnail from the video that it is in Isaiah hardenstein photo we did not set that we're not telling you to drop hard and Stein Just to be very clear I would not be dropping him right now obviously missed a couple of games was back yesterday or was back over the weekend excuse me and you know played limited minutes but yeah I think we should probably clear that up just so there's no confusion there you know the hardest time versus that she was split is going to be something to monitor I think in the short term you know if they do bring heart Stein along a little bit more slow  with the Achilles issue and obviously you know Julius Randle out that's what 36 37 minutes that are just out of the rotation at this point so I do think you know we could see some hard shine and maybe not playing together but I think there's enough minutes to go around there yes I think I would yeah I would not drop art and shine I also want to clear that up I think the concern if you have any is that he was dealing with an Achilles injury which can be bothersome and we'll can flare up and it's obviously a concern because any Achilles concern is a major concern we've seen like guys like capella you know like deal with like Achilles on and off for like three years but  you know he saw art style 16 minutes is first game back I think it'll work his way up  yeah I don't I don't even remember if that was exactly what you asked me  it was more a point of clarification so a couple of people asked about heart and shine and again that was I think they could reference to the to the to the thumbnail for the video Trey Murphy or Malcolm Brogdon for talking rest of season value in a nine cat League interesting question obviously very different players very different situations both have been you know a little bit banged up lately Brogden when he's been out there continues to play well you know obviously there's some concern about does he get traded if he doesn't get traded he's you know one of the most like obvious shutdown candidates of all time Murphy meanwhile did not play on Saturday against the books you know started the previous game against OKC you know right now it's a little bit difficult to get a full read on Trey Murphy I'm usually pretty Pro when it comes to him obviously he is his very three-point dependent Alex and the three-point shooting is not that good lately he's just he's been in a slump you know his last six games shooting 26% from three on high volume so not only is that a disappointment in that category but of course it's tanking his field goal percentage as well  yeah Murphy you know last year  well with Ingram and Zion playing less than 82 combined games he saw a 31 minutes and was the 83rd player in eight cat  so it's it's going to be pretty hard for Murphy to be like a to reach top 80 again if Ingram's iron are going to be healthy and he's not seeing 30 plus minutes a game like he can develop and he can get better he's still dealing with that probably you know still a little bit hampered by I think it was a meniscus tear to start the season um  I do think Murphy's probably safe for a long term like if you are if you are near the top of your league I would I would rather hang on to Murphy but if you are trying to creep up the standings like if you're in the middle of the pack or low in the standings and you just need production like right now I would I would Grant Brogdon so I think it I think it depends on where you are  yeah there's a difference to me between like who would you rather have the next month versus rest of season yeah and maybe it's more of like when does your season end you know flexible are your legs in terms of midweek moves if something were to happen like there's no doubt to me that if you could guarantee me that both Situation's remain the same for the rest of the season probably is the better player for Fantasy I think that's that's to me is a is kind of a lock also an elite free throw shooter you know which is he's been on fire at the line of late so if you look at it that way I think I would lean Brogden but again there's there's certainly some riskier with any any player over like 25 years old on the Blazers you know is that season you know where is on those guys could be in the mix for a Trader shut down Johnny says what's up fellas pink waving Emoji I'm not seen that emoji but what's up man give you a wave back appreciate you listening along good question on Jane Ivy's he had dropped in 9th and as you mentioned earlier Alex I think Josh Hart could be the single biggest beneficiary over these next few weeks with the dislocated shoulder for Julius Randle  He could heart yeah played 32 minutes on this Miami game this this most recent game that I think that was one Randall saw the injury right yeah against Miami 14 nine and five we've seen heart top out at in two years ago three years ago depending on how you want to say what you want 22 where he played for the Pelicans to start the year in the got moved to Portland he ranked 67th and 8 cat  he was playing 33 minutes a game now in Portland he saw a ridiculous usage that he will never see again I bet I think I think heart can be a top 100 player for the duration that Randall is out so obviously your way down against IV who has played really well lately but Cade is basically coming back healthy now I would I would like to think that Monty Williams will continue to play Jake and Ivy  um you know upwards of 30 minutes but I don't have a lot of faith in that and  I don't know I  you know Ivy over the past 15 games Ivy has averaged 17 basically 17 four and a half and four and a half I don't think heart can get quite there but if they scale IVs numbers back like the scales back by like five it I think the numbers are actually going to be pretty close  I think it's actually less risk with heart at this point it's going to be sort of my final answer is less risk adding heart  compared to keeping ivy with Cade Cunningham coming back oh yeah and you know Cade they study was good to go yesterday obviously didn't need them one of the weirdest results of the Year Detroit just like handily beating the Thunder all afternoon and it was a late scratch you would think he'll have a pretty good chance to to get back out there I believe they don't they don't play till Wednesday at Cleveland so if he's not out there that's maybe a little bit more alarming and then they play Friday and Sunday so it is a three game week for Detroit if you're you know if you're looking as if you look at this as like a last roster spot streamer you know maybe in that situation you lean Josh Hart because of the the schedule Advantage but at the same time I mean it the problem with Detroit is like we just we have no idea what Monty Williams is going to do right like there is there numbers you can look at that say Jane Ivy's usage rate drops by seven percentage points when he's out there with Kate Cunningham but then you're like  that was a really weird stuff going on early in the season when you know cage was playing 40 minutes and bring an ivy Off the Bench he's playing 16 minutes so it's hard to kind of factor in the the rise in consistency and really the way that I've used played better with Kate Cunningham out of the lineup like it is there more trust in him now than there was earlier in the season my guess is yes and you know Josh is been pretty up and down and mostly under this season obviously you'd kind of like the benefit of seeing a couple games of what that looks like but I hate to say it I mean in a night cat League I I feel better about heart you know because of the turnovers for Ivy but  you know I I trust that Detroit will at least be throwing IV out there for 26 to 30 minutes even if that means he's going back to the bench with Kate coming back so I would I would lean slightly toward ivy  yeah yeah I mean across the whole season  ivc's five fewer minutes with Kade available and sees averages 13 fewer fantasy points with Kate available but again like you said does he have trust now as he earn the trust of money Willems  and again it's hard to say  yeah I wish I had more definitive answer it's just I think it's going to be closed that's gonna be close  all right good question here from Matt and you know we should have led the show with this Ben Simmons available to play tonight yeah kind of I wouldn't say totally out of nowhere but someone out of nowhere he was practicing in the G league for a little bit was recalled over the weekend and then we got that that note yesterday afternoon that he's listed as probable and is now off the injury report entirely forward to for tonight's game against the Utah Jazz it is a three-game week for the Nets Matt's question you know it indicate that he probably in a daily lineup league so maybe not quite as concerned about that but Matt says should we sit guys like Evan Mobley and Ben Simmons tonight with them expected to be on minutes restrictions 12 games today so he has other options I would say yes I mean Simmons I just I don't trust this I think it's far more likely that two weeks from now he's back on the injury report and you know you're just we're just kind of on this continuous wheel of him being in and out Mobly yeah I mean  Baker staff basically came out and said yeah he's gonna play in the low 20s sometimes coaches will stretch that a little bit but I think if you're looking at it just for tonight with 12 games I wouldn't start either of those guys  yes I first Simmons your 100% right I need I need to see 20 minutes in the Box Score before I even think about putting Simon's like a star in light up I need to see it firstly yeah I mean if you have if somebody games tonight you're clearly in a daily moves League I would just look elsewhere to be honest I mean mate maybe puts up similar numbers to some guy playing 35 minutes off your bench but I won't even risk it ah Johnny says what do you guys think about picking up Jacob topping if he gets called up from the G league with the Randall injury  I I wouldn't I wouldn't like go grab him now prematurely I mean and if you're in a really deep League or like a you know a dynasty League maybe and you know League where you have you know some slots like our roadwire Dynasty league and you got these like basically developmental spots where you could kind of you know pick a trade players like cop in  but I mean he's still in the G League it's Tibbs he's doesn't really have a track record of you know somebody who's completely unproven at the NBA level being called up and you know one being in the rotation to playing enough minutes where it would matter so  I I wouldn't pick him up maybe we'll look foolish and two weeks when Jacob and his going crazy but now I don't think it's worth it I will do it it's love his guys he loves guys with MBA experience the Knicks have our they have enough depth to make a four with guys already on the roster  did was allergic to the G League I don't think he even knows that the next savagely probably Eric says would you find it crazy to drop careless Levert in a 14 team need category League he says he's hunting threes and Levert's percentages are a roller coaster at times yes they are thanks to both of you thanks for the question Eric thanks for listening and watching along yeah I mean it's that's a pretty good description of careless Levert roller coaster right one of the few players in the league that's Cape I mean it's kind of Harrison Barnes like honestly in some ways maybe a little higher scoring ceiling night to night but he'll go through those weeks where you're just like why why did I think it was a good idea to start him and then there'll be other weeks where he'll average 25 a game for four or five games straight spend a little bit down lately missed a couple of games early last week came back pretty uninspiring you know in their last two games it gets Milwaukee  I don't think it's crazy to drop a metaphor 14 team Lee know I don't I don't think it's insane as always depends who's out there but I don't I don't think it's that crazy  I don't think it's crazy I don't think I would do it until  I would maybe walk away until Garland comes back and then and then do something there I mean yeah alerts a solid 3 point shooter he's giving you you know two over his past 15 games he will get picked up 100% he will get picked up I would probably have to take  until Garland comes back it's hard for me to endorse that but if you've got again if you if you don't need the threes at all and you're leaning into other categories I think there are guys on the waiver wire that probably can give you for what your team is targeting like just as good if not better production for your specific setting  good trade question here from our guy Rodney he says he traded dejounte Murray in D'Angelo Russell for Michael Porter Jr and Stephen Curry 12 team points League who won the deal  I don't hate you know capitalizing on this hot stretch from Dilo  Well I this entirely hinges on D-Lo if you look gets traded and stops doing this this being like you know 28 and 6 over his past eight games which you know would probably go down to 22 and 6 if he's shot normally you're gonna win if Dilo gets traded and and comes off the bench or sees lower usage you're going to lose if Dilo for some reason doesn't get trigger keeps doing this or get ready to a team where he's playing for 3 5  which I it's like he's gonna get traded yeah I'm not the biggest Michael Porter guy for Fantasy you know just it's kind of start to feel like he's not going to reach the heights that we thought he might a few years ago and it stayed healthy that's a thing it's like that was always the thing with him it's like man if you could say healthy it'll be a superstar and just doesn't really feel like he's followed that trajectory this is a really interesting one because normally I would say you got Steph Curry it's a home run but ironically like Russell's been a better fantasy player than Curry over the last two weeks very small stretch and you know it's been a bit of a Down month overall for Stephen Curry by his standards I don't I don't really know if there's a clear winner right now because like you said it hinges entirely on D and I was just a Murray could very well be traded too but you're you're eliminating some risk here right like Michael Porter's not going anywhere you know exactly what you're getting the rest of the way and you got the best player in the most consistent player in the deal and stuff and Curry so I  I don't think we're gonna look back at the end of the year and say Man Curry just had a terrible last 60 games yeah I think he's gonna snap out of this and I think he'll probably return borderline top 10 value top 15 value at worst the rest of the way and you'll be okay with that one another question on Ivy talked about him a little bit ago aunt says Hey fellows is Ivy hold he's thinking about dropping him for precious or contract appreciate the advice yeah we've had all these guys so far you know I  you know I picked up a but I wasn't dropping anybody on the level of Ivy and I'm trying to thank you would I have done the same thing would I have dropped ivy for Chua I don't think I necessarily would have I think all three of these guys are very roster to me I I'm you know I'm pinning my steak like hope space I'm precious to choose so I'm obviously optimistic about what he can do you know on the contract I think I'd still lean Ivy there you know contracts value over the last three weeks has been so so heavily dependent on those defensive stats which as you mentioned earlier can you depend on on someone like John Kohler blacking two and half shots a game I don't know  car is listed at six five not six a not six nine six five so the block numbers seemed a little inflated I I'm 100% with Nick for those two guys specifically precious and Contra I would just hold Ivy and see what happens they're not so they're not such a sure thing that I would risk the chance that now Monty Williams trust Ivy or that Kate can't stay healthy or something like that a good follow-up here from our guy Matt did you know precious of you as siblings names are God's Gift God's will peace Grace and promise  that makes sense I definitely I definitely knew about God's gifts because I think you know that Saint John's back in the day I remember that was like he's older than precious so that was my introduction to the issue a family and this this lineage of fantastic names but man God's gift and God's will could you could you see yourself as like a God's will Bertha  no I was I'll turn it may have been named Eric oh God's God's gift was not I don't think on the table for me that's real though you were almost in Eric it was between Alex and Eric yeah really I was always told it was Nick or Jackson which I don't mind the name Jackson Erickson name too it's like I one of my buddies from for back home was named his name is Mike you know solid name he said the other option for him was Heath he's like my life would be so much different if I was named you like really it really into like snow will be a ling and four-wheelers like I feel like yeah just yeah that name like that sets you on a different path Johnny says is Paul Reed worth the pickup for today with Joel embed out probably I mean there are 12 games so if you're playing the the single day streamer you should have some options like  you know he's coming off of that big game it gets Denver that was by far as best performance in any fill in game for a bead this season and we have a decent sample we got nine of them even including that that big game he's only averaging 12 and a half points seven rebounds to assist 1.2 steals 1.2 blocks but pretty good pretty well rounded yeah I think I think I would add them you know it depends on the on your leak size and who's out there but if you're just doing the one game at bead fill in based on what you saw I get Denver you there's a good chance you might be kicking yourself if you don't and they have a pretty good matchup it gets Portland which you know without being that that becomes maybe a more competitive game and we see Paul Reed you know play into the into the 30s for minutes  yeah I Echo everything you said he's averaging over her family while a starter Portland Starz streaming Paul reading if you can for sure yeah I will say too I mean you might want to if you're really on the fence Maxie's questionable to buy his hair is a game time call it's like if those guys don't play Then you absolutely get them in there it's like part of the part of the reason we saw all these weird stat lines for the Sixers against Denver's like it wasn't just that beat out those guys were both out you know Patrick Beverley went crazy Anthony still out so yeah straight answer is yes but if at least two of those three are out Chris Chris Michael excuse me Chris Michael says Alex Nick what are your thoughts about Camp Johnson and shade and sharp for 12 cat is it safe to move on from them or stash maybe that's 12 team could be 12 cat you know I think typically when we get these 12 cat or you know anything above 10 it's you know double doubles triple doubles so probably doesn't really impact a whole lot here  we talked last week Alex about Shea and sharp and  potentially stashing him like I don't think he's a shutdown risk we saw him go crazy at the end of last season you know Portland as bad as they been you know they kind of have more options now than they did late last year when they shut everybody down so I if you got the room to stash and sharp I would certainly think about it cam Johnson to me is a more interesting one just because he's been just appointing right like you didn't think we'd be getting questions mid-season about like are we stashing this guy should I even have on my roster  yeah he's just kind of underwhelming like it's shooting it you know people are freaking out about his 3-point shooting if you take a 14 game sample he's 40% from Three's averaging you know he's making two and a half a game but the rest of his stat profile is really weak like he's not doing anything he's just turned into like a three-point shooter for that and maybe he still can reach like the 89 you know per game value that he did last year but I kind of doubt it I'm fine dropping him on a 12 team or I think somebody will probably pick him up because if you're in the mindset of like is he streamable on a four game week of course he is very streamable on a four game week that's like the argument to keep them on your roster on the other hand if you're low in the standings you just need a jolt every single week right and Jonathan is not going to give that to you you may as well just like chase other streamers and for Sharp you mentioned it like I think he's a bit he's sharp is extremely overrated as a fantasy player when everybody is available he's almost like just a point guy when everybody's available but on the wrist that other guys on Portland get moved or shut down or whatever and he starts handling the ball again then yeah he's you know I would I think it's fine to hang on to him for that for that chance  should I keep Luke Kennard  good question Kennard already been ruled out for tonight's game Grizzlies our home for the Sacramento Kings they play Thursday Friday in a back-to-back and then Sunday at Boston so it is a four game week they have a three game week next week and then pretty much everybody's on a short week they have three games before the All-Star break I don't know man I'm a little worried about this knee because it's the same one that cost him all that time earlier in the season they're just calling it soreness I think it was a bone bruise earlier in the year so it's tough to say if that's really related but it I mean if he's out there he's been giving you like three three and a half threes a game with all these Grizzlies injuries I  you know I again after this week like he's he doesn't have another four game week until like March so if you're in a daily League that's not as big of an issue if you're in a weekly League I would say you probably don't really want to wait it out because you might be a borderline starter anyway depending on your leak size  yeah I mean I I would love to hang on to him just because he's been very good as a starter like he's giving you assist in three he's played really well um  but yeah I mean he's he's not  he's he's not really a young guy for me he's 27 they're not they're not like giving Kennard developmental minutes they're giving him minutes because they have to play a guy and he's there  it's possible  I wouldn't be surprised if he got traded actually because he's on technically an expiring deal his car and track his contract for next year's a is a team option at 14 million so it's possible they've showcased him enough and they might play it really safe with him and then try to trade him to like a contender that needs a three-point shooting again I I don't hate the idea of dropping him but if you have the spot available I would prefer to hang on it's it's just  it's such a tough call it's a great question  the Admiral Admiral Nita says who's the better stash with the trade deadline Ben Simmons keyonte George or amen Thompson  not that Simmons for me I'm gonna I'm gonna rank it third  I'm out  that's fine yeah I mean I think they the Nets could certainly pull a plug if there is any plug to even pull with how bad they are but I don't trust him and stay healthy I don't know what the Jazz are up to be honest with you they're 24 and 23 looks like they might hit the play in but they you know  again they might they might prioritize next year but  I Sexton's also playing so while I don't know if they trade sex and then I'm in Thompson  I don't think he said like actually pulls the plug  I think they're going to just hang on because I think I mean they've committed so much for Fred Van Fleet and like being good  in the Amiga future mmm  I don't know I better better stash  I mean I think upside wise  Ben Simmons probably has the most upside if you're just talking like fantasy points per minute like if they if each of these guys got 35 minutes  but then I might go get Thompson and then probably George we know about George's percentages  yeah I've  just never not been a huge catch George guy for Fantasy specifically and you know it's if you're in a nine category League you know the turnovers have actually been a little bit better lately he was turning it over a ton early in the season and he hasn't had as many of those disaster games of late but I also I don't he was playing 30 plus minutes for a good stretch earlier in the year so like even if Utah you know which is played well lately they're sent in 10th right now I don't know I guess I could technically ship out you know Jordan Clarkson somebody like that and maybe that opens up a little more time for keyonte George but we've kind of seen you know what he is even when he's playing 30 35 minutes a night and you're still getting the same variability you're still getting the same you know kind of nothing type of games or two of 11 type of performances so I you know I think for me I'm in tops it's supposed interesting it's just who just used to trade right it's like who wants you know are you trying hard ways with Dillon Brooks you just signed like somebody bringing him in not with three and a half years left on his deal I don't think so it does it does feel like they're gonna need to consolidate at some point between Javari Smith Taurus I'm in Thompson you know Jay Sean Tate Jeff greens but in the rotation guys like that they have dudes that they should probably consider shipping out but I don't know if they'll do that but I'm the most tantalized with on the top since upside the rest of the way because you forget how much time he missed early on  you know he kind of got a late start compared to the rest of these rookies  yeah but  everything he said makes sense  all right we'll do this one quickly but good kind of General general knowledge question and had to head category leaks what stat levels are considered Elite in each category hmm uh  assuming you mean like per player  there's actually if if you are I don't even know if you have to be a subscriber to RotoWire to access the specific ratings there's a I could hear you know what I'll do I'll post this in the chat right now this link  if you go get that link we have a ratings page on RotoWire so if you go to the NBA side there's a rankings table you go to ratings you click that that's basically like our Seasons per game rake rankings how guys are doing for the whole season so if you sort by like let's say assists we have a z-score setup which long story short a z-score is like how better how much better are you than average  so I don't know what you can consider Elite but I think just you know ripping off this page like 11 rebounds is probably a lead for rebounds points it's probably something like 30 assists anything over eight I think you could probably consider Elite steals  I don't know one over one point six one point seven blocks is like two and a half threes is like three and a half things like that so you can kind of mess around with that page and see what's up there yeah it's also interesting you could go all the way back to I think 2010 11 are our Tech team is put in a ton of work on this page we use it all the time you know when we when we reference like oh this guy ranks 30th over the last 30 days that's usually where we're pulling it from so it's really interesting to look back and also note how what I would what I would say is an elite level is way different now that it was even five years ago you know I mean I that's something I thought about a lot you know in terms of  you know I didn't I didn't like you know make a point to go get Joel embiid in like my auction League specifically or Luca Dacia and you're like man so those guys put up 73 points I mean that's like a you know that even for like another star player it's like that might be a week from someone like Pascal you know he's playing three games you might give you 703 total or even some four game weeks so I do think those specific categories specifically points you know what it means to be elite like we got we got four guys right now averaging at least 31 points a game I mean these up at 36 points per game three is the other one I think that is changed most you know if you used to be somebody averaging like two two and a half made threes that was like whoa all right you're like close to the top of the league you know Curry was kind of on his own eyelid and he still is this season by the way he's averaging like point eight more made threes and anybody else but not only have the the elite guys raise their volume but the the middle level I think is the biggest thing and you have like you know well over 100 players averaging you know like at least 1.4 1.53 per game yup and an important thing to know if you're looking at that page and just like in general for Fantasy if you're playing cats is percentages are weighted by volume so you know a guy taking more free throws at like 75% is going to do more if you're affecting your free throw percentage in a guy shooting 95% on like two attempts um so like for example you know if you sort by like best free throw a best players affecting free throw percentage its embed right now at number one shooting 88% who actually does more for you than Lillard shooting 92% at his volume it's kind of a weird nuanced fantasy but almost everybody who's giving you something that I would consider very good in the free throw categories over 85% on pretty high volume  yeah that was a very good very good succinct analysis and again go check out that page just it's under our stat drop down and ratings where you can find all that and Alex dropped it in the chat as well  Jonathan Isaac question  so Jonathan Isaac's injury man has been minutes issue was his or Orlando's idea weed for him to jump up to 20 minutes to two straight games I agree now he's not on the injury report the day after very weird uh yeah I mean I just haven't really been thinking about Jonathan Isaac you know I think everybody that's watching right now is probably been harmed by Jonathan Isaac at some point throughout their days playing fantasy basketball if this becomes a trend you know he becomes interesting again but yeah Alex he's kind of in the Ben Simmons zone for me where it's just does that promise is there you know you look and you know right now he's averaging like the second best block rate of his career you know the steel rates actually down this season but the minutes have been low like we're not that far removed from talking about him as like a future defensive player of the year but I just I don't really know if I if I trust it this has been a strange situation  if you're gonna deep enough League like  16 I think it's fine as like an exploratory if you have the space you're doing well in your league you can you can get rid of the spot or whatever you can't be adding a guy like Isaac if you're struggling because he's just not  it's not consistent enough production  but  it is weird because absolutely weird but I just don't think he's ever gonna see like over 25 minutes a game consistently with the way Orlando's roster is with his injury issues so he started more like a deeply extreme where I think almost like for the foreseeable future all right we will hit as many more of these as we can got about 10 more minutes or so is there any player you would trade Luka for ask our friend Matt he says I have Luca and Kyrie they don't play many games in the fantasy playoffs he's in a Yahoo points lie oh yeah man  that's tough I mean obviously there's a case for B there's a case for SGA there's a case for yokich that's probably where I'll draw the line  yeah yeah I know that the fantasy playoffs issue is is definitely a it's a concern I remember hearing you know knowing about like those guys not yeah people they want draft them for that reason but  to actually answer your question I  it really has to be a guy like basically in the MVP conversation that's all so a good fantasy player like yeah like Nick said and bead  maybe Anthony Davis  yeah that's GA guys like that you know I think it's at least a discussion  yeah we're talking points league right so it's like Giannis is in there I don't think I would go like if you're just talking straight up fantasy points per game I don't think I would go lower than like five compared to what Luke is averaging and that would be a pretty significant step down so you know if I don't know exactly what exactly he's gonna be 55 or 60 let's say he's averaging 55 I don't see off the top of my head I could look it up but if he's if he's at 55 I'll see where actually is 61 Jesus 61 fantasy points per game for Dodge it I wouldn't go below 55 if you're trading for anybody you know  all right send a couple of these rapid fire is below cool the Bali a stash in a 12 team Head to Head nine category League  I don't know not for me probably not I think he's already playing enough minutes that if there were to be some sort of shut down  yeah I probably see a slight boost but I don't know I don't I don't think he's the type of guy that you're like all right here's 30% usage rate go crazy so for me if it's a yes or no question would be no  I think people want coola Bali to happen more than it is likely to happen and like Nick said he's getting a decent amount of minutes um there's you know I can I can try to do this very quickly I'm like rip I'm doing something on off right now where I'm like ripping Jordan Poole and Kyle kuzma off the court to see like what if coolies usage increases by a lot yeah with pooling and kuzma off the court the cooler bali's usage goes up by 4.6% which is what I would consider decent but not like game-changing  he's a stash again if you can afford it if you're at the top of your rankings like if you're top three in your league do it if you are below that you just need production right now and that's not what cool about he's doing  angel or Angel Figueroa says can make our Dream On In A points League  interest wow they good since Raymond's been back but just very different statistical Specialties I guess is one way to put it I I think I would link a mingi in a points League I think I would too double checking yeah  yeah it's closed I think it's actually a toss-up  it's a toss-up for me but I'm I'm fine rolling with comingo  I don't think there's a problem with that  okay another good question should I accept Tyrese Maxey for my Anthony Edwards  Tyrese Maxey for your Anthony Edwards um yeah maxius slowed down a little bit yeah early in the season but over the past 30 days he's still ranked 36th and eighth cat while Edwards is ranked 35th and 8 cat of course should you do it I think  I'm cool with it either way  I don't think anybody's gonna end up winning that trade um yeah I don't think anybody like  it's to me it's a wash yeah if you walk out of a kind of a what do you need a question for me and the stat lines are relatively similar in general but I mean the one the one thing we're Maxi has the key Edge I would say it's free throw shooting you know he's more efficient takes about the same amount but I I think these guys are like dead even the rest of the way which says more about it I think the crazy season that Maxi sad because you know Edwards has been maybe a slight disappointment but it's like he's playing badly you know you could say that were with Maxie is there a chance that Philly takes a big swing at the deadline you know do they talk themselves into Zach LaVine there is a scenario you know where they where they do that and then then you're probably gonna wish that you had Edwards so that's that's just one last thing I would say if that breaks the tie for you  let's see oh we already talked about cam Reddit or excuse me CAM Johnson and shade and sharp Paul says they're a possibility of Portland sitting Simons Houston sitting Shango and or Chicago sitting Kobe white toward the end of the season  good question  I don't I don't think Chicago sits Kobe I he's so he's young and he's in theory a part of their future if they do decide to rebuild I think they just want reps there's one to get reps I don't think Houston will sit shengwen again another young guy  I they're they're in a weird spot though at 21 and 24 if they're starting hot Portland sitting Simons I think that's actually the most likely  because Portland is so bad  and Ivy or excuse me and Simon's Simon says 24 I feel like that could go either way I feel like they won't sit them because part of me feels like  I mean Portland's horrible with him playing anyway and part of me feels like they'll sit there other vets they'll trade Brogden and they'll be like hey Sammy's you want to score 305 every night that'll be awesome for us and for you so  I don't think either I need those are particularly  that no no I'm at least worried about Kobe white I'm really not worried about Shawnee either I mean Houston I think it's pretty likely to be that Houston is at least like in the play and mix until the end of the season you know it's like if you were to sit maybe would be like the last week but I just don't see it I mean I don't know what the motivation would be still young enough you're developing him you want as many reps as possible you know Houston does owe a top four protected pick to the Thunder but you know they're not they're not gonna feel good about their chances to get into the bottom four here so I don't I don't think we see anything weird at the end of the year where they try to save that pick you know they also have Brooklyn's first rounder coming in I believe that's completely unprotected so that kind of cancels out anyway so yeah I mean five minutes you could maybe see it but because Portland is like on that line where like they could I think right now they have the 5th horse record and they're like three games better than Charlotte so maybe maybe at the end of the year if they really wanted to try to push for for top four lottery odds I could see it but yeah the other two not not really worth about it all  right I said I think it's more so that Brogden is helping them win games so I would the wrong move I think it's gonna make a lot more difference on like a sign yes situation  Adidas says which players should I drop to bring Kyrie and Evan boldly off of ir it's got a drop two of Draymond Wiggins and Wendell Carter tough call  I think I would drop Wiggins I think that to me is like the the very quick like my snap decision I'm 100% cool to drop to drop Wiggins  Wendell Carter vs draymond's a little interesting because Wendell Carter's been playing better lately  uh I think  honestly I think they're upside is pretty similar in terms of like even  yeah 12 team cats pretty similar upside I will say one call Window Carter gets hurt all the time I mean he got hurt early or the season he just never played more than 62 games in a year I'd be worried about him getting hurt again  maybe Jerry mom gets suspended again who knows  also but yeah I guess if you may if you made me pick going to my head as they say I would drop weekends and window Carter but I think any combination of those two if one of them involves weekends is fine  yep I'm with you there Carter versus green is really tough I probably oh man I'd probably dropped by know Carter you know it's been great for a week and a half he's been really bad and injured for like 15 other weeks so that would just kind of break the tie for me all right let's see what else we got here it's interesting question relating to the Hawks from Corey Jack he says thoughts on Yucca Kung woo odds capella gets traded  I mean the Hawks are a disaster right now there's 19 and 27 they are in 10 I mean we're talking about a I would say likely playing team at this point but I mean it feels like when they lose they've just been like it's been so bad you know all their losses feel like blowout slightly capella could get traded  you know he's he expires after next year so you're getting you know a year and a half  I don't you know 22 million next year and I don't think that's like that big man Albatross I just I don't know how many teams really want that archetype a player right now you know I mean that really the team that comes to be the Knicks it's like they would they view him that's kind of Mitchell Robinson Replacements We'll see if Robinson could get back  other than that it's he's just one of those guys that everybody's like yeah he's a good player we don't really want him though but yeah I mean at some point they're going to unleash a combo I really hope so man I have a man like every long-term League that I'm in I'm like I'm not hunting on this guy I think he's like he reminds me so much about when he's out there and they just they refused to play him I don't say the odds that think about gets traded to me 40 5 Cent that's fine yeah I part of me wonders if he qualifies is he a negative asset at 22 million for next year you know would they have to actually make a move like would he would almost be a glorified like salary dump to get rid of I don't know capella so yeah like Nick said how many guys are looking for  presumably you're bringing in cappella probably not to be your starter unless you are the Knicks  and then you want a guy playing 20 minutes for 22 million  you know maybe Orlando try something but I think they like one to encourage Junior Etc um look at I think if you can if you can stash a cockroach on your roster until the trade deadline just to just a hope do it because the Kong was again someone who's finding a roster  because you can play on when they have you know Hawks are on a four game week or something it's going to be nice but  it's it's tough to say  Can Harrison Barnes keep up this production  we'll do this one quickly because we addressed it at the top of the show no definitely not that did not stop me from going out and picking him up in a very important League this weekend he scored 32 39 and 20 in three straight games prior to that you can take a pretty large sample here we'll take his last I don't know 25 games before this little spree the average 9 points on 47% shooting the thing is he's beneficial it's like he's having a bad year it just has a low usage drain doesn't really do anything no I mean the much much larger sample suggests that this is one of his like two or three times a year where he goes crazy and reminds people that he's actually pretty good but in general I think you should probably expect closer to like 12 points three or four rebounds one or two assists you know cross your fingers for a block of steel  the past  five years seven years of data on Harrison Barnes tells you that like his best case scenario is he's maybe the hunter 25th ranked player in cats and gets 27 fans he points and that's  if he does that for like a really long stretch which I don't think he's talking about going to do now so I'm cool with picking up picking him up while he's hot like Nick said but he could just as easy go back to averaging 12 again for the rest of the year  all right  I don't know if this is a question or just a statement from Christopher but this is interesting he said the one thing that drives me crazy with all fantasy analysis people alike it's important to play the guys with the four game week as a three or two how often to any of them even play for in a week so if we're reading this correctly is this is this a  assessment that it's not that important to have a difference between two three four games because you know with rest and injuries guys don't likely play for anyway is that is that your read of this  I think it's more of like  there's a pretty good you have like a you know like a 35th ranked player on on three games and like a 60th ranked player on on four games  you know why play the worst player when the chances of them not playing four games is pretty high my argument I sort of against this would be  the part the player has more chances to play more games yeah then the odds of them playing like you can miss I think the odds of a guy missing one game are the same  so then it doesn't really matter like if you play a guy on a three game week I think his chance is a missing a game and they're going down to two is just as high as a guy playing four games going down to three unless they are known injury risk if there are Al Horford or somewhere or Gordon Hayward or whoever but you have to like its it sounds really primitive like If You're Gonna Play just add up the Fantasy Point averages and you know multiply it by their chances to play or like you know the total stats across the board and a roto League how many points rebounds assistance this guy possibly going to average if he plays all of his games because all we can assume is that a guy is going to play all the games in a week unless again it's a known guy who sits back to backs or is always heard or something like that  and those guys have been fewer and further between this season right I mean likewise playing back-to-backs right I mean LeBron and AD State healthy it's like a lot of these guys that we kind of stayed away from or were really cautious about its they've had better health than you'd expect so yeah I think what you the number one point you brought up is you can make the same case if you say well a guy had a four game week you might only play three well if you have three game week but I only play two if you have two game week might only play one and there's just there's just not that many players right now who are like oh it's back to back he's for sure setting out you know you might you might fix it in every now and then like the T wolves did that with my Conley last week although it wasn't even on a back-to-back weirdly enough there's just nothing you can do about that and that's when you want a guy in a foreign week because then you're not kicking yourself and saying oh man I'm only getting two games out of this guy all right we got our daily scoot Henderson question keep scoot in a nine cat League or use it as a streaming spot instead I've streamed it for now unless you I do I do think I'm on record all year out so there's going to be a time when scoot is good I think he could have like a shade and sharp type of run at the end of the year  it just hasn't been happening right like if you're putting scoot it like a weekly lineup right now it is it is actively damaging your team more often than not so I would stream it  it's killer man eight minutes again on January 19th six minutes against the Spurs two games ago  it is really hard to recommend a guy who is who is dealing with that I you know Brogden  I assume he's going to get traded  give scooter chance but scoot hasn't done that much when he's been giving more minutes so  again I my advice I give this blanket advice a lot if you're near the top of your standings  sure  if you need production if you're in the middle you're standing you're six things you're trying to get the third for cash or whatever it is you got to just get guys on your roster we're doing stuff right now to climb up the standings  thoughts on Mark Williams and Zach Lavine like I wish we had Insider info on William specifically we got the quote unquote not close to returning update a little over a week ago who knows what that means Charlotte is one ten games this season you know they're not rushing anybody back I think at this point got to expect these out through the All-Star break you know that's a nice like seven eight days off for Charlotte where you know maybe that's the kind of boost he needs but I don't know man I mean this this could also just be a total loss season and then Levine like he's legit injured but I also think this is a trade deadline thing I don't think they really want to risk anything I think he's likely going to be dealt and the latest update on him came I think Friday they said he's going to miss at least another week so  you know if he's out all of this week they play tomorrow they play Wednesday they play Saturday and then they have five more games before the All-Star break  we'll see I mean that could also you know the trade deadline is sprinkled in there too  you know it's possible they played his last game for the Bulls  oh yeah yeah I think I think everything is about both those guys is Right wheel we don't have any you know inside that aren't described on road a wire or anything more than any other beat writer said yeah all right we'll do a couple more and then we'll be out interesting one here from Skeeter  trade porzingis for Turner and women Yamaha for checked trying to prep for playoffs scared of a Wendy shutdown and KP continuing to sit games  yeah I mean I don't mind the the line of thinking here I think the framework makes some sense you know women Yama and Chet have been  at the very least comparable the season you know when behnaz you know on balance the better fantasy player just by the minutes restriction you know I'm with you on Port Sanchez you know I got hurt over the weekend doesn't seem like it's too serious but you know it's just feels like you're always waiting for that injury to come  um yeah there's a tough man because Turner Turner is been like playing at like a 80 ranked level lately and porzingis yeah porzingis is kind of get hurt when he's been the 9th ranked player over the past 30 days he's playing limited minutes he's playing back-to-backs now the minutes are back up chats more in the 60 range during this stretch I think it's fine to do if you're worried about those things  but it's um man I would I I would be just as worrying about either scenario I'd be worrying about trading like I worried that I'd flip the coin and be the wrong thing no matter what that's yeah if you can I would say I would wait to do this because I don't think the Wendy shut down is imminent I agree with you I think I think it probably happens at some point although I don't see the Spurs falling out of the bottom four you know that's really the number one concern but they're yeah I think there is it's almost like a picture with an with an Innings limit you know coming into the year you know we've seen that with like young pictures and even some older guys before where it's yeah they're pretty far on that if there's some dude for the Marlins this past year anybody who follows baseball is probably like you're an idiot this is like a big name guy but that's kind of how I view weapon like I think I think they might have like a number in their mind of like this number of minutes you know we've run the numbers with our training staff and like there's like an optimal you know number for him where they wanted to get you know a certain amount of experience without exposing him to risk but the Spurs I mean they played 46 games so  if he gets shot down you know maybe it's a mix of you know you're mixing in some days off or you know misses the final 10 games of the year like I don't see women Yama missing like what the final 25 games I would I would try to build this as long as I can with what Minneapolis yeah because last year with the Spurs did is they would just play guys like two games and then sit them two games and then sit them one game sit three games sit they will get like shut guys down but that's  to an extent you know like that's  almost just as harmful because you think you're getting three games against one you can't even start the guy or whatever  yeah yeah exactly right all right we'll do yeah maybe two more maybe the penultimate Draymond Green rows here or hartenstein rest of season  I mean Rozier has not done that much since it's going to the heat three games averaging nine points on 11 shots so that's gonna increase he'll probably averaged more like 14 or 15 points his shooting is just been off so I think look again Rosie I think he's gonna be like 14 and 5 probably for the rest of the year based on what we've seen through three games which is pretty solid but I think that will there's a good chance that is worse than Draymond and I think there is a good chance that is worse than what heart and she's doing for you the heart and Achilles injury is  mildly concerning but we don't know yet if he's going to have a something that's limited so uh that's that's hard to say  yeah I I'm a little more optimistic on Rozier like I think if he ever just 14 4 and 5 the rest of the way like that'd be a little disappointing I think you're hoping for more but there are a lot of mouths to feed in Miami like more than anything it just depends on like does bamboo just Jimmy Butler continue to miss time just Tyler hero Miss 10 games at some point you know it's like they're going to be weeks or stretches right there grows your plays really well you know it's important to know what hartenstein top 35 guy in category leaks in the last month you know it's not only the high volume rebounds but almost two steals a game one and a half blocks so he's been probably even better than you might expect so this is really difficult  and then Draymond you know just you look at you never like Blown Away by a stat line but it kind of adds up for fantasy  I I think I would rank them  I think I would go hardest time drape it hardened Rose your dream about I mean Rosie versus dream on is so close so such different players but yeah you got pretty good options there all right last last real question that we got one more I want to hit Joel session I flip LeBron for Deonte Murray and Jabari Smith I just lost Julius Randle and I lost John Moran I feel like I need to make a move  14 team category leak um  Jabari Smith's alright I mean I have 14 team leadership rostered for sure he's gotta be a fringe starter for you I think  um I don't I don't mind this trade um Murray is worse than LeBron fantasy but not a lot they're separated by like 20 ranks and Cat over the past month or so  so getting Jabari Smith back not bad I don't hear any better sweetener mostly because I think John Jay Murray could get traded to a worse situation that's situation could be playing with LeBron that's true yeah so I I don't think this is like a terrible trade but if somebody offered me Lebron for Murray and Smith I think I would take it as the way I would put that  yeah I yeah I think it's a good point we don't know about  Marie's situation you might want to wait until after the deadline see what happens yeah I just I would just started to do a little better than jabbari for your for your second option depends on the on the guys roster obviously or girls roster but yeah I don't I'm just not like I like I really like him I just think he's been misused and I'm not that excited about him for Fantasy we talked earlier about like the seven threes and fours that Houston has right now and sorting through all that so I would just try to do a little bit better because I mean LeBron's coming off of like his best statistical Game of the Year write 3620 and 12 the other night you know try to try to deal him to somebody who doesn't think he's gonna get hurt and you know see if you can really push the push the boundaries like I wouldn't go in with this offer like this is this is arguably fair but I think you I would start a little bit higher and make somebody say no all right last one Dennis says love the kings of raptors are working in the frame's there we go just put these up today can you share the artist I can I will link his Twitter in the chat is Ryan Simpson however I got these a long time ago probably like I don't know seven this years ago and I don't know that the store is still active I know every now and then he'll do you know he'll tweet something out and be like all the stores back up but it's been it's been very hit or miss and hasn't been as consistent as it was used to sell a bunch of you know  really cool stuff mostly NBA related but some pop culture some
