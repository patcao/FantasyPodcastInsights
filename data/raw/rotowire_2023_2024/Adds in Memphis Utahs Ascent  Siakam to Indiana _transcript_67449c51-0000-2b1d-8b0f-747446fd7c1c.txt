it's Wednesday morning Nick Whalen Brandon Kravitz here with you you're listening to the road of wire fantasy basketball pod we're here with you every Wednesday morning around 10:30 a.m. eastern Brandon another kind of weird week of the NBA we had the holiday on Monday obviously the NBA does not take MLK day off if anything they load up so we've had a busy week already coming off of a a relatively light Tuesday night slave only three games last night but they're pretty good ones right we saw Phoenix come back to beat the Sacramento Kings coming to rant hitting a pair free throws with just over a second left to see all that I was watching OKC and the Clippers late last night super fun game Paul George completely took over in the last five minutes to will LA to a 12817 win and we got the yokich and bead showdown in Philly last night 126 121 was the victory for the 76ers 41 and 10 for Joelle Beach did you catch any of the yolk Beach Showdown I did I was on the it was it was one of those where as a you have the sports fan side of your brain and interest and you have the sports betting site for more intrigued of the storyline of of matching up big man MVPs and Philadelphia and Denver but I was on the Suns minus four and a half last night so I I found myself gravitating towards Suns Kings and that's the disgusting thing about sports betting is that it takes you away sometimes from what the main storyline is but both games were tremendous dwell in beat I don't think he knows how to score less than 40 points at this point that was a heroic effort and something that it wasn't even like he's just like getting these easy buckets around the rim being the the massive body that he is his mid-range game is virtually Unstoppable so the it was both games were a joy to watch in their own right even though I lost my pet yeah we were talking on the RotoWire NBA show which you can hear on Sirius XM NBA every evening from 6 to 6:30 Central about the the points plus rebounds prop for and be I want to say it was only 44 and a half and like that's Joy of being care so much more about this game against yokich then yokich does on the other side of things like I you absolutely know and be just going to bring it in that spot and certainly did I mean the fact that this was a close game it was a high scoring game that certainly helped me in a bead played 39 minutes this was 78 I was I believe it was tagged yeah 7878 at the half that's more points than the Blazers scored in an entire game last week  so very very true and Blazers but nonetheless well I mean you know it's a tough sledding for them these days you still had a whole home 2519 effort from Nicole yoka so it's not like he was he was bad by any means but this team's not nearly as good away from the house as they are at Denver and then yeah then you had that that Sun's comeback that really spurred by Durant played great gray Grayson Allen was a monster last night the guy had like seven threes by half-time I was watching through the Kings stream and they just they could not stop glowing about Grayson Allen in the king's inability to stop him around the perimeter the king's LED that game by 18 points Midway through the order you know with like five minutes left this looked like it was completely sewn up and you know the sun's closed strong in the third end of outscoring Sacramento 35 to 21 in the final period and you eventually did Grayson Allen nine of 14 from three on the night KD he had four threes on his way to 27 points good night for Bradley Beal as well only ended up with 13 but started to feel his effect a little bit more for this son's team you know kind of offset of what was a below average night for Devin Booker scoring wise just 16 points on 14 shots but didn't have 11 assists I mean Phoenix now you know 22 and 18 I still don't know if this is a team that's going to show us what we want to see from them in the regular season they have won three straight those will come over the Lakers the Blazers and Sacramento they are at the Pelicans on Friday which should be a pretty good test after that indeed Chicago Dallas Indy I I'm certainly not punting on the sons I know when they they went through that that rougher patch like around Christmas you know we started to talk about man what's the ultimate upside of this team I still think they're gonna be really good I don't know that I would take them you know over a team like Denver I think you know Phoenix the Lakers Golden State those teams to me are still kind of in a similar basket although I'm starting to worry about the Warriors Brandon you know especially and we'll get into this later you know I you laughed at me when I said that at this after game one of the season I just want to point that out okay game one of the Season yes I I did not foresee Draymond Green being suspended twice Klay Thompson falling off a cliff you know trayce Jackson Davis becoming their starting center what we'll talk about the the well you know that all right all right that's that's kind of a scary thought for me but we'll talk about the Pascal siakam you know rumored potential trade to Indiana I think that was the one thing where it's like at the Lakers could turn you know if they could do that deal with or without kaminga obviously you prefer to keep him I think you probably have to put them in that deal unless you give it up you know Big Time draft Capital you know I think the October to that team does it make them the title favorite know definitely not does it push them at least into that conversation perhaps but I think it at least would bring them into the play and Zone into you know maybe that the push for the five six seven seed and the Western Conference in basketball soccer ends up in Indiana you know we could talk about what that means for the Pacers but I think that would be that would be kind of take in the number one trade Target off the table for the Warriors and I don't I don't know where you turn there I mean there are some secondary options but I think siakam to me is probably the biggest impact player who could be available like I would much rather you know give up two or three first rounders and a couple role players for soccer and I would Zach  Levine yeah and I think if you're looking at it from the from the Raptors perspective whose picks would you rather have honestly I think I'd rather have golden states because if the trade didn't work out this team is really struggling to keep up in the western conference right now and and so that's I think that that's a factor here when you look at it from the Raptor side who would you rather have Bruce Brown was the speculated piece the big piece to come over from Indiana I'd rather take my chances on Jonathan coming up I do think it would help the Golden State Warriors tremendously  do I all the sudden think they're title contenders know I still like all those teams that are bunched up at the top and the West a little bit better and then you have teams that haven't quite put it all together like the Dallas Mavericks the Kings the the Suns that I would still like better than we're golden state is right now but that definitely pushes Golden State into the playoffs assuming they don't deal with a major blow injury wise so that should definitely be something the Golden State Warriors are pushing hard to do but yeah this Indiana stuff Shams is reporting it seems to have a lot of steam and it's a team that's sitting in the sixth spot right now in the East that plays no defense whatsoever ask Kelsey Occam can help in that regard  so before we dive in on what that could look like because I think it's a fun conversation to have even though that trade is not happened like you said when it gets to the point where we get the Champs tweet we get the full article at the athletic with it you know that that means that talks are pretty serious so I think we could be heading you know toward a trade being finalized in the next week or so but again it's you know someone speculation at this point talk about Golden State and you know the assets that they have to potentially trade I forgot that they owe their first round pick to Portland this season it's top four protected so you know it all likelihood barring a you know complete fall off by The Warriors or a disaster a lottery night that will convey this season like you know they could handle over anywhere from like the 10th to the 15th pick right now to Portland if it were not to convey this year if that did land at the top four it's only top one protected in 2025 and then it would become unprotected in 2026 and if my memory serves me correctly Brandon I believe that trade dates all the way back to the Andre Iguodala Memphis deal in 2019 wow wow yeah a couple times since then and usually with the contenders that is the case that is something that we should have taken and I should have taken into consideration when talking about potential first round picks on the move when you're dealing with teams like the Golden State Warriors and the Boston Celtics or LA Lakers these teams are trading first round picks they do not care about that they are trying to stay heavily in contention and those first round picks at the back end of the first round are essentially trade chips and not real assets to build a roster well it's also sad because you know at the time you're thinking 2024 like who know maybe the league would even exist at that point like that's so far the future will be in a bubble Curry will probably be retired at that point it's like no no 2024 has has arrived quickly I mean I know I think they they sent a 2030 pick to Washington as part of the Jordan Poole deal that was another one where it's like all right yeah remind me in five years and before we know what that one will be conveying as well but let's let's talk about the ciac you know potential addition for the Indiana Pacers and by the way as we always do guys if you're if you're new if you're watching a Long Live throw some questions in the Stream we'll hit those over the second half of the podcast we'll get to as many as we can if not all them so continue to throw those questions in there we see them we acknowledge them and we will answer that before we had out so on siakam you know the rumor deal would basically be you know three first round picks according to Shams you know there was some some you know reporting that Bruce Brown would like to be included for salary purposes fantasy wise and we'll start with that aspect of it I think this would be ideal for Pascal siaca right you know I think yaakov Landing in Golden state that would be a disaster but you know I think Golden State plays such a unique brand of basketball I think there could be a learning curve you know it's like how does he fit in and see the true second option is is there you know kind of a reverence a deference to Klay Thompson who's still kind of trying to cling to that title I think the Occam Landing in Indy would be so perfect for Fantasy not only do they put a ton of points they allow us on a points they play close games they play at a fast pace and you know they have Tyrese Albert whose their number one guy but  you know he's a high usage player in terms of what he does for other players like he could score when he needs to but I think Pascale in Indy would almost be a code number one as opposed to just sliding it as a number two or number three elsewhere and you know some of these other destinations like Dallas Sacramento they've been on the list it's like if you were to go to one of those teams like to me he's a pretty clear number three and I think it could actually be downgrade for him whereas if he lands in Indy if this trade goes through I think I'm upgrading Pascal siakam Fantasy Valley  I would I don't think it's that different from where he is right now but it's definitely a tick if anything it's a tick up with Indiana and you nailed it it's the distribution that is created by Tyrese Halliburton Steph Curry is one of the best point guards ever but it's because of what he does from the 3-point line Klay Thompson is a diminished version of himself but still one of the best shooting guards of all time because of what he does from the three-point line not because he's getting forwards involved so that you worry about with Dallas obviously the ball sticks to Kyrie and Luka Duncan so where the opportunities the the Pacers played a Breakneck speed you figure his usage will stay high because of the hierarchy within that offense I think it would completely tanked the value obviously of a Jalen Smith of an Obi toppin just based on the way the rotations would go on the Raptors side you figure more of the scoring load falls on Scotty Barnes things start to open up for Jalen McDaniels we had a question about him on last week's episode that you and I did so I think things not only are they better for Pascal seacon with  the trade to Indiana they clear things up pretty easily for the Toronto side as well  yeah I  think there'd be a lot to be excited about there and you know if it would just be Bruce Brown as the the loan like you know real impact player heading Toronto you know I that to me doesn't really move the needle a ton and I think it would be it would be a boost for the guys who are already there right I mean that just that kind of adds more for Scotty Barnes that's more for a manual quickly and you know maybe maybe opens up you know a little more space for some of the depth pieces that the Raptors have and I think would also signal some of a reboot I wouldn't say rebuild because you have enough pieces here where you're not you're not going to completely bottom out but you know the other part of this of course and you know as Don sicario in the chat points out he says as a Raptors fan I'd rather they extend siakam they get a bad deal and trade him down the line totally understand that perspective I think if you're getting three first rounders that's pretty good you know we'll see what the protections are on those although you forecast like what are the Pacers look like over the next three to four years they're probably at worst a League average team at the absolute worst you know those picks are likely conveying in the in the early 20s you would imagine so it's you know you're not looking at some sort of Treasure Trove you know net Celtics Gerald Wallace type of deal here but I think that might just be the market for an expiring player in Seattle and then if you're Indie you know are you comfortable extending Pascal siaka because if you're giving up three first round picks Forum it's not a rental like that's that's part of the deal you turns 30 in a couple of months I would be fine with that I mean we we continue to see a ton of players play well into their mid-30s I think that's something you know I was talking to what was on the on the NBA show last night you know I think part of the reason the league is so deep right now with overall Talent is obviously we have a ton of great young players but the Old Guard has not really phased out right like the guys who were running the league 10 years ago are still extremely relevant if not still running the league right like I think you go back a decade and you know guys who were you know running the league in the early 2000s they were starting to fade out by the time they hit 33 34 35 whereas Curry Durant LeBron Hardin you could even throw like Paul George Kauai in that camp like all these guys are still playing at a high level so roundabout way of saying you know if you're giving Pascal saieko a three plus one type of deal like I think that's fine I don't think he's gonna fall off a cliff when he's 33 so the where I would say I understand where the the fan that chimed in they're trepidation with the deal like this how many teams can we look at and I'm not asking this question rhetorically but I I really would love to know the answer how many teams that are really good right now have been built up because of a trade that they made where they collected a slew of first drum picks  is there a sample of that in the NBA because we see this type of deal all the time but if there's no example of it paying off what is it really worth because we all know this is not like the NFL you trade for three first round picks in the NFL you are stealing in the NBA doesn't really work like that it can just I would love to know what what teams is it the Thunder like who do we look at you  when and you know the Thunder you know most of the most part those are their own picks that they've hit on right yeah it's not like they like the chat homegood pick wasn't theirs in you know obviously SGA is their primary piece and they got him as part of one of those trades where they also got a bunch of draft picks but it's not like they they inherited that pick and then three years later took him so no I think that's a very good point I think way more often than not these picks end up falling in the middle to bottom third of the draft and unlike the NFL where you still get you know Big Time impact players in the late first round in the second and the third round in the NBA or in the NFL in the NBA if those picks fall outside of the lottery I mean good luck like we've seen teams do it you know obviously you know you got your Diamonds in the Rough every year but it becomes exponentially harder if those picks are falling in the 20s as opposed to falling in the top five and again I don't see I don't see India as a team that's that's gonna be bottoming out anytime soon barring bad injury luck that could strike anybody yeah and the first round picks of course you're not gonna end up using all of them if you trade for Bunch but it and this is where OKC has and they're still sitting on a bank of it you use it as currency right but at some point as a fan like that's great if we're on a podcast with a general manager and they would sell us on why they love collecting picks so much but as a fan what does that really do for you you're looking for your team to get better as quickly as possible without you know flash frying it to where you impact your team negatively down the road for five years that's how fans think so it's hard to wrap your head around trading a really good player that is highly valuable and Pascal siakam so that you can sit on first drum picks for a couple of years I think that's really tough for fans to Grapple with all right I want to talk about the Jazz and want to talk about the Grizzlies before we start hitting some questions in the chat but first we got a message from our friends at FanDuel tackle millions in prizes all

right let's talk some Grizzlies I can't remember his team having worse injury luck than this Brandon this is getting completely out of hand in it started with Steven Adams you know right before the season we find out oh he's actually not back he's going to miss the entire year and it is completely snowballed from there I mean they're basically down to Jaron Jackson as like the you know the the loan key guy in this rotation over the course of like five days you know Jaba rant out for the season Marcus Smart out several weeks Desmond Bane out several weeks and you know it's been a disaster I think the Grizzlies cannot Salvage their season at this point I think they are a total cross off for me and you know well we'll see where where they end up in the 2024 draft I think that's kind of the only way you can approach this fantasy wise it becomes very interesting we can talk about the Jared Jackson side of this in a moment I'm looking on Yahoo right now at the most added players in the last 24 hours Far and Away two Memphis Grizzlies GG Jackson and Vince Williams yeah and I mean I would not Overlook a guy like Luke Kennard I don't know how heavily rostered he is at this point but David Roddy is gonna play significant minutes here too I think you're just sort of taking uh you're you're taking a an educated guess as to who is going to really be the consistent contributor but it's worth taking a plunge on some of these guys because of all the minutes that have now opened up with these injuries and you're right this team at 15 and 25 they are in no man's land right now they can't compete with the Pistons Hornets Wizards and Spurs for the most lottery balls because those teams are so far behind you most can't even catch them in traveling backwards and they're not going anywhere with the roster they have so there's sort of stuck in this  like top of the top of the bottom quarter of the NBA but those are all guys that you should be targeting if you've got the roster space they have a four-game week next week they have a four-game week the week after and then a three-game week which ends up being a it's a pretty light week overall we're talking the first you know full week in February so the vast majority of The League is on a three-game week at that point so the schedule for the most part Works in their favor yeah I obviously Jackson has had back-to-back really nice games GG Jackson that is I think they'll give him a more opportunity right I mean most of these guys that we talked about are not coming back anytime soon Jake laravia you know one of their picks from last year he's out as well that opens up a little bit more opportunity so I'm I'm very intrigued by GG Jackson he's from South Carolina second rounder in 2023 really was you know bouncing back and forth he's on a two-way it was in the G league for for most of the early part of the Season really had not been in the rotation at all before that next game over the weekend but 20.6 boards in a block in their lost to the Knicks and then 23.6 rebounds two steals two blocks in their win over Golden State on MLK days so I'm very  intrigued there and you know I have no issue whatsoever adding Jackson or Vince Williams like you said Kenard he's roster in 2568 he's a 3-pointers specialist but you know as bad as the Grizzlies will likely be for the next couple of months there there will be points to be had and I think he's worth adding if you're in a 14 or a 16 Team league for sure yeah and Gigi Jackson for those that look at the the 23 points off the bench that he had in that last game it didn't stop there to Steals and two blocks a lot to ask for night tonight but like we've said this is now opened up opportunities for guys on the roster and this is how second round picks get discovered in the NBA because the minutes just would not have been there if this team were fully stocked and healthy so the three-point shooting will keep him active and a contributor for the Memphis Grizzlies and then if you can get those defensive stats on top of it absolutely wins so I might need to go buy me some GG Jackson stock and we hop off the pod that's a definitely somebody worth looking at I I grabbed him in a couple of daily leagues you know my my two like highest dollar leaks the NFP KC and the stake lie you know our ESPN you know waivers run Sunday night situation so we'll keep you posted on Monday when I'm back with Alex baruto for what those guys go for I think it's this is a going to be a fascinating Fab bid because you know both of these guys are relatively unknown they don't really have name value I think it's gonna be super interesting to see you know how much people are willing to Pony up but there could be rest of season value here because I know Bane smart those guys should be back at some point I'm not saying they're gonna shut him down I think they will play again but I mean how many games do they play do they come back and you know play five to 10 games and all the sudden you know where we're in March and Memphis starts you know looking at the lottery and wanting to try to get you know as many ping pong balls as they can we've seen this before from teams in this situation the other side of this is Jerry Jackson who is the the loan you know big name healthy Grizzly these days I have them in a bunch of League's I have them in the stake League I could have traded him I was offered Jalen Duren and Bruce Brown  I had to turn it down I didn't I didn't love it I mean obviously during his fantastic for a few categories but doing okay and rebound so that one was a little unappealing but I thought it was a fair fair request at the time  I am very worried about his efficiency going forward you know I think the the performance that we saw against the Warriors unfortunately is emblematic of a lot of the games we saw from him early in the season when he was kind of the lone healthy grizzly 4 of 20 from the field three of 14 from 3 like I absolutely love Jared Jackson but we've said a bunch on this pod he needs he needs the infrastructure around him to be the player that he is you do not want Darren Jackson being your number one option you know somebody who's creating his own shots he has no business taking 14 three-pointers in a game so I do think you know there's going to be an uptick in raw scoring I think the defensive stats should sustain relatively speaking it's been at disappointment compared to last year I very much worried about what he's going to do to my field goal percentage category yeah as you should be and I think it is of the many things that I hope we've been spot on for you guys throughout the duration of this podcast as we know dip into 2024 I think this is the note that we have hit the most accurately throughout the course of the Season how just how much Jaron Jackson Juniors offensive Game and his offensive efficiency is you've put it really relies on the presence of of John Moran well John Moran opens up for him in terms of taking that pressure off the way he sets up Jaron Jackson the pick-and-roll game it's a two-man game they play out there and without the head of the snake Darren Jackson Jr is just left out there to die so to speak 41% shooting over the last 10 games look at the last two scored 18 points and 21 so it looks good raw stats are like okay I can do that 20% and 30% from the field that is atrocious especially for a guy as big as he is I just don't see this ending well if if you're in a league that relies on shooting percentages  yeah in the very small sample of games that he's played with John Moran this season he's shooting 51% from the field he's shooting 43% without John Moran you know it's it's a noticeable drop off and it was a media right like as soon as John came back you kind of saw a change in Jaron Jackson's game I think he was able to focus a little bit more on the defensive stats the blocks started to come around and you know I think it's we're kind of back to to early season Karen Jackson now and I think the defensive stats might be a little bit spottier still gonna have those explosive performances but I think to me a lot of those are going to be matchup bass yeah I think they're gonna run into a lot of opponents who can handle Jerry Jackson you're not really worried about anybody else on this roster so I would look into offloading him I wouldn't I wouldn't take like a you know take a massive loss on this one but if you can get a fair deal I think now you know the sooner the better as far as trying to offload him let's talk some jazz quick then we'll start hitting we'll start hitting questions in the chat you talk 15 and 4 in their last 19 games you know I was looking through some of the future draft pick you know transactions right now Brandon they owe their first round pick to OKC and it is top 10 protected so there's not you know Utah has to either solidify their place in the bottom 10 or make sure they're out of the bottom 10 or you're handing over a pick to the Warriors and I think it would certainly be preferable if you're taught to try to hold on to that look at how it conveys you know it's top 10 protected next year as well and then top eight protected the year after that so pretty similar protections the next couple of years Utah has been on a complete surge I mean they are they've completely flipped the narrative on their season obviously Lauren marketing has been a big part of that they're up to the nine spot in the Western Conference a game behind Phoenix just two and a half behind the Pelicans for the six seed in the west my question do you Brandon is this in any ways to sustainable I want to say yes because I think this Jazz team when they're good is really fun and they'll be they'll be slept on for another month so some some opportunities in the betting market for sure which I love to partake in my issue is they did this to us last year they did it earlier last year they were one of the hottest teams right out of the gate and they looked like they could not be beat and right now looks like the Jazz may never lose again they've won nine of their last 10 games they've won six in a row I I fear the pessimistic side of me says maybe this is just who they are with the collection of talent they have marking and Sexton Jordan Clarkson being the core three right now  where they can run really hot and then they're gonna tail off right now they're running really hot I I want to buy into it but I'm a little bit scared from what I saw last year at the start of the season so I I'm gonna say no it's not sustainable but that's all so an easy thing to say when they're not losing right now because this this isn't quite who they are all right let's start hidden questions in the chat keep throwing those in there we will go in chronological order as we always do and we start with an Amity Simon's question our question asker says I would like to trade away Anthony Simons who can I realistically Target maybe package him with one of Duncan Robinson Dante Devin chenzo on Yucca Kung woo or Alex Caruso yeah I think those are all fair attachments all have value in their own way and yeah Simon Says an interesting one I mean he's been kind of all over the map you when he first came back you was super hot right out of the gate you know that missed a few games with the illness hasn't really looked quite the same since then he had that big game against Brooklyn a couple of weeks ago you know played well against Phoenix in their last game over the weekend but as mixed in some pretty pretty ugly shooting performance is he's got a five of 16 a one of eight over 10 against Minnesota you know five days ago so I I understand wanting to offload Anfernee Simons I wouldn't worry a ton necessarily about him you know being a it a load management candidate down the stretch I think Portland's not gonna have trouble losing any games with him in the lineup but if you are looking to deal Anthony Simons do any names come to mind Brandon I will say I would wait for him to have like two good games back to back and then try to do it because right now you know anybody paying attention is going to be like I don't know if I want to play you know full price for Simon's you know the way he's played over the last two weeks so I this would not be the time to do it because you'd be buying Sky High but then I'm I might have I might rather have Grayson Allen right now I is that is that a retaking too deep of a plunge there I I mean if he's if he's giving you nine threes a game no but I mean that's he's played well I'll give him that very well he hasn't been just one that one game was a maybe his best but he's been really good  I think you could probably get multiple players especially if you wait like Nick said after a good performance for me for any Simon's because when he's at his best he's a he's a he's a stat monster he's a scoring machine Jaime Hawkins if he continues to get opportunities in Miami this guy's playing like obviously he's not gonna win rookie of the year because of the rookies that he's going up against whimby and Chet Holmgren but he's in most years he's playing like a guy that could be part of that conversation I think you could get him and something else and maybe you beef up your roster that way just a couple I'm just trying to think creatively think of how you can do this it's really hard to offload Blazers players with how bad that team is a that at any point when you try and pull this off their team could score 77 on you yeah that's it's sometimes I can be hard yeah I mean a couple names to come to mind for me maybe like Austin Reeves Devon vessel you know Colin Sexton has been a much better fantasy player over the last couple weeks and certainly over the last month the assignments so yeah I think Simon's has main value he's going to still going to give you plenty of Boom performances over the rest of the year so I don't think you're going to have to take a major loss here but again I understand the motivation I think you know the highest you could aim would be like a you know Tobias Harris CJ McCollum something like that Zach LaVine You'll Play A lot of people are down on but I special if you're willing to you know to add one of those roll guys to the package I don't think you have to settle you know for for like a true role player like you should be able to get something of pretty decent value you could end up targeting like if you really think Pascal sea and we're fighting somebody else that you think is about to get traded and then trade for a player that's on that same roster so trade for a raptor whose value is going to increase in the next week or so could be a route to go  thoughts on Keegan Murray and D'Angelo Russell asks our friend Alex  I'm not a Russell guy I just I absolutely hate watching him he's got new hair going on as well which was a little bit jarring he's a little bit better over the last few games many went through that stretch right just kind of bottomed out and mid December they ended up binging and he's been back in the lineup over the last two games just starting lineup That is the averaging 19 points 6 assists over his last five games he's giving you you know pretty high volume Threes And when I say I don't like them I mean more in real life than in fantasy so I don't know I mean in general I don't know if you're asking if you should trade for them or you know what the rest of season value looks like I think he'll you know kind of hover around being a top 100 player you know with the upside to climb closer to the top 75 and then you know Keegan Murray  points threes occasional defensive stats decent rebounder you know for his position kind of swings between the four and the five for them the free throw percentage just spent a little disappointing all the way he doesn't take enough that it really matters all that much you know I'm I played mostly in category League's and I've heard he's somebody that I'm just targeting for threes  yeah and he hits them at a pretty high clip 42% over his last 10 Maurice is a career 39% 3-point shooter so Keegan is someone that I really like real life flies in fantasy wise the Kings need him to play the brand of basketball that they want to play I think he's played really well as of late a 32-point outing just about eight days ago so you gotta love you love to see that D'Angelo Russell it's so erratic I hate guys like that and fantasy basketball that just drive me crazy and never know what I'm gonna get  all right we'll go rapid fire through some of these Sean says have to drop one in a 10 team head-to-head category League Suggs herb Jones Grayson Allen or tyus Jones  well I've hitched my wagon to Grayson Allen so I can't say him you better not be dropping Grace now  um just straight to Anthony Simon's form I like herb Jones I'm not I I think I would drop highest Jones know I don't know if I would right now it would be one of the Joneses we're not driving so after a tough road assistance the guys much better at home okay last 15 games for Ty's Jones 15 points almost seven assists 1.4 steals percentages are fantastic shooting almost 50% from three I mean that'll come down at some point I don't think I'm really looking to offload him right now I think I would go with her Jones and you know he's somebody that I always like is like my final starter in a 12 or a 14 Team league but you know we're starting to see more Larry Nance over the last couple of games he's been one of the most added players this week on Yahoo and a cross most formats and with her Joe's there's a lot of mouths to feed right if they're in ants is going to play 2025 minutes and Trey Murphy is back in healthy and Zions healthy it's just like I do think he's the guy that can kind of get squeezed in some ways and he's always gonna continue to start you know I think he's a probably better real life player than fantasy player he needs to be giving you either high volume threes and or high volume defensive stats and and lately that just has a really been the case you know he's been at one point two steals plus blocks combined over the last month so I think if we're going with that Trend I'm gonna drop herb Jones  right quick one here would you have selected the right Jones would you trade miles bridges for soccer right now I would do it I want to see a specialty I think he's Landing in Indy I like siakam right now I like them a little bit more if he's in Indianapolis and I'll take my chances elsewhere I like siakam in that spot too yeah those guys are really comparable but I think siaka potentially moving to Indy would push it in his favor and a millionaire named in the Stream says hey fellas I got Derek Lively and his production feels so lackluster thoughts if you will ever be consistent this season great show appreciate the kind words and yeah I don't really have Derek Lively anywhere so to be honest I yeah I have been paying attention but I'm not like locked in on his box scores every single night and you know the consistency excuse me it's scoring wise he has been very up and down even the defensive production over the last month as not been nearly as consistent as it was you know in early December he had a great run he was giving you like multiple blocks multiple steals that felt like every night to answer your question I would say I don't know if he's gonna become consistent this year I mean he's ultimately a young rookie he's raw you know I don't think anybody really knew what to expect so think you're just gonna have to live with the ups and downs he has helped the in the win loss column way more than a rookie should so I think he falls into the bucket of better real life player than fantasy player the way that he helps Luca in the pick-and-roll game he's he can be the the rim running type of big that Luke is desperately needed especially with his ability that cross-court passing that that makes him so unique so Derek Lively is a guy that I really like really high on but yeah the stats are not there so it's hard to trust him in fantasy and you'll have to excuse Nick's cough he was in negative 24 weather last night how are you still alive I live in Florida I literally can't fathom what you are experiencing up there this is Ben and I lived in Wisconsin my entire life I really think this is been the worst week of weather that we've ever had like 14 inches of snow over this past weekend and then immediate drop down to to negatives for like five days in a row I got I got scolded by the mailman yesterday I happened to be outside warming my car up because you have to do that if you're going to drive anywhere you need to like let it sit for 10 minutes and the mailman drove by and like yelled at me for not clearing enough snow around the mailbox like it's it's an ice block dude like there's like I would love to I would love to clear it I there's literally nothing I could do I would need like a like an old school chisel to go out there but yeah if you are not conversations you have in Orlando Florida address like the room that I'm in I have the background blurred as you can see my hands are blurring this is a one-room and I just moved into a new house by the one room that has like horrendous wallpaper is the office room and it's like half torn down so if I didn't blur it it would look even worse and I know it looks bad as is so I just want to want to be up front about that well have a better set up hopefully by the time where we're back on the Pod next week anyway we got questions to run through here talk about a few of these guys already would you drop Jalen Suggs or Trey Murphy for  Derek Lively  I'll let you speak on songs he's been terrible the last three games I don't is that a trend or is that just a bad road trip it's a road trip Jalen Suggs is the prototypical role player who is dynamite at home and it's completely lost if out on the road too long so I am not looking at Jalen Suggs saying oh this guy's falling off watch this team come back home on Friday against Philadelphia it'll be right back to the guy that you fell in love with on your fantasy roster these are the Ebbs and flows of the Suggs season so if that's my that's my take on on Jalen pretty confident that's the way this is gonna play out but I think it comes down to your roster what do you need if you need the the position that Derek Lively is feeling for you then yeah that's a move that you're going to have to make but I would not look at Jalen Suggs production as the last three games and say that he's just falling off it's just a road trip blip  yeah I think I think dropping either of those guys for lively as defensible if you need help at Center for you now they need rebounds you need you need blocks like yeah that's totally fine specially in a 10 Team league if that's what this is I would I think I would in a vacuum prefer sucks and Murphy over Lively but again if you need about the box then probably go ahead and really drop either of those guys I think they're pretty comparable Murphy of course little more reliable for the volume threes Skeeter asked is Jay dubb a sell high or a hole talking jail and Willie's from the Thunder he's a hold for me he's one of my favorite players man I absolutely love watching him I mean even last night you know and that Clippers game like hit some huge buckets to keep them closed like he's just wildly confident obviously a guy who went the late lottery last year a lot of people knew a ton about him unless you're a big college basketball Junkie but  I don't I don't think he's gonna drop off anytime soon and he's basically he's been this guy since early last season like he's just super super consistent shoots a good percentage for a guy who takes some tough shots I wouldn't really be looking to sell High I think he can sustain yeah this this Oklahoma City Thunder team is for Real they've turned to corner and we know what we're getting out of this GA he's the straw that's the drink but you're not gonna get there with one great player we've got a number of teams with the All-Star caliber player that are nowhere near as good as the Thunder hour and I say all that to say that Jalen Williams is the kind of player with the with the the way that he has come into his own in the NBA in a very short period of time is the reason why this team is taking a leap the way that they are Holmgren the instant impact they're getting from him in year one that's part of the reason so these guys are absolute holds 25 points in each of the last two games and it's not like he's doing it inefficiently which I don't think anybody on that team does I'm just blown away with what I've seen from OKC and and I don't see that I don't see that going away at any point in this season  all right we'll hit a few more before we head out George says I just traded away Jared Jackson and OG and Adobe for Paul George in I had to head nine cat 12 Team league because I was scared of Memphis shutting him down and his inability to create his own shots if you listen to the Pod we completely agree with you on that the question is Brandon did he overpay or is this a good move  uh slight overpay but I think you're overpaying for good product so don't have an issue with it sometimes we overpay I've got a pair of shoes in the garage I know I paid too much but I wear them every day and they're super comfortable so you know this is I think that's what you're getting with Paul George you worry about some injuries but the Clippers are playing well right now one of the best teams in the Western Conference and and Paul George is as consistent and reliable when he's on the floor is anybody in the NBA  hope you got him in your lineup last night because he had his best game of the year he was fantastic just completely took over that game in the fourth quarter yeah I think when you're trading for a top 20 guy you're inherently going to overpay more often than not so I think you're right I think you slightly overpaid but in this instance When You're Expecting if Jared Jackson falls off the way you think he will then it won't be an overpaid two months from now so I think you're okay there Dennis says do I drop quickly for Bruce Brown I would say no  yeah I'd rather have quickly  yeah I think you know Bruce Brown were to end up in Toronto ironically alongside quickly you know maybe some more opportunity there and you could get back to you know closer to the player he was last year I just there's just not a ton of upside with Bruce Brown it's like I think a lot of things need to be in place for him like the defensive stats have to be elite you know the field goal percentage has to be really good because he's just not a high volume guy and you know with quickly you're gonna live with some more ups and downs but I I would prefer the quickly side of that one Manila Most Wanted says thoughts on the melting injury do I keep him or consider dropping him you know Melton was great early in the season there's a defensive stats it's been fantastic as they tend to be with him I mean he's always been over once deal for game guy even when he was playing like 18 minutes a game in Phoenix early in his career you know they're saying he's going to miss out at least one more week  if you're in a shallow League you could probably drop him I mean we're ultimately talking about the Anthony Melton if you have an IR spot maybe just waited out for another week  yeah I mean he's an 11-point per game guy give you steal but look at the injuries dealing with lumbar spine stress that doesn't sound good yeah I think you have to be comfortable dropping him especially if you need somebody to fill that spot all right go quickly through a few more Guilford says Jaron Jackson for Chet 12 team had to head League I would take chat  every day without special right now I think you know earlier in the season like even a week ago that's that's a debate because Jared Jackson was playing so well for all the reasons we've talked about throughout this pod I would I would much rather have Chet Holmgren Joel session I traded away LeBron right now if yes what's the best value I could get for him  it's a conversation we've had all year you're kind of waiting for the injury for LeBron you know the production has been fantastic I mean world's better than you'd ever expect from somebody his age it's been a slight downturn lately he ranks out the top 25 in the last month but I as long as he's healthy you know he's going to be an elite guy it's just a matter of you know do you think he's going to remain healthy if you're trading LeBron I would try to get a you know more reliable maybe slightly lower upside you know big name guy back you know do you flip them for someone like a Jamal Murray or Alfred Shane goon or you know you float out like a could you get Dame Lillard I don't know I mean Derek Fox ranks lower than him he's been bad over the last month yeah I again if you're trading LeBron I don't think you have to but if you believe he's going to get hurt at some point as recent history with dictate then don't don't you know feel like you have to take 80 cents on the dollar I think you can still get somebody pretty good back what about what about a guy like Victor win the complete opposite direction age wise and we'll be has been doing  is other worldly I think you could I think that's a trade you might be able to pull off  if I don't know why I'm a manager would want to do it but right I mean with women you I think there's still the lingering shut down possibilities so that you're incurring a decent amount of risk there but you know I mean when pajama even always playing 24 minutes a night it's still putting up Elite numbers I don't mind at least throwing that offer out there yeah Sean says another trade question he was offered Drew holiday and Terry Rozier for Trey young would you take that offer 10 team 9 cat lead  oh special in attend team outtake tree Young  yeah I mean I just I think we're here you had a great great month and a half without lamelo I think that's gonna come back down to earth you know Drew he's been fine he ranks you know around like 75 on the year trade young I mean we could we could quibble about you know the Hawks and their lack of upside he is still a big time Elite Ultra consistent fantasy option top 15 guys so I would I would not take that deal unless you really have depth issues and you know you need to add somebody but you know the 10 Team league really be the case I would I would hold tray on with you on that yeah more for your All-Stars  all right another question says this guy really wants my Jalen Johnson he's open to trading dejounte Murray I assume that's dejounte Murray Could Be Jamal Murray Austin Reeves porzingis Kessler Lively Hardin avda giddy he says I have Duncan Robinson demon shenzo or Caruso to package with him  yeah I mean for what it depends on who the Murray is it could be Keegan Murray I suppose could be Chris Murray probably not could be Bill Murray Bill Murray  you know I  if you can get if you can get James Harden you know if it is Jamal Marine you could get him then sure what not be a Wednesday episode of Nick didn't spend a couple of minutes waxing poetic on James Harden  Victory lapping on James Hardie know I mean I get if you have to give up let's say Jalen Johnson and Dante Davidson so to get James Harden I would 100% do that if this guy in your league is down to do that I would make that trade as much as I like Jalen Johnson  yeah yeah there's a couple of guys there that you can make that move for heart it's hard for me to put all of this together at once but Jalen Johnson oh I mean stat I don't trust porzingis and I really need to know what Marie that is before I dive into that Walker Kessler has been a little disappointing Josh giddey starting to turn it around so if we're gonna throw all this love the way of the Oklahoma City Thunder not a bad option either  all right a couple more then we got to go Joe juice says do I drop Bane  I I'm not usually a drop guy in these situations and by the way it is Jamal Murray we have the we have identified the Murray it is not DeMarco Murray it is not Bill Murray it is Jamal Murray so yeah at him to the list of potential targets there I mean jail jobs has been great so it's not like you have to deal him but if somebody's willing to overpay you know I think you should be able to capitalize but back to Bain  I took me don't drop players in this situation I will say I mostly play in League's that have our spots so it's a little bit easier to to say you know I I be pretty surprised like if he's dropped by my nft Casey league if he is I'm gonna pick him up and just hold them and hopefully even if you get 15-20 games at the end of the year you get a nice boost there I don't this is to me this is not a long-term enough injury quite yet where I'm worried about that I wouldn't drop it now you know if it's if we get three weeks from now he's not making any progress in the reports are negative and Memphis loses 10 in a row yeah then maybe you think about it but I wouldn't do it right now if you need the roster space which is always the caveat I think the answer is yes it's a six-week injury and then maybe set an alert on your phone about four weeks from now and just try and pick them back up  see if if that if you're confident enough you have to know the people that you're playing against are they if they're just gonna scoop him right up and you don't need to drop him then don't do it  so I always I always use that as my barometer if I'm about to drop a player and they're going to be scooped up immediately they're probably they probably shouldn't be dropped yeah so maybe drop them now set the alert on your phone for four weeks and then pick them back up if you're confident he's still going to be there  all right we'll do two more and then we're out Brandon what are your thoughts on Tillman plumblee and Wendell Carter Junior who's the better pickup of those three in a nine cats Roto League  hmm I don't know Carter Jr is a real trade option here at this point Wendell Carter like in real life oh I think that those two would be at the top of their trade list so that'll be an interesting speculative um add because because of a future trade but as of right now you wouldn't be at the top of my list I just wanted to add that yeah I  man I mean  Plum is gonna play 25 28 minutes I think for the next month with zubac out I would I would say plumblee or Tillman before I'm picking up window Carter you can you can hope on a trade but I mean someone's had like three three games in the last week that have been better than anything window Carter's done all season yeah the fantasy so I would I would say  I would say Tilghman one family two but it's close and then Carter to me is a relatively just in three  is Larry Nance a good pickup  seems to be I you know it's funny I saw him as one of the highest added players on Yahoo and you know he's played 26 2020 minutes over the last three games he's got seven steals in that spans so that's a big part of the reason that you know if you're looking at recent rankings he's way up there not really sure that's totally sustainable you know I just he can't really rely on just getting two steals in like 22 minutes every single night in the Pelicans rotation is you know so loaded right now but I would say in a 14 or 16 Team league yes I'm picking them up yeah yeah definitely worth an ad right now because of what he's done the last few games and then the Pelicans are not shy about giving other guys opportunities if they're playing well but I'd be ready to to move off of them quickly because there's a chance that he reverts back to the single digit per game guy that he was all right we had to do one more brand and we got we got it we got tears in the chat Halliburton question Skeeter long time viewer of the chat we appreciate the question Skeeter he says he asked earlier you know he had a team that's dealing with percentage issues you'll go percentage free throw percentage or poor thinking about maybe hunting at least one of those categories and perhaps trading Tyrese Albert to do it he said he was offered Dinwiddie and Trey young for Tyreese Halliburton is that a trade you would consider making if you are in  percentage hell  yeah anytime I can get Tyreese Halliburton on my team in most okay oh the oh there were offered okay I missed that part and no I'm no I'm not if I was that willing to do it on the other side I can't be willing to do it if I have Halliburton in this situation I think there are other ways to fix your problem I I think there are I do I do think this is defensible though I mean it's like Halliburton has been better than Trey Young on the year but not by as much as you think you know like Trey young is averaging more steals Trae young hurts you more in field goal percentage but if you're punting that you don't care they're extremely comparable in terms of free throw percentage but Trey young takes twice as many per game so I think that is the that is the goal here is that your your taking the hit on field goal percentage you're getting a comparable player but you're getting somebody who in theory should improve your free throw percentage because he's taking eight or nine for game whereas Albert is taking four per games so I actually I think by that line of reasoning  I think this is actually a fair deal I would maybe try to get somebody other than did we because he's just gonna continue to tank those percentages both field goal and free throw so maybe get like a better free throw shooter as a throw in but if your goal is to hunt field goal and try to Rescue for free throw then I actually think this is this is pretty doable all right we gotta be on our way out here appreciate everybody throwing questions in the chat you guys make this fun for us to do you make it informative okay we gave you some good answers we'll have Dre and Rick Campbell back on the stream tomorrow morning Alex Cannon Shannon talking waiver wire on Friday I'll be back with Alex on Monday Brandon I will talk to you at 9:30 Central Time next Wednesday and looking forward to having you on the XM show later this week as well single tear Skeeter I totally get it
