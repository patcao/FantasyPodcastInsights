hey everybody  welcome back to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast  I'm Steve Alexander Dr A  that's Rick kamla the freak the legend it's February 8th Tuesday  happy trade deadline to everybody um we are going to talk trade deadline we're going to take a lot of questions we're gonna do this right after this song your cold opens make my weak man it is Rick kamla it is Steve Alexander we are the ogs this is the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Underdog and FanDuel happy Super Bowl week everybody happy trade deadline day and we do have some trades that have gone down here doc I'm gonna hit you rapid fire style here do any of these trades move your needle at all of the ones that have gone down starting uh you know about noon yesterday we had your boy Simone fontecchio traded to the Detroit Pistons Knox in the second round pick going back to Utah Kevin Knox Aziz your Tillman going to Boston some pics involved Lamar Stevens is going to go down to Memphis in this trade and the Monte Morris going to Minnesota I didn't think Minnesota needed to make a move dock on if obviously got their back up point guard Tim Connelly is the shot caller for Minnesota he had Monte in Denver and obviously like them a lot he wanted him back but Jordan McLaughlin I thought was playing well shaking for deeply for any League do any of these moves turn your needle so far  no  so us  Simone they do not sir is fontecchio still on your team in the cam Dynasty doctor or did you dumped him I think he's still might be hanging around  I did like him in Utah like I did like the fact he was playing  you know 25 30 minutes and doing some stuff  but yeah I  yeah no  but then it happened now man that happened now oh all right so what so let's see if by the way these trades are doing nothing for me either okay if look Tilghman is a streamer let me put it this way to me Xavier Tillman is a streamer on a non Horford game on a non-poor zynga's game on maybe Tatum is out and Horford is out but if Horford porzingis and Tatum are healthy take Tillman's gonna play 12 14 15 minutes but he could get 28 30 minute games when those guys are out so just keep your eye on that Xavier Tillman to me is entered the streaming zone now that he has been traded your boy can Crites sent him a male bag question for the RotoWire mailbag column that is probably posted by now I don't I don't even know he said do I drop Luke cornette in my 20 Team league now that Xavier Tillman is in Memphis I was like  thank you Kate train for reminding me that Luke cornette still plays in the NBA  this obviously cornet you know I just picked him up streamer stylist in a 20 team fantasy league I wonder if we're in the same one it's got him it's called Sam hinkis letter he and it's you and it's you and Catering in there right like you he probably dropped him and you probably picked him up I don't know if he's in this league I gotta I got to look it up doc I don't concern myself with who the other owners are I concern myself with winning um and I you know the names that pop up and you know K10 explorers and all that I don't care you're just the next victim um so I'm looking here at your boy Cornett recently he's had a couple of decent games in a 20 Team league in my holding Luke Coronet boy he's right on the cut line man he's right I'll tell you this I would rather have saved your tone and a 20 Team league then I would Luke cornette um but if Tillman's not available I may still hold if Thomas is not available I may still hold Luke cornette yeah he who I'd rather have is Gigi Jackson your boy are you now are you now on GG Jackson I am a put GG Jackson on your roster  stash him sit on him  wrap a blanket around his head and try to smother him to death like you're his big brother  yeah like I I think you want him on your roster because what does Memphis have left like we are literally counting down the minutes for the Jaron Jackson Jr shut down right  and it's Cynthia odama it's GG Jackson and it's  that dude Danny well so guys name and David  Ronnie yeah you know right  all right so uh look I'm this is one of those days guys where you got to look a lot because there's going to be movement and when guys go out then sponsor beckville by other guys and the waiver why this is maybe the most important day on the waiver wire you know you think of the first week of the Season doc where you've got you know opening night well there's only two games right and then you got Wednesday at that first Wednesday so many questions are answered about rotations and oh my God this guy's completely out of the rotation oh my God this guy started for whatever team like that's a really critical point for the waiver wire and so is today okay so guys look alive out there because you can find some some finds like you know I don't know like GG Jackson might be that guy um and if you've got only a couple of waiver wire spots left I would recommend waiting being a little patient here and taking all the way to three Eastern today to see what materializes because you'd hate to be out of pickups to the week in your league and that oh my God I really want to pick up this guy he's green for a 28 minute per game assignment here but I'm out of out of Trance  oh talk to me about how you approach trade deadline day Doc it's very important it's sort of like it's not as important as  like the first day of waivers in the NFL because they're so fewer running backs and fewer teams but it's up there like it's it's up there with the most important days for for basketball this is why you save your two or three moves or four moves for today  because  not only do the players that move gain value but the players that don't move game value and people know this it's not rocket science  you gotta have moves available to make today  you do and so I know you want to talk about Jalen Brunson um and you know obviously with the turn ankle the other night so take us into your thoughts on that and is it is it daunted even shenzo season right now it has been for the last five games he's been phenomenal  it is Stevenson and his season like dreams are coming true on the podcast right I'm so excited about leaving shenzo so excited about cuminga so excited about like all of those so many players right now that are just balling out and even shenzo is going crazy and the Knicks are going crazy dude what is happening like there's there's so good I was the next and Cleveland and the Clippers oh  and even the Hawks are playing better  um  nothing even shenzo has been out of his mind  kind of I think the Hawks are four and three in their last seven I have noticed a little bit of a diverse a diversification down the stretch Trey young is not ball-hogging as much as you typically does um you mentioned dreams come true Doc and and so let's have a quick conversation here about another dude that is making dreams come true in the fantasy world it is Rick Hamlet it is Steve Alexander we are the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast here today brought to you by Underdog and FanDuel Jaden Ivy just led the Piston to a victory at Sac last night with out Cade Cunningham and he went for 30 7 points um this is the most important game of Jade and IVs NBA career this is a win at a good team at top six team in the west and you went off and got that win um evoking booze from the crowd down on their beloved Sacramento Kings um and I I kind of scoff it it some of the stuff that  Monty Williams said and I'll read it to you here because of how Monty shamed Jaden Ivy I don't know what the before The Hyphen shamed is age shamed him um I don't know I don't know what appreciate him okay and so last night 37 points Monty Williams said the fearlessness he plays with  dude why are you playing him 18 minutes a game to start the year why okay Williams on IBC ceiling it's hard to recognize what a guy's sealing is  no it's not dude watch the games watch him at Purdue it's not hard to see what a guy seeing is it's literally it's easy we can do it it's literally not hard Dr Ray okay  he says all so but I see a young man who's getting better and who's coachable who's going to coachable uh what happened to coach him up he looks me in the eyes and takes it the right way because you're you're the John Wayne of NBA head coaches I am so out on Monty Williams okay here's how easy it is to scout Uptown okay doc when I watched and Ivy at University of Purdue coming downhill rocked up Half Back Body I'm like whoa that dude's gonna be a stud in the MBA dang it's not that hard and you know what doc you know who I was comparing him to all Dwayne Wade and Donovan Mitchell all right and you know what their style lines look like yes you do of course let's focus on Dwyane Wade  getting fired up and losing my voice Dwyane Wade was a 25 and five guy a 25 five and five guy right later in his career drifted to the 25 and 5 Zone um jade and I be over the last month okay greenlit a lot of a lot of games a lot of minutes 20 four and five I'm gonna stand up and take a bow 2.33% from the field I literally said in the pre-draft process he's a 25 and 5 guy in the NBA I said this on the are documented in Monty Williams the horror film would go to shielding his when you're not playing a guy maybe or when you're just confused I it that hit a total nerd with me dude but Jada and I be is good to go Hallelujah to the fantasy world  one of my male bad questions from Lexus was  give me 10 coaches in the NBA that you love and I was like that's the most boring question ever nobody wants to listen that so I said I'll give you three I love and three I hate  and with the love I want Jason Kidd because he plays Luke every night and Luke can play he should Steve Clifford is running Brandon Miller out there every night love that Michael Malone great quotes oh I love what he does with yogic like it's just fun my top three don't like were Jacques Vaughn for ruining the life of Cam Thomas Darvin ham for being Darvin ham and Lonnie Monty Williams was number three you know that money all that money dude I know hey  he's got LeBron he's got a D he's got a lot of work with he's got a lot of he's got a lot of problems  he's got 99 problems actually but you're throwing knives at the homie man you're throwing knives at the homie that that's why I'm like I'm like I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna straight check right now wiggle it I'm not comfortable I'm a Darvin ham dude man that's my guy like he's a Darvin like that's my God man so like I said here  what's I thought Darwin was gone he's gone blinking got his back yo why would you whack Darvin ham he just won the in season tournament for the love of God oh yeah they hit a lull guys more playing hard all that's Darwin's fault um he's throwing players off boo hoo get with it man then they have a strobe light party and put up a pennant like whatever dude got Jerry West drawing over in his grave if you was in a grave he'd be rolling over yeah yeah look out for the great Jerry West I completely disagree I I completely fine with them hanging a banner they had to hang a banner okay whether it's it's to me like I don't know if the Lakers wanted to or not but they had to okay like there was a political reason for doing it if the Lakers don't hang a banner it literally urinates on all of the fuss that we made over the n Season tournament you got to hang a banner like the league will look I believe that the legal office would literally like  kind of sort of hard insist on it like  do it just do it you don't to make a deal out of it but you got to put a banner up otherwise it just cheapens the whole event and anyway random tape okay Rick I'm taking Darvin ham off my list I'm putting Nick nurse on there for ruining Krispy Shea and then I've also got that's another one of the homies and I go way back with Nick like that's my dude man I said  no I will never get over the crispy shade disrespect that he showed for the last 10 years and from but hold on hold on money Williams money's trying to kill us their Thompson and Jade and Ivy because of Alec Burks and bohanek Donovan I can't do this let the kids play bro  but dude Darko reactivate also does not like Chris Boucher this is not a nickname I think this is a Chris Boucher motor thing Doc Krispy Chase 32 now dude it's over  oh the ceiling the the little that zip of upside now it's gone man nobody cares about all gone it's all gone there oh my God you crack me up dude you crack me up so it is the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast award winning FanDuel and Underdog sponsor this thing Rick Pamela and we're gonna do what's up what have we won and we won anything what do you mean  you and I like as our podcast want anything no not yet but we're it's going to one day I have no idea as soon as I get those cold opens down dude I think we're on our way to something  dude you're cold opens are arguably the best part of the show okay I literally is I'm on camera straight is straight face as I can be I'm literally like holding back laughter okay um and maybe like 5% of Tears um but it's it's all good dude talk to me about Christmas injury right here because came down on the foot of Kevin Durant the other night they called an ff1 on it for getting under his Landing space but dang dude here we go again with Chris Middleton Doc and  I don't really know who's gonna backfill him in this right I'm not like about Andre Jackson I'm not like that I'm not psyched about any of these guys  no he's one of those guys like there's teens where a stud goes down and nothing happens like you know what I'm saying like if Chris Middleton fell in the middle of the Woods  did it make a sound um but he left that game he left that Arena on crutches his numbers have been terrible anyway like he was on my  followers list before the injury happened now  you put that dude on crutches and having skating across the hardwood on the way out of the out of the Arena it's not not a good not a good look you know I think if I if I had Chris Middleton in a 12 team League  and today's trade trade deadline day  he'd be a guy I'd have cute up the cut  interesting you just sent a thought into my brain about that I met I've got a little lingering third round pick in the cam Dynasty I may I may float that third round pick it on his street heart he's a producer of fantasy sports radio and he traded for Chris Middleton from the cave trade can can Christ ah yeah I may do that I may do that because I don't know I this isn't going to be a full year thing you're gonna have to ramp him back up make the playoff push all of this Middleton's not done for the year it's obviously very frustrating what we're seeing um he has had some decent games it's really a buzzkill because like you wanted him to continue the momentum raising the minutes limit maybe one day get off the back-to-backs and so now that he's maimed himself again that like that ain't gonna happen but I mean the third round pick  in the cam Dynasty is not that valuable uh it's kind of valuable first Trump pick extremely valuable second round pick pretty damn valuable in a third round picky start getting really deep out into the weeds but don't tell everybody that I'm going to try to get some value out of this it is a high third round pick I'm at first place it's not the last pick in the draft well we got a three-round draft it's very high in the third round so also we got a Van Vleet injury here doc with the oh God there's been a lot of AD doctor lately I believe Ben Fleet is falling into the ad doctor combine unfortunately other talking about at least a four gamer probably out through the All-Star break maybe Beyond Don but I'm at Thompson welcome to the starting five and well waiver wire Madness is everybody's trying to pick him up so what is the van bleed injury do for you man it makes amen Thompson  a hot pick up and it makes Jalen green  season szn style Jayla green his Ballin  and amen Thompson's been balling for like six games now like I think I think it is Thompson Twins season  Dr style Hold Me Now  the the big song from 16 Candles the Thompson Twins are back in style I feel like both Thompson Twins are going to have a big second half  I think you should pick up amen Thompson everywhere you can get him right now and stash him play him sit on him whatever he has been he's been fun Houston's fun I don't know that you know they there was a time when we were talking like eight weeks ago  where Houston was in the thick of the playoff race  they're not even more they're down the bottle  they're fading  it's time to let the kids play  it's time to figure out what we've got to work with next year it's Amen Thompson seasons  it is now email ink and rock like that to trust me um he's they're not going to you know shut down like they will go for it they will put all their best to the wood every single night at the tari Eason thing is never ending man and we wish him well he was well he's still as one of the homies but but you know not not playing is a problem one more thing well maybe a couple more things your doc I want to talk about I want to talk about Jimmy Butler here real quick  to everybody okay I want this is it may not be by low time anymore but maybe it is okay hear me out um to me it's finally Jimmy Butler season like doc said not spelled out but szn I'm not a heat well I mean I just there's some teams that I watch all the time in the Miami Heat won one of those teams and it's been a dreadful assignment recently right they lost seven games in a row these were with Jimmy Butler okay and it's like  come on where is the Run where's the spark where's the juice where's the Mojo where is the whoa where's The Barking Dog Okay where is this stuff poof vaporized it's up in the atmosphere somewhere okay not recently doc Jimmy Butler and and he's activated okay he went like this with his finger and he went Boop and he puts pushed the switch they won four of their last five they're passing the eye test now and they're passing the eye test because Jimmy Butler's bringing the juice he's activated and when he's activated everybody's else was like yo I better plug into that otherwise I'm gonna get screamed up by Jimmy Butler for not bringing it hard enough okay where everybody should have been screaming at Jimmy all year for not bringing it hard enough but hey so we're Dynamic next player he's in commercials you get what you get Jimmy Butler over the last five games doctor a has gone 23 points six rebounds 8 assists two steals that's Jimmy Butler not this 17 five and four one steel bull crap that we've been getting write 238 and 6 with two steals triple double last night and here's why you try to buy low with him right now if you have been a manager of Jimmy Butler this year are you happy with the experience so far hell no you're not you probably might want to hit the escape button on Jimmy Butler so go make a move right now and don't lavish that manager of you know make a legitimate offer but see what you can get for Jimmy Butler don't overpay if if that first offer doesn't strike then maybe you can up it with another offer but start like medium and then maybe work your way up and clearly I'm not saying you got to go you know like your hunting Moby Dick here okay but but I think I think it's Jimmy Butler season we're in February he's like okay enough screwing around we it's go time now we don't want to be in the play in tournament we'd like to win out of that so you're you're buying what I'm selling here on Jimmy Butler  absolutely not no  no it's because the lack of Threes you don't trust him to stand on the court are you doing my analysis what are we doing here I am not in your house first of all know the fact that you love Jimmy Jimmy Butler right now and the fact that I don't is what makes this fun the fact that you know people send us trade offers and they're like who won and one guy says oh man that's that's obvious you won in the other guys like oh no this guy won and then we nobody won until the season's over and we find out who finished it out and and who played well I I just don't trust Jimmy Butler to play basketball games  until the actual NBA playoffs get here and  the problem is  that the NBA fantasy playoffs happened during what I call Silly Season  when Jimmy Butler is resting up for the real playoffs I got an argument on Facebook yesterday was some dude named Stephen Boucher  wasn't really argument he's a nice guy related to your boy Chris Boucher and well I think they may be they may be in relation to Bobby Boucher The Waterboy  it's peekaboo Chase season any  Rick before when I used to do this podcast not this one but a podcast with Matt Strauss um I used to always  accidentally call Chris Boucher Chris Bosh which was always fun but you know um I just think Jimmy Butler still gonna miss miss games he's gonna be not play and I met jacquez is not done yet he's gonna come back and buzzkill  um Jimmy Butler and I just don't trust him  yeah I understand it all comes down to trust finally here before we go to the streets and bring up the comments from the people dock on Yucca of Congo with the Clinton injury here and this is a couple of days ago this they said reevaluated in seven to 10 days reevaluated does not mean return as everybody here knows so we're talking about a multiple week absence from Clint capela and on Yakima who has look great um you know especially the game before the Boston game Dunkin' threes bringing the bench up off its feet um this is and he's probably already on teams looks like Cloud Santos is a saint buddy hield for Marcus Morris really Indiana trade there's got to be something more to that trade doc it looks like we've got some breaking news here Claud Santa's thing wait is Buddy is Buddy hield gone um I'm on woes here uh Claude give me give me who broke that trade right here I think Claude just scooped woe by the way yeah  scooped woj I'm serious here Sean's got the scoop here on this deal unless I'm like on the wrong area with wage but Indiana hearing a deal where Buddy hield goes to the Sixers according to Sean's and he where's the Marcus Morris part of this I mean clot Santos for the win dude he's like he's like jumping Shams and woes right here and right now  there it is wrong noises run do they run run your way for wire  let us go there's 65 people watching this right now right  all 65 of them should be running to their waiver for Benedict mathura right now how about neb heart  he's not mad either either one  um ranked the three TJ McConnell neb heart or Math Run if they're all on waivers rank those three Catherine nem hard McConnell mmm I would do it the same way um quad Santos that's awesome we being here first of all and and bringing that to us like clouds breaking this in our in our you know  you're muted  artists Claude Santos oh right there what looks like this right here you hold on I just for like I'm gonna cost real quick here shits and giggles I'm gonna look at what your real quick and see if he's even got this trade I tried to go look at Twitter you know what I saw  Travis Kelce oh my God whoa doesn't even have this trade  whoa what is what okay oh here we go with whoa six minutes ago he did he did have it let me see how let me see if we'll just got this group here on Sean's when did Sean's have it all comes down to the minutes doc I think that yeah Sean's got it he started it with Indiana's nearing a deal for buddy hield that was the soft launch and Sean's wins that is a win for Sean's two minutes before woge with that but here's the thing with Buddy hield doc I don't oh God that's very Trent  look I'm not  I'm not crazy about Buddy hield going to Philly I mean I like to fulfill its another weapon another three-point shooter I don't think Buddy hield is gonna turn into 18 points and 3.33 in Philadelphia I got a lot of  10 you've got  um Kelly oubre you've got other wings that play their Firkin cork Miss I don't feel these roster in front of me let me look at Philly it hurts it hurts Kelly oubre is what it does they got a lot of dudes uh melting like I said Uber but tomb of Daniel house KJ Martin sorry I just need Patrick Beverley no play Jaden Springer has been playing in the rotation a little bit and they really liked his deep end so I don't know I look at buddy he'll go in their Doc and playing like half the game I think he'll be like a 24 minute per game guy or do you think he's going to start now and Uber will come up the bed I think Uber is in trouble ruins Springer maybe I've been using Springer and FanDuel like that's how good he's been  so yeah um I I I've got obray on a couple of rosters I've been playing Newberry in FanDuel and DraftKings whatever but he healed going there hurts that and I think buddy hield is there because they're so injured like okay we lost Joel and bead we haven't seen the Anthony Melton or Nic Batum and over a month  another guy you mentioned KJ Martin ones last time we saw him do anything he just said 15 points last night  well I wasn't paying attention to not even calling you out I got KJ Martin in my starting lineup in 30  like that's how deep we go in 30 deep right if I get 7 points five rebounds in a steal because I got a couple guys hurt right now okay he's kgm Martin's literally in my 30 deep starting five starting I mean Covington is there too right  he is still there yes so I think they're at least he didn't played in a month so I mean they just have a lot of banged up people they get a healthy buddy hield in there they didn't really give up much  I mean this is more about the Pacers moving buddy hield I I feel like the Sixers kind of caught a gift  yeah I'm not seeing I'd like to see it would probably be I don't know a first but knowing Daryl Morey he probably got buddy without even giving up a first I'm not seeing anything here on compensation yet they're  let me see if whoa just got the compensation here on everybody right while you're

that's gone down here Doc and it involves Kelly Olynyk woes on this one first I believe Utah Jazz are finalizing a trade to send Kelly Olynyk and guard oji ochai bhaji to the Toronto Raptors for Cairo Lewis who is just traded up there from New Orleans Otto Porter Jr wow he's still in the league and a 2024 first round pick  okay so this this is interesting it's not it's not big clearly I would not call this a blockbuster uh so first of all we've got the Canadian thing right the the Raptors just traded for RJ Barrett they have now traded for Kelly Olynyk so they're getting that Canada thing going here I like coach I like ochai agbaji quite a bit and he's got he's he's got one of the best like bots in the NBA this guy is ready to attack and ready I think for some playing time here will he get it in Toronto that's the hope I think Kelly Olynyk is going to be in in the superior you've got yakka pedal um you've got Scotty Barnes I mean does he play 20 minutes off the bench maybe but I don't think this is going to lead to a pop from Kelly Olynyk I think it might lead to a pop though from ochai awadzi house this one hit me man I like a job  oh gee I'm just calling that  I liked him in Toronto I think he's gonna get minutes pour one out for my guy Chris Bosh slash Boucher on Kelly Olynyk hello crispy Shay goodbye  so it's over that's it  it's officially done I need to be shade Jersey and hanging back here in memoriam  it's it's over I Kelly Olynyk when he gets minutes dude he's a fun fantasy player he really is he really is I wish you would have gone to a better team um I was kind of because a lot of teams were in on Kelly Olynyk and he went to Toronto and nobody like that that's not a bad spot though like turtles been quiet all year see how comes gone  oh geez gone like a little kid go there and ball out for the rest of the season I  it could be a Linux season in Toronto it may be and oh my or have you have got you whatever you say his name oh she whatever you want to work with there yeah that dude I could see them slaughtering him right in and letting him play so this is interesting and let's dissect this um first of all I totally disagree about yakka Pirtle he's been solid 11 points eight rebounds 1.4 blocks leads the league in field goal percentage at almost 70 so ochai pardon me OLX not gonna start over hurdle but this is what could happen Toronto has made they're the most busy team they made the Seahawk trade they made the OG trade now they've made this trade and they've still got Bruce Brown and and he's like to be traded so if Bruce Brown is traded then it's really Giddy Up season on Ocho out bogie and and so it may be olenek too because if you trade out Bruce Brown I don't know what you're going to get back maybe it's a first and dudes that don't matter then Kelly Olynyk may go to the four Scotty Barnes at the three um but then we don't have a starting spot for froggy but we do have minutes frog bodies so yeah I think I think doc hmm boy  if I had to choose between if I had a baji on waivers and I had Kelly Olynyk on waivers I'm seeing Kelly Olynyk be a difference making stretch run Beast okay remember that run in Houston he had doc after he was traded there and they were in tank mode and everybody was hurting all that kind of stuff he went like 187 and 4 with with threes and and defensive goodies so I would I would say Linq is the pickup here man I think he is too and I like like I said I like it  I like when Kelly Olynyk gets minutes like it's fun and he kind of balls out hey Rick Underdog fantasy is the

Kyle Shanahan's Place sheet right and and so I don't necessarily go in order we about surround a little bit that's a fourth and one we got to go deeper into the into the into the Playbook here so what you got to jaunty man I don't have anything but somebody asked me what my ideal trade was for Atlanta and I was like I don't know who he who I even want back I just want the jaunty  saddiq Bey  de'andre Hunter and Clint capela to all go away  that's it I mean wow okay that's that's that's that's that's what that's Santa doc wants that for Christmas in February then we get all the Jalen Johnson we get all the Trey young we get all the on yaka who by the way has been a second round value over the last week over the last two weeks with Clint capela out with his injury like it's only a comment on  that's a guy that people should be running  to pick up off the way for  Neil p is asking what does the trade that just came down Olynyk and body going to Toronto what does it mean for Kessler here's the thing Neil P I don't know because will hardy is the head coach of the Utah Jazz and Will Hardy has been in my opinion a weirdo I'll phrase it that way we're not starting Walker Kessler all year I mean literally funky was in the starting five over has been their last game I'm looking at their box against OKC the other night up with Kessler coming up the bench playing 21 minutes 21 minutes for Walker Kessler this guy should be up there with wimby and shed for shot blocking okay so I think his rotation has been garbage what can I tell you so does this mean that  you know an Olynyk is out and so yeah maybe it does mean that will Hardy has to stop shaming Kessler and put him into the starting five but it seems like they really like the market in Collins know we're going with a shooter there so maybe Clarkson that does the starting lineup maybe can't they don't know I don't know it's will hardy it's got one of the weirdest rotations in the league I do think it's potentially good news for Walker Kessler though  did I gotta I got a question from  a reader and it said  hey Doc can you help explain to me why Walker Kessler has played fewer than 20 minutes in four Street games  I pulled up his game log it was 1917 19 minutes  four games in a row this was last week  what in the hell are they doing  I don't even care tank or no tank Utah or  Bedrock I don't care where you are what world you're in what Universe whether it's Hanna-Barbera or the NBA  how are you not playing  Walker Kessler more than 18 minutes a game what is going on  I look doc it doesn't make sense man especially after the year that he had last year um I mean this guy he is  there's all the shots that he blocks and then there's all the other shots that he altered right and he's such a presence and there's some dudes just don't even drive they'll pull up for a floater or pull up for a mid-range jumper right there anyone want to go all the way into the teeth of Walker Kessler they know they're going to get eat up and then we've got Pedro Marquez here he says um  I'd say this opens up a few minutes for Taylor Hendricks Maybe maybe but again um it's your boy will hardy out there so it's a very unpredictable rotation that you know Tom Thibodeau Doc is so easy to read with this rotation right he literally puts his cards out on the table there you go there's no analysis needed here no reading between the lines um so are you are you feeling Taylor Hendricks here I liked him when I was scouting him in the pre-draft process he's a player man he can block shots he can make shots he's a good players good Prospect you think he's gonna be green lit here  no  any closing words before we get out of here and bit of do to our great audience here on Deadline day and we appreciate it moving your time here with us to 10:00 instead of 11:00 Eastern time let's do this real quick let's hit it oh super quick hits  would you trade from France vogner for Brandon Miller Brandon Miller season dude the only guy playing in Charlotte and I love it man like I said on this very podcast like two or three weeks ago I'm like go get Brandon Miller he's Gonna Roll the rest of the season I think you were like yes absolutely would you do fronds for BM I would  oh yeah vetoed  oh  here's the what talk about the vetoed thing what is how does that register with you I saw that too that that looked pretty uncool nothing pisses me off more than having a trade vetoed  by the league or by by the freaky is what he's saying here anyone who tells me you can't do that even though you spent three hours and bought this clown beers to make this deal happen you put your heart and your soul into it you blew off work for three hours one day and we're just like  talking to the guy about his  family and you know tell me about your  primary school days like what was fifth grade like for you like you're out there trying to work a deal man and somebody's like oh you can't do that because France Vagner shoots this percentage Brandon Miller sheets this percentage so it's not a fair trade who's to judge what a fair trade is what's not I hate Meadows the only time of veto should be thrown is its obvious collusion and dude I feel like you you and I are in agreement with this oh you literally explained a situation of collusion where you're sitting down in your cajoling the owner and you're buying a beers and not cry on your shoulder that's literally just illusion delusion is combining your teams together to make a super team collusion is hey dude I'm gonna give you bennedict mathurin for nothing so that you can win  that is collusion  you giving me bennedict mathurin because you're a dumbass is me being a good fantasy owner who's smarter than you totally different things do not throw the collusion word around unless you mean it  so you are cracking me up today dude guys our boy Steve Alexander is legit on one today um okay so I wanted to make one more Point here on this front of and  Brandon Lee one of the fairest trades I've ever seen if any idiot vetoes that trade they're kicked out of my league or I'm quitting one of the other I'm out good yeah kind of like me quitting that League when they told me I couldn't have wimpy and they changed the rules mid-season yeah I had to get out of that yeah you were like goodbye yeah um you're gonna screw me out of Wendy well screw you was my take on that that's what I would do if my if this trade got me to my league  yeah I I take my ball and go home I'm not I'm a Whimsical mistress that way if you you wrong me I I'm not gonna hang around to be wrong two times um but I would rather have Brandon Miller for the stretch run then then France Vagner Franz Vagner is a stud but he's not a fantasy gold guy he's just slasher okay um he goes 20 six and four that's the good part the pra for Franz Vagner 1.1 steals one point six threes Brandon Miller has been way better and the fantasy gold apartment so I would rather have Brandon Miller for the stretch run in a dynasty League or whatever I rather have I probably rather have Brandon Miller doc I would um he's the guy I mean him a little ball are the guys kind of like Jalen Johnson and Trey young and Atlanta like they're gonna build around this dude they may trade miles Bridges today my trade PJ Washington today they might trade Gordon Hayward today okay so Brandon Miller is good to go all right well I have a one last comment about trade vetoes like collusion is two guys getting together and scheming to dupe the league you taking your buddy out for a beer and talking him into doing a stupid trade is called Savvy management there's totally a difference being a good salesman  and making a trade in fantasy is  I mean that's that's being a good salesman that's being a good owner and these leagues were every trade is  analyzed and micro analyze  and veto because it's not perfectly Fair it drives me nuts dude and it makes me not want to even trade I don't even really mess with trades anymore because  I've had so many vetoed over the years and I don't have time for it but I will never veto a trade unless it's  obviously something shady is going on  I hear you man I hear you guys this trade deadline day your boy cam needs to bolt and we really appreciate you guys being out here yes Stephen Alexander with Steven what the hell
