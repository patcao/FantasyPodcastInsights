welcome welcome to the RotoWire fantasy basketball pod Nick Whalen Brandon Kravitz we're here with you it is Wednesday March 6th Brandon busy night in the association last night thankfully we don't have like a ton of pressing fantasy news we had some injuries coming into the week you know Trey young last week's Scotty Barnes over the weekend Devin Booker over the weekend we saw the Suns go on the road to Denver and pull off a pretty impressive win in some ways with without Devin Booker this is a game that I mean Phoenix ended up winning by 10 in overtime but I was watching this one live Brandon and for a while it's like all right this is just a weird performance by Denver shots aren't going down you don't really see the Nuggets no show like this very often and then the Nuggets roared back and you know outscored  Phoenix over the final two quarters 52 to 37 including holding the Suns to just 12 points in the fourth quarter the funny thing is Denver didn't play that well in the fourth quarter at least offensively I mean defensively you got to give him a lot of credit you also got to worry a little bit about what we saw from the Suns on offense I mean it completely broke down and that's what points of the fourth quarter like that's almost hard to pull off with the talent they have it it and you know again shots were going down I think Durand at one point like missed eight or eight or nine shots in a row so you know sometimes those nights happen but I thought Denver you know looking back what happened in the overtime period Durant basically just took over I thought the Nuggets had a pretty good chance to just close this game out in the fourth and they missed wide open shot after wide open shot you know Michael Porter especially you know had himself a decent night but if just one of the like four wide open threes that he missed in the fourth quarter Goes Down Denver probably pulls this out nonetheless I think this was a huge win Brandon for the Phoenix Suns because they'll be without Devin Booker for at least a few more games you know this could be you know the initial time table seven to 10 days could be more than that but they're in a tough part of their schedule they do have a very winnable game at home against Toronto tomorrow after that though Boston Cleveland Boston so I think banking this win in Denver where at least I going into that was like all right this is probably a lost you know good luck winning that one without Booker getting this one is huge because you know Phoenix is still in that zone right now where they're gonna have to fend off the  Lakers they're gonna have to fend off the kings that win last night you know pushed them above the play in zone at least for now  yeah I think when you look at the Eastern Conference it's not going to be as problematic for some of these teams that end up in the the play in tournament because the the Bulls in the Hawks are probably going to be involved so you should be able to overcome that hurdle the western conference is a completely different story you do not want any part of being in the play in this is like this is like being in the final four of March Madness like you could end up in a one-off game against Steph Curry in the Golden State Warriors so you need to avoid that at all costs if you want to get yourself a playoff series that succeed is in the Western Conference you're right that win was big that was clearly not Denver's best game usually their able to score more than 107 at home especially I thought Nicole yokich a little bit out of character yesterday still put up great numbers but seven total turnovers yesterday that's really unlike him he's much more efficient player than that yeah I mean I I thought the same thing you know it's special early on I'm like this is like maybe the worst joke it's game I've seen all year and he still gave you 2516 and 5 right I mean that's that's where yoga is right now he is very clearly and he's been at this level for a while but I think that is the mark of not even a superstar but like one of those Next Level you know like top 20 25 guys ever is that there are no truly bad games right like obviously LeBron got to that point Durant got to that point Curry got to that point at his Peak where you just don't have those nights where it's like oh you just went to for nine and that's seven points it's like no the bear the bare minimum is still a pretty huge statistical game and that's what we saw from yokich last night I thought he was more willing to shoot him he took seven threes right that's not really something that he loves doing hit four of them a couple of them were just ridiculous High arcing shots had one just before the half but the overarching point here is you know it's gonna be tough sledding in the short term for Phoenix without Devin Booker but banking that win is massive you know Dallas took another loss last night at home to the Pacers  I had that one going on the the far left TV Brandon we had a we were watching those are left TV game I don't know that one no one felt like a center TV my you know my my living roommates / wife was watching a documentary on the 2000 on the far right TV which was really interesting actually I love stuff like that you know it's very center TV potential too yeah so Suns nuggets got the center and then you know we were switching between League Pass games on the far left this was and I know this happens a lot of Pacers and math games this was comically poor defense by both teams comically poor I at one point Daniel Gafford had three straight dunks on just wide open passes from from local Dodge its not a coincidence that Daniel Gafford was seven for seven from the field last night because every single one of them was a dunk or a layup interesting on Gafford I do want to note because we got questions on him on Monday  you know he had been playing he had some games where he's playing like seven minutes eight minutes he did play 21 Off the Bench last night now Lively gotten a little bit of foul trouble they only played him 16 minutes you know Cleveland had three files as well so I don't know that we're just all the sun back in on Gafford but he had 1610 and 3 so something to monitor because I taught to people dropped Daniel Gafford over the weekend and if I remember correctly last week we told you not to panic on this that it was gonna be an ebb and flow situation when it came to the bigs with the Dallas Mavericks and look at their Lively 16 minutes played  you know obviously was not all that effective scored 0 points but I think Myles Turner had 20 something by halftime actually finished the 20 points so I'm not exactly sure what happened there because you went off I think all of that production was in the first half this was the game that I turned on after obviously if you listened to this podcast weekly figure this out at this point that I work with the Orlando Magic and so I magic Hornets on last night but the moment that game ended it was over to this one and I actually live bet the under at the because they had they had hiked it up to 266 and a half and I'm like there's no way this I I understand that there was no defense being played laughable but at some point somebody is going to create her offensively and you just have to sort of cross your fingers and well it did happen Dallas scored 18 points in the third quarter that was that was the only reason that I hit that live bet but that first half they were both into the 70s by the halftime breaks so it did seem like you know they were well on their way to another Pacers 300 point total game  you know  the All-Star break I was all over this team they had won six in a row going into the break I love the additions I mean this  I'm telling me go back and watch the fourth quarter like this was alarming really alarming and the Pacers were doing a lot of this with their bench unit I mean they went deep into the fourth with you know Obi topping and you know TJ McConnell like this was not you know Albert's numbers look great this wasn't like a Halliburton takeover game you know bathroom played well Ben Shephard played well like this was for the most part a lot of reserves for Indiana Justice up this Dallas defense over and over and I was kind of poking around Maps Twitter last night there was you know somebody who's pretty plugged in who said he's here in some Mike booting holes are rumors as a potential coach for next season which would believe be the second time that he is I was hosted Jason Kidd from a job so you know we'll see obviously a rumor at this point but you know the maps  they're in the plans on right now they're the eight seed right now in the Western Conference and you know we there's there's now a pretty huge golf Brandon between the Lakers the Mavs the Warriors and then you know teams like Utah and Houston you know they're five and a half five games back we pretty much know who the top 10 teams are going to be in the west and like you said earlier if I'm Sacramento if I'm Dallas you know could be Phoenix could be New Orleans in that that seven and eight spot I know the Lakers and the Warriors have not been consistent whatsoever I know they've proven they can lose to just about anybody at any given night  I still don't want to be in a winner go home scenario against LeBron James or against Steph Curry no no thank you no part of that yeah we know who the teams are going to be we have no idea what the seating will be because even the the top spot held by Minnesota they're only one game up on the three seed the Denver Nuggets they're three games up on the LA Clippers who for the most part outside of their last game I've been playing some really good basketball so you really have no idea how this thing is going to shake out the last month of this season's gonna be huge in terms of seating and I think that is a big part of this entire equation it does seem like just based on where we are the two teams at the bottom of that top 10 the Lakers in the Warriors are going to have to play their way in but it is everybody else that has to scratching claw their way out of having to play against Steph Curry or LeBron James in a winner go home situation it's it really is fascinating in a tip of the cap to Adam Silver in the NBA because what they have set up is a far more interesting postseason because of possibilities like this that are on the horizon  all right let's see a few more news items from last night keep stacking up questions in the chat guys we all hit those over the second half of the Pod as we always do you guys always give us great questions we love that interaction so keep throwing those in the chat we got to talk about Alfred in chain goon and I guess in Victor Webb and Yama I mean my goodness man this this was another game I was flipping between on league pass I would argue the best game of shango's career certainly his best game of the season best game of late 45 points 16 boards five steals three or six he actually had 60 deals at one point there was a stat correction as someone who now roster shangoo and the road to wire stake League I was keeping a close eye on that so somebody at the NBA stats department is going to have to answer for why he lost one of those deals doing that against women Yaman I mean you could argue web Minneapolis is in that inner circle of you know best defenders overall certainly best interior defenders in the NBA you know Alex bharucha actually gave out webinar to block at  least seven shots which was six to one six to one what is a crazy number I told him about the show I'm like yeah I could see him doing it but like you gotta give me better than six to one for a guy to get to Seven blocks and he had three blocks in the first 10 minutes Houston gets blocked more than any team in the NBA if you look into some of the metrics so it was not a great a great game for women Yama you only had 10 points 11 boards seven blocks you know which now goes down as like an average game for him his blocks and steals props every night are now five and a half which is ridiculous like no one else which is what range yeah I was I was gonna give that one out the the NBA prop plays that I give out on RotoWire social media accounts every day that was one of the I usually end up with like four picks that I really like and then I got a Whittle it down to two just for the video purposes and that was one that was on the chopping block and I looked back at the end of the night just kicking myself because he did it was exactly that it was the steals plus plus blocks that was that was set at 5 and a half and he did it all it didn't need a single steel didn't get one still hit the over on that unbelievable  yeah it's not real man I ever with each passing day you know I know we've talked a lot about like you know going number one next year I'm taking another one I'm taking a number one I don't care I I know you got their little more safety with okay you know even I think SGA is now like in that discussion at least you know there's still might be people who go back to indeed if you trust the health you know some formats maybe honest makes sense I get that but man I just I just don't know that anybody else can match that kind of upside you know like two seasons ago you know when yokich was like The Runaway best player in fantasy basketball where it was like almost an unfair advantage to have him  I like you I think it's kind of come back to the pack a little bit or maybe more accurately the pack is caught up to him because of some of the crazy counting stats that guys like Luca and SGA are putting up but I think in a best case scenario  web pajama it returns number one pick value and maybe jumps like a full tear out of that group right like if he's giving you it's totally possible like you see a lot of great players make that year too late right where like you know LeBron's always the example I throw out you know went from like 20 points a game as a rookie to like 27 his second year like obviously Victor women could do that especially if they jack up his minutes into the 3536 range where she should be I mean he could be 2513 4/5 assists  two two to two and a half steals I don't know and like four four and a half blocks I mean nobody's matching that he's got to get there as far as consistent scoring but the thing he's giving you that those other guys at the top are not are those counting stats on the defensive side and he is so big and lanky and athletic he's basically a lock for a couple of blocks a game you can already baked that in to your score I do think that we are in an era of fantasy basketball where they're they're just isn't a clear cut one you have  it you're kind of in a Zone where if you have a top five pick next year you're just kind of good no matter who you end up with because they all do different things exceedingly well nobody's giving you a cross the board stats points rebounds to sets assists like Nicole yokich nobody right now especially playing guard is giving you the efficiency and some defensive stats like Shae Gill just Alexander and just and the monster scoring numbers that you get from yanis on top of the other things that he does really well and he does a lot of it around the basket which means his percentages are buoyed as well but nobody's blocking shots in that group like Victorious so yeah I feel like it's a little bit it's a little basket and Robbins like just pick your flavor because you're gonna end up with something that nobody else in the league is able to produce I think I would argue in a category League though that women Yama like lapping the field and blocks is more valuable because if he stays healthy he's basically guaranteeing you you know maybe you don't win the category depending on what you do with the rest of your roster but like at worst you're going to be like top five in blocks in your league right like there's just no way if you say healthy that you know if he's giving you 4.5 blocks per game that you're not up there like I'm looking at the last 30 days we have a great tool on road to wire where you can look at you know each player's value over a given time frame you can select which categories you want and then you can look at you know what we call a z-score for each category his z-score in blocks is 6.1 right now which is incredibly high like really good and another category would be like 1.5 or two he's twice as valuable as the next most valuable player in shop blocking which is Anthony Davis suicide like 3.1 and David's averaging 2.8 blocks per game in the span that I'm looking at last last 12 games which is exceptional and Victor Webmail was twice as good so if you look at the last 30 days he's the best fantasy player in the NBA in eight categories you know it there's just no real weakness right now like he's giving you 1.8 steals obviously we talked about the blocks you know I think he could be a five six assists per game guy next year field goal percentage is good despite you know being a little bit shaky as a shooter and the free throws I think that was the big question mark with women Yama was you know yeah the free throw percentage is been decent overseas we'll see how that translates 82% for a 7 foot 5 rookie is fantastic I mean it's better than Luka Duncan she's better than Anthony Davis you know it's basically the same as Nicole yokich you know sga's actually down in the low 80s this year that was a big thing for him in years past he was closer to 90 I'm taking up number one I'm taking number one that's all I'm saying you know the beauty of it is that one thing that you just sort of threw in there the big question mark was the free throw shooting the big question mark too that we aren't even talking about is health  is that guy going to be able to stay on the floor and no you're right and not bringing that up as a question because it kind of feels like it's already been answered it doesn't seem like that is an issue we've seen this guy take heart Falls this year we've seen his minutes increase through over the over the course of the Season he plays a style of basketball that for his size he's a little bit finesse but it works for his game because he's got those finesse sort of abilities he's unbelievable and I'd have no problem I'm certainly not laughing anybody out of the room if they draft him and Yama first overall I'm still not there yet but I'm not far away from it and certainly have no issue for anybody that decides they want to go in that direction we're drafting players later in the draft they can do one thing that Victor when Ben does across the board  if you had a guy that blocked shots like women Yamaha you're you're targeting him he's Walker Kessler you know like he's Walker Kessler Plus  shape plus Giannis plus donshea and yeah he's in he's incredible and you certainly not going to regret it if you end up taking it to the top of the draft yeah last thing I'll say on this is you can look at the overall z-score his is 1.42 on our side and you can find this on the ratings page on rotowire.com the application is that what he's giving you over the last 30 days is basically the same value as like if you combined like the 18th and the 19th best fantasy player like he's giving you two top 20 players and the way you know the it's outside waiting in terms of what gives you a blocks so I'm not saying like the counting stats equal Kyrie plus Kawaii like that's a little ridiculous but the the weighted value that it gives you in blocks is that significant so yeah Victor webinar extremely good living up to the hype no question about that we have talked Yakima portal  Brandon as the hits keep coming for Toronto  oh this was an ugly game you know one of my Best Bets yesterday was Kelly Olynyk over 16 and a half points plus assists he did get there I I thought this one was dead because the Raptors were down 40 early in the third quarter and I thought it was John Deere Porter time and we were cooked for some reason it came back into the game padded the stats a little bit finished with 22 rebounds plus assist that prop is now hit in nine of ten games when he's played at least 25 minutes this season but Toronto looked awful man I mean they went I think three or four minutes in the second quarter without a bucket they just can't really create anything right now even with quickly and bear it out there I don't think we see Scotty Barnes again this season to be honest you know coming back from a broken hand and you know now we see you know Pirtle was questionable to start the week he didn't play last night and then you know during the game last night we got news that he's undergoing surgery to repair a torn ligament in his finger so I think he's now in Scotty Barnes territory where medically timetable wise yeah he could be back what's the point I think Toronto was totally fine just sliding their way down and trying to hold on to their first round pit  this is why I have a really hard time when you get into March I am a big NBA better night tonight I usually I'm usually on you know up to two games on any given night in the league and this time of year I take nights off regularly because I just can't trust anybody half the teams in the league you have no idea what their motives are some of them you know you feel like you're getting value double digit points in your in your in your direction but  a game like last night is a good example that just doesn't really matter there's some of these teams they're just not feeling real basketball teams at this point in the year and and you just don't know what the motivation levels like for these guys at this point what do you think the Raptors locker room is like when they wrap up for the night and they get ready to work the next day you know this is not a high morale situation at this point so this is a this is a tough one to trust fantasy wise too  Justin Freeman Liberty who they just picked up I think I got a two-way deal last week was playing like two minutes into the third quarter that's where that's where we're at right now  you know I had I had a little bit of interest in like oh Chaya bhaji who I thought would would be the guy to kind of Step In Minutes wise for Scotty Barnes he did start last night gave you three points in 16 minutes there might not just there might just not be a whole lot there I think you know they're not gonna lose by by 41 or whatever it was 43 like they did last night every night but it's gonna be ugly it's gonna be really ugly and you know I think Barrett and quickly like you're still gonna get your counting stats there but yeah this team really struggles shooting the ball too I mean gradey dick was awful last night I'm still still not out on him you know I think a deeper leaks if you need threes you know he's somebody can at least look at the minutes are going to be there but you know he was one of seven from the field oh five from three at one point just got straight up like ripped by Zion for for a dunk on the other end like he just didn't really look ready or confident and again this team you know they always a top six or protected pick in the draft so I think they kind of made that calculation and the injuries to portal and barns I think maybe that decision as far as what direction their season is going a little bit easier so I think they're they're now in all right let's try to chase down Memphis to get the sixth worst Lottery  odds and and maybe we can hold on to that pic  are you saying that Toronto maybe has to go into that bucket of like I just I don't know if I'm touching this team and if I am I'm fading them yeah but that's the thing is I don't even feel comfortable feeding teams like this I think that would be the logical thought as well if you never want to bet on them then I guess you want to bet against them I just can't touch it because it the oddsmakers have caught up in terms of the the numbers they're putting onto these games where I feel like when you look at the spread all the values on the bad team and it's sort of a sucker if you take the favorite but I just I can't get a read for it you know obviously you gonna hit one one of the two directions it's every single night you know unless there's a push but I don't feel like I have a good read for it where I can the NBA is very much ride the waves of momentum positively or negatively over the course of a couple of weeks and I just can't get a feel for are they going to be in a game tonight are they not going to care at all who are they going to play guys like gradey dick that might turn out to be a good NBA player this guy's still figuring it out so a betting perspective I just I look at certain teams when I cross the team off the board I cross them off my board in both directions both betting on them and betting against them you know it's for gradey dick I wouldn't yeah I wouldn't abort ship just because he had a bad night that was as bad as it's gonna be for the Toronto Raptors he's still knocking down threes at a pretty good rate if you were to take that 05 out of the equation from last night so this is a guy that's still gonna get his there's no reason for them not to give him minutes at this point with them heading clearly in a South Direction  so you mentioned you're doing the prize picks videos for us each night those have been fantastic go check those out on the road to wire NBA Twitter account you can find him on the road to wear count as well you know Brandon's been throwing out two picks per night there I love playing on prize picks that's been my dominant sight as well what do you like it for tonight so I'm looking the way of this is a bounce back opportunity for both of these players Pollo been Cairo last night I had my eye on his Points Plus assists prop didn't end up playing it and glad I didn't he didn't hit it he did go over on points but just wasn't there as 27 and a half set last night against Charlotte it's the same exact number tonight now here's the thing as bad as the Hornets are I'm not sure that they are as much of a mess at least defensively as the Washington Wizards are so I'm gonna hop on that props tonight 100 points 120 points or more in each of their last four games for the Wizards they've been giving up a ton of points and I think Paulo is right to feast tonight over 27 and a half points plus assists it's kind of been his brand over the last month plus when he plays against teams that are sub 500 he tends to go off no shocker there and then I'm pairing that with a legend I don't  usually go after the goats when because they're all of those numbers are always inflated but Steph Curry coming off of an O of nine three-point shooting performance I think he's bouncing back in a big way tonight so I'm taking his over at five and a half threes made just an absolute embarrassment the last time they took the floor I think he'll be out for some vengeance five and a half oh what a number Golden State home for the Milwaukee Bucks tonight we'll see if you honest is out there by the way I know he's currently questionable you know if you're watching this you probably saw the video If you honest earlier this week warming up and  I'm a little concerned I'm I would put my concern level at like six out of 10 I think the Bucks would be wise to hold him out for a few games he don't want this to be something that recurs the books had said that you've been dealing with a little bit of Achilles soreness over the last few weeks and you know was able to manage it obviously didn't play the other night excuse me against the Clippers I don't know that Milwaukee is going to be able to sustain you know beating good teams without Giannis you know even even tonight on the road in Golden state if he doesn't play that that becomes a pretty dicey situation but but obviously you got a prioritize you know keeping him healthy for the playoffs they're sitting in the two spot right now in the East let's go to the chat we got some good questions here we'll start hitting some of these  our guy free key says is bench pool actually good I have him sitting on waivers in his League it yeah he might be it's worked out better than we thought right I mean he's had I think you can argue he's had his best eight-game stretch of the Season you know since the first game before the All-Star break when he had 19 in a loss to the Pelicans during that span 23 points three rebounds four assists one and a half steals taking nine threes a game hitting 3.8 at 40% shooting 44 41.89 from the field he's got three 30-point games in that span  I've stayed away from Jordan Poole I have not rostered him on a single Team all season wasn't necessarily by choice he was just going a little too high for me and drafts and in a little too expensive in auctions and you know most the League's I play in are a little deeper so he hasn't been dropped  I will say if you were available in our 16 team RotoWire stake League where I just really need another guard I would pick him up I think the bigger question is you know if you're in a 10 team or 12 team or are you going back to the well on Jordan Poole because you know if you've been sitting there for the last two weeks you probably wish you was on your roster yeah I mean it's hard to argue with that when you putting up the numbers you scored 30 plus and two of his last three three of his last five so it I think only the most stubborn person would tell you they still want no part of Jordan Poole I was saying that for months but yeah he has definitely turned it around bench pool has become a completely different player and then ironically enough the guy that he would have been the direct replacement for in Golden State also now coming off of the bench and Klay Thompson and it seems like both are thriving in this role so I don't know I don't know what kind of magic pixie dust there a sprinkling on these benches these days but it seems to be working for these knocked down shooters  Christian Rogers says good morning fellas morning Christian thanks for tuning in should I drop Paul Reed and pick up Dean wait wait wait what crazy last night and looks like Evan Mobley might be out for a while after injury is ankle really good question here yeah boldly you know I don't know if this was carry over from the other night when you know he got crossed into Oblivion and ended up falling down but they said he left the arena on crutches so  I would expect at least a game or two for Evan Mobley if you locked him into to a weekly league lineup probably taking the L the rest of this week the Cavs are in Atlanta tonight they played Minnesota Friday and then they have a home game against Brooklyn on Sunday so you gets back for one of those games but certainly could be a situation where he's missing time so the question basically is Paul Reed versus Wade and you know Dean Wade had the best quarter of his entire career last night you know scored 23 had six threes you know basically did everything for the calves in the fourth as they rallied back to to beat the Boston Celtics 20 of those 23 points came in the fourth  I I think I would still lean Paul Reed I know it's appealing now you know with Mobley projected to this time but the the larger sample strongly strongly suggests that that's not the guy that Dean Wade is and we actually you know obviously this time in December in January so we could go back and look all right what happened during that span  Dean Wade 22 starts in a row from December 8th through January 26th 7 and a half points 4.8 rebounds one steal two made threes a game so he's still giving you that my answer would be it depends how badly you need 3 pointers specifically because I think that would be the big advantage that Wade has over Paul Reed now Paul Reed came off the east come off the bench down with three straight games for Philly they seem to have sour down him a little bit but I still think he's gonna give you a slightly higher Baseline night to night even if Mobley ends up missing two weeks yeah I'm very put off by the idea of mobile who was not proven to be a good NBA players starting over Paul Reed that's not a great sign of where you are and your NBA career but  so I struggled to give him my endorsement here but this is not who Dean Wade is this is what Dean Wade is capable of she certainly can knock down threes but he's got to get that sort of volume in order to put up numbers like that and that's just not typically the case so I think this is more of a one-off performance maybe he'll do it one or two more times but Paul Reed would be the more consistent reliable option even if Philadelphia wishes they had anybody else  yeah I would if you can I would try to wait you know it one or two more games I would like to see like is this is this minute thing for Paul Reed a trendy they played a close game against Phoenix last night and he or Phoenix against Brooklyn last night and he still only played 19 minutes he wasn't in foul trouble so like if you know it all the sudden he comes out and plays like 14 minutes off the bench next game yeah then you're then you're in a spot where maybe Dean makes more sense but I do still think reads gonna give you a slightly higher floor  Christopher says I have Beyond annoyed not with you guys actually I love the show been here all year but the playoffs start and I lose Barnes Booker Janice Jaron Jackson and Desmond Bane see you next year so there's no question here but we will I think we can offer our condolences my goodness  yeah Christopher  we will be thinking of you our thoughts are with you and your fantasy family better luck next year hey we started talking about next year's draft already  it's never too early to get a ranking out there so and rotowire.com great source for all that information  Jared Jackson by the way questionable tonight against the Sixers so he hasn't been shut down yet but he's missed three in a row I think we kind of saw this coming I think he plays again the rest of the year I don't think this is like an official shut down but you know the reason that I flipped him first and goon last week was like even if Jerry Jackson ends up being the better player per game I make on Shang 18 to 22 more games the rest of the year and a bacon on James Jackson playing 10 to 12 more games and you're gonna get more value out of the guy who was playing that many more games so I the shutdown's coming I think for Jared Jackson so if it's tough to say go move off of him right now you probably had to do that around the All-Star break because anybody who's paying attention in your league is gonna charge you a pretty steep discount on him but it is about considered you know Alex and I talked about that on Monday you know what's a realistic trade like somebody said you know that somebody offered a towns for Jared Jackson yes do that if somebody's willing to give you someone like down just just pull the trigger don't even think about it yeah but you're gonna have to aim lower you know and and with the amount of injuries that you have Christopher  it's gonna be tough right I mean Barnes probably isn't coming back who knows I'm beIN Giannis and Jaron Jackson they probably don't miss that much time you know you'll get Booker back but it may be too little too late for you but if you could deal Jaron Jackson for somebody who you just think is going to play the rest of the season it's probably gonna be a winning proposition for you you know what it sounds like it sounds like Nick is telling you don't give up never give up never surrender you're not out of it yet never ever ever Matt Harvey says what's up from Ireland guys hello Matt do you think the Bucks could be the Celtics come playoffs  could they yes yes they could  what I picked them to do so no I would not because the way that the Bucks aren't catching Boston for the number one seat it's gonna go through Boston you're gonna play the first two there you're playing the game seven in Boston if it gets that far the Celtics basically have every box checked over Milwaukee other than best player in the series right I think they have more depth I think they're the better shooting team I don't know if I would say they're better Coach to be maybe that's a wash I was gonna say I think that actually you this is where you can finally give Doc Rivers an edge sure this that's my biggest question mark with the Boston Celtics because in the regular season it doesn't matter that much but by the time you get to the playoffs specially as you get deeper into the playoffs it matters a ton the type of adjustments that you make rotations timeouts you know like every little detail matters so much and that's where coaching comes into play Elite coaching we have not seen that Joe mazzulla is an elite NBA coach yet he was schooled by air exposure exposure might be in a different class but Doc Rivers has been doing this thing for a long long time so I'm not I would give the Bucks a slight Edge there you can never count out Giannis just going  absolutely crazy Damian Lillard will see what he kind of impact he has in the playoffs by the time you get to that series you might have a completely completely different view of what could be accomplished but with all of that said I don't think anybody's beating boss in this year East or West I think Boston they just look like they're Head and Shoulders above everybody else in the NBA right now top to bottom  yeah I think it would be a competitive series like I don't think you know Boston like you know sweeps the books or beats him in five even I think it could be a six or seven games series but the Celtics and historically defended Yin is pretty well you know you're asking a lot of porzingis who's never really been in that spot and then you know an aging Al Horford who throughout his career is defended us well but is it a different player now than he was even two years ago so he can't rule it up I mean it would have to be a series where you honest is probably giving you like what 35 a night and Lillard's giving you 30 a night like those two kind of have to do it for Milwaukee because even the other night again against the Clippers you know in honest is out like believe he has like his worst game of the year you know it's like those Boston just they all the role players to me have a higher floor they have more options you know their fourth best player is Head and Shoulders above Milwaukee's fourth best player and then of course the the elephant in the room is khris Middleton and his house like Middleton is locked in and looks like you know 2018 Chris Middleton then yeah I mean it's it's totally possible that Milwaukee could win that series but they're I think a lot of things would have to break Milwaukee's way for that to happen you know I would say the Celtics win that Series 7 to 8 out of 10 times at least right now but maybe maybe we'll feel differently I mean the books have seemingly turned somewhat of a corner and you know and you know Boston's gonna have home court advantage at this point they've pretty much unofficially locked that up they're 29 and 3 at home this year they've been a lights out home team in the playoffs to pass a couple of Seasons this team is ripe to break through and finally win an NBA championship  you have to win a game in Boston and I'm not sure that and if any of these teams are really going to be able to do that yeah  another question for Matt he says I'm down Mobly eaten and a Kung woo at Center what order would you rank the following players as potential editions Paul Reed do I read and Andre Drummond say Head to Head Yahoo points lie  yeah tough situation there you know obviously you're specifically looking for one position here with three guys injured at Center DeAndre ayton likely out again tonight against OKC that would be his fourth straight absence so I I still don't know that I would drop ayton like I don't see him necessarily as a glaring shut down candidate yeah I think they kind of want to get their investment on him do up this played well you started the last three games he had 26 points the other night against Minnesota and it really tough match-up at 5 3 pointers  he's not he's not a high volume rebounder the shot blocking spend nice he's got six blocks over the last three games you know Alex and I talked about you know Reef versus Jabari Walker the other day and you know I think we like Walker a little bit more but if wreath is going to be playing 35 minutes a night you know obviously that that is something you have to consider  I I still like Andre Drummond man I have too many centers on some of my teams were like I couldn't even get Drummond in my lineup this week I also missed out on his 26 rebound game the other night he kind of have to play the matchups with him like he got in foul trouble against Sacramento didn't really do much  you know in a points League I still I think Drummond is probably gonna give you the highest floor and you know you never know I mean I don't think the Bulls are gonna be shutting anybody down because they're dead set on getting that 10 seed  in the east i as of right now assuming is coming back  at some point in like the next week I would go Drummond wreath Reed  yeah that's exactly how I was gonna rank it just rank it backwards in terms of the question the the rebounding not replaceable in terms of what Andre Drummond can bring you do up these has been a really exciting player this time of year and I'm almost completely out on Paul Reid by the way the Sixers almost out on Paul Reid too apparently yeah uh coincidentally Paul asks us maybe this is Paul Reed himself which is more likely to happen Portland sitting Simons toward the end of the season or Detroit sitting Cunningham  great question here I I would say Simon's it has to be Simon's I mean yeah I you know Detroit can't keep doing this they cannot keep doing this you know I of course hindsight's a crystal clear 2020 I think if Detroit could have it to do over again they would they would hunt on last season it has set them back so far  this team should be  a couple of steps ahead of other rebuilding teams in the NBA they got Cade Cunningham in the 2020 draft that's a superstar type of player that they should have been developing last year I don't think he was shut down all year because he was hurt I think he was shut down all year because they wanted victoriana they didn't get him they stunted his growth they stunted the team's growth and now they're having to make up for it this isn't the draft where you need to have the top pick in order to get a good player I'm not sure there's even a great one to be had in the top five so I think it would be so foolish to shut him down they have to get out of that business what I think what breaks the tie for me and again I think it's relatively unlikely that both get shut down but I would say Simons Detroit is essentially locked into a bottom four record and that's what matters as far as Lottery odds go again you know if there's no women Yamaha in this draft but you still you still want to be picking this high as you can like I think you're matters valuable what your choice Portland meanwhile has 17 wins so they have the fifth worst record they're only two games quote unquote ahead of the Charlotte Hornets so I think there's more motivation for Portland draft pick wise than there is for Detroit because Detroit you know they've won nine games with kids coming in this year and if Portland really wants to make that push in the last like two weeks to try to you know fall below Charlotte and get those those smooth Lottery odds and have a chance at the number one pick then I think sitting Simon could make some sense so that's where I would go there who was the higher rest of season values or keyonte George  good question these are two players that have been you know tethered at the hip and fantasy for a lot of the Season you update George you know kind of had a bad game on on Monday but he left that game early with illness he was sick coming in so you kind of wipe that away we'll see if he plays tonight he's questionable scoot meanwhile you know has been injured for a while now you know it's not really been able to stay healthy consistently you know this time early on he's gonna miss his seventh game in a row tonight against the Thunder I think it just has to be George because we have no idea when scoots coming back and get George been a better player this year anyway and I think Utah's Gonna Keep handing a minute so I would go key on today yeah I got a I got a nice look at him a couple of games back the Utah Jazz were in Orlando and he just scores with such ease he's really an effortless type of player a lot more lanky than I realized and I mean that in a positive way like he's he's a good finisher at The Rim because he's got so much range to his game solid 3-point shooter he I think he looks like he is already grown Leaps and Bounds because of the minutes he's been given throughout this year to me it's easily keonte Georgia at this point  freaky says hey just want to join the pity party I'm down eight and Brunson a Kung Loop Bagley and maybe cam jobs in yeah cam left last night's game a condolences man thoughts and prayers whenever we could do for you we're happy to to lap as much pity on you as we can all right let's hit a few more and then we'll be out of here let me show the real MVPs by the way Nick the real MVPs of this podcast are the people that know they have no chance and are still listening to us and commenting on the fees they're the real  still setting lineups every week you know like that's the worst thing is when somebody completely gives up and you know if you're in a category League or even had to head of course right you're just handing free wins to somebody it's like you know do your due diligence you know it's your responsibility to the league to make sure you're playing this out even if you're in these terrible situations where you sometimes like seven guys on IL all right well rifle through a few more Jeffrey says I've lost puddle and I need a center looking for a trade before our deadline thoughts on giving Aaron Neese Smith for Wendell Carter in a 14 team nine cat League I think that's fair if you can do that deal I would do it yeah I like these Smith you know he has not played well lately he played really well before he had a five-game injury absence but I would I would do that deal specially because you specifically need a center so even if you're a pro Nesmith and you think he's gonna bounce back I think you have to prioritize your positional need here and I would absolutely go get Wendell Carter for Smith let's say you yeah I would have to go back and look at the split of what he his season is looked like the consistency of it after adding Pascal siakam because it's seems like it just conventional wisdom on I noticed this I watched more I watched more of the Pacers than I think if you were to like wait the teams that I follow on a night tonight basis for whatever reason the Pacers are towards the top of my list it seems like since Pascal siakam has been added to the mix Nesmith is kind of falling back into the background a little bit and I don't know for sure if the stats any  back that up because these with the still had some good games over the course so the last month plus but yeah I think window Carter Junior at this point is more reliable and that flux that that we were in with the magic and their bigs that has really settled down its window Carter Juniors job there's no doubt about that and there's a clear hierarchy of bigs in Orlando where for a minute we had no idea what that rotation was looking like good question here from Jay Sizzle he says in a nine Cat 10 Team league what order would you rank the following Andrew Wiggins who will return tonight Bogdan bogdanovich and Trey Murphy  Murphy white crazy last night had 10 threes so keep that in mind yeah hmm  that's those are really hard time getting away from me I mean Murphy's been on fire lately and you know that the pills have been mostly healthy during that span  yeah we love we love with we love what Dean Wade gave us about Trey Murphy at four more threes than him was last night I need more of that I put trade more fear on top of the list yeah I think I would go Murphy Buck animage Wiggins in that order and Wiggins play better lately you know I mean it was such a disaster early on you know he's been more consistent but still it just doesn't look like the same guy and you know he you know he's only missed four games but as a personal absence we saw that last year and after he came back wasn't the same at all I think you're going to get more well-rounded production out of the other two whereas with Wiggins it's kind of just points you know lower end rebounds like one or two assists the defensive stats tend to come and go he's been better with steals lately I guess and the three-point shot has been relatively hot but yeah I would go Murphy bucket of which but it's pretty close I mean I would love to have any of those guys on my team right now especially in a deeper League all right we'll do one or two more and then we'll get out of here atheist says Gafford wreath meech for rest of Seasons slash fantasy playoffs we're getting to that point in the year Brandon where this is a pressing question I'm still trying to figure out how to pronounce his first name Yeah well yeah well I think it's Vestige that's what I've been saying at least we're talking the the point guard in Charlotte  Mitch's played as played really well the last couple games I mean he's had just had arguably his best game of the year 215 and 4 with two steals he's been piling up steals the last few games my answer of course would be depends what you need I'm still I'm still a little skeptical on gaffer just because of the playing time prior to last night and you know we'll see if maybe he turns some sort of corner as far as you know working his way into Jason's rotation last night but I don't know they have so many big men  so if you need you know if you're if you need a guard obviously you're going BJ's if you need you know Assist or steals me change I think in general I would say the one risk with me just that lamelo ball comes back at some point and then you're in big trouble but who knows if that's gonna happen I have no idea we've got no indication  as of right now  because I think I think eight and coming back is more probable than lamelo at this point I think I would go I think I would go meet you scaffold wreath I don't know this is really tough band did you feel strongly well I I think this is one of those scenarios where obviously the position the positional need matters more than anything else and then the second thing is if you're if you're special if you're setting your lineup for an entire week how many times do these teams play in week 21 and and that'll be something to look into as well but if I'm just saying in a vacuum  if I'm just ranking these players I I think I'd rank it the way you have it listed I I really like Daniel Gafford and I'm surprised that they haven't been using him more at this point after acquiring them at the trade deadline but maybe they're getting to that point so I'm sort of taking the beat on that wreath has been piling up stats so you kind of know what you're getting in him and it's good and then meets it like  who knows because you're right the second lamelo ball comes back if that does happen he's got no value whatsoever the other two are going to maintain theirs for the rest of the season  okay we'll do this last one real quickly it's good one to end on kind of a more abstract question kagay says advice besides the obvious for joining a keeper League it's my first year in fantasy this year and I'm by far in last because of injuries enjoying a keeper next year and I want to do what I can to be ahead yeah good question I mean it in some ways depends on what kind of League you're entering you know is it is it more of a dynasty format where you have contracts is it a keeper League where you can keep X number of players year over year are you doing a draft or an auction to start this league or are you inheriting someone else's team if it's the latter you're kind of at the mercy of what what they did with their roster but I mean with the keeper League there's there's one of two ways you can go right you're either going for it right away or you're building for the future right and my advice to you would be to to look at some mock drafts you know even once from this year you can try to find some early mocks for next year as well you know we have we have keep a rankings on our site that I would push you toward as well that we keep updated throughout the year but it's really about choosing your lane you know I what I would not tell you to do is try to do both you know in some keeper leaks you can draft you know draft picks or drafty you know out of the the draft pool I wouldn't go too heavy on those if you want to win next year you know someone in a keeper League you know someone like LeBron or Kevin  Durant or Stephen Curry those guys are gonna fall a little bit you're going to see younger players pushed up the board so in my opinion it's relatively easy to build not like you know the number one team but to build a competitive team right away if you want because a lot of other people you know kind of get it's a strategy wouldn't say they get lost in this but a lot of people you know really get the keeper mindset of like well this guy's 30 I don't want to take him right there's there's gonna be a lot of like you know DeRozan siakam types that you can load up on a little bit later in drafts and put together a really good team right away if you want to  and there's there enough really good in terms of building your roster at the top there are enough Superstar level players that are still at the beginning of or in the middle of their Prime so where you don't need to really worry about that with the top players that are on your roster so you should be good in terms of the top tier player that you're going to roll over year over year what you don't want to do is get overly excited about rookies or second year players just because you're in a keeper League the entire mission of being in a fantasy league is to win it any given year you get the opportunity and in the first year of a keeper league is still that you're still trying to win outside of the the set outside of the office so I'm actually gonna go off of the beaten path of just how to build a roster make sure you're in a league with committed fantasy managers that aren't gonna bow out in a year or two I think that's the key to building any successful keeper or Dynasty league is you gotta get in with people that you know are going to be committed year over year I we hear this all the time in every sport I'm going to keep my keeper League fell apart I'm starting up a new one that takes all the joy out of it if you're constantly starting a new keeper league so find the right people and then don't obsess over rookies  all right great stuff as always today Brandon great questions in the chat guys we appreciate you we'll keep doing these pods through the rest of
