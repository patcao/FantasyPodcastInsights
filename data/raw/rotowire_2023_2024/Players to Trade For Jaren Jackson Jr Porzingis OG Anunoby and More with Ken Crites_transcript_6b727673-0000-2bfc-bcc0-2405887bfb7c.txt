hey everybody Welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast  it's Tuesday December 5th I'm Steve Alexander Dr A  he's grumpy old man  cranky old man can the K train Crites  and we're gonna talk some fancy hoops right after this Suite Jam  can I think all of our loyal  fans know the drill by now we're gonna do some news we're going to talk a little Panic meter  talk about some hot players  our favorite segments get off get off my lawn maybe look at a bet  or two maybe  dig up another doctor a tale from the attic I saw brush with greatness I love you hear it first of all what's happening how are you  I'm well still getting over myself to losing last night but back to not caring about the innseason tournament after caring about it you know when your team's out then you're like oh it's stupid focus on the championship but I'm well how are you sir is it you know I know you're down in Atlanta you know we have snow here in Vermont it looks like a Christmas Hallmark special but House Atlanta you're like in a T-shirt  oh yeah we're good man we're good it is cold this morning it was like 36 but  it'll be close to  55 or 60 today I mean I may go play golf I don't know I haven't done yet  I scraped ice off the car this morning you're going to go play golf  well my son's windows were fogged up and he woke me up at 7:50  because he got stuck in the driveway  because we live on a mountain so he all the way off the driveway halfway down the mountain so I had to take care of that more antics  from the my son and his backup failures so  he's going forward he's okay maybe yeah we'll have to hear about that more at the end of the pot yeah I don't know how about those in season games last night sir yeah man um how about them I'll tell you the you know I'm from Indianapolis I'm sort of always sort of been a Pacer fan always sort of not been a Pacer fan I'm I was always more of a Dominique Hawks guy than I was Pacers guy but I'm gonna spend all my time at Market square Arena and at Pacer game so and also my bold prediction for this season was this patients are gonna win the East that was a heart that was a bet by the heart not the wallet there but I like it it well they wanted both I gave him bold but I like the mix of young and old Tyreese Halliburton is taking over the world right now first triple double that was surprising to me he was shot I texted you right away can you believe tonight's first triple double  I just assumed  it happened early you would think and I'll tell you the my favorite thing about this tournament so far is was last night because now the only game in town the only game on TV it's on national TV and it is a one game  winner go home situation and it was cool like that was fun I enjoyed it much more than the pool the pool process yeah I agree it was fun I'm bitter about the Celtics but yeah it was fun and hey you could tell the Pelicans are taking a pretty darn serious too yeah they wanted to fight um and the Pelicans all of a sudden look like one of the deepest teams in the entire league I mean Jordan Hawkins didn't even get off the bench last night yeah was I think it's very healthy  I'm not knocking little on wood here but we'll see we're gonna talk about Zion a little bit later because he's  I did I don't know if you saw Charles talking about him after the game but Charles was like dude if you're not gonna score you got to get rebounds yeah if you're not gonna rebound yeah you got a score I mean you got one of the other you can't just be out there  but at least he is out there and he's healthy so there's I do love it when Charles goes to town on someone he's one of the few people with enough gravitas to get away with that where they don't  players don't line about it  yeah so news news from last night we already talked about the paces a little bit Tyrese had a triple double it was a big triple double he's averages of what  it's 25 10 did you see that stat where it's only him LeBron him and Jordan and  Grant Hill that have ever done something I did not see that whatever it is gonna be there fast as a fast approaching but yeah the Halliburton stats are fantastic you love how the Pacers are like he's our star we're building around him you know that's where the fantasy gold is when it teams all in on somebody and everybody else is a piece to compliment them Halliburton some of those deep fourth quarter threes I mean there are four or five feet off the line  pure confidence knows their goal already backpedaling on some no one they're going in I was like oh that guy's got some colonies and the one he hit where he got fouled he didn't really get the release lease the following is still was money like I I don't know what you see with the  Tatum and his post-game presser yeah you swear it because he has to go home instead of  yeah  a Tatum is always played up the Family Guy his kids were running around but you know give him like family time or Vegas is like I don't want to go to Vegas  well you know Vegas has been an interesting place because it used to be for adults only and then yeah again the 80s they made it all kid friendly but it was super cheap yeah I hear everybody's like oh you get a hotel room for like 40 dollars you get free buffet you take everybody and just go crazy they get all their money gambling now you got like your hotel rooms 1,000 a night you're buffets 80 dollars and yeah and it's not all that kid friendly anymore again so yeah anyway Pacers are moving on we'll see who they play they play the winner of the Knicks and  oh next and Nick's Milwaukee  Nixon bucks yeah  on Thursday in Vegas  well we might as well skip number two and go straight to number three since that is also related to last night Pelican's Advanced Final Four  Spider-Man off night from Zion  Brandon Ingram looked really good with 30 points six times  Trey Murphy two games sample size but he looks awesome the car I was watching a Pelicans game a week or two ago I don't know they're announcer crew it's like an old reel old guy to imply by plane and what sounds like a young former player doing color commentary and the younger guy said they show Trey Murphy in a suit and he said Murphy's gonna be an a multiple All-Star when his career is said and done I was like oh I like Trey Murphy love is efficiency but that was quite the hot take maybe a bit of a homer pick but I've been storm Murphy on my bench in a few different League's love that he's back  and we'll see what herb Jones is role is moving forward they may alternate starting those guys  but am I overly excited about Murphy what do you think sir  you're overly excited about him I don't think I don't think the other dude is going I only heard Jones is going anywhere I don't think he's going away he's gonna be on the best best defensive players in the league for years to come yeah and he's kind of turned into a monster this well you know maybe Murphy doesn't need to start got 30 minutes off the bench last night so if he's their Sixth Man and probably they wanted to be six man for a while and bring him slowly back maybe give him a night off here and there he is his recovery I think it's safe to say that if you're hanging on the Jordan Hawking's or nice and Daniel's time to go bye bye there's there's Nicole is like second round guy this year he was never been a second round guy he's always sick well seven point guard role 10 playing true point guard which you never did in Portland just boost his assist numbers  and they don't even know oh he does he does I just well just not gone wood with that whole lung thing but you know enjoy it while you can  look at the king's I do want to mention he is supposed to come back for that game the next game what otherwise you said the winner of the Knicks Bucks game I think it's if they win and they play Thursday night in Vegas he would be back for that one yeah so we'll see he should be back Friday for there I don't know what they're calling these you lose in the tournament game whatever yeah and if you lose in the tournament do you still play on Thursday no I play on those ugly floors so they go back to your regular NBA floor yeah I don't know I I'm too old for these in season tournament Florida give me seizures should be back soon  hey let's I know you want to dive into the crazy Saturday game no games on Sunday which unacceptable but yeah Lucas game on Saturday  yeah I want to know like I woke up on  Sunday morning let's say I was tired  and my son one he can't drive a car he's what he and I was like now what he do he's like dude he had like 36 18 and 15 and they lost and I was like what and then I heard about the 30-0 run in the fourth quarter and they still they don't play defense clearly during that 30 year run but you know there's a real problem that Kyrie and Luke don't play defense and to have both of your guards  be sieves is kind of a problem you look at kind of turns it on every now and then kind of just say I feel like Lucas at least tries to play defense he tries he puts a body on somebody he Alters a shot now and then he posted but you can blow by Kyrie is like you know  but you know Kyrie's got the hood again arm moves around pretend he's giving effort  Kyrie reading play that game  he's got the store foot again day-to-day Derek  Derek Lively sir Lively went crazy  breakout 20 points on nine of nine shooting probably won't go nine of nine every night boxing boards yeah and seven blocks hello I I the fsga expert league is a free agent so I bid crazy money for him in that well I mean you have to and he's he's shown signs of doing that all year they need a big man out there clearly to play defense and get rebound are you saying you're willing to give up on the Powell Cleaver rotation I am  but you know also Dallas got off to really hard hot start to the season everybody's like ooh MVP Luca and well they're three and six over their last nine starting to catch up with him I'm surprised his back as it giving out yet from caring the entire team on it yeah  I yeah they need some defense their Lively could be the rim protector they needed for a while we'll see but  yeah he certainly meets the eye test to this absolutely absolutely all right and we got so we probably should explain this whole schedule tonight we got two in season games you mentioned one Nixon Milwaukee the Bucks are four and a half points  and then the second game out west Suns at Lakers were the Lakers are appointing a half favorite I think LeBron's game time decision calf but he hasn't missed a game is that just  phony baloney reporting by the Lakers to play it safe for well they they're mixing it up this year because last year they were both  questionable and Game Time decisions him and Anthony Davis well this year Davis's probable every night and James is a game time decision every night so they got to keep guessing um I don't know I mean you know LeBron's playing in the game right right lights national game Crazy season turning only gaming town like he has to play so I think they're about gonna play I  we're gonna talk about it at the end but I really like the Lakers done tonight actually  the question of the Lakers though question for you in the Lakers is now trade High Time with Anthony Davis before the inevitable street clothes injuries kick and  yep it's probably true right trade High on Anthony Davis when porzingis comes back it's time to get rid of him women Yamaha threw us a little red flag last week sure that they grow in 22 games and then he set out one so then to one game week and I just killed me but yeah there's a bunch of guys that my buddy Keelan Coach K was on here a couple weeks ago and he was talking about Anthony Davis and porzingis and Wendy and he was like get rid of all of them trade them all  solve your headache now instead of later but you know well and I think the Celtics particularly learned their lesson with Malcolm Brogden last year they pushed him a little too much during the regular season and then he got banged up in the playoffs and they'd be crazy to do the same risky thing with prisoners and then with me alright what are the Spurs playing for this year they're going to be in the lottery again they need a you know the they probably need to up the got upgrade a point guard probably salivating at College point guards right now they don't want to win now  I mean what is pop doing exactly is are they taking are they trying to lose every game they can because they've lost like 13 or 14 in a row 15 maybe uh the cool thing about Wendy he only needs 20 minutes I only need him for 20 minutes a night  and I'm good he'll get four blocks he'll get nine rebounds we're gonna be here about his back and then a knee or ankle thing all year round  no just give him his 20 minutes and put them on the bench and I'm good with that  let's let's let the man let's let the man play  all

oh 29 in there I know we got people at like us apparently I'm sorry  do one let's see here I'm gonna pick one out she pick one out before that I bet there's a question here about oh yeah  about a guy oh there almost all these are from the same dude  there we go I just got offered hardening and Jared Jackson Jr for my Halliburton  no hardcore win Trader fair I'm not quite sure what that hard ways you keep Halliburton come on it's crazy well one thing is I was gonna say is who's scariness right now we're getting ready to talk about the Panic meter mm-hmm  Jaren Jackson Jr was the first guy on my list yeah he's down in the 80s ranking wise he's he had a great game I think these last game he played he was 30 points the blocks are down which is the biggest bummer they're still pretty Elite but they're not shooting off insane as yeah exactly and that's just their offense as terrible you know like who's setting them up they don't have a point guard on that team  Marcus is out we all know Jaws out so he's got to create his own shot which is not traditionally  what he's had to do but the drop from 50% last year to 42% this year is  frightening  very it is and you know back to the back to point blank  Point Blank mesh let's go ahead and throw this up here to answer your question I'm with I'm with the K train on this one you keep you keep Tyreese Halliburton I don't think you want I don't think you want to deal with James Harden on your fantasy team this year I don't know if that was with James  you in Ty Lue are like oh geez I saw someone on Twitter like hey man I just need 10 games to get my bearings here and it's like game 11 7 points four turnovers  three rounds what PJ Tucker quote which I'm not sure is been verified I saw other people quoting PJ said there's not enough basketballs in the world for this team  not to go around just the entire world right  all the basketballs  from the entire world and there's not enough oh that was look a little prop too live questions maybe we get a little more at the end maybe I'll try to answer some live ones well you come up with your brush with greatness story and let's see if you've already oh yeah we can look at that I haven't thought about one doing that you have someone on your pan Amita that I agree with  Kate Cunningham just I mean the whole organization the whole team Shannon you know my Friday co-host is a lifelong die-hard Pistons fan and I gave him what's usually my old man rant slot and it went like 20 minutes Monty you know Monty Williams highest paid coach of the NBA hey nice work money good to see it with a tank Ivy's trade value oh but he was going in and out of so many topics and I just felt bad for me just that was a proud franchise  well I think Ivy's making it come back I'm not too worried about Ivy anymore I kind of think it's a good time to get in on Ivy you can draw off the killing his bus  yeah I was never on the kill you  that was one of those bosses that he or is that a little bus oh okay go there oh wait hey though Kate is deceptive because his numbers core numbers the county that's look fine  but when everything goes great right yeah when you added all together he's just I can't tell if he hurt you or helps you three years in a row granted his second year is pretty short but three years in a row shooting 41 and a half percent and what point is that  not just rookie Jitters and a real problem your lead shooter can't be under 42% that's like Marcus Smart you know lead defensive player can shoot that but not your offensive lead player yeah he he's not a good shooter and then the toes are up too he's at four and a half turnovers oh that's all  yeah so yeah I mean you know he's hurting teams more than he's helping even though you'll see him go for like 24  nine and six and you're like oh that's pretty good but there's no steals as much of turnovers as horse shooting gotta be at a points league for Kate so you'll hopefully you you hope the name value can help you in a trade deal or there's a Pistons fan yeah his name is bigger than his game for sure right now yeah and then Julius Randle dude like he's the very last player that shows up in the in the stats in the in the ranking on a certain website that I have looked at 188 he's got to be about the same place in rotavirus rankings you can't shoot he's not blocking shots he's not stealing he's turned two single he had two single digit point games in the last five but you can't you cannot rely on Julius Randle to do anything do you think that the Thibodaux constant yelling is just warn them down like I think some players love to be coached in some frankly do not and Thibodeaux strikes me as one of those guys who's voice is you get tired of hearing  pretty quickly not only his voice man I just looking at his face wise over there on their  right arms Crossing  he should play the penguin in whatever the next Batman movie looks like he's you know in the massive amount of pain on the sidelines and you know he's just screaming at people at all times and I'm sure they're just like look look old guy right like old man who's never won anything here really don't care right now I can see Julius Randle being like yeah I don't care yeah but like you can't wait to go home to kick his dog and then I think along with your Memorial permanently a panic meter listed player Andrew Wiggins we should probably throw Jordan Poole and tyus Jones on there as well like those three guys are just permanent we have pool doesn't surprise me I knew pool would be in over his head and couldn't be a team leader but tyus Jones I thought finally opportunity for Jones he's earned a starting gig  and he's been just Melba toast just nothing just  not seizing the moment I get it that probably pulled drives him nuts but  I had I had I expectations  horrible  horrible horrible all right he got he who's on your Panic list well I'm still well  Cade and Wiggins have mentioned  mikal Bridges  he's turning it around so this is more panicky last week but I certainly expected more upside from right now he's kind of an early fourth round pick value though everyone took him in the second verse is last year's just with Brooklyn stats his points are down is turnovers are up is threes and three point percentage shooting or both down and it's free throw shooting down I do think he'll turn it around but those were a scary first 15 games and you know what I thought with Johnson out early and then Camp Thomas was out we'd see Bridges really carry that team like he did second half of last season and it didn't really happen maybe hopefully it's just a slow start I'll say this though Brooklyn now now that they're healthy  I love what Nick Clarkson's doing net so I think are a real Challenger in the East I know I'm getting off topic but  I'm happy to see the bridge the Nets healthy and see what they do  I agree with you I mean they look good I mean if Cam Thomas is gonna do this all year  and I think he might and that's like you're super sleeper my 30 deep saviors Man of the Year baby this is this me the first week I've had him in my lineup this season in 30 team so I am very very excited about that I've been I think his real role is six man Off the Bench  you know when he goes on a heater you leave him in there he's always gonna shoot and whenever anyone's hurt you stick them in the starting lineup but yeah excited about cam Thomas for sure  um what about Spencer Dinwiddie man he is so he's a roller coaster and he was very bad yeah he is so that's yeah yeah I mean he he's a veteran like he he's actually not a bad guy to be putting in the middle of the cams and the Knicks and the whoever else not always kind of a shoot first point guard you know where I think they'd rather he'd be more of a distributor but what I don't what's so befuddling to me with dimwitty and I haven't been some keeper legs because it was cheap last year  he's a veteran right so why is his why is his performance so roller coaster like it's not like he's getting acclimated to the NBA here's a guy who's role should be pretty clear they don't really have a great backup point guard why is it so dicey what did he's role is and I don't know  I first thought I was Simmons but we haven't had to deal with Simmons for a while and he's still up who  exactly in fact why did I even say his name it's so pleasant not to say his Simmons no no sorry I was referring to Australian ghost that I saw angry yeah he goes  with me that could be a keeper yeah that's good the Australian goes and then who's the little shooting guard that is gonna disappear now that now that everybody's healthy um why can't I think of people the nets for the next yeah boy I don't know where you're going with this but oh the dude not cam Thomas no not Lonnie Walker Lonnie Lonnie was kind of balling there for a minute but I think he always does he always been a tease with the Spurs with the Lakers and now that he's gonna have four great games this season and good luck predicting when those four great games I think he's already had them I think we've taken care of that they're already done but he's gonna go away I got him on a car on a roster too right now but they're healthy but that's like a nuts are healthy just like Hawkins yeah yeah it's time it's time to move on yeah because honestly they love playing defensive guys like Rousseau Neil Moore DFS you know so he's not gonna be Dennis Smith that was the the bad backup point guard I was trying to think of yes yeah we should not be pushing didn't witty for  minutes though Mavs fans they used to think he was the Savior remember how many years ago did you think you know to the Mavs think Smith and look forever we're gonna be the dream combo that seems like a 1000 years ago yeah it was  all right Ken you got some get off my lawn  I am tired of NBA players complaining about every call every call he met a Docker was right when he yelled stop bitching the LeBron James it's a terrible look for the game get back on defense play the damn game I love Jayson Tatum six Celtics Homer but maintain him complains on every call when he should be getting back on defense it's the one thing I hate about Tatum's game  that's my get off my lawn what's your get off the lawn it's a good get off my lawn and I'll talk about Luka Duncan because he's my guy and he complains more than Tatum and LeBron put together I think he complains after every single play yeah literally and you're right man this just get out get out there and play like I know look the refs aren't perfect yeah they're humans this game is played at such a speed and pace and Tempo I don't know how reps keep up with Pacers games I be like at my niece trying to keep up with a you know with the wicked Pace that patients are gone but so they're going to miss some calls play defense you make it worse when you miss a shot badly then complain about the call and the other team goes down and gets an easy layup that's like a 4-point play oh trust me nuts um  I'm gonna go back to an underdog bad beat from last evening that involved Obi toppin of the Pacers  his overnight six nine Obi up and yeah over was three and a half rebounds  like  he's gonna play Big minutes he's playing against Boston that's a lot of shots which means a lot of rebounds  he's got to hit the boards I hit four out of five and Obi top and finish with two rebounds  pretty sure he had zero in the entire second half  so thank you  six nine Obi topping and then Jordan Hawkins was in my dang FanDuel lineup and he played he had not sat out any games that's far he was playing well he only had to score like nine points or something ah and I would have been fine but he didn't even get off the bench so I I guess he's done I guess that run is over train Murphy plus 24 Point differential last night plus 24 that could be the death of a Hawkins right there but back to your top and rebounds I had the over on Al Horford getting seven and a half rebounds he got four in the first quarter I'm like haha easy money he then got three the rest of the game in fact Tatum twice still rebounds from him I'm screaming at the television what are you doing  Horford's been so good since porzingis went down I thought exactly and he was gonna have a big game yesterday and you know they rested for Cornett in less meaningful games but I'm like this is in season tournament big out did play 31 minutes but he took three shots and guess who outplayed him Coronet cornette yeah he Thunder jams and he was making hustle plays he was getting Tommy points he really was he was the Green Hornet it was fantastic yeah  yeah that was oh that was awesome Payton Pritchard over five oh he was he's yeah that was I can't I can't roll with Payton Pritchard unless I know  somebody's not playing he needs a true point guard to set him up and they're pairing him a banking you know the former Toronto Raptor youngster who's like six 10 playing cards crazy lengths but he doesn't he's not really a point guard he doesn't set so Peyton's always trying to score off the dribble and that's not his game he needs to catch and shoot some easy threes to get the group oh hey who are you let's get to Hot players who are you excited catering who are some  we have Tech issues all right I was gonna ask you I'm the first you go Scotty Barnes is returning first round fantasy value  finally  but  last year's big friend lost here  just a lady here the breakout was just a lady here and I didn't see it I didn't see it coming man I was like is Scotty Barnes really ever gonna be as good as we think he's gonna be in I mean we're only 20 games in but he looks amazing well it's only his third season and remember every article was like the only way the Raptors can improve this year's eve Scotty Barnes  you know breaks out  and yeah the the blocks you know one in a third blocks a game is fabulous shooting more and yet the shooting percentage goes up not down  fabulous  the nine boards man the boards are fantastic  I mean I thought they were talking about making him a point guard but he's playing more like a power forward like yeah well he's still getting five and a half dimes he might be is that more than Schroeder he might be getting more assistance is a shoot first PG but let's see what he's also destroying ogn and Obi in the process yes he is Schroeder's got seven assists a game oh I take that back sorry Dennis you an apology oh gee is killing me and if multiple weeks yeah what I they well isn't he in a wok here isn't he and spicy P you know isn't this the last year they're contracts you gotta believe I believe so they can't keep both those guys they may not mind oh gee losing value  well OG I mean he he's finished he died he was like third round last year he's like 8 or 9 this year it's like it's drastic it's not percentages of Tanks haven't they let me look this up like yeah he's gone from almost 48% to 46 but his free throw shooting is down to 58 57%  how does that happen how do you go from 84 to 50 percent in one season  ask Andrea Andre Iguodala he did it multiple times  good point I assume that was just age though because he was like 48 when he retired or something yeah I don't know but yeah Scotty's rise is led to OG's fall it would appear okay well you're taking a big name and pointing out how he's even playing better I'm gonna go the opposite route and make a free agent scrub suggestion Malik Beasley who I hated in real life because his defense is terrible but in fantasy he's their catch and shoot guy there's no Grace in there anymore content and Crowder are both hurt  bees is getting crazy minutes because they're bench now is bad um and look I do I want them on the Celtics no I do not but do I like him catching shooting threes and he's rebounding which is shocking to me it's probably a two or three week run but check Malik Beasley is a very cheap pickup in your Waiver Wires I totally agree with that he he's the guy who are some other cheap pickups right now that  what well maybe not cheap but if Mike if old man Mike Conley is out there he has been steady and reliable you know he ranks commonly ranks 50th in total stats in nine category League he's got a six to one assist to turn over racial he said over two threes a game and everyone just assumes he's semi-retired but you can get him on the cheap  he's pretty rough man I I and you you've been talking about him for a minute so this is not it's not anything new I think Derek Jones Junior on days when Kyrie Irving's not playing he's been balling out for Dallas great DFS his minutes sustained though when they're healthy I don't know if I mean I don't know man but he's  his game log is  33 minutes 31 minutes 34 minutes 20 minutes so he's played 30 in three in a row  and in those three in a row he's kind of he's kind of balled out yeah yeah  like yeah yeah we'll see greens been out for hasn't green missed a few games for them yeah but I think they're done with green oh really oh I feel like well not done done but I like der Jones Junior can help us right now we're tired of waiting for green for Green's going to bench turning to this thing  Dr Ace let's mark this day in time  and get to this one I'm back for weeks from now  four weeks from now um so yeah there Jones junior is a guy I have been I have been grabbing  I always thought when he went to my Amy he was gonna do well many signs of Chicago when they had  that big three that are not very big and you're like he's not gonna get any minutes of Chicago and I've never been a DJJ guy  I just think that the I think Luca likes him I think Luca trust him and Luke and needs somebody to trust because he ain't got much you should replace the neek Jersey back there with a luka Jersey because your heart got clearly several of them all right I'll do it right now  but the other guys I had on my list they're all the mostly big names Chet homegrown first round fantasy value thank you very much everybody yeah for doubting him and I was one I assume the injuries would pile up I did it's early still happened Herbie Jones third round values CJ second environment he would talk about these guys and Malik Monk  which you didn't get into  when we were talking about the Kings but you don't like to King's bench other than Malik other than mine they mean what do they have they have no you know what was the bonus is your Center you need somebody else's room protector and they don't have them trails  no not gonna happen that Ben scares me Sasha V you're a league MVP has not really panned out for them I think he's only ever less than 6 points a game yeah that King's bench scares me but back to cheap good pickups how about JJ but the other JJ in Miami with bam out of bio on a week yes Junior Hockey is all here you know we had a discussion about him on this podcast we could go yeah and I was like man when they're back at full strength I get it like Jaime  has turned heads he's one spool stir over he's won his teammates over he looks right out there and guys are like but  he's got he is he gonna get 30 minutes and is he still gonna be worth having and I was like  I don't think so but now I'm not so sure like I think they sort of need him  it's almost like though they'd rather he lead the bench Squad then take heisman's role in the starting lineup right like with the starting five they want ban and Butler taking all the shots or hero when he's healthy  and so I think they're happy with Jaime leading the bench Squad kind of an a man new role  but we'll see I think he's gonna get his minutes but whether he starts or not 30 you're right might be a problem but you know when bam first got hurt who was that in that when they had was it Indiana  they let they let hockey as play a Caleb Martin and Butler uh for like a 15 16 17 minute run where they just left the Pacers and their wake and you're like oh it was impressive because yeah he passes well from the perimeter he's posting smaller guys up  it's an all-around game that you can see spoils to really likes ya and I think his teammates like it too he's out there you know dapping it people up and chest bumping everybody and getting them fired up like  I don't know man I think I think I'm a Huck is maybe worth holding on to for the entire season so yeah that's a good one um  but you like what you like on the gaming side of things tonight I'll go gambling and then you think about your awesome  brush with greatness  maybe I can answer a few of these live questions that are coming in  that's a lot of multitasking on my truck in that but let's see my I'm getting ahead of myself sorry my bet tonight I like the Nicks eighteen plus four and a half at Milwaukee the in season tournament just changes things just saw with the Pacers  man up against the Celtics last night Buck's and nicks have only played one game this season the Bucks won it by five but the next shot under 40% in that loss and the Bucks hit 51% of their threes I don't think that's gonna happen again what to me was more telling from that one matchup was that the Knicks out Rebound in Milwaukee 56 to 41 and I do expect that to continue to happen the Bucks are missing Crowder and content they've really struggled to have some bench production and I think the Knicks might care about this more Milwaukee has grander plans so I'll take the four and a half points for the next tonight all right I'm going in Underdog I'm going with Malik Beasley higher than one point five blocks and steals okay it's got a separate which means it's a  it's a fire pit gets its yeah it's like one point five times  money  so yeah I'm kind of feeling Malik Beasley I'm so feeling  Lopez higher than five rebounds okay and I'm feeling Isaiah heart and Stein needs to get me one block  one as you pointed out the way Randall's playing hartenstein should get a little more minutes right should and then I have got  Anthony Davis in the little article I wrote for ESPN I've got Anthony Davis winning the MVP of the n Season tournament which means the Lakers need to win it all which means they need to win tonight and it's Lakers minus 2 against the Suns I'm going with the Lakers minus two I think if ad and LeBron come together on the same page  Austin Reeves plays well  good things can happen honestly I think what one and done format plays the Lakers Advantage right like those guys can't stay healthy for a seven game series but one and done perfect you know there's got old guys could they could do that and then take the next few days off hey I'm RotoWire client Underdog is really won you over I love how you're all in on the end I play every day yeah I put like 12 lines in for a dollar a piece trying to win the lottery  fund fantastic fantastic yeah so I end up in gambling Hospital  a bucket day a bucket day you can sell that road to wire travel bug on eBay you know I am I'm one of those guys where I I know my limitations they always say don't don't bet this if you don't think you can afford it oh I know I got that covered and frankly it's sadly one dollar still gets me excited I love the game all right you think about your brush with greatness story I'm gonna try to pick off a few of these a live questions one says do I drop Killian Hayes for Derek Lively yes yes and yes I can't say that emphatically enough  somebody Trey Murphy has the higher ups oh wait somebody's asking Murphy or Brogden you got to go Trey Murphy just because  he's gonna be healthy bro you're gonna drive you crazy on nights when he does or does not play  absolutely go a trainer for Brockton I really hope by the way that doctor is getting some fabulous member of Billy he is an insane memorabilia collection  a DFS question should I pick portisch tonight or pick up herb Jones for Thursday  hmm I think I go with herb Jones I think that bit of a coin flip oh I do see some paraphernalia Let's see we got here  I can get Bane for lamelo should I accept I would take Desmond Bane  lamelo balls game Count it's going to be a problem all year oh you went to go in the Luca  we might have to either tilt your camera down more or raise the the Jersey rack to see these better but  I'm talking to a man with his headphones off sorry but you survive without me I rattled off a bunch of answers from the live questions which are fans very pleasantly entered thank you very much is there one I can let me see if I can do one thoughts on Reeves rest of season  Austin is going to drive you nuts he look he's never gonna be he might not be top three top four options that offense  I would I would I'm not I'm not a big Austin Reeves fan I think he's a little more popular for reasons I'm not allowed to say on this podcast  wow I am an awesome I was expecting him to be  a focal point the third call if you will yeah for them and I still think there's a lot of  time and hope for that to happen  I think Dilo doesn't care to pass he will pass to Hall of Famers  but I'm not sure D'Angelo is going to be giving the ball up much to us  has looked really good at times yeah here too he has  all right all right give us give us your brush greatness story and I spot what I've got here what I left you by yourself for is this is a Karl Malone oh autographed Hakeem a tonic  is that what is that brand what is that brand these are the atonic dreams this is this is akeem's signature shoe back in the day and these were neutral gray but Carl as a rookie colored this in purple  with a marker nice you wearing he was wearing these and then this is a Wayman Tisdale that was his Pacer days I assume right yes yeah so anyway I was a I was Reebok when we bought was in the game and panel on a lot of money for players yeah I was a big mailman fan when he was a  sure Louisiana Tech I thought the Pacers should take him instead of women Tisdale Pacers took women so male so male and I and was always good to me rest in peace William and Tisdale great guy so ma'am it comes off the elevator I'm like oh hey man like this is the stadium in Indiana but this is most maybe fans don't know right you're you're where would you camp out after Pace's game and what stadium are we talking well this is before the pace of game in the Hyatt downtown Indianapolis okay okay thank you so the elevator doors open this is 1980  for somewhere in their doors open on the mailman comes out I'm like man what's up man  we should have taken you instead of Wayman William's garbage you're the man let's talk trash Hendrick just pandering oh just trying to work the angle he's like thanks man and I mean do you think I can get your shoes at the game he's like  yeah man I got you I might go okay I'm like I'll just be waiting outside the locker room he's like  sounds good man it sounds good he like really couldn't care less  Bobby can I just  kept walking with him to his team bus  and just Wayman Tisdale all the way there so so he gets on the bus oh my God man good luck play well tonight I was like yeah I'm gonna get mailman's shoes like I'm so excited and  so after the game is over  I don't remember I've got the stats somewhere but I don't have the handy but mailman or all the you all the jazz players come out of the locker room I don't see mailman  and so like just Bobby Hansen comes off the bus or something whatever and I'm like hey Bobby do you know where mailman which I don't reserves love being asked about the Starboy he went back to the hotel like 20 minutes ago like he he got a private ride or some some stuff I'm like walking back to the highest with Bobby Hansen and Mark Eaton oh another jazz player Rich can't say the guys it's hard hard to just quietly walk anywhere with Mark Eaton I would like a human tree and they were they all want to go somewhere to eat but it was like Sunday night Indianapolis in the mid-80s there was nothing going on it's like a ghost town I remember one of them kicked the door on the Nat King Cole restaurant on the circle and he's like this place sucks and so we get back to the hotel  and wait how old are you by the way at this moment no like  15 okay yeah I got you yeah and about the same age as my son who can't drive a car  and  so me and these three dude Rich Kelly was the other players named and three of us walk back  and I don't see  I don't see a mailman anywhere but then  the team bus pulls up  and everybody's getting off that  and about that same time another car pulls up and mailman gets out of that car and gets into a black Mercedes that's parked right next to the team bus  and my man this dude is avoiding me so hard so I of course walk over to that Mercedes and knock on the window the passenger side window  window rolls down its horses black tip went to Rose down I look in their mailman's looking at me  and I look in the driver's seat it's Wayman Tisdale  club together like Bell beds sell you out does he say to women hey this kid said the Jazz should have or the pace should have taken me instead of you  I don't know I'm like hey Wayman mailman  you told me you were gonna give me your shoes what's up he's like  I'll just put up he's like dude I'm wearing them  like  I'm wearing them out they're the only shoes I have  like are you kidding me right now like you tell me you're gonna give to me well you know I didn't know I was like all right man well have fun tonight I'll see you later I like turn around like like Charlie Brown you know after Lucy pulled the football or  he goes hey man  and I go Steve he is  all right he's like I'm gonna leave me at the front desk you come get him tomorrow and I like  all right and I was like  alright yeah this is going that's not gonna happen so I went home went to bed got up for school in the next day of course first thing I do is you get the white pages out the Yellow Pages out and I look up the highest number I call them I am your answers phone I go hey this is a weird question but is there a huge pair of basketball shoes sitting behind the front desk and she goes what's your name and I said Steve and she goes yep I've got him right here and I was like no way so I went to school and I had to wait all day and I got you know my mom drove me down there we picked them up and I got them I was like it's accepting women left one so it was one from mailman no no Wayman was a separate transaction oh yes separate time when you were telling him hey weren't the Pacers smart they took you and set of Malone yeah that's but instead of  I could listen to your brush with greatness stories all day we need our we need RotoWire to fly Us in to the company meeting so you and I can just sneak off to the bar drink old bourbons and  and I want to hear brush with greatness Stories the whole night I got a lot of yeah that one that one's that one's pretty good one um yeah I can't believe he left him and I haven't taken very good care of them but they've also they're just deteriorating because they're all 40 years old but you don't see you don't put them in like the the plastic box thing you don't have some of your stuff's probably worthy of the plastic box stuff it is it is but when I when I had my house in Indy I'm sort of Rich back then because I didn't have a bunch of kids and I had a I wasn't in the fantasy sports industry real job yeah and I had this I had this shelf around my pool table where I had all the shoes like up on the shelf and I give it just it was kind of badass but then we moved to Georgia to the middle of nowhere and they all went and trash bags in the movie truck and they just sort of been sitting around ever since I installed in my sports cave in the basement a shelf above the TV from my bobbleheads so it's bobblehead collections I don't have stuff you have but I have some more amusing than valuable bobblehead stuff done there but my daughter's got a brave bobblehead collection that's pretty sick nice it's up there with the best ones I've seen nice yes nice all right man well I think we did it we ran a little bit over but hopefully it was it was okay for Story
