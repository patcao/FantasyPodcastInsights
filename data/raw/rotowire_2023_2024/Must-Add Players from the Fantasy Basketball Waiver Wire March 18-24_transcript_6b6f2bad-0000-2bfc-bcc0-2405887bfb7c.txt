welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by a sponsor smart bracket.io it's Friday March 15th 2024 Alex barua here with Shannon McEwen and Ken k train Crites all board  so last night Luke Adams sat out Thursdays 1:26 119 loss to the Thunder due to a hamstring injury because MRI came back clean tentatively considered questionable for Sunday's game against the Nuggets he's coming off a streak of seven consecutive 30-point triple doubles he is the number one fantasy player in 8k 30 days above victoriano and Nicole yokich Luca right now  third in MVP odds at 10 to 1 behind SGA who is 41 and Nicole yokich the favorite at minus 270 can I ask you does that feel like the right order  I think it's stupid that the MVP rankings are just regular season because who cares how people do in the regular season feels like a rant is this a physical stupid who cares  regular season MVP I mean I realize there's a lot of people wagering money  and by the way  OKC Thunder played in California the East Coast SGA would be running away with this it's it's horribly biased by media markets and I don't care who's best in the regular season if you lose in the first round of the playoffs you're not an MVP  this is partially why I think yoga just such a heavy favorite is because I think people want to give him the award for what he didn't win last year in addition to being Finals MVP and willing to finals it's almost like voters remorse in a way well also in beads injury right like there was some number two guy and then yes yeah and B was already coming close to game Count issues before that  anyway can we have some unfortunate news to quickly pass along yeah oh yes yes RJ Barrett could be out for an extended period after his younger brother passed away RJ did not play Wednesday and will not play Friday that is all we know right now  and our condolences to the Barrett family though you know I thought they listened to the show I hope they do not that's not what they need right now unfortunately yeah Shannon we got some expected or unexpected I don't even know how you classify it anymore Ben Simmons update yeah Ben Simmons underwent a second back surgery in three years he had a microscopic partial dice discectomy I believe is how you say that he is expected to be fully recovered for next season's training camp  Simmons played in 15 games this season average 6.1 points 7.9 rebounds and 5.7 assists in just under 24 minutes for game  yeah the Scott I think it's this guy to me that's a tough one to say basically you're gonna shave off part of his discs doggie herniated he actually this is  I think last year a couple years ago he had like a micro detector me so they like shaved like a little bit now they're gonna shave more off of it so I like he's supposed to be recovered for training camp I don't know if people are going to draft them next year back issues are tough man I've said it on the show in the past you know Rob Gronkowski Dwight Howard there's numerous players across various sports that have had back injuries and then never you know they'll come back and be quality player still but never quite the same never able to reach that Peak that they had before and you know same with me with Roto yeah never gonna be 25 years old Shannon again oh contract wise Mr Simmons has one more year you guys want to guess what he's gonna make next year with the Nets  40  40 million you nailed it 40 million point three technically even the point three is not that good for 40 million 40.3 million and then he will be in unrestricted free agent  he has a player oh no sorry unrestricted free agent so the net scared  Mike gets another 15 games out of him next year but not good for Brooklyn I wonder if he'll get signed I think someone else signed him for really cheap if you want to continue playing I mean I don't know how motivated I don't think he cares I think he gets up I mean he's making 40 million alone he's making a 37 million this year I'd be I'd be looking for spots in the Caribbean like Foo everyone lie down if if he ends if he ends his career he can say hey look I was well MBA player one year all defensive player I you know he could sleep on a giant pile of money Alex who cares what he want I'll be like I need my my tie at 10 a.m. I'll be lying here pile of cash thank you  in more fun news we had DeMar DeRozan passed three players last night in all time NBA scoring he moved up to 30 seconds he passed Elgin Baylor Dwayne Wade and Adrian Dantley in that order never gets the love he deserves a goodness gracious I loved his he's like four foot one and had the best post moves  and it is seasoned with your beloved Pistons or in his crew with your beloved Pistons I believe right Shannon know they they traded him for Mark McGwire before they be actually became like the true Bad Boys he ended his season with my beloved Milwaukee Bucks did he a career actually career yeah just like Moses below right um yeah that's a good trivia that's a good part oh no no he didn't Milwaukee two years Philly back to Philly and then the Spurs for his last year I mistaken that's slow game is lasted forever he didn't speed was not an element yeah he could just stand under the rim and do this with his elbows and just like that you do like 87 head fakes and until you went up he just keep doing it Defenders would jump just out of boredom just out of like let's end this 65 small forward back in the day when everyone had to have post moves no matter what position he played he and Isaiah Thomas famously did not get along which is the big reason why Danley was traded because he was he was like an All-Star Calvert player for the Pistons but I said I didn't like him so he's toxic curve and and Mark McGwire came in and really solidified the Pistons rotation  and we have now officially lost the age 20 to 35 segments so maybe we should well very quickly I do want to mention everybody above the Rosen and the all-time scoring list who is retired is a Hall of Famer except for Vince Carter who is eligible in 2024 and as a finalist for the 2024 class so can I ask you which may spark another old man rant is DeMar DeRozan a Hall of Famer  but maybe this is two questions do you think you should be in the Hall of Fame and will he probably be all of them  I'm gonna say yes and yes I mean at some point just the career stats you just have like you just say like to your point when when you're at a stat level where everyone around is Hall of Famer isn't that the I'm not like those baseball guys that love to get into 72 hour arguments and start political rallies about their guy getting in or not getting and it's basketball and honestly the tap western Mass where they host the Hall of Fame they're just desperate for any kind of attention they get so they'll be happy to have the DeRozan family rental hotel room  I think he'll get in I think he'll get it I don't know if I deal world like if we really cut down the hall of fame to make it very illegal if he would get again but I think I think he's gonna get  hungry let's okay let's talk about our friends at smart bracket please  hey

the web we have a kid knock on our door this week  trying to raise money for her soccer team to go overseas on some like I don't know a trip whatever and it was like I said oh what are you selling I'm thinking like cookies popcorn wrapping paper know it was a bracket you're 14 years old you're you want me to bet in your you know soccer teams like this is screwed up  he's like give me chocolate or something like like a 8 year old knocking on your door yeah at least start cooking her mouth hey I bet the overall it's modified you over two and a half threes trust me but she said it's Rocky and Sluggo over here to break my knees  oh my God  okay Ken before we dive into waiver wire do we have any feedback that's feedback questions Mr malook asks Vince Williams and Max Drews  both on my IL do you think they will play next week  and help his first week of the playoffs  the truth injury is a little concerning to me at this point it's a knee strain and he's been out for six games  and they don't necessarily Cleveland doesn't have to rush him back and on the other on the other hand you know for Vince Williams for the Grizzlies they don't have to rush him back either because they're pretty bad um  but  look I don't have a more information than we have on RotoWire in terms of their technically day to day but neither of these teams are going to be in a rush to get these guys back that's all that's all I can say and let me have but you're more the expert on this Alex isn't Desmond Bane going to come back I'm sorry does come back it'll be like one game here one game not here but if he plays a game or two he's right at Vince well they moved to point guard though I guess there's enough lack of talent in that starting lineup there be room for Williams and Bain if they were healthy so yes I think I think I think Bane coming back will affect Vince Williams usage but I don't necessarily think Bane is going to play in every game I have to I have to shout out a someone who works in our industry Josh Lloyd on him looking at Jaron Jackson's game logs and noting who Jaron Jackson plays against versus who he does not play against  he does not play against teams like Charlotte and Washington  Brooklyn's on this list Portland is on this list twice so he did play yeah he did play against good teams like the Clippers play against Minnesota play against Atlanta yeah play against okay see it's so you know I think there's some selective sitting going on  so if you roster Bane  be careful about that let's say oh certainly Bane yes but William yeah I who knows his plan for Memphis between both those players at their their day-to-day officially in questionable so there's a chance they're going to return just say watch the news over the weekend and if you need to submit a Fab bid for replacement you know get that in because it might not be determined well know more about Williams for Saturday's game and I'll just throw this in Mr malook  he is giving us a shout out from Jakarta Indonesia hello Indonesia we are loved in Indonesia next question comes from Christian Rogers I'm going to guess he's not in Indonesia thoughts on Toronto's power forward Center jaunty Porter  possible Silly Season candidate  look I'll say yes possible but I'll let Shannon touch on this since I talked about like three minutes of last second ago yeah Porter's had a couple a decent games off the bench for Toronto he has 25 fantasy points and 41 fantasy points and only 22 and 21 minutes that that's really buoyed by four blocks and one steel and that 41 Point outing so he has upside he has the ability to go out there and rack up some stats if he's getting the minutes he is the brother of Michael Carter Porter Junior correct Alex yes he is so there's that it's in the blood I I I'm not a big believer like to see him get a starting nod before I am gonna stream him in but if you're in Daily League's and you need a streaming spot you know he's worth he's worth a look while Toronto's banged up because they are extremely thin right now totals out for the year is that right it's on officially out for the season yet but is it assumed Alex yeah yeah  turtle and porters on a two-way deal but I can't imagine he's anywhere near the game Count where they'd be concerned about him playing too much or losing the two-way status and you got Kelly Olynyk is really the only Center there was really half a power forward and Barrett's out now they've been playing a power forward so maybe you'll Linux slides over too because we don't know how long our chip Barrett's gonna be out with that family tragedy yeah and one thing I will say about Porter may not matter that much he's very injury-prone  he like missed his entire rookie season basically with a knee injury that was undisclosed I know this because I checked right now and I wrote 18 Porter notes and they were all out Friday out Thursday out Sunday still out Friday out Wednesday ruled out Monday out Saturday out Saturday yeah so um injury prone but everything Shannon said is true he if he plays he will he can pull up numbers  I feel like you're gonna start questioning your career choices when you realize you wrote 18 Dante Porter oh I was questioning its sentence as I wrote another one I was like can we just say he's out for the year like can we just make up our own sources  and then Reds 22 well I'm on this has a strategy question  I think I know the answer but it's do you recommend picking up streamers first thing in the morning right before tip-off  uh well I don't I don't play any daily transaction League's I will say  it's I mean the earlier the better in theory because you get nobody else is gonna be able to get to them if you get to them first I think if it's right before tip-off that's a good time for like guys were questionable to you know also depends if you have a transaction limit like I'm going to daily leak right or transaction so if you get somebody early it all sudden there's some gem that you may have used up your transactions for the week  yes and any thoughts here yeah I mean I often times will even try to pick them up the day before if possible to me it's always the earlier the better  so that's the route I would go you just have to take more time dudes research and identifying the right players to to pick up so the early bird gets the worm you might say yeah by the way shout out sweet Pistons hoodie I know you've worn it performed on the Pod but looks good chance  thanks we were auctioning it off pop warning Pistons hoodie what's our charity  my salary back pain  we should it's time for the money segments of the show  the way for wire we have per usual two regular picks and one long shot pick the regular picks must be roster in less than 50% of leagues one long shot pick must be rostered in 25% or less of Yahoo leagues at this point in the year across the rates are a little more nebulous let's say for game Count next week Charlotte and Dallas have two games and the rest of the teams are basically split between three and four so keep that in mind when adding guys when dropping guys Etc  my first suggestion Houston Rockets jock landale 29% rostered elper and shengwen out for the rest of the regular season coach he met dossier is not starting Jack landale who is a traditional backup center they've instead shifted Jabari Smith who was their starting power forward up to Center and then slid on and Thompson into the lineup and then they bring landale Off the Bench but landale and back-to-back games played 26 and 27 minutes in the first game you pick up 11 4 and 5 with two steals in a block second game 13 and 1 that's good enough for me the minutes count everything for me to I think you can probably roster landale for the remainder of the season it's a long play but the Rockets do have three games next week he's the only legitimate Center on the roster unless you're a big boat on fan I like his ads I do not care for his game  I love mobile I wish I wish they would play ball Bond they won't Shannon your thoughts on landale he's a solid option you know he will be coming off the bench but it's encouraging that he played 27 minutes in the most recent game on Thursday night against Washington who is also going small so Lawndale is even seemed 27 minutes against a team that has a opposing team has small lineup so that's encouraging I'm in a highlight the guy who I think is the the key Target for the rocket shortly  and I'll say for that fan interested in Porter boy I'd rather have land for sure if that's a waiver wire option for you I'm first of all fans if you like our videos please hit like And subscribe Below on the YouTubers here we would really appreciate that that's how we justify doing these things I'm kind of going all Euro for my picks this week and I think we've named all the names I'm bringing up but there's still out there still available let's go to Detroit for Nina Simone fontecchio Tech 19 the Italian Ford for Shannon's Detroit Pistons he's only roster in 42 percent of Yahoo League's he has started the last two games for the Pistons he ranks 30th over last seven days average stats and in his last three games almost 19 points over five rebounds three threes and one steal over with excellent percentages but get this over 36 minutes a game at this point you were just looking for minutes and opportunities plus the Pistons have four games next week multiple beneath on tekio pick him up  yes sir my first suggestion of the week  amen Thompson swing man guard forward for the Rockets 45% roster as Alex mentioned is out for the remainder of the regular season with an ankle injury Jabari Smith is slid over to the five and that's opened up the starting spot for Mr excellence in himself amen Thompson he's been a top 25 player over the past week based on average stats and those average his averages since joining the starting lineup and playing two games as a member of the starting five are 13.7 rebounds three assists and two steals his field goal percentage is pretty insane right now he was nine for 11 against the Wizards last night but he also totaled 46 fantasy points in that outing I am lucky enough that I had him stashed on my bench and a couple weeks he absolutely should be rostered in 10 and 12 teams moving forward remember when we were complaining about the Rockets being too deep and Terry eason's out cam whitmore's out now sanguine is out suddenly there may be happy to have old man Jeff Green I don't know yeah it was a great matchup last night for online going against the Wizards who have no centers everyone everyone's a good matchup going against I I watched her last like eight minutes of that game and I was like I don't think either these teams are really care about who's gonna win right now even though the Rockets were like up 15 I don't know what's worse the 18 Porter player news notes are you watching the end of wizards who was it Wizards I was having I was having some dinner you know that Rockets Wizards sure yeah it was oh you know what you know I should actually we didn't mention this at the top Josh Green got hurt the other day too it was ankle sprained it looked way worse than that I actually washed that live I thought  Victoria's Achilles it's not that which is good news it was kind of crazy my my next wave suggestion Batista eyeball we're at this point the season where yeah Portland speaking of bad teams Portland's out of four game week which means you could stream in Matisse thybulle  he has scored points in nine straight games  that's huge for Batista Bible who does not always score points but most importantly the Steals and blocks are still there 2.1 steals 0.9 blocks over the past nine games again it's a four game week so you can stream him in and you might get yourself you know eight steals five blocks something like that so if you're if you're in desperate need of that you know what to do  can  let's go to the ceiling beach oh yeah beat me to that glorious pronunciation probably doing me a favor yes vasilia meech the 30 year old rookie Serbian guard for the Charlotte Hornets look this is a playoff stash okay Charlotte has only two games next week every different commissioner site handles the NBA Playoffs differently and there are options within each site for instance I'm in an ESPN League that the first round is two weeks and the finals or two weeks so check your rules and meet which is a great pickup but not if you he's only got two games next week look the Charlotte season ended months ago they've essentially turned into OKC's Gleek team with meech man and poke chefski meet you just started the last six games for Charlotte and they bumped Trey man from point guard to shooting guard Wednesday night me just had 25 points and eight assists that was against a woeful Memphis Grizzlies Squad he shot nine of ten from the field that's not going to continue but more importantly look last six starts for meets 16 points over six assists almost two threes well shooting in Elite 93% from the free throw and most  importantly playing 30 too many minutes a game for these terrible Hornets there's a gazillion minutes of playing time for mechanic after this week when he only has two games it's wild to me that his roster percentage hasn't gone up more 32% we've talked about him three out of the past four weeks I believe yeah absolutely 36% but I don't start any ESPN is like two all right Michaela Shannon my second recommendation for the waiver wire is George the minivan Yang for for Cleveland  roster and 11% of leagues five consecutive starts with Evan Mobley out he's averaging 14.2 points 4.2 rebounds and 2.83 pointers and 28 minutes per game he's got a top 75 player over the past week I believe niang will stick in the starting lineup even after Spruce returns so probably reverse ocoro or Dean Wade those are two of the other guys who have received spots one of those two will go to the bench and Spruce will pop back in line up so I think Yanks pretty safe for as long as out they need the anxiety with Mobley out and as someone who could mean is someone who could stand to lose 15 pounds and lived in Cleveland love Georgia's game love wait he plays bigger than he is too and he's still a perimeter guy yeah I like him that way if you will yeah big man body big thick boy oh man okay  let's let's move to quickly our NBA DFS wait section long shot sorry yeah I got hey I was doing something nice work I was I was I was multitasking we had a job screen projections issue I was fixing it all right yeah  even watch this podcast I'm typing numbers on a different window I got mad men talking about other men being thick and my ear I don't know what's going on anymore um all right oh yeah TJ McConnell all right you've heard me do this argument Emily time pick up  Timothy John the man has four games next week you know what that means fire him up because he will get you 20 assists  you  say that he might score 20 points at any given game over his past I'm gonna go back farther past 11 games for TJ only 20 minutes a game but 13 points 5 assists 1.4 steel shooting 60% from the field all you gotta do is watch the Patriots play and see they just controls everything when he's out there so pick him up for four game week Indiana Jake laravia of the Memphis Grizzlies average game stats ranked 69th and 9 category over the last seven days look we do not know who's playing for Memphis night in night out their Arabia has been a bit of a bus pick for them so they're just giving them all the minutes if people owe us up both knees they do not care the guy can create his own shot score off the dribble also hits threes last eight games almost 14 points five rebounds 2.1 stocks 1.43 but he does have a low field goal percentage Memphis has only three games next week so that's a problem but decent long shot he's only managed in 16% of Yahoo and only 4% of ESPN's so if you're desperate Jake laravia someone's got to shoot for Memphis  that is factually true and that's the point of the Season that we're out with Memphis and we've been there for a while yeah okay and let's wrap this thing up yeah our final long shot suggestion of the week nickeil Alexander Walker or Walker Alexander I think I might type which one is it now I'm confusing myself exactly Walker yeah golly forward for Minnesota 7% rostered he's seen a larger role with Karl Anthony towns or way is the towns Anthony I think dammit these names these hyphenated names and my backwards typing cats out for hours and hours yeah yes towns is out Alexander Walker seen minutes he's averaged 21 and a half points five boards three times four trays in 33 minutes over the past two games Minnesota has four games next week yeah it's the kill Alexander Walker will most likely come off the bench he did receive one spot start but that was with Kyle Anderson out Kyle Anderson will probably started for but Walker will see increased run either way his plays up and down  but with the four game week if you're in a weekly week he's worth a look if you're daily streamer he's worth a look so go scoop him up this pods off the rails so do you mind if I tell Mike Karl Anthony towns Story please do all right we're in Vegas for the annual meeting which occurs during summer ball this is four or five years ago I'm racing to the elevators in our Casino  and just before the doors closed this giant hand reaches out and stops the doors and opens them and there's Karl Anthony towns alone in the elevator  and I walk in a little  fan boyish and I'm like whoa I thought rookie of the years got their own elevator he looks me in the eyes and goes yeah Wiggins is using it oh I almost wept the joy that we were like like I'm friends now with Karl Anthony towns but I asked him I said is Tibbs yell a lot and he just shakes his head  yeah  and then you were detained by the corner oh  charity beat the hell out of me I stood next to Marvin Moneybags Bagley in the Vegas Airport during one of these same summer trips we're standing in the bathroom you know you're on all next door urinals to each other and a man yeah and I wanted to ask him so many questions but yeah McGee there's Jake McGee Jarvis McGee the old Wizards draft pick Joel Veil thank you I do it at the time I forgot it now Javale McGee and I yes all waited for luggage on that on a similar Vegas trip and oh shout out to I also shared an elevator in Pittsburgh with Jerry Stackhouse who just got and he was coaching Vanderbilt they were in town to play pit we were in town to see our daughter in Pittsburgh and anyway  Jerry sorry but you got laid off by the camp Vanderbilt this week that's a Milwaukee Bucks Legend Jerry Stackhouse team Detroit Pistons Washington Wizards Legends I mean all three of us actual Detroit Pistons Legend I believe he led the NBA in scoring one year when he was on the Pistons that you know so I I first of all he was head to toe in Vanderbilt Clothing my wife had no idea who he was and  I said coach  um my Celtics aren't given Nesmith any time and he just laughed his head off and he said he's and he met his dog house  I was like all right cool Jerry Stackhouse and I friends  oh you reported it on road a white Jerry Stackhouse told me  he's with officially in the dog house  are we done wait wait wait  yeah we just talked about how we got all right Mr DFS advice and I will answer questions oh boy there are six games today  highest over under all these over under I guess her playing a discussion now we won't get into that 223 and a half is the highest over under at Atlanta versus Utah she got some questionable guys in that game Taylor Hendricks about Don witch Jalen Johnson a look they're only six games on the Slate we can probably just quickly go through them all but first well Shannon let's just start with Miami Detroit that's it that's your crew  yeah that's a decent game to Target I do I actually like the Miami side a little bit more and I'm siding with Jimmy Butler he's got two games against Detroit this season already and he is averaging 48 fantasy points per game per game in those two contests one other big note to pay attention to is Cade Cunningham he's questionable for tonight with a left says left knee injury management is the reason for that so you want to keep an eye on Cade he's 8500 on DraftKings a couple good outings from him against Miami too averaging 46 fantasy points per game in two contests if kids that's a big boost for Jade and Ivy 6200 on DraftKings he's eligible at point guard and shooting guard a sar Thompson already ruled out for tonight which means another spot start for Simone fontecchio Tech 19 at 50 I believe let's see let's confirm his salaries about 50 100 sorry 5300 on DraftKings so that makes him a decent value option you know for me there are two other games that I'm watching Pretty closely  all right you guys just you guys just sit back and listen can take those headphones off you don't need them  all right the two games I'm really watching Utah versus Atlanta it's the late game and then the Clippers and Pelicans James Harden is uncertain for Friday night and we saw with Friday what happens when James Harden is out its bones Hyland time baby don't Highland went off for 50 fantasy points last night in the spot start 32 minutes 17 points 11 assists five five rebounds four steals if hardens out again  Bowen's island has to be in your gifts lineup he has still vastly discounted because the Slate came out before last night's game finished phones is 4300 on DraftKings I will say you know we got a we got a good morning from Alan Siuslaw ski esteemed co-worker video editor content creator we must have been really screwing up for Alan to check out this video  that's the fans I posted the wrong time so yeah Alan it's been a train wreck and I'm a big part of that I'm sorry Shannon that's fantastic day of us advice  yes bones Island time it's in full effect oh yeah about shooting right like if they get the minutes he's a Gunner he does not care who he angers  absolutely I will say you know Shannon mentioned the Miami Detroit game I like Rozier tonight and that match up 6800 it's not bad for Rozier Detroit's backcourt defense not great as without a star Thompson being there Phoenix vs Charlotte Phoenix 10 point favorites on the road we'll be down Eric Gordon notably Charlotte's still down the Bella ball Seth Curry Caleb Martin  look we talked about the ceiling Beach earlier he's been balling out for them it is a tough matchup though is there anybody in particular that you like in this game or is this kind of a stay away for you a little bit of a Stairway meech is solid solid value it's the second half of back-to-back for the Suns right they played on Thursday night so that worries me a little bit I want to see you know it's very possible the sun's decide this the night off for a couple of their regulars we'll see if if he's active and it's Booker or Durant sit for some reason I do like bread Beale draft teams just a good value under 7,000 one one last pick or a couple guys I want to highlight one Toronto we had mentioned short-handed Bruce Brown he's been getting extra run back to back out with with 30 plus minutes and 30 plus fantasy points 5900 on DraftKings and then the Utah Atlantic game that I mentioned earlier really like the Utah side Utah is sitting they've already ruled out numerous players for tonight Hendrix is a game time decision but Clarkson done and  all ruled out  they don't have anyone at the guard spot other than keyonte George Colin Sexton maybe it's been hot he's gunning he is shooting he is a dimes you know even even telling Horton Tucker could see some extra run tonight but but both Sexton and George are fantastic values like you imagine Kenyatta George been on fire he's got back back he had one minor game where he left early due to due to illness but he jumped right back in and back to back 40 Point outings he's only 6600 against a good matchup against Atlanta you know the myth of the the myth of the Shantae Murray's defense being quality continues to be a mess so he started yeah he doesn't care and he knows he's not even gonna be  he's not gonna be a hawks uniform next year right is he  I don't know what Atlanta is doing Atlanta is like number one in the league in terms of like individually I like all their guys and they just disappoint all the time but yeah I think there's out there marinas like a Terry Rozier and Charlotte situation where it's like he's he can defend but he's going to for this team yeah  I want to go back to I was a glad you went over Bruce Brown because the Raptors are so short-handed has DraftKings overpriced Kelly Olynyk now with his run of big minutes you can't over price caliola it's impossible to over 7 7000 but he has three actually I mean look since March in March 40 fantasy points 2241 2042 43 45 so he's I think he's appropriately priced actually he locked to get a fantasy point for a minute so yeah I agree I think I think he's pretty much appropriately priced I don't like the matchup against Orlando though  yeah Orlando Stout defense slow slow okay let's talk about one more game here I don't think you mentioned it Shannon Detroit excuse me Denver San Antonio got one banana going up against the cola yogis Denver's been playing some of the best defense the NBA as of late they've really turned it up a bit anything you like in this game this is another game where the road team Denver is the double digit favorites  yeah well blow up potential is certainly there no big surprise you know Michael Porter Jr he's been out on a nice little hot streak recently Aaron Gordon's discounted yeah on the on the San Antonio side I like I like so Chan I was just gonna say so on yeah exactly on he's been on a nice run and he also is only 6,000 on DraftKings you know he's got back-to-back 34 and 38 Fantasy Point outings in the past two he's been very solid for for the Spurs lately had a 36.9 week ago too yeah absolutely and you know  the blowout of this is that the Nuggets sit but I don't think pop cares about he's not gonna rest his young guys like so on those guys need as much experience they can get right he's gonna play regardless of the score  yeah I think so yeah I mean you could look at anybody's game logs I mean if you just want to use you know when but Yama sort of a barometer when pajama hasn't seen less than
