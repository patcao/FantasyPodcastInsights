welcome to a Monday edition of the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast I am Nick Whalen  glad to be joined by Alex barua Alex we we have not done this pod together the last two weeks we had James Anderson standing in as we did our win total over under predictions for the East and the West you can find those archived on YouTube archived on this very podcast feed but this will be the pairing every Monday going forward save for any days off that we have and this will kind of be a weekend recap all the you know this early in the season we got six nights worth of games now under our belt Alex I want to kind of just parse through a bunch of players a bunch of teams and you know kind of basically play a game of like all right is this real is it just a short-term trend is Damian Lillard going to be a minus 38 every single game he plays for the Milwaukee Bucks I don't know but we will basically trade players that we want to talk about and try to give as much fantasy advice and as much knowledge as we can about set players and let's begin with the Milwaukee Bucks we've only seen them in action twice they played on Thursday against Philly and then at a pretty disastrous game last night against the Atlanta Hawks out some which they fell behind early they did not shoot the three well at all you know tacked on some threes and garbage time but I think at one point they were three of 21 from Beyond The Arc we did see a much better performance from Giannis on Sunday compared to opening night but a nightmare showing from Damian Lillard you know one of the worst first half of his entire career he finishes with just six points on two of 12 shooting two of eight from three did not get to the free throw line after living there against Philly on opening night your takeaways for bucks  yeah it's I'm a little concerned about the box I will say I mean it's it's still early but you know it didn't look ah basically the the chemistry between Giannis and Dame has not looked amazing so far and I you know overall I just felt like I was expecting more open looks for both of them you know I thought they'd play off of each other a lot better and youngest to be getting all these Rim runs easy lobs loader be hitting these basically wide open threes off a tough screens it just hasn't happened the boxer still struggling for offense and a half quart like they were  basically over the past decade with moving holes oh yeah it was a little more encouraging on opening night but you know it was it was kind of a give and take right because I thought in the opener the honest really did not play well at all and I was like it was like a c minus game from him it wasn't finishing well I had seven turnovers just didn't really look like himself and Lillard was there to pick up the slack but it kind of feels like a two-man team right now and we should know no khris Middleton last night that's a big deal but we saw a very limited version of Chris Middleton in the opener and I think that might be the case for the next few weeks here as he ramps up and you know that they need guys like like Malik Beasley to show up night in and night out and you know Jake Crowder obviously he's more of a defensive guy at this point but if he's gonna play 25 to 28 minutes most nights they're going to need him to hit open threes he did not do that last night so it just feel like a little more Reliance on somebody's on proven players early in the season for Milwaukee I don't I don't think this Hawks game is anything to panic about I think we've seen one pretty good showing from Milwaukee one pretty bad showing and we should know Atlanta shot 51% from the field they hit 15th threes you know guys like jail Johnson who was moved into  the starting lineup DeAndre Hunter they played well the Hawks role players vastly outplayed the Milwaukee role players because it's not like you know Trey young and deante Murray had fantastic games in their own right and they only could buy it for 35 yeah I mean that the Hawks definitely were hot shooting that was part of the equation I thought the Box you know they came out flat energy wise again the offense was chugging Atlanta hit like a lot of  not even really contested mid-rangers they just they just hit a lot of you know shots that are you know like they're gonna miss more of those going forward so it was a combination of Atlanta's a little hot to walk he's kind of sluggish  but yeah it's just not a great start from Milwaukee I mean I've only I only saw the second half of their first game against Philly where like littered completely build them out and then I watched the first three quarters of this game before going to garbage time and hasn't looked great so far yeah a little bit shaky but again I think what's Chris Middleton's back up to speed you know things will move in Milwaukee's Direction you know one thing fantasy wise that I do want to know is we've seen we've seen a little bit of a reduced workload for Bobby Portis again only two games and there was a lot of garbage time Sunday night but he's played 40 total minutes through the first two games you know was averaging closer to 26 28 minutes per game over the previous two seasons that's something that I'd like to see out there a little bit more just because I think they need what he brings on office  I think they do I mean portal is one of the guys I wrote an article about like overrated draft picks in the first 10 rounds of of fantasy this year and I think Portis was my 10th round overrated guy I just thought they're gonna be as much room for him to operate in the offense and that's that's kind of born out so far I just think he's he's pretty much a drop whatever fantasy league you're playing in unless it's like a 16 Team league there's just too many options off the waiver wire this early to advantage of an upside guy  so the Lakers in action last night they've already played three games lost in overtime at Sacramento that this was his Lakers as it gets you know once again role players struggling Austin Graves is off to a disaster start to the season he was one of 12 from the field last night the Angela Russell for some reason played 41 minutes I mean he's been a huge negative I think for this Lakers team thus far one of five for three he and reached for one of 13 combined from downtown big news on the Sacramento side Jared Fox you know rolled his ankle was able to come back into the game you know push through it and over time but it sounds like he's going to miss some time they didn't really give us any sort of firm time table I would guess you know somewhere in the range of two to five games minimum so you know get him out of your lineup in a weekly leaks this week and then you know on the Lakers side of things I think we step this one out Alex I opening night there was no way that LeBron James was gonna was going to you know stand Pat and just you know be okay with playing 28 29 minutes a game here we are three games into the year and he's already played 39 minutes yeah I hope people did not sell low on LeBron James after hearing that news  yeah they just they just need him out there I mean in theory they shouldn't have to because that was the whole point of having Anthony Davis it's the whole point of rebuilding your roster with hachimura in their taking a flyer on Christian Wood having Austin Reeves in theory be able to score 15 to 20 points a game it just has not bore out that way and they continue to need 30 to 40 minutes from LeBron pretty much every night  yeah I got that's the way it's gonna go if they want to prioritize winning regular season games which in a competitive West they're going to have to do that I don't see LeBron you know it's not gonna be 39 minutes every night but it's not going to be 29 either I think he'll be right at his his normal workload I mean we go through this every year right I mean it's like once he turned 30 every team that he's been on whether it's been the Cavs with the Lakers have said well we got to pull back on his minute you know we can't be overextending LeBron and then they find out pretty clearly that without LeBron you know it's a total disaster and they need him out there so I think for better for worse this continues and you know we'll see what that means wear and tear wise for LeBron he had 27 15 and 8 turnovers last night however we did have a question early on in the chat Alex Franz Wagner Keegan Murray if you're I just assuming just kind of taking one for the rest of the season Keegan Murray 17 points 8 boards five assists two steals a block and three three-pointers last night but frogs are off to a good start I would lean KRON Wagner yeah in pretty much every format I would say I mean more so in a points format but Wagner you can make it out you can make an argument that he's their code number one option with Paulo bannerot and Keegan Murray at best is the third option and in Sacramento's offense like yes he's a great three-point shooter he's gonna get some Steals and some rebounds and stuff but Wagner is Wagner is the man  yeah two games so far for or Lando they actually catch the Lakers on the second night of a back-to-back tonight like that spot if you're looking for kind of a money line Underdog to go with it I think this is a good schedule spot for Orlando but boggers big great and you know obviously the three-pointers of what you think of with Keegan Murray but you know Wagner six of 16 from the ark so the attempts are there through those first two games let's talk about Yakima I think we kind of inadvertently mentioned him and this will be a good segue to to discuss the Toronto Raptors as a whole they lose on Saturday 114 107 to the Philadelphia 76ers it's been a good start fantasy wise for Scotty Barnes so he was doing a lot of things in that offense you know if you took a late flyer on Dennis Schroder that's been good so far he had 15 and 10 on Saturday Gary Trent just doing Gary Trent things take a ton of shots not being super efficient but both yaakov portal and Pascal siakam off the sluggish starts yes I mean Pearl you know first game against Minnesota that's a tough matchup for him against Colbert uh Place 24 minutes but still goes for seven and 11 assists stealing a block game two against Chicago He follows out in 19 minutes you got to keep that in mind that plays 25 minutes against Philadelphia that's a tough matchup obviously still solid six seven three with a block um I think you know what this tells us is Turtle probably is like a 25 to 28 minute guy within Toronto's offense if you were drafting him to do more than like for 10 and 10:00 I don't think he's a drop but it depends on shallow your league is and who's available unfortunately like that's that's gonna be the case or the sort of like answer a lot of the time but if you're in like a 12 team her I would certainly hang on to him yeah it's been disappointing relative to what he did after the break you know he came over midseason and you know finished out with 13 points almost 10 boards over 2 assists once deal one block per game like he's never been this crazy high blocks producer by any means so two blocks through three games I'm not really panicking about that you'd like to see a little bit more involvement in the offense but I think it's still pretty early to even say what this Raptors offense is going to look like I think they want to kind of test things out running through Scotty Barnes and you know it might not lead to a lot of wins but it's led to good numbers for him so far I was a little alarmed with the yakim only taking eight shots he got off to a disaster start on opening night like I'm just getting crushed in field goal percentage in some of my League's right now like him a ball Market in all those guys really struggled in the opener siakap was five of 17 look better against Chicago but regressed a little bit against the Philadelphia 76ers got some questions about Andrew Wiggins and Scoot Henderson in the chat Alex I I took some flyers on Wiggins late I actually thought he was a decent in value you know giving how much time he missed last season a lot of people kind of forgot about him and how important he is to this Warrior's team not somebody who's really ever had injury issues in the past I mean he's been a you know 75 sometimes 80 plus game player earlier in his career so I thought it was a by low opportunity but he's been relatively quiet so far and that's with you know Draymond Green missing a couple of games you know Wiggins averaging 11 to and one so far as giving you a couple blocks but it's he's one of those guys and I think maybe at this point in his career more effective in real life than in fantasy  yeah I think about a real life player than a fantasy player I mean this is like you mentioned a bit of a concerning start with the extremely low usage three assists and three games only averaging what is this 11 12 field goal attempts a game with the low minutes I have concerns I wouldn't blame you if you dropped Wiggins a special if you're attend team her because his upside is like I don't know what the 80th best player yeah is his best situation so worth considering dropping like if Jalen Johnson was available I would just rather have jail and Johnson than Andrew Wiggins yes school's a little tougher just because like you're kind of drafting him knowing that he might struggle a lot of the gate the the issue is like is Portland going to be really bad which they are really bad and sharp you know I guess it's really discouraging that every Sims is out for a month maybe even two months  and it's not scoot Henderson picking up more usage it's shaded sharp and I guess like higher it makes sense in terms of like sharp is there sharp is established  so it's not a great yeah screws scoot's not a great shooter he's going to have some trouble so yeah  I don't think he's a drop but  it's you got a monitor right for sure I think with scoot is you know the upside is there and I think there's going to be you know that fear of kind of droppers or more so if you do drop him but I mean you certainly I wouldn't be starting him at this point if you're holding him don't put him out there unless you're in a really deep League I mean it's been it's been ugly man there's there have been very few positives I know we got to go in a little bit in the second half against the Clippers but these last two games without Simon's like I was really excited to see what he could do against Philly last night and takes seven shots in 26 minutes and he's been picking up a ton of fouls which you don't normally see from a rookie guard I mean that's that's a young big band issue not something that you really think about with him so that's limited just minutes a little bit over the last couple of the games but I mean the shooting is been disastrous he's one of 12 from 3 he's been super inefficient I mean it's tough to swallow that in Roto league and he's not he's not giving you assist you know it's giving you a 2-3 game he's not really rebounding the defensive stats haven't been there so you know we're less than a week into the season that there's not like a bus drop for me right now but I would I be relatively comfortable  dropping him and I just kind of want to have somebody else deal with that that field goal percentage issue especially I do think later in the year he's gonna have the spots but I don't know if there's gonna be a lot of weeks like if there's a four game week for the Blazers I there's not gonna be a lot of weeks for School Henderson has like three or four really good games I think there's gonna be a lot of Peaks and probably more valleys he's got more turnovers than assist right now so that's that's obviously a problem if you're nine cat and I think you know maybe like you mentioned before game week maybe he started we'll see if you're in a points League you never know but at this point yeah definitely don't start a if you're in a shallow League I'm cool dropping him because you were kind of just hoping for like top 80 upside anyway and if he's not he's just not playing well enough right now  got a question in the chat about key update George Alex rookie out of Baylor first round pick for the Utah Jazz this is another rotation to me that I don't know that we've gotten a great gauge for it yet they got blown out started slow on opening night against Sacramento they end up beating the Clippers at a competitive game in game two and then get blown out by Phoenix last night tough loss with with no Bradley Beal and no Devin Booker out there for the Suns but you have to George looked good you know 12 points seven rebounds six assists one steel did have two turnovers but took 12 shots at 27 minutes off the bench my question is like how consistent are those minutes going to be for Kia George or are we looking at a situation where in games where the Jazz are not being blown out you know he could be more of a like 15 to 20 minute guy at best yeah I think  going forward you showing it assumed more than like the 20-minute game he's getting right now but they they're backwards they gotta figure stuff out back there because you know they're starting tailored Horton Tucker  Horton Tucker puts up numbers because he's not really a point guard Jordan Clarkson's a veteran Colin Sexton's kind of been all over the place he's also not really a point guard Chris Dunn is more of a Defender so the Log Jam is really going to just cap keonte Georgia's upside but if you're talking like someone to stash you know longer term in your family like who's someone I could add right now that may be in a month or two if I have the bench spot available could could pop off and I think George is on that list because the offense does seem to run like he's a true point guard  more than anybody else on that team at least with upside maybe Kris Dunn but buttons off size relatively low so um yeah he's a stash if you can afford it I mean I think it mostly as you can at this point right it's like you know if you're in a 12 or 14 Team league and you got four or five bench spots like I think there's a pretty good chance you can keep piante George in one of those like you have sometimes I like to kind of split my my bench between like a couple reliable guys who you could throw out there in a pinch and then some upside plays like I'm pretty comfortable putting key update George on that list I think the worst the Jazz play the better it is for him right like I think they if they're like one in seven a couple weeks from now I think you know maybe that means we see less tht we see more you update George but again they've played some you know two blow out so far so we don't really have a great handle on this rotation I could tell you what player that I'm starting to panic a little bit about just Walker Kessler the minutes of not really been there and again the blows are you know have something to say about that but 21 223 minutes for Kessler over these first three games did have eight rebounds on opening night at a block that's all well and good but you know two blocks for Walker Kessler 66 minutes into the year just you know 17 total rebounds you know for somebody who was being pushed up  draft boards somebody had to pay a premium for it's been pretty disappointing  this is a potential League loser tag category right now that we're talking about I don't think I have any Walker Kessler not saying I like blame anybody for taking Walker Kessler and like the fourth of the 5th round if you're taking him earlier than that that's that's pretty tough yeah they're just I mean I and I was even worried about John Collins after preseason but not Collins is now seeing more minutes than Kessler they're still playing Kelly Olynyk you know about 20 minutes a game because of what he can do offensively spacing the floor dribble handoffs it's just you can't drop it like you just can't but it's  I'm worried for sure everyone you should be worried  that a question in the chat about Terrence Mann latest update on him did not practice today that being Monday not trending toward playing tomorrow against Orlando at this point they play a back-to-back Tuesday Wednesday I would guess that he misses both have so that you know could be back in the mix next week but it's a two game week for the Clippers so you know don't put them out in any weekly lineups I've never been a huge Terrence Mann guy Alex I've been pretty clear about that I feel like the Clippers value him significantly higher than any other team in the league and he's 27 years old at this point you know he's not a he's not a 20 year old who hasn't really had a chance to prove it he's played you know 25 minutes a game over the last couple of years and every now and then I'll have a Boom game but I just never been that intrigued and you know I think the minutes aren't really going to be there for him unless one of Paul George Leonard her out so to me he's more of like a spot start in Daily lineups but not somebody I foresee myself being comfortable throwing out there in a weekly lineup League unless you know we're looking at a long-term absence for Hawaii or PG if the minions aren't even really the concern for me it's like the usage I mean you know because you even saw two years ago he averaged 29 minutes a game and ranked 181st and eighth cat because he can't get the ball because everybody else and like Paul George and Kawhi Leonard and now Russell Westbrook are there and um so even if he gets 30 minutes a game I just don't even I don't think you're really ever going to start him because he again we're talking about guy who somehow has been put on like a pedestal when he is averaging like eight three and two when he sees 25 minutes a game so I would prioritize almost anybody else on your waiver wire with upside compared to Terrence Mann and you can just stream the spot you know Phil guys in who are on four game weeks and start him if you have to you're just gonna get better value than that yeah and I know we mentioned PG and Kauai but you know that they're still handing it to him in minutes they're still you know trying to work Robert Covington into the mix and Powell you know even you know KJ Martin I think will be in the mix that those forward spots too so man's gonna play when he's healthy but I just don't see this being an advantageous fantasy spot whatsoever let's talk about the Washington Wizards a little bit Alex they are they are one and one thus far gotta win over the Grizzlies on Saturday after allowing 143 to the Pacers in the opener it's been clunky it's been very wizard Z as we expected but nonetheless you know good team win everybody in double figures got 22 Off the Bench for Corey gibbert in that Memphis game on Saturday Pittsburgh hit 53's look good so far I think he's performed about as he'd expect Jordan Poole 8 of 23 for 27 points that sounds about right terms of what we thought he would be doing calculus but one of ten for three on Saturday still gave you 21 and 13 you know what guy who's been a little bit disappointing I would say and we're talking two games is Daniel Gafford and you know look better certainly in game two then he did on opening night and we should know I opening night you know he went out with a leg  injury I believe came back but only played 21 minutes he was got four blocks there's two games that's really what you're targeting ultimately with Daniel Gafford but I'll let you speak on him I know he was one of your big Targets this year I don't really  I don't know why people are panicking to be honest I mean the first game was a blowout like you mentioned to Indiana they got destroyed so he played 21 minutes also had five fouls but still only play 21 minutes 6 5 and 2  that's pretty good for a guy playing 21 minutes and then against Memphis plays 28 minutes 10 11 and two so to me  I wasn't really expecting him to do more than 10 11 and 2 our projections for him were were actually like 12/8 and 1.8 so  you know I don't I don't think there's really any reason to panic about this at all okay there we have it and I will remind you we are two games into the season so things will change we've already seen some some Boom games and plenty of down games I think from notable players and I'm not worried about Captain at all I think you're right I think he's been about as expected so far and more than anything you're chasing the blocks right I think the rebounds will be there but if you could be you know two 2.0 block per game guy you know pushing 2.5 at some point if the minutes are there I think you're gonna hit your Roi and that no problem you know what guy that I was I was somewhat reluctantly buying in on this season Alex and I feel like I ended up with him in like three weeks when I had no intention of Landing him was really go bear he's like good so far I mean it's you know two big double doubles 15 and 13 on opening night 14 and 14 against Miami Heat I had four blocks and the open area gets Toronto did not have a single block against Miami but my entire case for Rudy gobert was last season was the Baseline if he could just improve even 10% from that you know we're not talking Peak Rudy gobert where he's the top 30 fantasy guy but if you can just be  slightly better than last season where he was going to draft like people would kind of closed the door I go there a little bit too early like he's only 31 as far as Big Ben go he has about his perfect of a track record as it gets as far as staying healthy they're just aren't that many seven foot three guys that gives you 70 games year in and year out we know what the you know the downside is going to be in terms of the free throws but he's also taking you know vastly fewer free throws now than he was during his Peak Utah years yeah I think I think you're right to to buy low on hongo bear and I think a lot of other people were doing the same you know because he was he was going I don't know around seven sometimes and it's like who else on the board you know has this kind of upside that's available at around 7 that's what we thought at the time now if you drive to Jalen Duren there it turns out you're probably winning your fantasy league right now but yeah I mean I I think you know I'm not gonna continue expecting like 14 and 14 games I'll go bare every single night but at the same time like that's you you can't be shocked by that because that's who he's been for the vast majority of his career I still don't like to fit  or anything like that he's aging yes he has he has bricks for hands I get all that but I just draft slot yeah you have to feel pretty good about what he's doing right now a couple of sponsors we want to tell you about before we head out underdog if you're listening to this pod you

fantasy we will see you in the arena  all right Alex a lot of reading need to take a deep breath another question in the chat about Nas read he's good so far through two games you know coming off the bench of course but 25 and 8 with two steals hit four three-pointers in that win over Miami on Saturday I love having Nazareth like he's like my safety valve big man you know we Center eligible and in most League's I you know not starting him most weeks but not somebody I'm looking to drop by any means like there's there are not a lot of situations where you have two you know established big men and gobert in town especially one in Gilbert who can only play the five and then you have this other big man coming off the bench who still sees you know 25 to 28 minutes a lot of nights like I I think Minnesota's content to play big I don't think they have a lot of guard depth and you know they're gonna try to you know kind of be that team that bullies guy's with someone like read coming in off the bench she could play him with gobert or with Karl Anthony towns so I'm absolutely holding nazri  I think you have to I mean I he's one of the best permit fantasy players in the in the NBA points League's category League's whatever you want to use he's a high usage guy and you know I was drafting this year at the end of the draft  hoping that he would see like 22 minutes a game  and so if he can continue to see 24 to 28 minutes a game he's going to be you have to have them on your bench maybe even startable on three game weeks definitely four game weeks so hold now agree no concerns whatsoever there how are we handling the Houston Rockets they are they're off to a 0.3 start look we we knew this would be messy we knew this would be a really difficult rotation to predict night to night even looks just completely annoyed with this roster for advanced lead at a couple decent games to begin the year he was very bad against Golden State yesterday 8 points on two of 13 shooting you just you have to live with those games every now and then from Fred Van Fleet but I I can't help but think he's got to be dragged down you know going from Toronto to playing with this The Supporting Cast of Houston that of course has a ton of talent and I think could be a really nice young years from now but still going through some growing pains and you know it's looking to me like it's not something that you know he made you don't go who I think is a pretty significant upgrade from Stephen Silas and it's just not something that's gonna be solved overnight now we did see Barry Smith play well against gold state 14 8 5 assists two steals I know he's had a struggles on defense you don't go up you know kind of called him out in his postgame presser but you know he's somebody who I was mildly panicking about through the first two  games but good to see him get it at least on what turned around last night yeah I think you know I think that's Houston team is going to be as tough to predict as we expected now the rotation I think is tighter than some people were expecting because well partially because you somehow Jeff Green playing 19 minutes a game for this team but I'm in Thompson seeing 18 minutes you know like you're basically giving almost no Cam went more tari eason's been out but whose minutes does he take when he comes back but yeah I think I think I'm Houston there's going to be a lot of nice words like different guys you know because everybody on this team everybody in the starting lineup has the opportunity to like take 20 shots at any given night and just get hot so I wouldn't be panicking about anybody or like over the moon about anybody that I drafted from this team that's at least in the starting lineup and your safest back at this point is probably just shangoo yeah I wanted to bring him up I mean 19 and 9 with almost seven assists per game so far that's been something that was a bit of a surprise we you know the assistive increased his first two years but this is a pretty big job and you know small sample we'll see where that ultimately settles does only have one block through three games so that's something to keep an eye on and the free throw shooting as is not been great you know it's not taking a ton about four and a half per game thus far but he's down close to 57% he was in the low 70s each of the last two years so I think that's something that will rise would not panic about that quite yet but we got a question about markelle fultz in the chat he's somebody I wanted to bring up as well we know we had a question over the weekend as well and one of her other videos asking you know Mark how folks or Kobe white rest of season you are our resident Marco full sky here at the wire Alex well I'll defer to you on this one  you know I don't think  I will say I it's a little concerning he's play only 25 minutes a game and his first two games but the first game was a blowout over Houston second gave us a little bit closer against Portland still had you know six assists and in 25 minutes I I would put my concern at like very mild but I think because they're still kind of experimenting with like Jalen Suggs and call Anthony has played really well  I don't think false is a drop but if he's gonna only like if if it's two weeks from now and he's still only playing 25 minutes a game then yeah it's gonna be a more difficult conversation more difficult decision to have he might still be able to get you five assists and I steal and a half in 25 minutes it's possible so if you're if you're a cat had category league and you're you're targeting assistance deals that's probably fine but other situations you can probably find somebody you know just stream somebody in If he if he can continue to see such low minutes  no that's transition to talk about the Oklahoma City Thunder who just you know they felt victim to the Denver Nuggets last night there's no other way to put it I mean that was a 33 Point Beatdown Denver LED that one from the job and really never look back at homegrown Knight team points take that for rebounds but no steals no blocks no assist for him just got a scoring night for homegrown you know Jalen Williams to be has been fine you know it's kind of picking his spots but just ask your game for SGA you're not going to see that very often you'll feel like we saw it some of the worst games maybe the worst games that we'll see all season from just Alexander and Damian Lillard you know happening like three hours apart he finished with seven points on two of 16 but we had a question specifically about Josh giddey I'm not not panicking on giddy you know it's been a rough start for 13 last night didn't get to the free throw line at all 9.3 assists two rebounds I think Oklahoma City to me is it's like a more optimistic version of what's happening in Houston and at least this core is growing together like I think part of the reason that Houston is struggling is you have a coach you have Fred Van Fleet and you have Dillon Brooks who want to win now any of a Corps of young players who are nowhere near ready for that whereas Oklahoma City's had some success last season you know they're all kind of in similar age ranges I think everybody's on the same page but it might be a while I think the the influx the inclusion of Chad homegrown all the sudden in this offense it's going to take some time I think to sort out okay who's who's losing some usage because you're adding a guy who you know ultimately could be a what you know 15 to 17 point per game guy  yes um you know it's interesting because giddey  I wrote an article about like when did potentially Drop Like An underperforming player or hey I drafted these sleepers he's not performing as well as I thought do I drop him or not giddy was one example I used to someone who was on who started the season on a cold stretch last year last year through goodies first eight games he averaged 13 points on 43% shooting this year's averaging 9 points on 34% shooting so I'm not saying he will like 100% shoot 50% of the field again but you're right to point out like integrating giddy excuse me integrating homegrown into the rotation is going to take some time he's gonna take his shots Jalen Williams needs his touches as well and this year you know  he had one like bad game against Cleveland in a close game  and then this last game against Denver was just a complete blowout and he only played 22 minutes so like three kind of weird games to start the year um I would I would not be worried he's still gonna be like at worst  I mean technically at worst he might be the team's fourth option but I wouldn't really like put him below chat in that hierarchy  you know we talked about the Blazers a little bit earlier but I want to back up and hit DeAndre eight and been very up and down so far and again Portland's been a tough team to judge they've been involved in a couple of blowouts lost by almost 30 against Philly on Sunday nights eaten had two seals in a block and that one had three steals in a block and opening night so he's it hasn't been all bad I think if you look at the cumulative averages so far is you know down big and scoring and that's what we'll hit on most but you know the rebounding is right where it should be able to steals a blocks are pretty in line with what we saw last season same with field goal percentage but he just has not really been a part of this offense you know have 14 points against Orlando on seven of nine but he's taking only 11 total shots in the other two games like is is there a case to be made here that especially now with Anthony Simons out of the mix that DeAndre it is really going to suffer from not having anything close to a reliable point guard yeah I think I think the issue of not having a reliable point guard  is um that's right to bring up you know Chris Paul was like spoon feeding spoon feeding 8 in baskets in Phoenix  it's weird though I mean he you know early on in Phoenix they would they would feed him the ball in the post they would have him in the in the on the elbow for these jumpers and  Portland's not really giving them that space to operate this year and I thought they would and especially now that Simon's out because I figured like well eight you know he's gonna be behind Simon's and maybe behind Jeremy Graham but like they got the assets so you gotta you gotta you know you gotta showcase what you have or see what you have and eighth and it just hasn't been the case the usage is absurdly low The only positive that you can take away right now is he's actually been amazing on the rebounds if you could sucker his workload he's averaging like 18 rebounds per 36 now how often is he going to see 30 minutes a game on this team that's going to continue to lose games by 20 points every night I don't know  yeah I just I worry about him kind of getting sucked into what feels like it could end up being kind of a disaster year for Portland and you know somebody who's holding a lot of Jeremy Grant this year I worry about that as well you know it's just there could be a lot of nights where they're you know they're down 25 in the second half and you know the thing with that is like who do you even turn it over to right it's like the young guys are already playing so I write I don't know I just I think Portland was Simon's being out I mean that is just a huge hit obviously for those who have Simon's in fantasy but I think he was somebody that was kind of get a hold of this offense together and with looking not ready at all you know with Shane sharp we'll see I mean he had that awesome ten game run at the end of last season I think he's the most obvious beneficiary I don't know that Malcolm Brogden is gonna be able to fully bail them out you know he's been fine in terms of his own statistics write 185 and 5 last night he's been Rock Solid but not somebody who's you know directly benefiting dehydrate and at least so far so yeah it ain't that again not panicking yet we're less than a week into the year but it's been it's been discouraging and and I think until Simon Says back there there might not be a clear path out all right let's see what else we want to hit here we got a question do we do we sell high on Scotty Barnes which is an interesting way to look at this you know I'm having some Scotty Barnes fomo so far I went pretty heavy on Pascal siakam just kind of I was trying to lock in you know known Commodities in kind of the the late early rounds and siaka was my guy got burned by Scotty Barnes last year but off to a really really good start and I think if you were if you were asking for for more Scotty Barnes the playmaker we've seen that if you're asking for more out of the defensive end we've absolutely seen that nine blocks through three games four Scotty bars 21.97 and 3 is his stat line through three games would you consider selling higher do you want to ride this out  I mean I would sell high if you could get like a guarantee top 30 player out of it I don't think you would okay if you can get that for sure I would do it because  you know some of this with Barnes is  the shootings been hot right he's 50% from the field he's 36% from three I don't think either of those numbers are who he is neither are the three blocks per game but I think the rebounds are sustainable I think the assists are sustainable and I want to be surprised if the average you know a little over a steel and maybe a block close to a block and a half per game and to me that probably translates into what like maybe top 40 Value top 50 value so if someone's going to offer you like Darius Garland for him  I would seriously consider taking Darius Garland or or someone of the like like Paul George maybe but I don't know how many people are actually going to do that so I think I think you're just good riding out with Scotty Barnes I brought it for a little bit and at least see how real this is I mean of course there is a chance that you know could have a couple bad games and you might not get those type of offers you know I think those are good players to mention and in PG and Darius Garland but yeah I would want to you know Bank a couple more weeks of this if I can because I think I think there's also a chance that Toronto is one of those teams that pivots midseason right and we could see like even more Scotty Barnes slanted offense if they were to part ways with someone like Pascal or Gary Trent you know their team to be that what we've seen so far I don't know that they could view themselves as anything better than you know kind of a borderline play in team which is the what they were last year I don't think they got any better I don't think swapping out Dennis Rudder for Fred Van Fleet makes you a better team and I don't really see that being a buyer you know unless something really lines up for them especially because they're not going to be willing to part ways with Scotty Barnes and other than that they don't have a ton of ammo so yeah I've been I've been missing out a little bit on Scotty Barnes and we need to pick it up I mean Dentistry  like we knew spot wise this was going to be good for him can he continue this like it I think he sees himself as like the the code number one option in Toronto you know I saw a stat on Twitter Dennis Schroder is top 10 in the NBA in touches per game yeah so  I think like your initial gut reaction is like nah a shooter probably can't continue doing this but he's like a very legitimate part of their offense playing 30 to 35 minutes every game leading the team in touches  so I don't see why he can't you know sustain this he's not even shooting that well at least from the field or from the free throw line not that he's gonna get to the free throw line very often but I don't I don't know if this is like a sell high if that's kind of like where where the question is leading I mean maybe you know on the on the off chance that they traded him you know to a contender at the deadline and then he starts seeing like 23 24 but it's a game that's certainly possible if you're really really worried about that I don't mind moving on from Schroeder but the way the offense is being run like this is I think fairly sustainable for him yeah I think it in until they make that pivot and you know that could include doing something with Rooter who's very movable on that deal I think it's actually it's just a you know bad team good fantasy spot for for Dennis Schroder get some questions about Klay Thompson in the chat Alex I'm really see nothing of concerns so far he's just kind of its a new version of Klay Thompson right and I think at this point in his career he's no longer you know quite as Elite as he was on the defensive end but at the same time you know I think everybody talks about clay like he's falling off the cliff over the last couple of years and you know missing as much time as he did with the injury I think there's just going to be some natural decline that you just don't get back after an Achilles and an ACL I mean that's just there's not a lot of track record of anybody coming back from that in their their mid-30s but you look at last season and play went through was ups and downs we were having these conversations still gave you 22 still shot you know 88% at the line the field goal percentage is what suffered you know at his Peak he was 4647 for the field which is wild for a guy  taking 78 threes per game but he was up over 41% for three last season he's at 40% so far attempts are slightly down but it's all right where they need to be though I have no Panic whatsoever on clay and unless you think that the injuries catch up to a met some point at age 33 which you know they could but I think he'll probably be about the guy that he was last year I think gold States gonna need him to be that yeah to me I mean you're drafting clay because he's a three specialists at this point I don't really think there's any other reason to to have drafted him and you know your concerned about the injuries  but I don't really think you're going to be able to to like you know sell high on Thompson I don't know if he  if you're if you're league is really shallow you know you could drop him in theory but I don't think I would he's just you kind of just  like if your team build isn't you know let's say you you're ahead category league and you're not targeting threes  I'm okay with maybe moving on from him I don't know if I would again I don't know if I would drop him maybe try to trade him to somebody else but um  if you're that worried about the injuries I don't know why you drafted in the first place unless you basically got him for free I pick like 120 so I'm I think whatever he's doing right now is just who he is a lot of bike Conley chatter as well Alex and in the chat two games under his belt so far I think he's looked about as expected right pretty much in line with what he was doing last season I guess the sister been slightly down but tough to really say anything over a two-game sample you know at this point in his career I mean Mike Conley is what 36 years old I think expectations need to be tempered with that said I still found myself grabbing him at the end of a lot of drafts you know I talked about you know wanting to fill out my bench and competitively with a couple upside plays and a couple of guys that I feel good plugin in on a four game week and I think he still fits that for me  yeah he's he was a low upside flyer at the end of drafts you know if you're point guard position was not really settled he just needed a guy there he's just a setup man for for Minnesota right he just sets everybody else up on the team  as a floor General it's his open threes you know I don't be surprised if he plays 60 games because he's 36 years old but you're good here yeah don't have a lot to say about my Conley get some big boost Nicolas Claxton questions as well I mean with Claxton he got hurt in the opener and you know didn't play the other night against Dallas not gonna play tonight against Charlotte the Brooklyn Nets also play Wednesday against Miami and then Friday Saturday back to back so it is a four game week a little bit of a tricky situation but you can't really start him with confidence right now meanwhile vous adventure and he's he's been as reliable as it gets right I mean you talk about a guy that's basically just gonna lock into like a 30th to 45th finish overall in Roto that's been the case for him for basically the last decade but it does feel like he's been a little bit marginalized so far I mean the Bulls set the NBA record for fastest players only meeting after opening night and I think vous Adventures involvement was something that was you know coming to a head already in the first game of the year not a great sign but yeah his used to just way down you know down at 11 points per game the rebounds are down as well if you had to choose between food and Clacks and you know assuming this is  not a long-term injury for Claxton who are you going to rest of the season  actually that's pretty tough  you know because like you mentioned which has been more stable his attempts her down he's been relatively healthy but he's older so he's still kind of an injury risk I think I would actually lean Claxton but I don't  I don't know if I would like actually make a move on that if I had either guy it would it would you know I feel like if I was in either position like if this was a trade on the on the board I feel like whoever which of the whichever guy I had I would be nervous to accept the trade  yeah what partially depends on your bill as well I mean if you're looking for blocks then you walked it I think I would favor Claxton at this point you know it does feel like the cliff could be coming for vooch at some point and you know the cliff could be coming for the Bulls team at some point and I don't know that he would you know if there is some sort of blow up scenario I don't think that would necessarily benefit him it's just it feels like the Bulls are going to repeat basically what they did last year which is going to be a really frustrating season and I think at age 33 at some point you know who isn't just going to be locked into 18 and 11 every year and we saw the blocks in the steals start to wane last season as well so I think there's more upside certainly wouldn't Nicolas Claxton what about Trey Jones the Spurs have been a really fun team to watch so far obviously due to women Yamaha didn't see a ton out of out of my opening night due to file trouble but the flashes of been there you know Trey Jones stepped into that starting role last season 13 points for Rebound six and a half assists 1.3 steals per game kind of a junior version of what Ty is Jones gives you but they're going with the Sohan pyramid so far this year and it has a better job so he played 25 and 33 minutes through the first two games on the 20th in a blowout loss to the Clippers in their third game at 5 Points four assists in a steel and that one I'm still okay holding Trey Jones in most legs I mean if you're in a shallow League then you have probably time to depart ways but I I still think even if he's only playing like 23 minutes a night like there's a lot of nights where he's gonna get you four five six assists you still gonna be a really high steals per minute guy  yeah I don't  the the Sohan experiment I don't it hasn't looked great the offense is really clunky the spacing is bad I won't be surprised if Trey Jones becomes a starter again sooner than later um  is he a dropping a ten team nine cat  I wasn't driving you know I wasn't gonna be drafting Trey Jones for him to be more than like barely a top 100 player he's just a low offside guy like Nick said he can get you six seven assists a game good steals per minute so if you're a category league and you need those categories you're good but if you're looking for just pure upside which you if you're in a team or your bench you can take a lot of flyers on upside guys you can be streaming in guys on four game weeks he's not a must hold it kind of depends on what your what your team building is oh tough question here Alex from yovani Javier Killian Hayes who's the better pickup right now it's that's a lot I think about where Jade night Jaden Ivy excuse me is that this is a legitimate question  is is neither an option I think that's kind of how I feel about right now um they're both basically saying that seeing the same minutes like what you're looking at is Ivy's got more scoring upside Haze has more upside as a pastor and Defender so if you're talking about specific categories that you need to show up consider that if you're just talking like points you know like a points league and you're just you just need that I  I don't know I you know like initially before the season I will get told you I'd be more worried about Hayes because Monty Morris hasn't played and Monty Morris is gonna come back next month  and well as he gonna take my meds from Kelly and now I'm worried he's gonna take for Jake and Ivy so I I would explore other options on my way for why you're impossible I some I think there's some sort of Disconnect between Ivy and money Williams you know just just the move to bring him off the bench right away felt a little strange Ivy did did Biff a windmill dunk the other night which is just like for guy who's like struggling to try to get back at the starting lineup that's not a great look yeah Detroit's a weird roster just too many veterans trying to get minutes like I do think this could this could eventually sort itself out you know if they part ways with Alec Burks Joe Harris guys like that you know if they sell off some pieces we haven't even seen oh yeah bucket image yet you know he could cut into to Jane Ivy's workload a little bit but I think for the short term I would lean Killian Hayes which which sucks I hate that I have to say that I like Jane Ivy a lot more as a long term piece but I just don't know that the Pistons value of the value of him that way right now all right question here how do you how do you see Jordan Poole doing in Washington I would say Alex that what he's done so far is a pretty good preview I think he'll be a little bit more efficient you know I think if he shoots like 42 43 percent for the field that's fantastic you'll take that every day of the week he's under 40% right now I would my guess is he comes in closer to 24 25 points per game but you know he was a four four and a half assist game guy in Golden state which is which is good you don't think of Jordan Poole as really a pastor at all I the presence of Titus Jones I feel like it's taking some of those opportunities away and you know now there's like this pool versus kuzma who could take more shots every single night like I I still think it points League Jordan Poole is super valuable and the boom Knights are gonna be huge like he could have multiple 50 point games this year and he could hit like 83s in the game you know for the course of the week like there's he's going to have some nights but as we've already seen you know I think he's also going to be prone to a lot of seven for 1823 type of shooting nights I mean this is pretty much exactly what we expect our Jordan Poole the man is no conscience he's here to do one thing on the Washington team and that shoot the  rock averaging 22 shots a game and 31 minutes again shooting horribly 37% for the field 22% from three if he can get those up to 40 and 32 you know because the volume is going to be so easy to take so many bad shots that you can't expect them to be as efficient as he was in Golden State  many I don't think it's passing vision is that good I think he got a lot of system assists with with golden state like you mentioned Ty's Jones is there but if you're asking me you know over or under Jordan Poole  20 field goal attempts per game for the rest of the season I would probably go over so it's  you know he should in theory be a top 50 player will win surprise me  yeah it's gonna be a weird stat profile I mean the other thing that's made him a better fantasy player in Roto is the field or the free throw percentage and you know he's off to an okay start there waiting too small the sample to say anything but you know 8793 88% of the line the last couple of years you know if he's taking seven or eight free throws a game instead of three or five like he has been the last couple of years right that becomes really valuable and wrote it as well because I think even in kind of a worst case scenario he's you know he's not gonna be a 78% shooter this year it's like you know 82 84 is probably the Baseline and he has he's already showing the ability you know usually when you have three straight years of being like 87 plus that doesn't just stop I mean that's like Elite territory guys like that tend to be really consistent so yeah that's another way that he could benefit you in rotol League's let's see what else we got here Alex still got a lot of good Henderson questions this one is yeah what do you think about a menopause Anderson should I hold for long term value and as we said earlier with scoot it just kind of depends on your league size like if you're an attempt team lead can you justify holding scoot right now  probably not  no I don't think so because  you know I think people were realistically hoping  yeah I don't think anybody thought was gonna be like a top 60 player averaging 35 fantasy points per game and if you're a 10 Team league there's a million guys on the wire averaging you know 25 fancy points for game that you can just stream in if you're team looks amazing like if you're doing amazing right now through a week and a half I'm cool with you holding you know Ahmed and just because if you don't really need the help and you think they're long-term value is going to be good that's fine I would still strongly consider dropping them you know scoot is just they're both going to have minutes issues Thompson because he's not going to start in line up and scoop because they're going to be in someone you blow outs I feel more confident about scoot out of those two just because of the role like I again you're totally right about the blowouts but I also think there's a lot of nights where he's gonna be a 35 minute guy especially if and when Portland kind of accepts its fate as just one of the worst teams in the league at that point they just say all right well we're now 25 we're just gonna keep playing you to get the experience you know at some point I do think they're gonna flip Malcolm Brogden as well I don't think he's gonna want to be a part of this for a whole lot longer and I think that opens up more for scoot Henderson so if I had to choose between those two I would rather hold Scoot and with a man it's like he I think for a player like him to be fantasy viable as a rookie like the minutes absolutely have to be there like you can't you can't rely on him you know being it even on your roster let alone starting if you play an 18 minutes a game and with Houston I don't know if that's gonna get salt like I'm pretty confident that you know scoop basically can't be any worse than he's been so far if there's no way to go but up both in his production and his role whereas with Houston like they're convincing themselves that they want to win and if a mental Thompson is not contributing to that where does that leave it right like at some point they're gonna want to get a look at  more you mentioned tarason hasn't played yet like he's gonna have a role in that rotation that could take away from a mental tops in so you know I do think at some point this season you know they're gonna they're gonna turn things over to more their youth but that might not be until you know way later in the year and I think we could be looking at a couple months here where Thomson is just kind of a bit player trying to figure out his role yeah I'm with you 100% you want to you know it sounds pretty basic but minutes are a huge it's just a huge determining factor in fantasy basketball for Value like if a guy seen 30 minutes a game consistently um there's a good chance he's worth rostering and yeah so I mean scoot scoot from a role perspective is the guy there  is Josh Hart Alex a good pickup for week two it is a three-game week for the New York Knicks so not not ideal but not a disaster they played Tuesday at Cleveland Wednesday rematch against Cleveland at MSG and they're at Milwaukee on Friday they don't get a four game week until week four of the season for what it's worth you know Josh Hart is somebody I find myself rostering if you feels like every year his minutes are down a little bit I think the addition of Dante David chenzo has cut into that a bit he's been kind of sitting right at 22 minutes per game whereas you look at the end of last season and he was you know routinely in the mid-30s he was averaging closer to 31/32 so we do have to take that into account kind of depends what you're looking for like if you're if you're looking for kind of like a shoot for the moon type of streamer for a week I would avoid Josh Hart but if you're looking for somebody who's probably gonna play better than he has so far I think the minute it's eventually pick up and as we know I mean for a guy who's guard eligible on a lot of sights about as good of a rebounder as it gets so you know someone to kind of a unique step profile right like if you're if you're targeting rebounds if you're behind in a head-to-head League this year or this week in that category then I would lean Josh Hart but for me it I can't just blindly say yes or no it's it's situational  situational I would lean know just because of the minutes heart needs like  I don't know 28 oh my heart needs almost 30 minutes a game to be a roster Roll Fantasy player and like 12 team leaks and if he's only seeing 22 minutes a game you know  and not controlling the rock really in any way it's just  I I wanna pick him up I feel like there's probably somebody else like a four game week that you can stream in that's that's just worth it  is it worth it to pick up Kelly oubre and drop Lou Dort asked the cousins 9855 we're going through this again with Kelly oubre I feel like he did this at the beginning of last year right to an even more extreme degree you look at first 30 games last season with Charlotte 21 points per game five rebounds two and a half threes you know eventually the luck kind of wore off there he has not shot the ball well the last two games he's over his last 10 from three was fantastic obviously against Milwaukee in the opener five of six Roby on the ark I'm totally fine taking the plunge yet again with Kelly oubre and just kind of riding this as long as you get I would I would take Uber here Phillies rotation is pretty thin in terms of like they have PJ Tucker their back are they starting and then like they're backups are like Daniel house and Danny Green Paul Regan isn't getting his money minutes as people thought Uber he loves to Chuck so you're gonna get that you're gonna get the shots out of him Dort is just not an offensive guy and it's his role is continued to decline as okay see has gotten better pieces around him you know in case on Wallace looks good for them too so it's like he could start stealing minutes I would I would yeah I would just rather have Uber  is use of nerdish worth a pickup one week in ask Cody Cantrell I would say yes I mean that the big concern with Dirk is just never really been the production I mean it's like in weekly leagues it feels like if it's a four game week you're getting like two good games and two horrific games and you just have to live with that so inconsistencies always going to be an issue but a lot of the reason that I did not draft him was not it wasn't because of the move to Phoenix it was because he's played 5256 37 and 8 games over the last four years but if you're picking up off the waiver wire and you're kind of taking this week to week I would absolutely grab them I don't think you're going to find a lot of big men with more upside and you know it's been a little bit shaky early on you know as far as what his role has been you know he only took five shots and that loss of the Lakers the other night rebounded nicely at a nice kind of well-rounded lined it gets Utah on Saturday you're gonna have to live with some Downs you have to live with some very shaky free throw shooting at times but again if you're in a pretty competitive league and he's out there I would absolutely grab him  I'm shocked he's available if this is any deeper than a team lead I'm actually I'm actually shocked but yeah I mean he's he's but first career he's averaging like you know over one Fantasy Point per minute  he's averaging for this per game right now and that's what you know Booker and be missing most of the time right he's gonna get more assists when those guys are in because of the shot makers he touches the ball he's a hand off screen guy I mean yeah he's extremely clear pick up for me I've got some questions about Jeremy Sohan throughout the show you know is he a drop what your thoughts on him so far you know it's an experimental situation like we have not seen a whole lot of this like a team willing to take the plunge and you know pull a guy who is viewed as I guess more of like a true power forward and just say all right you're a point guard now it is not directly led to a ton of assists you know he's got 12 total assists through three games you know the steals numbers have been fine he's over steel for game the rebounds have been okay took a 0 scoring only took two shots against the Clippers and that blowout loss yesterday I I kind of stayed away from Sohan and obviously we didn't get the news until close to opening night that he was going to start up point guard so I get the entry but I I feel like him playing point guard takes away a little bit some of the you know defensive potential that we thought he might have he's probably gonna be pretty bad as a free throw shooter you know hovered her out 70% last season the field goal percentage was a great either I think keeping him away from the basket doesn't necessarily help with that I am very interested to see how this plays out but from a fantasy perspective I'm kind of sitting on the sidelines  I don't have any so on this year um you know I don't you shouldn't Panic after a 0 point performance against the Clippers it's a really bad matchup for him Clipper is very good defense because in the first two games of the Season he you know 60 combined fantasy points now do I think the experiments going to work no as I said earlier in the show I won't be surprised if Trey Jones steps back into the lineup sooner than later but this is still a really young team committed to his young players so we would surprise me if so on wasn't seeing 25 to 30 minutes a game if he's not touching the ball is much yeah it's gonna be sketchy but like don't drop him right now all right let's talk a little PJ Washington we'll hit a few more of these then we'll be on our way out got a lot of questions about him and he was somebody I instantly regretted not targeting a little bit more aggressively after opening nights 25 and 5 it was only one of six from three that was the thing I mean all of his misses essentially worth 3-pointers and that was kind of again the case against Detroit the other night he's off to a really bad start shooting the ball two of 11 from the arc but playing a ton of minutes you know playing next to Mark Williams up front PJ Washington is always somebody that I like grabbing if I can late in a draft I feels like he's always been undervalued you know last couple years like earlier in his career was always like is he going to be a full-time starter is he not in wrote a League's the fact that he takes so many threes it hurts his field goal percentage his free throw percentage has never been that great but he also doesn't take that many so it's not a huge killer but if the general question is like you know should I pick up DJ Washington I would say yes like you said unless you're in an eight or a ten Team league if he comes a little dice here but in any standard size League like I absolutely want him on my  bench if not even in my final starting spot he's a really boring player but you know lamelo gets open shots for everybody why you know PJ can hit threes even though he hasn't hit three so far into the year yeah if you're wondering whether or not you should hold them absolutely hold them you know he's someone that can average you know 25 fantasy points relatively easily has some more blocks upside than he's shown and yeah Bridges it seems like he's going to come back but um you know that might be a situation where he takes minutes away from like JT Thor who's been playing um I don't know like maybe don't pick up Thor don't pick up JC Thor I don't know what Brandon Miller as I'm not I would hold washing to  all right I'll do a couple more here how would you rank the following Alex do Anthony Melton carry Rozier or I assume cold Anthony not nacho well Anthony  Rozier  I mean Rosie's playing 30 minutes of gaming and is a consistent 20 points score it's to me is that clear yeah I would go Rosier and then I'm not the biggest coal entity guy but I and I love Mountain I just I worry about the heart situation it totally depends what you think is happening with hard if he comes back and is playing at least half the season for the Sixers that obviously directly impacts the Anthony Melton if you think James Harden's getting traded or he's gonna be away from the team that I would put Belton at number two but I'm with you a Rosier is definitely number one of that group by far the most proven player and he's kind of been you know bad team proof right like he's one of those guys you're kind of like a souped up Jordan Clarkson where it's like even if the team's bad he's still gonna get his 21 points four rebounds five assists most nights all right we got a question about Isaiah Emmanuel quickly I just decided to drop IQ to stream that spot  did Kool-Aid trippin mess up here Alex  I don't think you messed up you know quickly I got a surprise to how many minutes he seen so far  so I it's tough because I think quickly is really good like I think quickly should be a starter in the MBA but the minutes in that back court are just really tough to come by or I should say they're sort of up for grabs right like so far this season Grimes 25 minutes again quickly 24 minutes a game heart 22 minutes again even chenzo 18 minutes a game  if Brunson gets hurt you're going to feel like an idiot but it relies entirely on Brunson getting hurt and you can't  purely roster guys on the hope that the guy in front of them gets hurt certain guys yes but if you  I think you're fine streaming the quickly spot someone might pick him up yeah and you might feel like should I really drop them but I think I think you'll be fine in the long run  yeah all three game week for New York like we mentioned with Josh Hart they got a couple of those coming up so I think he dropped him at a relatively good time all right well and on this one Alex and then we got a do some business as well  on Yoko Kong Lou if it feels like we're going down this road again is he a good pickup or should I wait ask Donovan I love Ayo I've been on this island since he came into the league I think he is awesome I think he you know we're here in Milwaukee we watch a lot of bucks games I always feel like he guards Giannis about as well as anybody you super versatile he's athletic he's kind of does everything and yet the Hawks insist on playing him exactly 20 minutes of game for like three straight years and that's been the case so far this season I mean he played a few more minutes because it was a blowout last night against Milwaukee I love the potential I love the per minute value I I want to hold him if I have a spot but I I think we're gonna have to wait for a cappella injury unfortunately for him to be truly Unleashed  yeah the part of the problem is if you wait  what are you waiting until if you're waiting until he has a man gets more minutes or has a massive game or capella gets traded well then everybody's gonna go for a Kong woo and then you're gonna have to compete over him depending on your waiver period works so you you just have to trust your own like opinion if you if you believe capella will get traded then you should probably just pick up a Kong now and hold him if you can because if he sees 30 minutes a game he's going to be excellent but if you don't really believe that and really it's like he's gas like I don't know I don't know you know because last time trying to be competitive there's still trying to win 45.50 games this year it's a it's a very tough decision I don't I don't unfortunately I wish I had a real answer for you but small sample size I think that's the that's the answer for a lot of these questions and you know we'll continue to do this every week you know we'll keep opening up the chat for everybody we love all the interaction here even if you disagree with some of our opinions that's totally fine we welcome that and as a year goes along and we build More Sample and we have more games under our belt we'll be able to answer a lot of these questions hopefully more definitively but we appreciate everybody hopping in the chat this was a lot of fun and we should be able to repeat this just about every Monday going forward a lot of fun breaking down these questions with you always love talking ball we will be doing it on Rota wires Flagship Show on Sirius XM NBA you can catch us on there each week night 7 p.m. Eastern will be on there tonight breaking down a
