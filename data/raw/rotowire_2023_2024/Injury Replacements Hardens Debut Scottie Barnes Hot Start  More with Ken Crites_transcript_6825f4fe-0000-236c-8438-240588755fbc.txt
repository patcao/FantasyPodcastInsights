hey everybody  Welcome to the award-winning Roto wire fantasy basketball podcast which is brought to you by Underdog Vivid Seats and rival fantasy it's Tuesday November 7th  go out and vote we'll talk about that in a minute I'm Dr A  he is fellow RotoWire staff writer Ken the K train crates  let's go  I'm honored to be back Steve thanks for having me glad to have you back it sounds like we're going to be doing this every what every couple weeks a few times a few times a month  we've got a we've got a schedule set up we've got a we've got a format maybe a what do you call it what they call it  when you were in college a syllabus we have a syllabus for this guy that might give us more intelligent than we deserve well we can also call it a format but So today we're gonna we're gonna cover some news we're going to hit the Panic meter we're gonna talk about some hot players we got since since the K training and I are approaching 100 years old we got to get off my lawn segment  back to election day there's no games tonight so there's really not any betting to talk about but we were gonna we're gonna get into that I put some player Futures in there we'll discuss teachers and I've got maybe a maybe maybe a  maybe a rick Moran story if we have time for it but I love the story please we gotta do it cater I've already had a visit from the cops to my house today and it's oh so 11 a.m. what do you think about that how many empty bottles of bourbon are in your front yard Steve Well ironically we sort of picked up the front yard yesterday and I live on a very private lot so people can't really see my lawn and I live in the Georgia Mountains so I mean I'm absolutely things get a little be making your own moonshine it sounds like okay I let things get a little loose down there at times  but yeah my son just learned how to drive and oh he was on a he was in he was in a fancy Country Club neighborhood at the golf course where I work and he was in a roundabout so he was on his way to being free and going where he needed to go but for some reason he turned off that and went down this like narrow driveway and he he realized he shouldn't have done that so he just threw it and reverses and started backing up and he back like 20 feet  into this dude's lawn and took out like Wall Street the end of Wolf of Wall Street like that he takes out a light took out the yard sign with this with the address on 81 over 3 sure almost went over the four foot retention wall  drove away in front of the guy licensed Away Steve my time to take away he just got it he's had it for like a week  so any also ran over all the cones in Reverse when he got his license and they I don't know why they gave him his license but anyway  so dude calls the the guard gate and says hey grab the number of this blue Honda that's getting ready to drive by and then like two hours later I'm at Johnny B's my local hangout and this guy who's my son drove through his yard his neighbor  sees me and he goes hey Steve he's like this is your story drive a blue Honda I was like yeah  well I guess he's got yards so anyway  me and the guy I worked it out a week ago all right a few days on Sunday sort and I went over there but the cops  did not get notified that we had worked it out so he was there knocking on my door at 9:30 this morning well I'm sure you told them hey I have a very important MBA podcast I need to get to so let's let's wrap this up I was like the story we need to wrap this up that so anyway let's get into this yeah anyway I didn't let my son know he is not going to prison so I would let him worry about it I let's go to the center situation in Orlando Steve what's going on in Orlando Wendell Carter Junior is out for three weeks  former Pacer Goga batad  um I always say I mispronounced names brutally but it can be the tazzy all right you know he's been getting the start everyone thought Mo Wagner was gonna get the movagar sorry I was gonna get the start but it's not it's been Goga  and the first game he was 10 and 10 with five blocks anytime anytime somebody gets five blocks you take notice um and then last night  he had 7.6 boards two steals in a block they gave the more minutes off the bench but you look at the point deferential go get a better game I don't know why they kept giving  Moe more minutes but most of fake tough guy he was so terrible when he was with the bullet was Celtics he was at he made Luke kornet look good and you know I feel like he gets a free pass because his brother's a star on the magic team but he's like a fake hustle guy you know fake flop dive into the crowd when it's not necessary I hate mobile the people even know that Mo and Franz are brothers I mean I they don't get very much hype it's not very often Brothers play on the same team oh doesn't deserve the hype but you're right I don't know how many people know that their brothers I don't know either but you know Carter's out for a while so I think the Todd's is a good pickup right now I do too because just because like you mentioned the block potential Mo Vagner has never been a black guy Goga Goga has been one of those great per 306 minute guys that we've had a free Go-Go joke running on other versions of this pod and I'm excited to see go get some minutes we'll see hopefully he  you know it's not like when will Carter's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar right like I'd like to think of Goga had a quality run they might let him keep starting but maybe I'm just too Pro Goga  I don't progress that's the that's it that's a term right there that's a media social media that really should take off your favorite player James Harden made us 17 points six assists I got killed by the Knicks right the Clippers got beat up Paul George is very excited to have James Harden on board as he went to for 11 with 10 points  why Leonard at 185 and 3 very pedestrian is this Thibodaux just being his defensive Guru or is this a mess for the Clippers well it's game one  yeah it's game one Hardin still wearing the fat suit  if you Paul George and Kawhi Leonard right and Harden's making those quotes about I'm not a system player I am the system  and I'm quite Leonard I'm like yeah this is the Kawhi Leonard system the play in that because no one wants you but us news says like that the West oh only raging ego Maniacs who says I am the system you know what I give James Harden that quote 89 years ago when he was you know a year into his Houston run but after that what kind of nutso raging ego Maniacs use that out well yeah if you're George and Leonard are you just shaking your head like what's going on it's like drunk Reese Witherspoon stumbling around the Streets of Atlanta asking if the cops know who she is as she goes to jail that's like a video I really need to look up on the internet that was a thing you did not seen that that's right five years old Russell Westbrook started which is kind of important because we didn't know if that was gonna happen and given the result of the game maybe maybe it doesn't happen in the next one but bones Hyland and Norm Powell both paid played 22 minutes  powerscourt 14 bones scored five I think the bone we can probably pour one out for bones exactly and Powell really I was shocked I mean it was that some garbage time I was watching the Celtics game I did not catch too much of this I was not really dialed into the Clippers game last night I'm gonna be on with you I didn't see one second of it and I was having some DirecTV issues oh all right well I mean I think zubats is safe because he's like their own you know he and plumblee nobody wants to play do the Dirty Work Center stuff but yeah I think all those bench guys  Powell and Highland in particular who looked good a week or so ago I how many shots can there possibly be for those guys and how much do you give Harden and Westbrook starting  you think that lasts I do I I don't I I don't give this team last team like I don't know how this is gonna work I already I don't know more Maniacs I don't know who's gonna start I don't know who's gonna  I mean what does Westie do if they put him on the bench does he throw a fit I mean I don't I don't know I mean the Lakers put Westbrook on the bench and he kind of handled that seemed to handle it okay so  you know but like I don't know why is it like well hey we got Westbrook to turn his game around we can do the same with hard like me how many I used it we'll see we'll see  I tried to remind myself hardened League the league in his last year right like he can't do it I shouldn't I should lot like my personal disdain for the guy  shouldn't taint my stat projection form but it does former Celtic  and Adam schefter  favorite person or favorite yeah exactly the time or another one out there oh four went out for him knee surgery  which I feel like he's needed knee surgery for like five years now well like repetitive nicer this is like I don't know is this is second third or fourth procedure you know they try to not use the word surgery you know Brad Stevens is like yeah we could see that copy even partly can Portland acts surprised I you know he uh you know I I just  it's it's inevitable and that's honestly why  I kind of like the Drew for a lot of reasons I like to Drew holiday  trade the Celtics kind of burned a bridge when Brockton when they tried to deal in the original porzingis deal and then Time Lord just can't stay healthy and we're seeing that sadly now he cannot stay healthy and um yeah and you know what the Bucks really don't look that great right now and they missed through holiday just defense it was like you're able Birds awesome day delivered hasn't had to play playoff defense and how long  they missed they missed yours defense man but anyway Tom Lord it all it really means is more minutes for DeAndre ayton right and gotta be I thought DeAndre was gonna roll into Portland with the chip on his shoulder ready to prove people wrong and dominate and go and he just doesn't really looks like cares he has he should be getting two blocks a night right like  the athleticism is there but the effort  is not I think that's why Phoenix is  didn't mind you know they slowly burned that bridge with him  yeah eating drives me nuts could they go shit could they go small ball so a little more important get sharp some more minutes or my  my  well the problem is is 52 year old Jeremy Grant clogging up the the paint taking all the shots and getting two rebounds a game  that is that is the problem and he's only there because he thought Lillard was coming back he was like okay I'll sign and then well I said they offered to overpay him to try to keep alert and then that didn't work and yeah yeah well so it was all related to Dame and then when Dave didn't come back I I find it hard to believe that Jeremy Grant's gonna be on that team for the entire season but right right now he's kind of clogging everything up to let these kids go out there and just run which is what most of all I'll say this it's not like scoot turn the world on fire the few games before he got hurt so no but she don't know us and yes you are what's his what's his favorite Brogden looks really good but he's old well Brian will be great till he also has a he's gonna be hurt any day now I something broke enough one of his feet  or hands so anyway more minutes for eight and if you've got eight and maybe this will get him going but I  I don't know about  yeah I got it what's her name is column has a small collapsed right time yeah long issue for the second time what's weird is that they're not really giving out any details on how long he's gone you know but you wisely and I agree the 100% you put in the notes there's a certain automatic pickup you've got to make here based on the situation well and people were asking me yesterday on Twitter before the game if I like Dyson or Hawkins or  Kyra Lewis and I I was going with Hawkins just because what have you done for me lately and he played well in the previous game so yeah this one right draft pedigree as well Jordan Hawkins UConn rookie 14th pick  went crazy last night 31.7 boards three assists seven triples yeah the palette and gunning last time CJ had a lung problem he was out from a month and a half so  exactly we don't know how long he's gonna be out this time but Jordan Hawkins is the pickup of the day on Tuesday there's no NBA games maybe he still sitting out there available in your league be a good time to go pick him up maybe you have a guy like say who is I dropping last night at a rapid Pace like every League I could get I was just dropping this guy was it Max druze probably was through because might have been through this it might even up with Cleveland was that like half a roster and everybody would nuts like he was like some hot you know second year sophomore blossoming like no this guy's old this guy's this guy's had multiple two-way contracts  hey you know honestly an improvement at small Ford for the Cavs because they had nothing at small Ford for the Cavs last year a Coro  some defense zero offense but mixtures is going to be option four on that rotation when everyone's healthy  and I still think screws is worth rostering in a lot of leads but if you if you need to if you need to drop somebody through yeah  my man Bruce Brown and Indiana better reality player than fantasy player yeah we're getting on the chat here would you take Hawkins or a Schroeder and Toronto I still go Schroeder I think he's locked in that is like for years nobody else to play point guard there exactly they have one point guard on that team that's not probably wouldn't drop shooter to get Hawkings but I would try to find somebody to drop the Hawkins yeah and a lot of times you can just throw a guy on the IR and not have to cut anybody that's so sexually rules speaking of injuries another point guard issue this time in Denver  yeah Jamal Murray out for a week hamstring at least a week that could linger I know I love and  man this Murray just can't stay healthy for an extended period it doesn't seem like when he does  he super fun and then you forget about the fact that he's often injured and but Reggie Jackson to me he didn't even do anything last night he looked he looked I wrote automatic pick up I disagree I think I think he's on the wrong side of his career bell curve inefficient score that you know yolk is going to get just pick up the assist even more so with Murray out and maybe here in Gordon frankly you know they play a little more through him a Reggie Jackson you know I'm all those like frustrating years he hadn't Troy probably he's my opinion here but I just can't get behind Reggie Jackson yeah I mean automatic pickup might be strong I'll give you that but he's gonna start and he's gonna play minutes for the nuggets for the minutes 14 Team league even a 12 team or if your bench is terrible for the next two weeks yeah you got a guy on your team even won the cut and there's nobody on waivers to pick up if Reggie sitting there I mean that's a guy sure rather have Jordan Hawkins though  I would rather have Jordan Hawkins then Reggie that is correct  I'm just trying to see what Reggie did last night I just want to see I know it's stats were bad but I thought he played a lot of minutes oh they played each other too it was Jackson against Hawkins 20 minutes  7 points four assists two of eight nothing write home about but he's gonna play point guard for the next 10 days or so so just keep that in mind exactly exactly but we'll see  is this back bimbo BMW the new set of I don't know you know they also have Santo Domingo finally coming back healthy he's not exactly a classic Banger inside like Tillman I think I think abdomen biombo they're going to alternate there it's not like Memphis is lighting the world on fire they finally did eke out of Victory  uh but I think we know the offensive limitations of biombo  this speaks to even more to oh Desmond Baines awesome because he's gonna have to carry that offense  but I I actually picked up all dominant a bunch of League's when Adam's got hurt and I think longer term you know all Thomas numbers when he started last season which was really more in the first half  I thought a lot more appealing than Tillman's we don't know anything about these Tillman injury details just that he had knee soreness has anything come out in the last half hour that you've seen Steve not that I've seen but we I mean I have awesome not seen Xavier Tillman doing anything to turn my head and get me fired up  and while Bismarck being a is similar in that regard where I don't get super excited when I see his name  if nothing else this kind of ruins Xavier Tillman right like well it's like they have a lot of invested in by Umbrella right like they didn't have a choice month was it Monday or Sunday when they went with biombo they didn't have a choice because children was just flat out and Obama is not working him back in slowly I don't know I need to we need to find out more about this Tillman injury but Tillman wasn't exactly getting it done when he was in I'm just saying if you had one or two double doubles I thought  I mean if you're holding Tillman in in fantasy the last thing you wanted to see was his backbone of course and I jumped on the the Santi aldama train last year and I didn't enjoy that ride I'm not  that's fair that's fair I am not all in on Sam TV this year I was I was a little early on him last year I will say that I thought the big death blow to Santee was Steve Adams returned and he ain't coming back this season for them so I mean Tillman  basically eight and eight but with a block of game and 1.7 steals a game so far okay but let's talk about but no threes not gonna shoot even outside the key his November numbers are three points and five boards and one block so but maybe is maybe his knee maybe his knee was hurting and I don't know even play he only played 14 minutes against jazz on Wednesday in the late 24th time we saw him so his last four games he's had eight six zero and six points I would say he was trending down his first two I suspect that's the knee we'll see we'll see I mean look no one's gonna say our future is bismack biyombo right they are not let's hook our wagon to that guy but I'm what I'm saying is if you have Tillman on your team and you want to drop him from one of these hot free agents we're talking about  I don't think it's gonna be the end of the world  that's fair I do not drop them for by 31 year old buy ombud though don't don't make that move  I would drop him for Jordan Hawkins sure  obviously I might I drive him for Denny and Dacia  oh yeah yeah yeah certainly um  all right would you like to talk about bam bam  triple double last night 22 points 20 rebounds 10 assists Road win over the Lakers he had four Steals and blocks or is I like to say Steve stocks oh enjoy I mean bam was so good 80 had growing spasms oh thanks Mister Street closed we growing spasms hi you know that sounds like a dirty joke not something I've never we've never actually reported groin spasms on RotoWire before Alex barua you know I'm watching games and texting with Alex last night he's like in my six years of reporting worldwide injuries I've never used the phrase groin spasm it's like I think that happens if fraternity parties not basketball courts but  that's good we'll see how long 80s out he's not exactly Cal Ripken but now we need to play on Wednesday catering I mean you doubt him yes  well he also would back into that game it was just like  like a piece of furniture like I don't know I don't he knows he has his horrible reputation he does not want Charles Barkley mocking him on National Television more but this is why  you know game Count you will avoid ads just he's great when he plays but then he's gonna have these injuries  dude how about the fact that these guys are actually trying to power through  injuries this year I feel like this league mandate  is sort of working  yeah I don't I don't even know how they enforce it and yet you're right it is working so far I feel like guys have a different mentality instead of seeing how many games they can sit out and still get paid they're actually like what maybe this year I'm gonna try to see how many games I can actually play in and take a cue from Mikhail bridges yeah or 40 year old Michael Jordan who played 80 two games and averaged well I think was over 34 minutes for the Wizards that last season  just coming out of the front office  yeah so those way to go bam keep an eye on 80s growing spasms between now and tomorrow night um you know what I think we got to jump ahead and I think it's time for to talk about

a little um  Underdog problem last night myself  I had a and wasn't a problem it was actually I don't know I don't get off my lawn segment I'm we're gonna jump up there just for just to talk about Underdog okay then we're gonna then we're gonna go back but so I had I had beef stew I needed 1.5 triples from him he comes out of the gate and Banks too right off the bat  done green we're good to go Kevon Looney I need one block he has a block early in the second quarter off my off my lawn good to go and dominga I need one block bam first quarter done Zach Collins is the fourth leg of this thing five this is a hell of a parlay by the way this one of the scare parlays five bucks to win 122 dollars I need two three-pointers from Zack Collins spur center right yeah first quarter bang like first shot of the game he hits the three-pointers really well I like all I got was get through the second half of these games and have one three-pointers from Zach Collins and I win big money and of course the Spurs were down like 30 to the Pacers he even got back in the game though for trash time and through one up and missed it I still had a chance but anyway Underdog like you said that's an obscure for leg parlay but it's fun and it's legal in states where you can't bet so it's it's it's it's a good time  I can would you like to talk about the Panic meter would you like to get us kicked off yes your new segment who is scaring us right now  and I will say first fans if you enjoy this video please click the like And subscribe buttons below that's what funds Steve and I get to do this work yeah who's making me scared right now you've got a strong list I'm terrified about Daniel Gafford now maybe like Tillman he's been nursing an injuries had an ankle injury he's been trying to play not playing well  he's only had one of his three games with solid results there's no other Center in Washington Gafford should be getting monster minutes it didn't check his Monday results did how did the Wizards got blown out as usual right there there on the page  six of seven 12.7 boards five blocks yeah that five blocks is why again so yeah I as you noted in the notes well done he's fine but boy those first first three games scared the heck out of me I think it's because of the ankle injury and as you said early in the show five blocks delicious  yeah  and then you've also got you guy  we can use my guy I was always guys this year so he was great first half of last season before the personal issue that popped up and made him miss most a second half and he's just and I expected nice things I had a low side I have been two keeper League loss and one of the keeper League the other ones camel is thing with no sorry so it's kind of excited from to come back  what do you think Steve is a he just is it a terrible fit with Chris Paul I mean his free throw shooting which was bad last year is even worse is it 57% he has zero steals in seven games I feel like I could get a steal in seven NBA games two of nine last night a four four point six yeah blocking the steel last night so I can see oh that's Roseville streaming yeah but my fat you know what could walk into a steel in seven NBA games I mean something like Wendy would accidentally bounce one off his knee and I would pick it up right something something without a steal how do you do that I don't know he's been terrible he's the guy that I would I'm dropping right now um I I think he'll get it turned around at some point Wiggins but I don't have time to wait there's the white the waivers popping with guys that are kind of going off right now yeah I mean we can just only 28 it's like he's too young is he 28 I probably should double check that but I felt like guys too young to be  acting like an old man yeah 28 what I don't know what's going on there but you're right it's terrible all right who were about Steve well I was all fired up about the Andrea Hunter and the Hawks for a minute and then over his last two games he has 12 points and seven boards total  I don't know what happened in those two games I don't know I'm not dropping DeAndre hunter in mostly just yet but this looks more like the DeAndre hunter from last year as president of the DeAndre Hunter we were seeing this year the knee injuries have taken their toll maybe and yet keep waiting for Jalen Johnson to remember and then remember the AJ Griffin trained last year like they have other options I know they're paying a hunter a lot  well I think they wanted to be Hunter and Jalen and I think City Bay is clogging clogging things up there yeah yeah another guy Bruce Brown I mentioned him earlier I was kind of fired up about Bruce Brown being  kind of a glue guy for the Pacers which he is yeah he's not putting up fantasy numbers out of three pointers so I would rather have any of the door is kind of hot right now I think he's a hot pick up Tim Hardaway Jr might be better than Bruce Brown manager Point on Brown they put up 150 points on the Spurs last night and he only got seven of those no steals no blocks five boards for us this but 150 points you get seven come on  and then a guy that you you put on my list for me which is okay because you're my podcasting Godfather at RotoWire a guy that I would never draft in a million years anyway is DeMar DeRozan  89th and per game value  like come on man he doesn't shoot threes he's 34 years old he's tanking now the field goal percentage is tanking which  can't do yeah I just I'm not feeling the martyrs so those are some of my dudes would you like to tell us about Vivid Seats

we've got like a hundred and ten games in the NBA on Wednesday night and 0 NBA games on Tuesday night like this early in the season like I'm all fired up about Underdog fired up about my fantasy teams I just want to I just want to gamble and watch basketball  and I can't do any of that tonight there's no football like what first of all what are we going to do tonight  um secondly my family why so the reason there is no basketball tonight because the NBA has decided that on voting Day November 7th every year whether there's a major election or not we are not going to have basketball games  holding and you're the keyword there Steve day voting day and on Tuesday when are most games played Steve usually at night time when the night when the polls are closed  so I I'm gonna go vote for my two city council seats that are open today I think we're we have a Vermont there's maybe a rule up about which trees you can tap for me oh maybe yeah so Maple yeah legislation yes so the NBA cares about us voting on these things so much that they've canceled the entire season for us but again  if the Celtics are playing tonight and the Hawks are playing on and when he was playing tonight how would that impact me voting I'm sorry about during the day I don't understand I just a day night I don't I'm cranky about it  if there was a presidential election happening tonight we get those super late don't they the president stuff goes late I get two dares to pull up until about game time yeah look I get it a little bit for a national election but for this stuff come on I'm all in favor of getting more people to vote I don't see how this gets more people to vote let's I don't see it at all it's gonna make it like the Olympics like in every four years thing  I like it amen all right the other this is to get off my lawn segment by the way it's just too old guys  just Larry David just ranting about stuff  let's talk about Statler and Waldorf for the older The Muppets old guys so the term stocks  Ken it's a it's  stocks stands for steel and block combined together into one easy word that fantasy  punishments and writers have half of them have adopted it half of us and not yeah you're into it you're down with you stops I'm sorry I'm not I see that word and I it makes the hair stand up on the back of him  why does a Bobby sir I don't know the same reason that having a kid running across my lawn bothers me I don't I don't I'm just old and cranky dude ah there's a lot of hey look I actually you don't on the Friday pod I have my own segment called The Old Man rant I was complaining about Kim Kardashian sponsorship with the NBA on Friday oh which you can see in the RotoWire fancy basketball YouTube page but so I'm cranky about a lot of things a lot of things but stocks isn't one of them here's what I like about it when you're doing a show like this right and you're you're repeating someone's stat line it's really boring to hear this many points on this kind of shooting this many rebounds this many assists by the 5th or sixth stat everyone's brain is just turned off so you just merge the stocks together at the end because you're trying to get through it quicker  okay  I really love the defense of stuff I just don't I just don't love the word I don't know why um I'll avoid it on future Tuesday sir dude let's talk no no no no no you have to keep using  you have irritate you just poke it with  you  Cam Thomas your guy my guy he's running my 30 Team league right now like he's on my team with wimby yes and so this is player one of our hot players section go with it well look at me we're talking about hot players I'm bringing up someone that everyone knows is hot but the only reason I'm doing it is because on your the last time you had me as a guest you said let's end with big reach bets and my big reach bet was cam Thomas Sixth Man of the Year he was something like plus 4500 odds  well cam Thomas is now the favorite to win six men of the year and fantasy is offering 44th per game value eighth category League's he is gunning which is why we like him 45 points last night in the lost to the Bucks and I will say cam Johnson and Nick Clarkston their out but they will eventually return  but Thomas's odds he now leads  oh I screwed this up but top odds for six man of the year is a plus 700 actually Shannon one of my other RotoWire coworkers he thinks he's going to become ineligible he's gonna get too many starts he thinks they're gonna they're gonna sit didn't witty who has not started well could have been he could have been in our concerning Panic meter section and so he may not qualify that's kind of the fun of voting betting on a Sixth Man of the Year Mary Ken Thomas on fire who's your who's the first player hot player you want to point out maybe I'm going to go with Marcus Sasser hello not a common name  33 minutes last night he had seven points  place for the Pistons he's a rookie  but the two games before that he had 22 and 19 points  he scoring Off the Bench for the Pistons the Pistons are terrible Marcus Sasser is going to get a ton of run you listen to shows like this not so we can tell you that Victor woman is good or the Kevin Durant is good you want it guys you want names that you may not be thinking of and Marcus Sasser kind of hot first round pick but all the way 25th on that timeline the Piston should be pushing right yeah like why is bogdanovich still on this squad you see old for this roster Alec Burks yeah he's talented but what is he doing on this roster  Killian Hayes  yeah that's true but he's still like only 12 years old because then you start when he was like eight or nine maybe maybe but I've got Luke door on my list I think he's a hot pick up right now and until last night Dillon Brooks was absolutely on fire which I don't understand how that's possible but I don't know shots for Dillon Brooks like really I'm Dillon Brooks you're going to develop Dillon Brooks over Jabari Smith really really Houston  did you want to mention your other guy or we moving on  no I have to stay in Detroit  as our Thompson their first first round pick hello stocks he had a four steel four block night on Sunday in their loss to Phoenix he had four steals last night in 16 points Alec Burks is hurt which is giving Thompson's already starting but with Berks out he's getting even more minutes he's at 52 our he ranks 50 second per game value eighth category leagues and really low turnover is probably even better in nine nine category leagues but don't sleep on his or Thompson not sure he's available but check your waiver wire  nice  Lebron vs Jordan magic vs bird Barkley vs Mikhail basketball synonymous with Legendary player rivalries catering versus doctor a

little most improved player I've got Scotty Barnes  plus 5500 which is second and I'm completely blanking on whose first I got to go back to my DraftKings board and cam Thomas's third plus eight 800 who do you like for most improved players sir  um you know what I you I didn't really spend much time looking at this  because I thought I don't even know why but shade on Sharp has to be in the running now I had a I had a  at the beginning of season I had a player in mind to win this award yeah that escapes me right now I kind of like what Barnes is doing dude he was blocking so many shots and they were deferring to one offense which was fantastic early in the season he's flirting with triple doubles he looks like a like a different player  right now than he did last year so I just reporting sophomore year but seems to set up this seasoned nicely for most improved and I think the key to winning most improved is making the All-Star team and I think Scotty Barnes has a much better shot of making the All-Star team in the shade on Sharp does because yeah I was for Portland and they're not Tyrese Maxey has the best odds which is a we expect hard to be traded and of course he has been traded he's a plus 200 which is understandable I think Maxie appropriately is the favorite all right let's cut to our closing segments Steve which I am looking forward to this every time you have me on the show  I want to hear Steve's brush with greatness when you bump when you used to bump into veteran NBA players back in Indiana and you know a favorite beef Brothers of mine is somebody you've met in person I was hoping you're going to show the shoes I've got the shoes I've got I've got the shoes  I'll try to I'll try to keep this short and sweet so when I was a kid as most of you know I used to hang out after Pace their games and meet players I meet them before the game meet him at the games I try to get them to give me stuff A lot of times they gave me a pair of shoes like this one  oh the horns Rick Mahorn Converse and these are piston days not his bullets days as I write this I believe was a Pistons shoe but the first time I met him was it as a bullet  so so it was after a bullet's game back then they called them the Washington Bullets  I really have to say that on the road to wire basketball podcast that's on sale on Elvin Hayes would insist you say bullets okay so Rick Moran was a big bruise brother with the bullets beef Brothers the beef Brothers right there was a bruise beef it was beef Brothers with Jeff ruling and they had a fantastic poster of the two of them in butcher jackets and as I recall as I recall Rick Mahorn had gotten into a altercation with her Williams during the game this particular night and her and for some reason Rick Mahorn was in a hurry to get back to the Hyatt the hotel in Indianapolis this is probably 19  84 83 and  he's outside the Pacers locker room with me because I'm just hanging out  and he's asking Pacers if he can have a ride back to his hotel and I like no man you gotta fight with her we're not gonna ride and after he asked two or three guys I was like  hey Ricky turns out looks at me I'm like I got a car he's like let's go you're right you're how old I'm 16 I'm like my son that just back through this man's lawn  I just have a sweet ride that when you seven Camaro yeah  that was destined to do this pod together we both owned a 67 Camaro it was basically breaking in half and was the worst snow car you could ever get a kid to drive in Indiana right yeah absolutely so Rick and I get in the car he goes oh man I got the same car at home and I'm like what is going on I'm sitting in a car at midnight with Rick Mahorn  post fight post fight and I'm driving him to the Hyatt let's see I hope I can get there it's two blocks that way so I we start driving and I'm like trying to think of things to say to Rick Warren his knees are like up in his chin like barely fits in the car he's huge man and I go hey so I knew Buck Williams was leading the league in rebounding rebounds at that time and I so I told Rick I said I asked him I said hey Rick  what do you think about Buck Williams he's kind of a stud rebounder and he and he looks at me and he goes man  fuck Williams is a bleeping bleep  I'm like okay 16 I think he made a cat reference to there may have been a cat reference I just keep driving straight pull into the height about five minutes later two minutes later and he gets out of the car he's like he's like hey man he's like thanks for the ride hold on a second let me any deposed the old  the old horns out of the bag and gives me get the kids don't know those Converse shoes that was the top shoe back then here oh everything I have I've had 40 pairs they're almost all Converse in a DS it was before Jordan Nike I had one pair of Nikes they were low-cut the red the first ones from what was that guy's name  I forgot Mike Mike banham I don't have a bird in Magic were Converse at those days that was everybody Converse yeah yeah  so when when horn came back the next time with the Pistons  I was outside a lot when he saw me and he was a man you want to give me ride again I'm like yep so I gave him another ride oh yeah he used to leave tickets so he recognized you the second time yeah yeah he used to these tickets for me and we'll call and we came buddies and I haven't talked to him since I was in high school so he  he I am unrecognizable to him at this point if I walked up to him on the street he would be like what but anyway so 16 year old doctor Aid is not look
