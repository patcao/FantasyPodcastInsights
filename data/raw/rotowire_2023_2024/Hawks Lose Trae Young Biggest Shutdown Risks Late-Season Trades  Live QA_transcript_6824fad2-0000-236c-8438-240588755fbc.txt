what's up guys Nick Whalen here with Alex barua you're listening to the road to wire fantasy basketball pod it is Monday February 26th we'll recap all the big news from the weekend talk about the Trae young injury what that means for Fantasy some of the players were concerned about getting shut down late in the year and we'll tell you about the big trades and some of our important leagues down the stretch more RotoWire coming your way next welcome to the show Nick Whalen he's Alex barutha talking MBA for the next hour or so we will take live viewer and listener questions so put those in the chat as always we'll hit those over the second half of the Pod Alex we we're now entering our first full week out of the All-Star break kind of a weird one you know with flavors zooming on Thursday some leaks you can set a separate lineup for the weekend other League's carry over to essentially the lineup that you had in their excuse me for the half week going into the break any anything major for you coming out of the weekend and he trades and he free agent pickups any notable developments in any League's I would say nothing major just you know the biggest news I think in terms of the fantasy sphere being that Trey young is going to miss what I think at least a month they said but I won't be evaluated in a month which is yeah  he could be done for the year to be honest that would not surprise me at all and the reality is a lot of people's fantasy seasons are going to end some people's before April so you know if you have very young and your team check when your league ends and you know my son's drop them are the ones that that tend to end a little bit sooner obviously it depends you know League to League when your season ends like for example our you know like the NFP Casey League the RotoWire State League those go through game 82 so in that situation you know if you have an IR spot maybe you throw them in there and you're hoping that you get those two weeks from him at the end of the year to me it depends partially on leaked size as well like if you're if you're in a 10 Team league like there's players out there that are going to to be producing for you if you're in a 16 Team league dropping him to pick up I don't know like Kyle Lowry or been math or something and you're like yeah that's a little bit more on appealing but yeah I think in general we're gonna see a wave of Trey young drops and probably rightfully so again he's gonna be reevaluated in four weeks so we're talking end of March for the re-evaluation at that point  I would say it's more often than not that we get an updated timetable and it becomes week to week or more optimistically day-to-day after that but I think the important thing to keep in mind is they're not saying he will be back and forth weeks they're saying we'll see where he's at in four weeks  right yeah Atlanta they're in the they're in the final planes spot right now  sitting at 25 and 32 in the East you know I it's conceivable they just stay there because they're above Brooklyn who has 21 wins and obviously they're going nowhere fast yeah so they might they might end up just being locked into play and even if they try to essentially tank the season away without Trey young it's like the can they even really I don't even know if it's something they can feasibly do no not not really I I don't they're kind of stuck right I think the big winner here is the Chicago Bulls who now feel great about accomplishing their goal of being the 9th best team in the Eastern Conference and losing in the plain so congrats to the polls this should should all but lock that up but yeah Atlanta versus Brooklyn the rest of the season is going to be a really sad race to see who who wants it more I guess or maybe who doesn't want it the least for that 10 seed to me Brooklyn I think Brooklyn's trying to win you know they're they're first round pick is going to Houston no matter what that's completely unprotected so there's no real draft implications there's no reason that Brooklyn would want to you know try to find their way into the into the bottom 10 or something because they have a protected pick like that's gone so I don't think I don't think we can really expect the next to take a step back the question is are they actually good enough in the post Joc Von era to catch the Atlanta Hawks and who knows I did the Nets have been maybe the most confusing team for me night tonight we did see the Hawks you know when and pretty  impressive fashion without Trey young last night at home against Orlando 1092 Murray played well almost a triple double for him we saw Jalen Johnson put up a 21 ten and seven I think one of the big Winners fantasy wise will of course be Bogdan bogdanovich as well yeah bug damage a nice game you know move into the starting lineup I won't be surprised if the averages you know like 17 points per game but the guy got the guys in the lineup and then in terms of guys who's like weren't playing that I've been in circuit into the lineup you know 17 minutes of Garrison Mathews 11 minutes of Kobe buffkin who it's like yeah Kobe buffkin out there you drafted the guy my God but Matthews is just going to be out there you know he's not gonna position to position match for Trey young but the fact is Maurice slides to point guard dog which can handle the ball a little bit they don't need another playmaker out there necessarily  yeah I think other than Chicago the other winners you know are whoever Falls for this out of Philly Indy Miami and Orlando because two of those teams and all likelihood are going to be in the play in and you know then you're looking at you know potential matchup with with the team like Chicago or you know I think he probably rather play Brooklyn then at Atlanta because I would guess if Atlanta finds a way to make the play in show Young's probably back you know by the time we're talking late April but yeah I think it the bottom of that of that play in picture in the Easter Conference is Now setting up pretty well if you end up as a seven or the eight seats so the plans coming together for the Miami Heat but yeah that's the the big news coming out of the weekend I mean we can we can just go back to the same update we have on the Mellow ball which is that he still not back he's still day-to-day you know he did Practice coming out of the break that seems like a step in the right direction at this point I'm almost hoping he doesn't come back you know I'm still holding him in one League where it just doesn't make sense to drop him I have an IR spot it's not gonna end up mattering regardless but I want to see more trade man and this this Charlotte team is actually been I would say fun to watch but they've been a better product over the one four out of five they won like the ugliest game of the year I really hope you did not watch this like I did last night Alex this was a 93 to 80 win over the Portland Trail Blazers who scored 34 points at halftime 34 points Portland was three of 32 for three  you might be on some sort of like list for watching this game the league you know NBA should like give you a free year of League Pass just for even tuning into this game for for any stretch but yeah I mean the Hornets I don't know how they're making things happen you know they they and you know Grant Williams to even play well somehow they get away with that Williams taking full you know four threes yeah they they're going into a tougher part of their schedule coming up here so we'll see if this could continue they play the Bucks back-to-back games I got to play at Philly but they have a matchup Works Orlando coming up and they have a tough finish to their schedule as well so yeah not really a whole lot of reasons for overall optimism with the Hornets but you know like what we're seeing out of Brandon Miller I think that's been you know one of the if you're kind of scratching and clawing for for high points this season you know the fact that he started to come on he had 17 points on 18 shots I'll be it yesterday against Portland I do want to quote for a second Alex I had like the all-time stream yesterday I had to drop I think I dropped Dennis Schroder in a league and I just needed one fill-in and my options were very limited it was for like the later games yesterday I'm like screw it I'll grab Nick Richards 2110 3 blocks two steals yeah Richards man I was a Richard's first eight and Showdown yeah he's kind of a you know a lot of people if you pick Nick Richards up on the wrong week he'll get you like seven points nine rebounds average and then if you pick them up you know during the stretch that you're kind of talking about so you could also give you 15 and 12 yeah he continues to be just like a solid option for them as Mark Williams seemingly will never come back as was jokingly predicted on the show by me when he was downgraded from doubtful to out yeah that was that was like mid-December you said that was pretty good right now I made a couple big trades this week and the road to wire stake League where I just need to move up like three spots to get into the top half of the League this is the league where you just want to be in the top at 16 teams you want to be in the top eight the bottom half of the league has to pay for a very expensive steak dinner plus drinks for the the top half of the league so I'm a little bit in desperation mode here  I finally offloaded Jaron Jackson we've been talking about it for over a month at this point I'm still concerned about a shutdown traded him to our guy Kyrie and who was on the pod on Friday traded him straight up for Alpine um I love that for you yeah I I assume kirian needed blocks I don't back blocks in threes maybe I don't know the exact thing like I yeah well you asked me what I would  go ahead he's doing better in this league I think he's in third so he he's like look I just want upside here like Jared Jackson's the better player when they're both at their Peak and he said he's trying to make a run at I don't think he can get to number one but he could get to number two conceivably and I wanted the safety of shangoo and because I had it I know you could say the Rockets are like what are they 12th right now in the west and you know they're not that far ahead of Memphis but I don't think they're shutting it down you know that's another team that doesn't really have draft pick obligations that you're all that worried about like they're they're setting their first rounder to Oklahoma City and that's only top four protected so they're not you know they're giving that up they're not gonna find their way into the bottom four and I just feel better like I think Jared Jackson could be shut down literally any time between now and the end of the season and I'm also specifically chasing rebounds and and field goal percentage and Jerry Jackson is that helping me in either of those categories right now so I wanted I want to check it I think it made sense for for what I need the other trade I sent Malik monk to our guy Steve bolando one of our sales guys traded Malik monk for Brooke Lopez  uh I think that's a pretty fair trade yeah monk had that kind of bad stretch during that during that time that Kevin heard her and Harrison Barnes also happen to get hot that was really bizarre but now he's back to playing well um you know Lopez just kind of he just continues to be Brooke Lopez like you'll have his three rebounds 7 point performance then he'll get five blocks here or there you know I I think I mean on the you know the per game rankings would tell you you won this by a lot but of course we're talking about where this is I guess good context for people listening it's like we're deep into a roto League where this is the point in the season where you can be like I'm really weak in this area I'm really weak in this area if I bump up here I can move up a few spots like if you're first in threes by a lot you just trade two three points you go away and focus on other categories even if you lose the fantasy value evaluation yeah and now I'm putting assist in this league so that was part of the reason that I was okay you know sending out Malik monk rebounds wise it's basically a wash you know like to get like to think that is being seven foot one would help me there not really the case but you know it's a boosted field goal percentage she is actually hitting more threes than the league bunk so that you know that helps as well that's another category and then the other you know rebounds of blocks or when I was really after most so you know getting the two and a half to three blocks a game out of Brooke Lopez down the stretch should be huge and again you know you could always say there's you know injury concerns with Lopez and extremely healthy over the last year and a half since the back surgery but it was it was a move that I felt like I had to make to try to chase down you know one of those top eight spots in terms of waivers this weekend I didn't really do much at all there's most my leeks are deeply you know I mentioned the Nick Richards pickup that's not going to be long-term necessarily nobody did anything to notable you know kyrian went out and added Royce O'Neill he had a big game against the Lakers that's gonna be a little bit Hit or Miss but I get it you know with seemingly somebody out every single night on the wing for the Suns you know Cody Martin was picked up to Monte Kara was picked up by DJ he also added Jonathan Isaac who looks like he's escaped a major injury we'll see about that but I thought it was interesting James so James Anderson is doing well and in the stake lie he lost Trey young and I think he's also has a Kong woo so he's kind of hurt right now he went and picked up Kyle Lowry which tells you where the reliable guard depth is in some of these deeper leaks  yeah I look I don't I don't hate the loud rep pickup I don't it's just good to pick them up and see what happens that's all I can say like if you lost Trey young and you got get somebody um and you know Melton is back for Philly so that you know that could certainly hurt Lowry once melted his back to full speed and um but yeah I Lowry's gonna hit some three screws and get some steals for you but like you said you're gonna 16 Team league available guards are you may as well just stream at that point just stream whoever's got four games  yeah a couple of sympathizers here in the chat George says I can't believe I'm losing the best fantasy player on my team Trey young our sympathies George go out to you and anybody who's rostering Trae young I mean we've said this before Alex but really this is been a pretty good season injury wise right as like if you took lobello that was kind of the big one that probably sunk your team if you took him inside the top 15 which most people did if not higher but other than that it's like so many of the guys that I was completely staying away from Kawhi Leonard Paul George LeBron Anthony Davis is like for the most part A lot of those injury problem players have had close to best Casey season so far yeah I'm trying to do a quick trying to a quick search here on like games play it you obviously we have the embed situation yeah yeah Jimmy Butler has missed a decent amount of time but you're right I mean I'm looking I'm just scrolling through like wind shares per 48 looking at games played Mobley Mr Stretch you know Kyrie is in and out always but you're right I mean a lot of these guys on this list to play at least 45 games up to this point which is exactly the kind of thing that you want coming out of the All-Star break is there in place to play 65 which is as we say like that's just what you need like if you get 65 games I'm almost anybody in the NBA's these days you can't even be mad about it you're just like yeah it's pretty like average outcome  yeah I mean I'm looking at just like the top of the 80 people board going back to the beginning of the year and you know obviously you have trade young but yeah we're like 50 plus games into the season it's a little different when something like this happens late and obviously you know kills me right before the fantasy play out so I'm not you know saying it's not a big deal but you know at least you banked a good two thirds of the season from him same with him being brutal you're probably doing really well in your league if you have to wellbeing and you know now you're just a limbo there but other than that I mean just about everybody who was drafted in like the top 25 to 30 picks as been pretty healthy you know of course would be the other one you know it's like there's some guys have underperformed like we call Bridges that's been a disappointment siakam has been a slight disappointment but you have the guys like Kyrie you know even Karl Anthony towns it feels like every other year is missed a ton of time he's been healthy Market in spend healthy you know the Celtics guys have all been healthy Jalen Brunson DeRozan even Jared Jackson who's been a big injury risk it's been disappointing for other reasons but he's been healthy Zion Williamson of all people as State Health yeah  yep he has um you know Baine Smith some time  and overall disappointment and also spent some time Simon Says hasn't been healthy that's Simon Simon's killed me in one leg in our state League I had Simon's that was really bad for me because he was projected to be I think my best player and that was that was bad but you're right you're right I mean I don't know I don't want to go out on a limb and be like it's the 65 game rule that's why everybody's playing now I think it's just one of those years it's just you know sometimes you get lucky so I mentioned trading Jaron Jackson straight up for shengwen I also sent you an offer in that League straight up for Jared Allen and I said to kind of late so I don't even know if you saw it necessarily before before it expired but did you consider that one what was your thought on that as a potential deal so I saw it and then I wasn't like I was just like I'm going to bed which is where if anybody said to me like if something fantasy really good after 10 p.m. I'm like you know I'm gonna wake up tomorrow I was in the lab last night yeah 100% understandable but I I went through the same mindset that problem like you and I have talked so much about Jaron Jackson that I'm not gonna be that guy who trades for him no disrespect to you but I understand why you sent it to me because you know if I need help in blocks or threes or something like that and yeah I would it's something I have to consider but Alan is still been playing too well like ever since multiple went out Alan's taking a step up and it hasn't it hasn't really decreased since multiple came back so it I just ultimately wasn't going to do it  yeah James says he just traded Jaren Jackson for Jimmy Butler sure I'm fine with that I mean obviously Butler's missed so much time that there feels like some risk there but there's no shut down risk with Jimmy Butler I mean Miami's gonna be scratching and clawing to stay out of the play in so I like that deal and if you look at total value there's like 45 spots between those guys but I think we know who Jimmy Butler is when he's in there so I think I mean getting someone to Jimmy Butler's caliber she goes caliber for somebody who is as much of a shutdown risk as we believe Jaron Jackson to be I think that's a totally fine deal good question here from George she says hey Nick and Alex what's up man just lost tray and a Kong woo in a nightcat 12 team Head to Head playoffs start next week and he'll be either first or second  for his bottom three bench spots he says he's holding doomo and Scoot Henderson last spot should I stream or hold one of the following players Olynyk hunter or keyonte George  yeah so Hunter is that DeAndre Hunter I would assume so it did could be RJ Hunter but probably Deandre yeah I mean yeah DeAndre Hunter is a little more interesting now that that Trey young is out and he's had like I don't know I mean he's double digit scoring in seven straight games which for DeAndre Hunter that's pretty significant I don't think you can drop keonte he just has too much upside as like an assist guy is scoring has been pretty good lately Olynyk you know olin's great per minute but his role is kind of fluctuated lately he's if you can get 20 minutes eventually he's gonna put something together for you but I will get hate the idea of dropping either probably dropping all the Nick  to stream other guys in but wait what do you think Nick  what you know what I'm saying do you have to roster scoot did does this oh you know scoot versus you have to George me like I think I'd rather ft George at this point yeah I know Portland said yeah it's gonna start the rest of the year and then he made one start before the break it hasn't played since so it's not like that that's thought to be too long term of an injury but he's missed two in a row with an inductor I don't think scoot is a shutdown risk we'll talk more about that later in the Pod but yeah I'm not I'm not really thrilled about Olynyk it's been pretty up and down so far and what's ultimately a fairly small sample size in Toronto you know at most he's gonna play like 21 22 minutes you know and you said you're in a 12 team league so I you know that's a little underwhelming I think I would hold to sumu George and Hunter  that's where I would lean  but I don't mind Street either I mean if you're going into the playoffs like it's pretty nice to have a streaming spot open yeah he George also has a Chianti or scoot  to me that's pretty close I mean scoot's gonna kill you in the turnover category and the field goal percentage category like keonte is not a field goal for signage God either right he's gonna hurt you there but he at least keeps the turnovers under control it really just depends I mean it I you know I hate to like put the onus on I'm people be like whether you just believe Scots gonna be better or not  yeah because it's just It ultimately comes down to that whether you believe it I don't know if I necessarily believe it  he's made nine starts since the new year  shooting 35% from the field 5.6 to 3.6 turnovers 14 points like he can't be better  I I just don't know and they're really really comparable in a lot of ways especially if you just look at the last month with scoot started to play a little bit better but I think it's a debate for sure and you know part of it is maybe what you need like you have to George is going to give you I think more consistent steals like you said he's gonna be better field goal percentage wise and we're talking like 42% versus 37% so kind of depends how much that matters to you I do think scoot has more assists upside right that's part of it you have to George is gonna give you more threes as well scoot still not a very good 3-point shooter whatsoever he says he is hunting he is hunting field goal percentage he has a guard heavy team so okay if you're putting field goal percentage that then that becomes even closer and yes good I think is excusable or maybe that's not the right word a Bible option will say yeah over key update George but wouldn't really feel bad about streaming that spot either I mean we're ultimately talking about two rookie guards who tend to be really shaky game to game  best ad for the rest of the week asked Jason fontecchio Hendrix Dort giddy Josh green and Ben Catherine or Norm Powell okay we got a lot of options here oh we do I I have to apologize I don't know the game count for a lot of these guys I have the schedule up we have a great page over at RotoWire where you can see the breakdown you could customize you know when your league starts and stops in terms of counting games this week is it's a three-game week for most teams I think there's only like 12 teams that have a four game week Utah is a team that has a three game week so  if you view these are all relatively equally then you know maybe you could cross out taeler Hendrix OKC also has a three game week that applies to Dort and giddy Dallas has a four game week Indiana has a four game week and that maybe it the Clippers play three games Detroit also plays for so the four game guys are Funko in matheran  so  here well I'll bring this up for math ring it's for mentioning anyways starting two straight games with their niece Smith out yeah Smith is not playing today against Toronto and and Catherine has had two very good games like very good games averaging 15 points 9 rebounds five assists huge for Math and five assists in two steals  so I might I might lead on bathroom by the fall of he's got four games and we don't know 100% when is Smith is coming back that might be my that might be my answer he also has an even shot at that well in those games he's five of 14 on both games you know ten of 28 overall so I think there's room for improvement there you look at fontecchio  he's been pretty good too I mean you still worry night tonight about the Pistons either getting completely blown off the floor to the point that James Wiseman is playing in the fourth quarter or you know the rotations just changing on the whim of Monty Williams they play on the road at the Knicks and the Bulls the next two nights they're off Wednesday Thursday then they have Cleveland and Orlando so that's not really in that four games but these are not great matchups like none of these are good fantasy matchups at all you know like the best defense in the league and Cleveland he got low scoring slow pace teams in Orlando and Chicago same goes for the Nicks you know fonte I think if you're just looking for points at 3 that's going to be fine should be sustainable but I think you're right I think that's right might be the movie here with a four game week for for Indy  Ian says he needs to drop one for a streaming spot in a nine cat 16 Team league should he dropped Bruce brown or on Yucca a Kung Fu as we mentioned to cun was injured right now he's going to be reevaluated in two weeks  so you know obviously I like him a lot more than Bruce Brown but this could also be something that ends up spanning a month so if you're talking streaming in the immediate future I think you probably have to drop a Congo  yeah carrying and I got a question on Friday about Bruce Brown Bruce probably just not doing anything he's just really isn't like he's 100% droppable and almost every single League um maybe not 16 teams so but yeah it is made more difficult by a Kong who's injury you can actually just drop both and stream both spots and you might do better than worried it just hang on to both of them  but yeah 16 team leaks that's tough  I got Matt Carmody says to Sumo and DeAndre Hunter on waivers would you drop on tops in or Alexis favorite player Barbara Bagley to pick up either of those Head to Head points lie  yeah I you know I was actually on the Friday pots sort of encouraging people to consider picking up on men even though because people had dropped him obviously Fred Van Vleet came back but I think I'm in played 28 minutes and 33 minutes and back-to-back games now I only played 21 minutes against OKC last night so that's a bit concerning though he still had two Steals and three blocks  I mean while for Bagley is not seeing as many minutes you know consistent minutes as you would hope or want it's not even really due to follow trouble or some blowouts they're playing like they're playing some Omar rui they're doing Rashawn Holmes once like a while what I drop either of them for for ioda Sumo or Hunter I think I would drop Bagley for the soon moo  to me that seems pretty safe  yeah I mean the Wizards have just gotten completely hammered these last two games so it's almost hard to take those seriously although that might be the case going forward I think they're 11 Point dogs tonight against the Knicks  or no they're not playing the next I don't know who they're playing but they're big they didn't play tonight I don't even I'm talking about I'm thinking about the Pistons Marvin Bagley Pistons a racer on my mind no I think you're right with just Sumo man I mean it I don't see the minutes really cool and off I mean it's it's almost like the ghost of Tibbs is still coaching this Bulls team I mean he's played 39 39 33 401 309 over the last four games I started now 10 of the last 11 he's averaging 16 four and a half three one steal shooting over 50% from three on a pretty high volume of a temps almost six per game in that span so I would I would definitely pick up to Sumo and yeah I've been dropping a man versus badly to me that it's a points league so yeah you know they maybe the defensive numbers from a man not quite valuable  yeah I I should I should I should revise my answer because I neglected to was a points League I would it's close between Ahmed and Bagley but in bagley's way better on a points League relative like to a category League like even though his minutes have fluctuated over the past five games he's averaging 32 fantasy points in 26 minutes so  you know you don't have to drop him to add to soon move but I think it's safer to have to soon move compared to Bagley is how I'll phrase that yeah  James asks Kim Whitmore bologna Bali or gradey dick for what some have called Silly Season at the end of the year  well yeah I was looking at this up the other day Alex for the roadwire NBA Show on Sirius XM NBA  can't wait more as a higher usage rate the Paul George this season  so even even on nights when he's playing 17 minutes like he did to get Society last night he's gonna be getting shots up that's not gonna be a problem for cam Whitmore I don't know if we see Tara Easton again no time table for return that was the note over the weekend I wouldn't really worry about that anymore but you know I think I'm Ben Thompson has been the priority over cam Whitmore which again is fine because you know what work is still give you 25 points and 21 minutes like he did against Toronto a couple weeks ago I I think he would be my guy of these three I have not I've just not been in there on Kula Bali all year like I long-term I'm you know willing to see it through he's also out right now dealing with a right pelvis injury don't see a whole lot of those and you know even the games that he started this season and we'll take the the game against Cleveland out when he got hurt  seven starts he's averaging 10 points for rebounds 1.6 assists one steel 38% for the field 24% from three I just I don't really see it with him  yeah Kula Bali  I mean he's gotten like he's had a couple good games like I just  he's been very different roles right he started some games he's come off the bench Jordan pools been a dog at the lineup it's just cool about he never really steps up I think the way people want him to  he hasn't really showing an ability to like up his playmaking he's not usage guy he steals and blocks are good but they're not Elite so I'm not really cool to Bali guy to be honest I think I'm kind of out on that gradey dick  it's just going to be a threes guy I mean I know he can do a little bit more than that but within the context of this roster  I don't think so so yeah I'm on Whitmore even though the the Rockets are the team between these three there are at least likely to give up um Whitmore I think is just going to keep playing 20 minutes a game and keep scoring like 15 points  all right nem hard or McConnell as a better pickup in what I hope is a deeper leak here so we're just between two Pacers nevart has been a regular starter yeah obviously Aaron E Smith being out has helped him a little bit in the short term started to play closer to 32 33 minutes a game and McConnell just you know kind of gotta live at life just backing up Tyreese Halliburton  I it's been so much you need assistance to me but I think I would lean nem hard  I would lead him hard because the assistant close and that part is getting way more minutes consistently yeah but I I advised I I said If You're Gonna 16 Team league I mean Hemsworth's probably not available but McConnell probably is like I think I think McConnell should 100% be roster can all 16 team leaks it's too many assists it's five assists per game I don't care about how low the magnets are it's just it's been consistent  yeah I would vote em hard here but no you're right you're right I mean McConnell even when he goes out and plays 15 minutes he still giving you five or six assists Network by the ways been up steals lately he's got eight steals over his last four games so that's something you would normally think more about with McConnell but he's been pretty decent there all right good question here and this will this will lead us into one of our bigger picture topics are the Jazz potential shutdown team and should we trade away Laurie marketing we want to touch on you know some of the biggest shutdown candidates League wide right now and  yeah the Jazz are interesting man this is two years in a row with this team where it just kind of feels like the season is waffled back and forth between are we pushing for a playoff spot are we not pushing for a playoff spot as we said a number of times they always top 10 protected pick to OKC so it depends how much they care about that really it's what comes down to for me  and there are there in in 11th in the race for the worst record yeah um they have 27 wins compared to Atlanta is 25 Houston 25 who think I think they could theoretically get below both those teams and and slagging tonight  is he a shutdown candidate yeah I think I think that's on the table they've been terrible lately they had like a weird Revival and now they're back to being bad for an eight over the past month horrible on defense they bench watch or Kessler Walker Kessler again I would I would trade marketing if you could get comparable value I think that'd be the safest thing to do yeah okay so outside of marketing in are we worried about Walker Kessler are we worried about Collin Sexton when it comes to Utah  I am not that worried about Kessler because I'm not even sure  I'm not even sure will hardy thinks that Kessler is a winning player like I don't I don't know what will hard even thinks about Walker Kessler anymore I think he's young enough and sort of been inauga the lineup enough where I think you'll just play sex is a little bit of a different story  you know I could see him getting shut down if they wanted to do the tail and Horton Tucker thing again Bryce sense of Bob maybe put them in the rotation they give Kyrie Lewis's shot  I think I'd be more actually more worried about sex and getting shut down then Kessler  yeah  yeah I think that makes sense you know important I think Malcolm Brogden is the obvious one right there they're saying he could return any time now I would imagine he like if you gave me over under 0.5 games played I think he plays again the season but I think the Phantom injury or maybe a real injury is coming for him I think he's gonna be shut down at some point you know do you worry about Simon's as somebody who has him in somebody's I yeah I'm a little worried about Simon's not um  I'm not I wouldn't say I'm like panicking about him  because I do think it will actually be difficult for Portland to slide into like third worst record at 150 has 11 well it doesn't matter you just got to be in the bottom four right exactly so  I again if you could trigger make a comparable value for a guy you're confident we'll play the rest of the year yeah do that but most people in your league are kind of gonna understand why you're trying to offload him  so it's values gonna be artificially low  so the Nets as a shot down team I'm not super worried about them because like we said earlier they're they're picking is gone that's unprotected to Houston got a new coach in there you know trying to to kind of prove himself and then maybe keep that job next year I'm not really worried about Brooklyn  you know Toronto Charlotte's those those are our teams that will come up the Raptors draft wise  they owe a top six protected pick to San Antonio again they're gonna have a pretty tough time feeling good about that one not conveying but they could get close you know Memphis has 20 wins they have 21 they could they could actually they can actually pull this off so Toronto is a good one every word about Scotty Barnes yakka portal any of their veterans I would be a little worried especially if I mean Memphis you know poking out out and update the other day and they're like we're still gonna try to get Bane and smart back you know that's okay you know Toronto has to I mean I don't think they will to be honest but I Toronto has to be hoping and praying that those guys actually see the floor and push Memphis up the standings but yeah I mean I would be worried if I was rostering anybody from Toronto because they are so close to that that pick that protected so  yeah again if you got bars whoever else on that roster I would I would look to see if anybody on your team wants them all right and your league wants them  and I know there's this narrative out here that I was just a bad draft you know teams are already looking ahead to 2025  we've got through this exercise like once every few years a quote bad draft comes up there will be guys there will be guys who turned into really good players it happens in every single draft there's never a draft where just nobody's good that's literally never happened in any sport ever so I'm just not buying that are like I just I don't buy like Toronto's like oh they're fine just handing over the seventh pick to San Antonio I don't think so no I don't think so either  no um you have to you have to take a shot you never know even if you don't necessarily like a guy you lot there's  you know they're surprises every single year so it's worth having a shot in the dark and and yeah you could trade that pick right you at least one be in possession of the pick to do something with it so yeah I'm not I'm not buying this bad draft thing there's there will be believed me come late June we'll be fired up about like 10 different guys it happens every single cycle all right Admiral needs says thoughts on Chris Middleton keep or drop when he comes off of ir he'd be dropping him to pick up either keonte Paul Reed or Draymond  um  I mean I I still really like Middleton as a player it's just he really can't get healthy man it's it's it's it's tough I mean he's better than all those guys and fantasy  well he's healthy and he's playing 30 minutes I mean it's it's not even really close to me  but our  dude do you have a strong lean on this  well the way the question is freezed you know it's keep her drop when he comes off of ir it's like I If You're Gonna wait that long for him to come off anyway you might as well see it through with Middleton I think or at least see what they do minutes wise like if this turns into another thing where it takes them a month to be back to playing 32 minutes a game and the books just want to have healthy for the playoffs then yeah it's probably gonna be a losing value I mean dream on is the interesting one to me like we talked about keyonte George the plus is the minuses there Paul Reed you know kind of is what it is but I mean very much been like a top 50 guy since he came back from the suspension so that one to be interesting if you if you don't want to play the waiting game with Middleton  yeah I mean driving on continues to be up clearly a top 100 player in fantasy you mentioned he's averaging 10 8 and 6 with like two Steals and blocks you bind in February so yeah I mean I want to hate the idea of you know moving off the Middleton to get any of those guys but I think I like you like Nick said I just want to see what the Bucks do with mikaelsons because the Middleton's playing 30 minutes he's gonna be better than all those guys  he also said Trey man would be an option to pick up to that change the conversation at all um  no still projects to be better than Trey man  so I just wasn't doing it for him like Trey man's very good we don't know about Milo that's not really the point I mean Trey young man's averaging five assists so does Middleton when he's healthy and Middleton's giving me twice as many points so yeah  sticking with that Jay Sizzle says I want to drop Trey man for Iota sumu in a nine Cat 10 team head-to-head league is this a good move or know the the overall ratings would say that Trey man has been a little bit better than to Sumo you know depending on how far you go out if you if you isolate the last 30 days it's it would be better to have to sumu you know over the last couple of weeks you know when Jerry man is actually been playing real minutes that becomes a bit more of a debate but I would I would take to Sumo either way here I think there's still some variability with Trey man it's a terrible team they they're like struggling to get close to scoring 100 points a lot of nights like he's leaving a cyst on the table because nobody can hit shots and they're still the Specter of lamelo ball but potentially coming back at some point and that's all this up  yes I mean there are you know if you want to make the argument either way I think the debate would what would agree on is they're fairly equal fantasy players right now is thanks Stan but the soon mood doesn't have this like negative thing sort of like this potential Dark Cloud hanging over him in the future so yeah and I mean man might be over his head a little bit in terms of like you know his steals production for example that could come down where I am more confident even even as efficiency in general like this is as best efficiency year by far taking on an increased role that could cool off so I'd rather have to sumo  yeah I mean to Sumo shooting 50% from the field on the year not just you know since Levine went down or anything like that I mean I just think it's gonna be a much safer bed there's gonna be nice where you probably regret it but I think to see mood to me is the pretty clear answer James says Royce so Neil is he worth a roster spot yeah we mentioned he was picked up in the roadwire state League 16 teams  I mean he just had his best game of the year so it's a good time to ask this question 20 points 10 boards four assists two Steals on the Block in a win over the Lakers yesterday he didn't hit 63s in that game that's not something he's done since late November you know the 3-point shooting tends to come and go with him  you know Phoenix was without Eric Gordon and Bradley Beal so that's that's the bigger factor to me  I think  well I mean Beals injury risk and so was Durant and O'Neill's has been a good feeling for a lot of his career for for guys he can do a variety you can pass he can rebound he can defense everything it's just very very low usage I think in a 16 Team league yeah go ahead and pick him up if you're a 12 team League I just at best he's a streamer on a four game week  Dennis asks should I drop Trey Murphy to stream his spot or keep him rostered in a 12 team or  assistant we got to put our Trey Murphy bias aside I absolutely love Trey Murphy and would love to be rostering him and some of my deeper leaks its  it's been a little frustrating man I mean the minutes have been there lately you know the shooting is not been there for him he went he's gone three of nine one of seven two of ten three of nine one of five from three and his last five games my fear here as you drop them and then you know this is the this upcoming week is when that all reverses right I you know I I was hoping the All-Star break he come back to the all-star break and he would start chewing better immediately you know because he started the year with the meniscus injury and I think that's affected his his efficiency I  look I would love to hang on to him I prefer to hang on to him his defense has actually been great lately past six games he has at least one seal one block  I think  look I we talked about the top of the show Zion has been very healthy all year Ingram has been pretty healthy this season but both of those guys were made significant injury risks there's no reason they can't get hurt within the next ball one or both of them and then Trey Murphy you know takes an extra five to six shots a game so I'm going to go counter to that and say that I would stream the spot because the Pelicans have four three-game weeks in their next five  they have won four game week and that is the week of March 18th  so if he's you know one of your final starters or maybe a bench guys some weeks anyway  are you really feeling great about throwing them out there when it's basically nothing but three game weeks coming up like I I think you might be better off just streaming a four gamer each week going forward by the way next week the Brooklyn Nets have five games so if you can if you can grab a net out there for a five game week that would that would be the way I would lean but yeah the schedules not great for him you know coming up for the next month plus  yeah that's a that's a good point I don't think this is like a league winning or League losing move but a lot of people you know a lot of people dropped  cam Johnson at some point it if you can stream in cam Johnson on a five-game week and drop Trey Murphy I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say that's like a bad decision  yeah I mean five game weeks are extremely rare these days we used to see a few more of those you know when the schedule was a bit more compact but that is that's kind of a godsend Camp Johnson right now and see his roster rate 76% rostered in Yahoo so one out of four leaks he might be out there for you all right Matt says what are your thoughts on stashing healthy players on IR if you have a buy or playoff spot locked up takes away your ability to stream  I feel I mean it mostly because I play in you can't really do this right they have to be IR eligible  um no I I think it rasp and Lee you can you can have a guy hang out and I are really healthy yeah he has to have been placed there when he was hurt but you don't have to activate them until you feel like it yeah so yeah I mean I what I what are my thoughts on it go ahead do it I don't know is this like a question like do people think it's a like a bad move like it breaks a code or something I gotta I don't know I don't do it I think if you could do it you do it that's what I would say yeah I mean if that gives you a little bit more flexibility I mean obviously in a pretty good spot here if you're thinking about doing that so now if anybody gives you any grief in your league just send him to us and well we'll set up great  George points out that regarding Trey Man Charlie does have a two game weak and weak 20 so I just have to keep an eye on you know I to be honest I don't do a whole lot of like you know four or five weeks out you know looking at the schedule this maybe I think a fish to fry in my legs which means I have ground to make up but yeah if you're sitting in first or second and you have the luxury of time to to look into that stuff absolutely but I still I still think that alone to me would not push me in favor of man over over Iowa if anything that's more ammo for the December camp right I think well Atari you know it's hard for us to give blanket advice on  like how many games a team has a specific week in the future because  late in the year all of these weeks have different relevance to everybody like we could give you advice about like weeks 10 through 15 because everybody it's the same for everybody but some leeks and some leaks are gonna end like March 15th some of these Grand April 1st some leaves are gonna end and so they all have different ways so you gotta check that on your own but good info  all right Jordan Goodwin time on the roadwire fantasy basketball pod any thoughts on Goodwin now that he has a two-way deal in Memphis  Yeah I mean he you know he didn't play in their last game against the against the Clippers I think that was more of a contractual issue you know that the next day they signed him to that two-way so I think that was it's not like he just got for the rotation  Memphis is such a mess you know if you're if you're in a deeper League I think he's worth looking into I mean he played two pretty good games back to back one he started when he came off the bench the one he started was that disaster game for the bucks before the break by the way but yeah I mean in addition to all the the usuals who are out for Memphis like John kochar's banged up now he's not gonna play tonight I think part of this comes down to like do you actually believe the Grizzlies that you know Desmond Bane Marcus Smart they're gonna be back out there when healthy ah I don't really believe them I just I just my own personal the way I I treated I just act like they're not coming back and you can you could there's only so much like debate you can do in your own head about like are these guys coming back is this a lie so I don't I just act like they aren't because I think it would be stupid as far as like Goodwin yeah he signed a two-way deal but it's so late in the year that he should be I think he should be gonna be eligible to play the rest of the year with the parents Squad  what do we think about I really liked him I mean last year with Washington I mean you may be had to be a little deep in the weeds and fantasy but he was actually ranked 89th per minute in fact he last year with the Wizards that's a really good streaming weeks with Bradley Beal out I think it was and you know he's like basically first career for 30 seconds he's been like you know 13 points five assists one gonna have steals that's great you get some blocks as well and I think he could see increased the most usage of his career in this role is he gonna play 36 minutes probably not but  pick him up  here's a good question and kind of ties into what we're talking about with Bane Tori Thompson says number one in my league with a cushion 10 team or someone dropped as a band which you claim him and stash him on IR or is it even worth it it depends on your last guy is I guess to me you know if you I don't know let's say you have like an echo Kang woo and now we don't know what's going on with him  then yeah I mean I if you're number one with a cushion and you're not dropping somebody of real consequence which in attending League you probably are I would think about it I mean that like if you're number one and adding Desmond Bane basically makes you invincible and he comes back  it certainly something to consider but I just I don't know if we can Bank on it this feels 50/50 at best and even if he comes back as he playing all the way through game 82 is he playing a full minute slowed to me it 100% comes down to who you're dropping  if you don't get the drop anybody if you're picking him up  I mean I it's some leaves are going to be different some guys are not getting some legs you're not gonna be able to pick a guy up and pick up immediately in your IR you have to pick a guy up put him at you have them on your bench and then you have to insert them into the IR but yeah like Nick said if you're not dropping anybody of consequence you know if the right if your whole bunch is healthy you're not gonna have any issues starting anybody yeah I have no issues with that move  yeah yeah I should clarify it's a good point I mean if you could just grab him and put him directly into ir and you have nobody else there then yeah I don't see any downside to do in that but yeah if you have to if you have to pick him up drop somebody to in order for the transaction to go through in a 10 Team league that becomes a little dicey anything deeper than that yeah I think it's worth the risk um our Dennis says Grayson Allen or Cameron Johnson in a 12 team are worried about cams low minutes Fair concern I mean if you're just tuning in we did mention Brooklyn has a five-game week coming up so that would that would be the week to roster or even stream cam Johnson in general though I think I'd rather have Grayson Allen  in general I would rather have Grayson Allen I mean there's a chance that you can get Best of Both Worlds streaming cam Johnson is it next week that they have the five games or two weeks I believe so I think it's okay  stream them in streaming cam Johnson next week for five games drop him and then pick up Grace and Allen I think there's like the ideal move yeah I agree I was back a long term  Galaxy brainwave water we love it Tori says I'm going to drop Bowie on anyway because he's full not much of a risk but I'd hate to not be able to use the IR slots the case I need them  I would say unless you're league as a weird IRS settings like if you need them then you just dropped pain right  yeah I mean I don't get 10 Team league bogdanovich at this point is just he's a streamer he's not he's not really anybody of consequence yeah okay another Bane related question would you drop Malcolm Brogden for bein so basically a swap of ill spots ah I don't think I would actually I think Brogden has a better chance of coming back this season  that sooner sooner than Maine  and other it like I think we don't we don't want to get necessarily obsessed or not obsessed we don't want to lock into the idea that Bane's gonna come back and play like 35 minutes a game and take like 25 shots it's possible Bank comes back the last two weeks of the Year place like 18 to 25 minutes a game  it's just out there running around like trying not to get hurt and he's basically as good as anybody else you could have off the way for wire  all right last one here from Jason getting it in out of the gun he says should I make a trade here my 19 category League team is Murray capella Keegan Murray oh wait I think I all right we gotta start over here click apella Murray Jamal Murray Tyler hero Ben mathurin Brooke Lopez kristofferson's might have a copy and paste issue here but he's saying should I make a trade basically  really hard to say based on you know just looking at a roster you know you're I guess a little bit guard heavy but then you got you know capella Lopez and porzingis  have no wings yeah right if anything yeah you might you might have trouble finding some support eligibility  uh yeah I mean if there's a trade to make I think you probably want to make a trade for a like a forward who gets some steals maybe I don't think you're getting any steals production from your guys so that would just very very quick reaction on that yeah  all right final one we'll talk a Brooklyn Nets question DFS or  sharp day around sharp and you saying over Derek Lively in a 10 team 9 Catlett leaks so what rope in the Lively part of this as well because that is interesting you know with the with the additions that they made at the deadline so basically Finney Smith sharp or Derek Lively  I don't need I don't need to be rostering Phoenix Smith I don't think Lively hasn't played 20 minutes since he returned from his from his nose injury and Bradford's been there so that's obviously concerned that's usually where sharp hangs around too um you know he's he's been playing in like the 10 to 15 minute range lately but I think Sharp sharp is a better per minute producer than Lively the question is is sharp even gonna like  Sharps magnets have been up and down all year  if you need the pure upside I actually think it's sharp as the move I would I would add sharp if you just need a bunch of upside but if you're in a fine spot and you want to play it safe I think I would just keep Lively  yeah I  mean league right so  I feel like there should be better options out there right then any of these guys I mean I wouldn't feel good about picking these guys up in like okay but is this a for the five game week oh right right okay good questions like all right that this makes significantly more sense yes yeah I mean I think you have to go with one of the Nets then and yeah I think in that case then sharp I would go sharp I'm not I'm just not fired up about what we've seen from Vinny Smith all right guys great questions as always covered a
