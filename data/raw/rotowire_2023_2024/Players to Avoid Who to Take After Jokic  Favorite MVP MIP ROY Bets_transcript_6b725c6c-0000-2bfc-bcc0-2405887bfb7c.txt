hey everybody I'm doc he's Rick where the fantasy Hoops oh geez welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast sponsored by Underdog and Vivid Seats here we go Rick what is happening how is it going  all right everything is really good you know we had Steph it a game winner last night I was just like whoa we're really playing all the way to the end of the fourth quarter of a preseason game  and nobody died Steve Alexander nobody broke into nobody to solved on the court and liquid form that will never be put back together again right all this bubble wrap we can't play a whole game Zions playing like he's stepping his toe in the damn water how do you get in shape that way so I mean obviously it's a game winner okay greatest shooter of all time I was just impressed that those dudes were playing all the way to the end of the game man we are closed doc a Tuesday night opening night can't wait man well  you know we are contractually obligated to talk about James Harden on every podcast I do which is about six a week thank goodness I don't have this delay issue on all six of those or I would be in a minute institution right now but we've gone from James Harden  playing good soldier practicing with the team  going to play basketball to James Harden hadn't been with the Sixers since Sunday and was last seen bouncing around Houston Texas  with no indication giving as to why he was not with his team or if he's ever going to be the team again so  what are we doing Rick like first of all  if you're looking at the 25th pick and a fantasy draft are you touching James Harden and secondly where are you just on a personal level with James Harden at this point  homies  wanna kick it with James in the club not yourself out go with the job I'm out I've been out I want to be out on him in the cam Dynasty he fell in the we are inaugural draft last year he fell like fourth round I'm like damn hardened the fourth round is some serious value um and he had a terrific statistical year I'm so dumb with James Harden man um you mentioned good soldier I think there were some misreporting going on here you know he's being professional and he's checking all the boxes know he was and he took part in one live five on five in the first two weeks of training camp that's a hole in its we know when the NFL a lot of guys were upset with their contract they go they're there their body is there but they're not doing anything that's a hold in hardin's gone from a hold into a hole down I want to give you the reality take and the fantasy take quickly Darrell more needs to cut bait now he needs to take a first round pick from the Clippers the second round pick from the Clippers Markus Morrison Robert Covington and move on with his life that is reportedly what the Clippers are willing to offer Darryl wants three first round draft assets and those expiring contracts man is off the table and the Clippers don't want to give him three future first-round draft assets and I don't think they ever will Dr a so if I were more I would take that deal before the Clippers move on with their lives and make James Harden their problem not my problem because he poisons every team he goes to he will poison the Clippers if he goes out there and fantasy it's very simple you can't trust him he's injury-prone he's asked out of three teams in 2019 months he might ask out of the Clippers if he's traded there so he's good good to me in fantasy basketball he is the deadest player to me in Fantasy Basketball in the entire NBA doc okay let me let me put it to you this way if James Harden were available in the 10th round of the league and I Snicker every time I'm in a draft and he goes 23rd 27th 25th of like that's a benefit for me and and  a massive elf of that manager right there tenth around 12th round 15th round I am leaving James Harden to be somebody else's problem okay I think you stated that very well very strongly I think we all know where you stand on James Harden I'm in a similar position because you can't trust in and there's some guys I'm just not gonna drive them or how far they fall and he's one of those right now now I'm a lot of guys we don't need to worry about it because people are taking him and sitting around we regardless like they don't care they're like I'm gonna take him there's too much upside there and leave the legal assistance last year he can do it again this year he could he could do whatever I'm not taking a chance  but you told me where we did put this show together that you want to talk in future Hots so we pulled some numbers holy names let's talk about MVP Rick who who's on the  where's the smart money going for who's gonna win the MVP of the NBA this year okay my friend um all right I have let me go to your rundown here we've got dual a dual rundown scenario here I want to get the odds that are on RotoWire via DraftKings so um I'm just gonna run run this down docket and as we continue this conversation um you know I've got yoga twinning MVP this year and me and Antonio Daniels are going to talk about this tomorrow on NBA Radio on our show but so yogic at a plus 450  Doctor Ray everybody watching and listening here and by the way quick shout out here to F Scott Foster he is commenting here in a stream yard with us he says to goats Steve having another Boomer moment which which I know he got a big smile on a doctorate right there oh I love it so  pardon me doctorate we are four and a half Xing our money on Nicole yokich to win MVP there's no way it's plus 450 I think this should be plus 150 plus 200 okay it's early right I remember I was on Ronald Acuna to win National League MVP uh okay and I believe it was plus 800 before the train left the station right Ooh La La eight times your money okay so it's early Caleb Williams who took a hit last week in the Heisman race but coming into the season now thought his odds weren't flat enough it was plus 350 plus 400 something like that so I feel the same way here with yokich um a guy that I'm completely out on Dr Ace Luke get on you who is + 500 here perota wire on the DraftKings odds you have to win and have great stats to be in MVPs not gonna win doctor a 42 and 40 41 and 40 won 38 and 42 I don't know maybe they go 44 4 and 38 this is the West buddy and I think the West is super stacked I I'm not even sure Dallas is going to make the plan tournament Dr a I'm really not and I like the moves they made I like getting Grant Williams Derek Lively should add some bounce I mean he's better than Dwight freaking Powell right but I still can't get with it versus the OKC's the Minnesota is the New Orleans all those other squads man so let's start there um hot on yokich at a plus 450 ice cold dead in the water on Luca at a plus 500  okay my head around the fact that people are I think the over under on Dallas wins like 42 and a half 43  I just don't see it it's it's Kyrie and it's Luca and it's a bunch of guys and  they missed Jalen Brunson so bad I don't know that they're ever going to recover from that in the Luca era I don't know Luke put up with the long before he's like bro I gotta go I'm not gonna I'm not my whole career in that by myself not winning  um I think I like on this list is SGA 1600 um  dude the sky's the limit for SGA the world is his oyster right now like League Pass we were talking about I just did podcast five minutes ago um and we were talking about we need to do a tears right for me  I think OKC is gonna be a loan in that top here I want to watch the play every night and if if they are better than we think they're going to be if they have a really good season SGA  would have a real chance to win this award so I think if you're going to take a home run swing 100 dollars to win 1600  that's a good way that's a good way to go  so I love it um I've got green I code I just put the odds down and I put guys in green that I would put my money on dudes in red that I would not and SGA plus 1600 is a guy that would that would get some money for me or I would you know cosine a wager us Steph Curry and plus 1500 I really like it um he's won MVP before obviously everybody loves him so you know there's no reason not to vote for him and if he goes 3132 points per game and we're talking about maybe a 400 3-point season doctorate I think Steph Curry's going massive this year I think he's gonna have an awesome year chip on his shoulder from the records of last year and you know clock is ticking you know what I'm saying like we get to go time for this dynasty I just think Curry's gonna have a huge year and and I want to hit you with a long shot here for MVP we're talking Futures here the fantasy ogs your boys camp and Doc ah Anthony Davis and plus 3500 doctorate so Anthony Davis and plus 3500 okay I can't believe he's this far down the list I really can't and I get it half man half a season blah blah blah insert joke here I understand um I I have a vibe in a tickle and a Mojo about Anthony Davis this year I do and I believe he's going to stay healthy I believe he's going to spike statistically and have a Nutty 27/13 two and a half one and a half line on Plank 65 plus games okay I'm not trying to say he's gonna play 77 games but I think we're gonna get 65 plus and I think we're gonna get a defensive player of the year candidate like in the core and I think we're going to get maybe like fourth or fifth on the MVP ladder right behind probably the usual suspects but I just think we're gonna get a big time you're here from Anthony Davis and if he's having a great year let's say the Lakers are first in the west docket and they're on Pace to win 59 games Anthony Davis will be your MVP of the of the NBA if he goes 27 13 and 4 whatever the line that I said with all the defensive goodies and if the Lakers at 58 159 wins we're talking about an MVP so Anthony Davis said A Plus 3500 I'm in Florida brother I can't bet but if I could I put a honey Bean on Davis I try to make some 35 I try to make some stats on this one dude I like that better a lot  I think I was gonna put money on an Anthony would be Edward but you're right you know if if the Lakers you end up being really good and win a lot of games LeBron and AD are both going to be in the discussion so Rick who do you like for most improved player of the year this year  so  like Jalen Brunson and interesting I don't see Jalen Brunson on the odds that you put in our rundown here and I'm gonna I'm gonna try not to be terribly offended by that because I feel like there may have been some editing throughout that process um I'm just busted in your Stones here but um I love Jalen Brunson he was third and MIP voting last year he fits the profile of a player that's about to make his first All-Star Game and giving when you look at um they don't tell you what the criteria is but you can read between the lines of what the criteria is through the Winner's are and the winners are guys that pop and make an All-Star team for the first time last year marking and first time all star SGA right behind him first time all star this year Bronson I believe is going to be a first time all star the Knicks have gotten and all star in two of the last three years both Randall and I think this year the pendulum swings towards Brunson he averaged 24 PPG last year I think there's room to get it up a 25 or 26 I don't see upside beyond that but the most important metric here doc a is to make the All-Star team for the first time and I believe the Knicks are going to be a top 14 in the East maybe even not maybe above Philadelphia I stacked the East Milwaukee Boston Miami very tightly forth I've got the Knicks and then we can have different conversations from there but I think it's going to be a banner year for the next 50 wins I think Bronson's gonna go large I think brunson's going to be the clutch Player of the Year as well the award the deer and fox one last year so I think he's gonna win MIP and the clutch award this year Dre so um I'll look up his eyes here in a minute but I would assume it's probably like plus a thousand at least 10x on your money to bet Jalen Brunson from IP and I absolutely love that young fellow man I don't know about that because how much better can his numbers be in the world last year and I understand first I'll start team it's a big part of it but there's also a big part of it of taking that  big leap and stats and I don't know that he could he could be much better than he was last she would just probably why he's not showing up on let's go ahead and look that up I'll tell you Mikhail Bridges  in 27 games with Brooklyn last year put a big number that we talked about before on the show  but when you combine those with this Phoenix numbers  his overall numbers are not mind-blowing it's gonna be easier for him to pop  on those bad numbers in Phoenix from last year in Brooklyn this year and do it for a whole season and make an All-Star team I think that's why Mikhail Bridges is the low on this totem pole as far as the odds go I think  Jordan pools very interesting he scored what 41 last night or something 47 he's got like I like cool I definitely like pool for this award he's gonna score a ton of points in Washington Austin Reeves is kind of sneaky there's lots of like here  okay um I'm I'm tripping out right now  I'm in I'm in the Twilight Zone dude I am scrolling through the DraftKings odds for most improved player I mean dude I'm down here around oh my God Christian Braun Patrick Williams I'm still not at Jalen Brunson yet Zion Williamson at plus 5500 why is he even on this list ah they okay this is insanity  we got to talk about this Grant Williams on Yucca akong woo like what Jose Alvarado I mean I'm all the way down here at the bottom all right I got plus 10,000 on James book Night who just had surgery which I believe in season I  okay there's 50 names here no  75 or 80 names here no Jalen Brunson we need to launch an investigation what is going on here this is weird doc a this is one of the best players in the NBA I look and I acknowledge it as well there's not a lot of room for statistical advancement from Jalen Brunson but we've got Center Stage advancement and we've got the first time all star advancement that might be enough it might not be enough okay to your point but damn it chilling Brunson should be on this list and plus 1000 plus 1500 whatever it is um that's shocking to me and to me and I've been on a DraftKings of doctor ah I believe they Shield some lines like I don't you know in and in basketball like what when a guy gets hurt and there's like a hot dude coming up behind him and we all know that dude's gonna have a pop game in that first game without the star that's out and then that guy's just off the board for that for that game it's like what why is he off the board because you think you're gonna put his line at 15 know he's going for 23 tonight it's so shady to me um and I think that's what's going on here with Jalen Brunson why in the hell would he not have odds on DraftKings for most improved player literally I want to launch an investigation about this  yeah well  as as that as your last statement finishes in my head right now this is insane what's happening such a boomer such a boomer moment again Rookie of the Year Rick maybe maybe this will be less frustrating for you maybe all your guys are gonna be listed on this list probably know I mean literally does that make sense to you the Jalen Brunson doesn't have odds for MIP on DraftKings does that mean you just kind of moved on like does that make sense to you we can move on but is that you find that weird in any way  cleared it all up I thought I I'm not that surprised I mean is no R&B on that list is come on man go on that list I just I think brought some was I think in people's minds he was an All-Star last year even though he wasn't he had a really good season he put up huge numbers we all thought he was gonna blow up in New York he did it  maybe he meant maybe he missed the boat maybe that ship is sale I just in the hunt  I mean I think I think it has in  um let's go on to Rookie of the Year as I continue to  deal with this um Wendy plus one 20 scoot plus 240 champ what's 280  B Miller who has been  by all documented accounts hugely disappointing since draft day plus 1600 Camp Whitmore at plus 20 200 that would be a that would be a shocker and what you and I don't know how I don't know that  he cannot live up to the hype  unless he gets hurt he  I love Wendy for Rookie of the Year and Dr a I want to bring you on our audience into an epiphany that I've had since we have last been on the air I work with a guy on NBA Radio by the name of Antonio Daniels he is one of the wisest and smartest and and coolest and best dudes I've ever worked with and he enlightens me in our audience a lot well we were talking about Rookie of the Year in Wendy the other day and I said you know I'm afraid of the late season shut down and and he said um he said cam looked this up he said let's look at the past couple of drafts because I don't think the top picks get shut down  guys get shot down veterans get shot down but he's usually don't shut down the top guys we went back through the last two drafts right the Paula Bank Harris the Jabari Smith's the Jade and IVs um Kate Cunningham two years ago played all the way out to the end of the season and it was like ding a light bulb one on he's right date Jalen greens guys like that they don't shut those guys down Shane sharp played late last year had a bunch of Big Time games right so so Portland if that's a historical triangle will follow this year Portland's not going to shut down scoot they might shut down Grant and Aiden but they're not going and maybe Simons but they're not going to shut down Scoot and sharp because they need to development um you know in in Detroit they're not going to shut down Cade and IB and Duran because they need development all this kind of stuff so like the top top guys don't get shut down so that was an epiphany for me so now all of these guys are back in play even when be on San Antonio and Scoot on Portland and I look I don't like the odds here on Wendy docket and a plus one 20 it's extremely flat extremely chalky and and honestly there's risk involved right he could get hurt there could still be a shot down despite you know what we think is going to happen so I'm just not crazy about that plus 25 I would love when B plus on 120 not so much I think Chet is the play here doc a and plus 280 because I like the two point eight X on your money we are guaranteed that okay see  won't shut down check guaranteed okay um because they're going to be in I don't know they're going to be fifth or sixth in the west maybe seventh in the plane tournament kind of thing but okay she's gonna be very good his stats going to be amazing 15 and 10 two and a half assists two plus blocks probably right around a steel per game probably gonna bang what do you think doc a 1.23 I think you'll be at a three um per game so so check to me is the way to go here betting wise to the plus 280 yeah I agree I the 120 is just a boring on wimby like it's not it's just not fun and I think if you're gonna  you're gonna play for something and try to win something I think Chet's the way to go I think it's gonna come down to chat and wimby and I think it's gonna be whoever probably plays the most games or misses the least amount of games between the two probably gonna win that award but let

NFL over and over and over again my head Rick moving on from the gambling  who  is in your top five for Nyan Cat right now do you have a top five list for 9 cat particularly  interested in who were taking at number two as we all know Nicola yokich is going number one in every single week yo lmb very popular at number two but I could see just a Luke or Ty Oliver and being in that conversation  so I I'm on a big man kick this year Dre um because I you know what we can't we can't just do the same thing every year and and I just I wanted to tweak my draft methodology this year and I'm going it's not like I'm not taking Smalls early if it's the right pick at the right time right like maybe Halliburton it 11 okay like I gotta take him right but but I'm looking to go big when I can't early because I you know it's just there's always guards that you like um in round five and round six and it's really not bigs that you like at that point so I'm trying to um I'm trying to lean big early so I am with D&B thing at at number three though I've got Yana's number two behind you then I'm gonna be then I've got Luka and then I've got Jayson Tatum um and I love Tatum I mean the guy blossomed into a 3010 and 5 well okay he wasn't quite a 10 but a 30 ten and five ish guy which is Giannis ish um and I was in availability guy I love the fact that employees we do add porzingis we do add Drew holiday I'm not sure Tatum's going to average 30 this year but but I like the availability I'm also not sure sga's gonna average 30 this year with which yet you know dorks gonna get shots Jalen Williams is going to get shots get he's going to have the ball a lot and I mean I love you know give me wrong I could see him coming back to me 28 off of 31 but I got yogic then I got him beat me you'll get you honest then beat then Luke and then Jayson Tatum one two three four five  yeah I don't have paid him in my top five but I do like them a lot this year he's he's an iron man I think he's gonna be out there playing every night you don't really have to worry about him you know the more the more time that passes with Luca every day right now I'm a little more nervous about him than I was yesterday's questionable for opening night he's  always holding some part of his leg and it's just makes me nervous SGA I have zero concerns about I know he's gonna be out there every night Ty Halliburton I know he's going to be out there at night Tatum I know he's gonna be out there every night makes me a little more and a little more worried about Luke with every day that passes but I think I think if I'm I think I've got the second pick I'm probably taking Joel embiid  if I got the third pick I'm taking FDA  if I got if I might take Tatum but that's that's where I am  you want to turn let me ask you this Rick would you rather have a top five pick this year would you rather have like Pick 10 11 or 12 you think  do you think it's okay being at the end of the draft this year as opposed to the beginning that's a really good question um I don't know doc a I'm kind of like I want um you know I just think we're more premium at the top here I do and I think like if you're if you're in a 12 team league and you're a tent okay so then you're going 10 and what are you going ten eleven twelve then 13 14 15 so you're going 10 and 15 okay um so you know right now on so you could go with like a Kevin Durant and Anthony Edwards so you could go with a tray young in an Anthony Davids I mean look I like that I do um I think you can have a nice little nice little sandwich there I do like you know coming off of the early pick all right so you're missing the end of the first round of the beginning of the second round but then you're getting the end of the second one at the beginning of the third round on and I think that's still a really fertile area as a supposed to you know when we drift towards the back here with with their  comeback around I don't know man I just I would rather be up there swinging at the the Dodges the honest is the embeds is the Yoke it's just I would rather have a top five pick but I would totally it's a coin flip it is it's just a preference for me I'd rather have these big boys in these big names well I'll tell you what  if you are getting stuck in the back of your grass there are worse that  available to you then Michaela is Jared Jackson Jr Anthony Edwards Trey young those are all guys were going in there I feel like Anthony Edwards is a very to take over the world like  I kind of feel like these were last year  this is going to be the year of Anthony Edwards you at 10 and then turn around get say James Jackson junior at 15 and start your  start your draft off with those two young studs I think you're gonna be  in pretty good shape for the rest of your dress so  I don't really mind being at the turn if I get the top five pick I I want it because I want Luca SGA hi I want to start off with one point guards but if I'm stuck in the back  give me one of those what are those guys I just mentioned I'm pretty okay with that Rick today it's not up yet but at some point in the next couple hours my first male bag column of the season for Rotoworld is going to hit I got a ton of good questions on X slash Twitter whatever it's called these days I took those questions put in a column I do it every Wednesday usually runs on Thursday and we got some good questions from from the column this week and we actually already answered that one looks like this  Ten teams eight cats I have picked 10 and 11 at the turn who should I be targeting that's from my buddy bmac  I don't do a lot of 10 team graphs Rick I didn't ate team draft two days ago which was weird like you talked about drafting All-Star games  it's pretty weird I almost all the leaves I play in her 12 I think most of the leaks you pray in her 12 teams in a 10 team you're looking kind of All Stars through like round six who would you be targeting at 10:11  probably um I probably be looking at a tree young Anthony Davis combo I'm gonna get my 27 and 10 from Trey with a bunch of Threes I'm gonna get a Nutty Defensive Player of the Year type of stat line for Anthony Davis you know is there in July with Davis there is there's injury risk with a lot of these guys I would also think about lamelo ball docket and and maybe instead of Trey young that would be a consideration I do worry about a shot down with lamelo ball Charlotte's going to suck this year I probably go tray and Anthony Davis and attend Team league if I had ten I'm going 10 11 I go Anthony Davis then Trey Yuen yeah I like that we were talking about lamelo ball on my  podcast I just got done with and lamelo ball and Anthony Davis both I feel like you're you're into Anthony David this year I am I like he's usually not I got the tickle this year doc I do you like he's either gonna win me a championship or he's gonna get hurt and I'm gonna be screwed  and I think that's the way it is and I think we're in the same boat now with lamelo ball because he's got one ankle the big baller brand shoes or have torn that family  we may never see again lamelo it's just  floating around out there on one foot it's not and I feel like he  is one of the play into another level this year he could win MVP  if he played for it when more than 25  so the military so good but man you take me to Philip Brown and he goes down two weeks into the season with an ankle and your season's done you can't replace a niche or a lamelo ball or an Anthony Davis when they go down so it's interesting to see it's interesting you know all in on I like I'm okay with it I don't know that I'm drafting either one of those guys right now but it it is fascinating to see you not scared of anything David's like come back to we're gonna talk about that the end of the season is we had that worked out for you  and if it doesn't work out we're going to be complaining about it all seasons so there you go  who's on your do not draft list that is I tell you what that is perfect perfectly segue from what we just talked about because Anthony Davis is on my do not draft list Ah that's interesting um look I I'm probably on Kamala island with this Anthony Davis thing I just you know seeing LeBron kind of drift into the robin role last year willingly and continues to promote Davis's the Batman and we saw Davis emerge as a Batman in the playoffs and I just think that Davis is going to take that to another level this year and and you know obviously it's a Leap of Faith with the injury thing but um apparently I don't want to go into reports right because they just don't matter well we'll see when we see and I just got a Vibe on Davis this year sometimes you got to go with your gut here's the Do Not draft list for your boy Rick Campbell um Kevin Durant Kevin Durant I don't have the stat in front of me Doc it's in my brain though he's averaged like 34 games a year over the last four years what like I mean he literally is Mr dnp LeBron James tongue hanging out at the end of the Denver series always misses a chunk since he got to LA with the exception of the championship year um I'm just so worried about injuries I'm so worried about load management because they're trying to get him to the finish line so LeBron is a know Kyrie Irving is a know um and it's for the injury thing right he's got an injury right now the groin um where is he's back to practice should be able to go opening night we'll see Jimmy Butler he's too arrogant for me man um he is a game mister he's like he just I don't think he values every game okay like Tatum does like siakam does like Trey young does I don't think he was ever game I'll get him tomorrow okay we got New York coming in here on Friday I'll play that okay so I'm out Andy doesn't hit threes James Harden we always are already talked about that Kawhi Leonard he's averaged 40 games a year in his four years with the LA Clippers by Paul George he's averaged 47 games a year in his four years in a Clipper uniform bye and finally Bradley Beal and what sucks I got two of these guys on my cam Dynasty team two guys I want nothing to do with James Harden and Bradley Beal it is what it is obviously when they're healthy and alert they're very very good but they come with a lot of injury risks so that's my do not draft list  what about Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson over there like okay thank you thank you Zion is the yes  Brandon Ingram is a no okay I am I can't I like I don't know how I missed Ingram I really don't I went through a long list and invented I thank you because Ingram is on my do not draft list I will never draft Brandon Ingram he's overrated okay he doesn't give you enough three she's kind of that mid-range guy right he's not a Hugh what is he one point eight threes maybe two threes right it's not a three three per game got so there's that and he's a game mister and he's soft he's soft man if I mean last year docket what did he have a toe injury I mean dude we're missing months on months on months with this thing it never ended man so I think he saw a DeAngelo Russell's another guy now that we're taught now that we get to the soft players right super soft man let me tell I can make this definitive for everybody if you've got DeAngelo Russell okay because me and do a podcast here once a week but you're gonna need advice you know on up on a Wednesday night heading into that late night Laker game okay remember these words if D'Angelo Russell is questionable he's not playing he never ever played through questionable he never does never and I really use the word never never played so just know if you wake up or you you're looking at your team and you see the cube identical Russell got a

friend ill go  these players you ready I'm ready khris Middleton class Jones  White  Terry Rozier and then waited  by the way first of all all of these questions are super super heavy and I'm into it okay um so great job to everybody that fed doctor is mailbag legit I'm not just I think these are really really heavy questions here's the ranking Ty Jones's first I think ties Jones has a chance to go like 17 and 7 and have really good point guard numbers not you know 20 and 10 I don't see that but I could see 17 and 7 a couple of Threes per game 1.4 steals um I don't know about the percentages might be kind of yucky but but I think the raw numbers are going to be pretty good um again we're talking about a sleeper here right I don't know if he's gonna be a League winner for you but I think he's going to be good a really do and I like that Washington thing from a fantasy perspective because it's very rolled to find it's very we know where they're going with this right I do worry a little bit about a shot down I do because I think Washington's not gonna be very good I do worry about a shutdown but I'm I I'm full steam ahead on this um you know pool I'm drafting kuzma I'm drafting Thai Stones I'm drafting Gafford if it's a super super deeply right I'll mess around with some gaffer but number two is Rozier I love the three and steel combination from Terry Rozier he's gonna go at least 24 and 4 for you I'm a big fan I like Terry Rozier I think he's very underrated fantasy player Chris Middleton is next it's the injury Factor if you were healthy he'd be number one here but we have the injury Factor he's trending towards opening night but it's still kind of murky and we also have a downshift doc from a number two role to a number three roll with obviously Giannis and Dame taking most of the shots there so we're not going to get 25 from Chris Middleton it's probably going to be 184 and 4 which is solid but I'm I I'm not really feeling that Jen what is next and to me his numbers are going to come down off the last year because of Ben Simmons healthy ball and Ben Simmons looks great this preseason if you guys haven't been able to watch so I like Dinwiddie I don't love them and then Derek white started two nights ago for Boston with Horford coming off of the bench in a dress rehearsal game which I think was a clue that White's going to start but I'm not geeked about him because he is fifth in the pecking order of that starting five Tatum Brown porzingis holiday and then white what is he gonna average doc a 12 points with three rebounds and four assists and a steal and a three and a half like I I don't know what what's Drew holiday was traded to Boston Derek white kind of became dead to me in fantasy well and we poured one out for him when it happened because over over you know you're wrote a wire and sports Toby we were all freaking out like oh man this is the year that Derek White's gonna blow up and come in and kill it it you know what a super sleeper he's gonna be great rebounder for a guard please D Place both ends in their Court Marcus Smart's gone like the world is Derek White's oyster and holiday shows up is like oh I guess we can forget about Derek right now the guy on that list I like and I think you listen first time Jones like you said the Washington Vibe they're going to be terrible but they're gonna be fun to watch on League Pass there's gonna be a lot going on with Jordan Poole scoring 40 and I and Somebody's gotta feed him the Rock and that's fast Jones and I think if you can get tires Jones or in or trade zone um it's only the point guard and orbi white who might you know the point guard in Chicago three guys you can get me in your draft if you are on point guards early they can salvage an entire season for you one of those three guys is going to have a season all three of them might be  might be good so I like those I like the sleeper point guards late in the draft this year  I'm now with young Trejo's but I'm with you on everything else she said ah you know they're talking about so Hand playing the point this year and I'm just not a trade Jones guy I think you said backup point guard masquerading as a starter and so yeah I'm I'm feeling everything else she said I'm just not I'm not a trade Jones guy I got you all right let's go to another question from my man Chili Palmer he has a quick question every single time I do this come like chili is like  he's like Old Faithful very reliable which point guard are you targeting and rounds three and four among Fred Van Vleet Cade County named dejounte Murray and Darius Garland do you like that group  so again it's just an awesome question chili much love man um I go to John say first out of these four I love dejounte Murray doc a you've got phrases to go way back as an OG I got phrases to go way back as an OG and Deontay Murray is fantasy gold baby you gotta have threes blocks and steals to win in Spanish he got to have them and he checks all these boxes obviously Big Time steel guy rare with the Steels one point eight one point nine like big time numbers right um helps out with the three ball you know between one and a half and two threes per game like he doesn't kill you he doesn't he's not mass somebody doesn't kill you do you just kind of can stand Pat with the three game but then you get the assist the rebounds the points a pretty good percentage is he seems to get more fish in each year and he's been able to find a really good statistical role next to Trey young did not bring anybody in its going to vulture and change that equation okay I love to John Taylor Murray Kate Cunningham is next should be I don't know doc a 22/7 and 7 right kind of like a LeBron light type of stat line with a bunch of goodies from there he's a defensive minded guy so I do see steals of Garland is next um although he's I don't know I don't know why I the Garland thing is fading for me a little bit docket I would still mess with them in fantasy but I don't know the way Cleveland went out to New York in that Playoff Series has like poisoned me on the calf thing man like I it's just right I still had that bad taste in my mouth right now matter of fact hold on sir  it's still there it's still there okay it's on you to get that day out of my mouth and then lastly Fred Van Vleet docket I mean I'm so over the three for 18 from Fred Van Vleet right I mean we're all again fantasy gold rolling this quest for three balls and steals right in Van Fleet is Elite at three balls and steals but my God man and he's not gonna have as many shots right because you're sharing with Brooke's in green and Shen goon and Smith and amen and tari Eason and I just don't see him jacking like he did in Toronto last year so that's why I got the John take Cade Garland and Van Fleet now the thread being Houston thing is going to be interesting to watch and see how that goes  I feel like he's gonna take a fantasy hit because they're not gonna be playing to win they're gonna be playing to you know hang in there and teach young kids and  it's gonna be sort of strange setup there I think  you know man and Simmons earlier about how good he will  he look I took him with the final pick and that eight man draft I did  something I said I would never do but he does look good and with the last pick of the draft  Mr relevant you get Ben Simmons and Kate this is here  would you take  starting point guard for the Raptors Dennis Schroder at the end of your draft would you take Ben Simmons  again it's a great question I like them both um I I do I I will mess with Schroeder at the right point in my draft and I will mess with Simmons at the right point in my draft between the two I'll take Simmons I think there's more upside we could be I mean the Philly Simmons and he's kind of looking like the Philly Simmons I need to see more but he's kind of looking like that he's saying he's back to the Philly Simmons the Philly Simmons was 15/8 and 8 all right that's gonna be better than any three cats that line the Dennis Schroder puts up Dennis Schroder is not a big steal guy Ben Simmons the question I have he looks very good with his movements right the question I have is quick to which and and you know defensive reactive ability and all of the elite defensive stuff that he had before all the back surgeries I need to see more Ben Simmons in that regard as opposed to glimpses here in the preseason so that's still a work in progress but he will have put potential to block a shot per game and get about a steal and a half games so I say Ben Simmons on this I'd rather roll the dice on him and this is weird Okay I am telling you right now that I am  fair to partly bullish on Anthony Davis Zion Williamson and who's my man that we're just talking about sorry I got I got thrown off um the guy that Ben Simmons and Ben Simmons okay Zion Anthony Davis and Ben Simmons if you ask me this heading in the last year okay I would have said doo doo I'm out on all three okay like they would have been on on my they're dead to me list okay and now I'm fair to partly geeked about all three of them there's reason for it right they're all in great shape they're all heading into sort of prove it Seasons they got a big motivational chip on their shoulder all three of them trying to all the haters and I like that I like the bounce back back Factor do I like betting on teams okay and when I when I give my college football picks I like betting on teams good teams coming off of a loss all right because they're pissed and there's a motivational chip and you got the the regression back to where they should be and all that kind of stuff so I'm feeling all of that was Zion and with Anthony Davis and Ben Simmons this year it is a  yes yes yes  I cannot wait to see how this goes so it's going to be a long summer possibly if they all revert back into their former self I hope you didn't get caught up in the media day he's in the best shape of his life he's put on no it's still watching it you know what I'm saying dockets for I've watched Ben Simmons play and and again it's preseason so you don't know if a guy's really going full octane in 105% right maybe he's going 85% so you know what I mean there's that but he looks good he does he's he had a steal in a run-out jam okay he's hitting Fade Away jump shots out of the post he's coming down and draw deepens and kicking like you look good you does all right yeah one more question and then we're gonna get out of here and then we're gonna figure out how to never have this play happen again because I already did lose my mind  question is demonic bonus  Rick in your mind a top 10 pick head to headlines with bonuses for doubles and triple doubles that's from JP at one fast dog Simon says not for everybody right he doesn't block shots he doesn't  their thing he has holes in his game as far as fantasy goes are you in the bonus guy I am a sabonis guy  10th overall  I don't know feels a little Rich um he doesn't hit threes he doesn't steal and he doesn't block  that is three major hits he's an availability guy played all last year with that jacked up thumb right and super appreciate that I love the I don't know doc what was this line last year 1712 and 7 right let me let me point three point three point three in the in the fantasy gold category right and that's where that's everything I'm sorry man I'm sorry I know he's gonna get you dub dubs is gonna trigger those bonuses and um no I rather take Anthony Davis I would and David was gonna Davis is going to trigger you know not the triple double stuff but the double-double stuff you can have a million double-doubles I I gotta have three blocks and steals it is my predominant thought and games played okay let's add a fourth thing there block Steals and games played it's my predominant thought every single time I draft every pick I made you just described Jaron Jackson Jr to the team I love Jaren Jackson if you're three you're blocks your your steals your games played no job Morant for 25 games like Desmond Bane and JJJ Triple J man I'm pretty fired up about all of it rick we are out of time  this has been amazing I've gotten to hear our entire conversation twice already I will listen to it a third time as I as I time stamp this out  literally hearing everything 10 seconds after you said  as well as live so we got to figure that out we're gonna take a minute to do that right now but the ogs are out Rick thanks for coming in thanks for going to do it again next Thursday I'll be back on Tuesday  with a special guests not sure who would be I might be  I'm not sure yet but I'll be here Tuesday and then Rick and I has always will be here on Thursday
