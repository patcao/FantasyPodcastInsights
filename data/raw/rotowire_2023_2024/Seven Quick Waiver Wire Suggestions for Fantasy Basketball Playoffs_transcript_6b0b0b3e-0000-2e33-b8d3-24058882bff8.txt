welcome to the award-winning RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast brought to you by Rota wires free trial at rotowire.com slash try it's Friday March 28th 2024 Alex barua here with Shannon McKeown and Ken k train Crites  All Aboard it's actually Thursday recording oh yes it is Thursday we're recording a day early tomorrow is a holiday  and yeah I think we'll probably do one more episode one more Friday episode this year next week but today's episode will only be waiver wire We're Not Gonna touch news we're going straight into waiver wire I also conveniently took the under on this podcast length before the show um let's just jump in I am suggesting Max strus who just returned from a three-week absence he's 38% rostered only he was dropped on a ton of leagues understandable but make sure you make sure he's not available especially if you're in a 14 Team league he first came back 19 points he had five threes four rebounds two Steals and 24 minutes again make sure someone even drop him he's ranked about 120th across the entire season there's a lot of up to and down with which juices game partially due to the injuries Cleveland has suffered throughout the year but again someone who should be I think higher than 38% roster special with Cleveland having four games next week  almost everybody's got four games everyone bought Washington Denver San Antonio and Utah with only three everyone else has four so you don't you know  don't get stuck with those 14s but Suzuki's interesting certainly if you need threes right Alex  he need three he's not he hits about two a game you know he's not as good of a 3-point shooter as I think people think he is but he also gets more system more rebounds Than People sort of assume from him so he's pretty well-rounded player can step into more minutes when like a variety of players on Cleveland get hurt so it's a good option there  I'm also going to suggest some three-point Shooters as my first recommendation we're going to Boston for Sam Houser and Peyton fast PP Pritchard Houser is 23% roster on Yahoo Pritchards 42% Boston also has four games next week look the Celtics have already locked in first in the East that's already clinched with roughly 10 to 11 games left they're six and a half games ahead of all the Western teams to make sure they get home court advantage in the finals should they make it to the finals and Drew holiday has a legitimate shoulder issue unlike a lot of the other Celtics who they're just resting but there's going to be a ton of minutes for reserves Houser and Pritchard and a lot of starts as the Celtics really give everyone a rotating break if you will heading into the playoffs Pritchard a little more assists than house her house are though decent Steals and blocks for a small  forward they're both going to score the both going to hit a lot of Threes so Sam Houser and or Payton Pritchard are my first suggestion from the Celtics I like it Ken my first suggestion I'm gonna go to the other side of the country  take a Celtics rival really hatchimal the forward for Los Angeles Lakers he's been a top 50 player over the past week he is 40% rostered on Yahoo I know I've talked about him at least a couple times in this segment over the past month or two he's locked in as the starry as one of the starting forwards for the Lakers and he's really picked up his production as of late over the past four games really is averaging 17.8 points nine rebounds 2.33 pointers in over 32 minutes per contest if you need help in those categories he will give it to you you know similar to macros I've I feel like really should be rostered in more more than 40% giving how long he's been in the storyline up and his production the last couple weeks so go snatch him up if you're in a 12 or 14 Team league and he's available his production can be a little bit up and down but like Shannon said he has been really efficient lately double digits and double digit scoring and nine in the past ten games 60% for the field 48% from three and like Ken alluded to with the Celtics like the Lakers don't have the same sort of leeway to rest guys but at some point there's a potential that they just lock up a seed right and then Hachi Wars a guy that can get more minutes in the situations that's something always keep in mind at this time of year  as the playoffs draw closer my next suggestion Lakers are two and a half back from avoiding the plane but they've also got two you know they're in 9th with the Suns and Kings ahead of them at some point it's pretty clear they're going to be destined for the plane and you're right Russell folks and we saw this week I mean they've already rested I believe LeBron and Anthony Davis I'm back back nights one one each night arrested on Tuesday and Wednesday  yeah there's still a lot of jockeying from the special from the fort at night and the West I mean the the Lakers are look I mean there's not a lot of the Season left but they're five and a half back from the four seed you know the Clippers Pelicans Mavericks he seems are really bunched up so keep an eye on the standings because that's gonna dictate that's true a lot going forward um my second suggestion  Jonathan Isaac of the Orlando Magic someone who has certainly been suggested on the show before as well 15% rostered yeah season High 25 points March 23rd against the Kings his past nine games 11 points five rebounds 2.2 stocks per game he's played at least 20 minutes in four of the past six games look we know the story with Isaac anything other than more than 15 points for him is can probably considered an outburst but he can't get you two to six stocks and then he giving game and it should not surprise you and I think Orlando  yeah um and I think I think Orlando would like to ramp him up a little bit more as they had into the postseason because he is someone that can  I think really I don't want to say swing a series for them but the Pentagon on the matchup like you said you said Isaac out there for 20 minutes to guard the opposing teams Best Wing that could change a game for you so I think they want to make sure he's ready for that  c is a healthy Isaac that's always the issue a healthy Isaac could frustrated Jayson Tatum or somebody like that in a playoff series for sure you questions just minutes how many how many minutes do they trust those knees before they implode that is a great question  yeah go to your next suggestion Ken we're going to New York for Miles McBride  he started the last five games as the Knicks go small with OG on and Obi out he's had three 26 or more point games in five of those starts in fact his last five games he's averaged 21.6 points almost four assists  over four and a half made threes well shooting 55% from the field 91% from the free throw line and less than half a turnover a game so his last 14 days he ranked 61st and 9 category League's for per game output we don't Julius Randle we're just here in crickets newswise unless Alex you have any info on Randall coming back  and know and and oh John I know that elbow I can't imagine they're going to play him in back-to-backs before the playoffs let alone we're not really sure we know he's out I don't know if he's scheduled out for the next Knicks game he didn't play last night I don't know what his stats we don't we don't quite know yet day today but we don't know what on an obese coming back and they're sure not gonna push him have to rush him back too early once already so I love a lot of minutes if you need some efficient shooting and points I love a lot of minutes from McBride who is only rostered in 35% of Yahoo leaks  yeah I would argue miles McBride for as long as in an obese out is should be the top free agent pickup someone who is not the top free agent pickup but but a player I like moving forward to money tomorrow forward for the Portland Trail Blazers 6% Ross rostered he's been a top 75 player over the past week nine consecutive starts many of those filling in for Jeremy Grant to you know like Anna Obi where not really sure when Jeremy Grant is going to return over the past four games kamara's average 14 points 5.8 rebounds and one point eight three-pointers in 34 minutes for game again I mean Portland has been running out a lot of their reserves you have grants Miss time Simon's missed time plenty of other players eight and this time so tomorrow will probably be in the starting lineup moving forward he could jump between the three and the four which he has done in recent games as long as he's starting though I think he's worth a stream option in a weekly League daily League whatever the format may be  in Grants Miss nine games in a row  11 of the last 12  kind of think they're shutting him down  yeah tomorrow look tomorrow is he's kind of like a Money Ball 3D player takes a lot of a shots at The Rim takes a lot of his shots from the corners I think a better Defender than his numbers would say you know you look at his number since the All-Star break its 0.8 Steals and half of block but there are a lot of games you know two steals two blocks three steals two blocks here and there so he can have some Boom games once in a while especially if he gets hot from three  Alex who's your long shot bloodshot is a key on Ellis although I should mention that Jonathan Isaac also qualifies as a long shot but yeah Keon Ellis of the Sacramento Kings 20% rostered Kevin herder out for the remainder of the Season Keon Ellis has stepped in I watched a couple Kings games he's awesome man amazing Defender they trust him in the back court next to deer and fox kind of stealing kind of stole Davey on Mitchell's role to an extent it's a earlier in the season Mitchell's able to play now because herders out and try Lyle's his time as well but Kiana Ellis has started seven of the past nine games low usage player 8 points a game on 55% shooting before percent from three good from Deep three rebounds about two dimes but the  it's all about the defense 1.8 steals 1.1 blocks across the past nine games he had a five block game against the Memphis Grizzlies the other night although you know everybody kind of does that they're one of the most block teams in the NBA well yeah he's someone who if you need defense like if you're if you're thinking about like the Matisse thigh Bull type the even the Jonathan Isaac type Kiana says another guy fits that mold well I don't think lso the kings are in 8th but only game and a half out of getting out of the plane I don't think Kiana else is a guy unlike some others we've mentioned that needs people to sit to see big minutes he's gonna play frankly regardless of the king's situation don't you think Alex  yeah I think so because I you know he's gonna be a part of their playoff rotation he's gonna play Big bands for them that hurt us out and then also if Fox sits out or something else that's more minutes for key on so it's kind of a it's kind of a Best of Both Worlds now I don't think his usage is that scalable I don't think he's gonna take a ton more shots or be asked to handle the little bit more that be more of like a Malik monk thing but yes more minutes could be on the horizon Forum yeah we we discussed Keon Ellis a little bit last week as well and really what the king's seemed to be doing I I believe Keon Alice even if if heard her were healthy I think Keon Ellis would have the app might have had the opportunity to hold on to the starting gig he really gives him a defensive presence that they need within the steering lineup and essentially his minutes are going to fluctuate you know between low to mid-20s to low to mid-30s depending on the need for that game if they need more of a defensive presence he's going to get those minutes if they need more often Firepower monks gonna come in and play extra minutes that game um well my long shot this week is the opposite he's a guy that has a lot of upside only if the starters get benched and that's Luke Cornett of the Boston Celtics again we mentioned Boston's clinched the East there's six and a half games up on all the teams in the west Boston's going to be benching Their Stars a lot over these next 10 11 games specially The Fragile Chris stops porzingis and the ancient owl Horford which means a lot of minutes for Luke kornet even Xavier Tillman's got a knee issue so again I think a lot of minutes for carnett during the Silly Season of meaningless games for the Celtics I really like cornet if you're in a daily transaction league and you see the note like oh bringing us and Horford or both out let's play Cornett tonight in the five starts Luke kornets had this season he averages a double-double granted 10 points 10 rebounds but almost  two and a half blocks while shooting 69% from the field 100% from the charity stripe any still get you almost three and a half assists  so special if you're in a daily League I like Luke kornet as a silly season Plug and Play option he's going to have nights with big minutes yeah and then absolutely DFS stud in those five starts averaging 35 fantasy points per um my long shot  is a long time favorite of the Pod a guy who we unfortunately have not bring up yet this season Brandon Clark forward center for the Memphis Grizzlies 3% rostered  Clark made his season debut on Wednesday against the Lakers it was great to see he played 21 minutes I was surprised that he was able to top 21 minutes in a season debut he finished with six points five boards and one steal you know my my attraction to Brandon Clarke has always been his defensive upside I believe he's a guy who can go out there and get you know a couple blocks of Steel really contribute on that end decent rebounder as well it's just a matter of minutes and Memphis you know we've seen with Memphis this year they're rotation they probably have had the most five man starting lineups unique lineups in the history of the NBA this year absolutely Bonkers my guess is he'll take it slow with with Brandon Clark they don't want to it they don't want to just throw him to the fire after missing the vast majority of the season but his minutes should pick up down the stretch and he's Earth is stream if you're in a deep enough League where you're looking for for some defensive stats Clark was out for over a year you'd think they'd want to boost his confidence a little with some strong meaningless games where yeah he cleans the glass and gets some gimme points I still believe I still believe rui rui and Brandon Clark former teammates at Gonzaga oh right there you go yeah all tied together here that we go to the clothes already  we can I was about to throw in a fun Factor Grizzlies started 21 players this season 21 different players for the Memphis Grizzlies have drawn to start wild we don't have a can you tell where that ranks it must lead the league this show I don't I don't have that up but I would imagine that and probably right probably like 1 4  yeah we can wrap it up Ken do you have a quote for us or we just we just three car fantasy Trainwreck has hit the end of the line good luck in your fantasy playoffs
