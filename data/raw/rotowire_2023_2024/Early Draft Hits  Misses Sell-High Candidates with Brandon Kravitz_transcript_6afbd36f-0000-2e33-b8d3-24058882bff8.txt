welcome into a Wednesday edition of the RotoWire fantasy basketball podcast there we go Nick Whalen Brady Kravitz here with you on this Wednesday morning Brandon normally we would Jump Right In we would have a big NBA slate to discuss but no basketball on Tuesday night the NBA take it election night off but you don't know what that means we get a 14 game slate coming at us on Wednesday nights so good luck I mean I have some daily lineups rated where I have like too many guys active and I have like good players sitting on the bedside 14 games is too many it's too many to keep track of it is it really is I hate him I'm not gonna complain about it but I will say I personally prefer I think my favorite night in the NBA's when we have like four games I think that's the perfect sweet spot for me yeah where I can I can move around a little bit but I can also I'm just so much better when it comes to setting a daily lineups or Underdog props or betting on I don't even know where to start so I mean of course it's we had yesterday off and they just legalized they're opened up illegal sports book in the State of Florida where I reside so the fact that they did that on a Tuesday where there's no NBA was a cruel sick joke and so I'm ready to hammer it today I got a couple of games in mind but I'm with you it's almost too much to even wrap your head around  yeah I'm looking at that you taught Indiana games specifically I know last night I was kind of doing some research for for this late and there's like I think the totals I got the 245 and that one I mean that's like two of the fastest Pace teams in the league two of the worst defenses in the league going at it but yeah it's a little overwhelming it's a little overwhelming especially you know I'm on the radio you know from six to nine my time so all these games are tipping off you know I'm trying to keep track of what's going on I'm trying to talk football on the radio and you know which is just a whole different level of distracting I want more games in the late window and I know most people would disagree oh somebody States up until like 12:30 1 a.m. Central like you know it's great Portland Sacramento I watch a lot of West Coast teams but I I would like it it's kind of like the way they bounce the NFL schedule you know where we got all these games starting early and then they only put two or three in the late window like I like to see a little more balanced you know I I guess in some ways just as a viewer I wish the NBA cared less about people actually being in their Arena because then they could do what baseball does and they could put games on in the middle of the day Major League Baseball just said we do not care if you arrive at our stadiums we're gonna put games on whenever the hell we want as a viewer I love that the baseball season is great because you've got games on in the middle of the day and less it's MLK Day you don't really get that in in the association you're totally right and we have the jobs that we have an enable us to watch games at all hours so we should acknowledge that but okay it's fantastic like that's one of my favorite sports days of the year I mean you wake up you got the Hawks play in that like 11:30 a.m. the Bucks have been playing early the last few years but anyway that is that is neither here nor there can I can I cut in just a what I you and I the first time you and I are doing a full-length podcast together so this is all so partially a learning experience for the two of us for that same reason what you just said about MLK Day where do you land as a big football fan too on the fact that the NFL is tried to take over Christmas this is it's just something I have to understand about the mentality of Nick Whalen I get it from the NBA's perspective that there is some encroaching being done but I just love football so much that I don't care and I'll watch both you know this is a this is a two TV household in the living room yeah we got those two TVs for a reason there's only one NBA game on at one so you can you know we can find ways to balance it out I mean the bigger issue for me is you know trying to like sneak away from from my family or my now wife's I guess family oh yeah congratulations yeah thank you that's I think that's the first time I've said that but he was like I you know I got an iPad a couple of years ago that's been huge for just like you know hold it under the table I could sneakily watch things but no I don't have a problem with the NFL tried to take it over I mean if anything it's like you really need more money you know it's like could you just have this one but I also feel like Christmas day like a lot of Christmas for the NBA Nick and frustrates me as a man I get it the NFL boy let the NBA have it Christmas Day peaked for the MBA in like 2016 17 when there were those like insane calves warriors battles like I I'm the biggest NBA fan I know and I'm like not as excited for Christmas Day games as I used to be like that like when they would reveal the NFL I don't know I think it's just it's wrapped into this whole kind of devaluing of the regular season thing  all right well I'm done commandeering the podcast you go ahead well what we want to talk about and as always you know second half of the show will hit comments so feel free to throw those in you know on YouTube We love your comments we will answer as many of them as we can later in the show but we want to do a couple segments here talking about early draft regrets Brandon where we're two weeks into the season still in my opinion too early to panic on just about everybody but you know if you if you took Pascal Seiko for example you're not feeling great about it and I am in that boat I will tell you that you know if you took reach backseat with the 55th pick in your draft and you now you got yourself a guy who might be a top 20 player the rest of the season you're feeling great so we'll talk about some of the players that we missed out on guys we wish we had more shares of some of the players that we hit on and then just some of the general surprises one way or the other but I do want to start with Maxie and there's there's almost not much to say here right it's like I'm not really surprised with what Max he's doing you know if you or somebody who thought James Harden was going to be traded and you took Tyrese Maxey great I also think where he was going in drafts like even if hardened on the Sixers I still think Tyreese actually has a path to being a top 50 player like I just looking back I'm like why did I not just take it with like the 45th pick I'm not saying he had to take him in the second round you know his cost was so low still that I just looked back and think man what a missed opportunity I mean specifically in playing fantasy basketball I think it's so much about once you get past the first two rounds where the players that you should draft are pretty obvious and you probably shouldn't Veer too much from that you just have to get your guys and and I think the Tyrese Maxey path the ranking didn't really reflect what kind of value he was gonna have because the ranking for Tyrese Maxey was still somewhat James Harden playing in Philly was still somewhat baked into that so he was a guy I think for us that follow it regularly you knew hard and wasn't going to be a part of the mix here long-term and so if you did end up getting Maxi on your squad good for you it's paying dividends not only is he scoring he's giving you the assists he shoots at a pretty good clip as well so he's definitely somebody that I tried to Target as much as I could just having the confidence the James Harden was going to move on at some point a guy for me that that I was taking late graphs in fact one of them was the the Vegas draft that we did at Circus a RotoWire crew was shade on Sharp and then I think that he's a good example of of what I'm talking about I I know in the moment and we didn't have you know we were doing this sort of old school we didn't have computers and rankings in front of us so I'm kind of just going off the off the Dome and you're looking at the board full disclosure this is being done at the stadium swim pool at Circa and we basically had to like go and like heard everybody when it was their turn to pick this was like the least scientific draft that I've ever been a part of but nonetheless it was still a pretty sharp room well and I and I blurted out shade on Sharp probably three to four rounds before he should go and I am not regretting it Nick he is been outstanding and and continues to get opportunities with scoot Henderson now missing some time so he's definitely one of those guys I feel like I sort of maybe even backed into that one  well I think everybody's going down with the biggest thing right it was actually was actually off to a relatively slow start the first couple games of the year and it was such a small sample that who knows and the Blazers were getting blown out but now you know it was good missing time and it seemed like a pretty much immediately one Simon's went out sharp was playing like 38 to 42 minutes right away and I think that's gonna continue to be the case for the next several weeks so even if and when his role we're regresses a bit while Simon Says back like you're getting so much value early on that it's probably gonna be worth it and yeah he's somebody I wish I would have had a little bit more of you know chat homegrown and Victor web Miama I have some regrets about I still you know the reason that I stayed away from both of those guys is I just worry about games played I worry about the long term but honestly both of them look better than I expected both of them you know women Yamaha special is basically met value you know right now he's like the 23rd ranked player per game in in eight categories that's right about where is ADP was it got pushed a little bit higher late in draft season but you're certainly not disappointed if you drafted weapon Jama and you also look at like half of his games he's you know been and valid trouble or played under 30 minutes you know I think if you if you kind of prorate out like all right what if he's actually playing 32 3033 minutes per game I think that was gonna be just fine let me check homegrown Winx ahead of weapon llaman in fantasy he's the 13th player on the season and you know you could get chat homegrown quite a bit later in drafts and you could weaponize his number was 52.4 and I mean if he stays healthy I think he's gonna have a really good chance to be a top 25 guy all year  I would completely agree with that he's looked outstanding and I think what he's giving you and in the passing game you know he was gonna block shots he can score from everywhere it's so he's definitely a guy that when we saw we saw flashes of it in summer league and in the preseason and he's just following through with that he's someone that I loved in the draft process when he was coming out with the magic having that top pick I was all in on Chet Holmgren so to see to see him playing like this already after missing a season which was really unfortunate I'm just happy I'm happy for him and and for those that the believed in what he could do for women I think we just didn't expect him to to show out the way that he has already going up against top tier competition you kind of figured that it would take some time and in and it was it was slow out of the gate in terms of like that first  game and getting into foul trouble and those type of issues but he's number two in the league in blocked shots right now what Toe to Toe with Kevin Durant and at times looked like the better player it's really remarkable I see you sort of scaling over there but he had a hell of a night 38 points against KD and he made them look like a child  yeah man and I feel like we still haven't even seen like close to what we're going to see highlights Wise from women Yama you know he had that that Baseline reverse dunk that everybody you know kind of blew up on social media and I was like Yeah by weapon yeah I'm a standards like I don't know that's like a seven out of 10 like I think we're gonna see some some absolutely wild stuff as the season goes along again we thank everybody for the comments we will go back and hit those later in the show if you guys have any any draft regrets any players that you've hit on you know guys you jumped 80P for that have worked out so far let us know what we'll touch on those but we'll go back and hit the rest of those questions later in the show Brandon who are some other players that you regret missing out on so far  yeah I think I didn't get enough of Walker Kessler he was somebody that I really liked last year go back to that the block shot category somebody that you just knew was gonna bring it I probably should have moved him up in terms of my rankings I love what I'm seeing from a start-ups and this guy's got a few steals a game in his bag that doesn't seem to be going away so those are a couple of guys that I look at and say I just wasn't really willing to pull the trigger but they've I've been outstanding  yeah I saw Thompson is a big one for me I mean it's one right I'm not I'm not sitting back and like you know just ruining my giraffes where I did not you know go way above 80 for us our Thompson it all along it you know I was on the record saying I like a star better than a men just because of the situation and it clearly that's been born out we'll see like Detroit I still don't like oh yeah bug manovich still doesn't play like I hope that they don't you know shoehorn him into this rotation for 30 minutes once he's back but you know Jane Ivy playing like 20 minutes a game it's been huge for us our tops and who they clearly trust more at this point and you know the feels on the blocks numbers have been huge I mean that's that's kind of carrying him toward  borderline top 40 Value so far the rebounds I mean for a guy who basically plays Judy garbage ball forward to be to be bringing down nine boards a game on a team that has a ton of big man too that's the other thing it's like they're a competition for rebounds and it's our tops and is still one of the best rebounders if not the best at his position right now field goal percentage you know in Rhode Island League that's gonna be an issue we knew it would be a problem he's down at like 40% but he's been a much better free throw shooter than expected I'm curious to see if that's sustains he's at 82% right now yeah and another guy that I was just looking at here Nick vujevich who I'm quite familiar with his days in Orlando I just I think we almost get bored with his production it's he's like 17 and 10 19 and 10 every single year but he just continues to produce in such a such a predictable sort of way go back to a conversation that we had a couple of weeks ago about guys with that nice safe floor you need those guys on your roster I don't want constant movement in and out and you always know what you're getting from boots and I would just pass on him every single time out of boredom  well that's what I thought I was getting with soccer right you're like oh you know I might not have the highest healing I'm not somebody who was waiting for the Seahawk rant man he's killing me he's killing me irritable he's been so bad he's I mean the volume down they used to rate is down like seven percentage points yeah even when they used to raise been there he's been inefficient I do think it turns around to some degree but I think this this is looking like it's Scotty Barnes team at this point and to me that's what it's learning absolutely now you get to tonight I'm not I'm not selling Pascal siakam yet I am I have my hand firmly placed on the on the panic button but I have it pressed it yet let's see what he does against the Dallas Mavericks and then if he can't produce against this team that really has no interest in playing defense then then we can start to to create I think I might start to press down on a little bit so tonight's important for siak

Brandon we got some chatter in the chat about Jordan Poole and you know our guy J is asking will Jordan Poole get any better than where he is right now I think if you're somebody who invested in Jordan Poole which I really did not and it wasn't it wasn't by choice like if he was there you know at or below ADP I had no problem taking him but if you did it hasn't exactly worked out so far you know it he's the 63rd player overall and Rodeo league so it has a bit a complete disaster but the thing that I think really stands out not only with pool but with Kyle kuzma with Daniel Gafford with some of these main guys for the Wizards is the minutes I mean I thought George pool could lead the league in minutes like that was conceivable right and he's at 28 minutes a game part of it is they've been completely blown out in half of their game so far but at the same time it's like you know it's the Wizards right like Jordan Poole is is kind of your future like even if you're down 30 I don't think you have to take Jordan Poole out of the game so I think it's been it's been frustrating and even the games that have been relatively close for the Wizards you know we're not seeing him extended to the degree that we thought well I mean it's getting better though you know it's scored 23 points in his in his last outing you gotta like that it's been pretty good from Deep you know you're gonna get that sort of production from him I just think this is the this is the high variance of Jordan Poole playing on a really bad team I am I disappointed in what he's done thus far absolutely but it's just not surprising he's on he's on a bad team they're playing Sandlot basketball right now and it's gonna look really ugly at times they've had a tough schedule Boston Philly Miami Atlanta so I would just say practice some patience when it comes to Jordan Poole he's gonna frustrate you at times just kind of close your eyes and and wait for the accumulation at the end of the season I think you'll look back and go man that was really anxiety provoking but but he delivered at the end of the day  yeah you just got to know what you're signing up for which Jordan exactly that's exactly it he's a high variance player playing on a team that's awful why I also think the dream of like wait Jordan Poole win the scoring title like I don't think that's happening unless this this minutes Trend really reverses and like look I still think he's gonna have like 550 point games you know eventually they're gonna be competitive enough and the training wheels will be off and he'll have those boom nights but I think night to night it's just looking like it's not going to be quite as consistent as we would have hoped you know James Harden I want to ask you about him he's got one game under his belt so far so we don't have a sample here they said he'd be on a minutes limit the other night he played 31 minutes gave you 17 and six shot it well from the field obviously he's always been somebody who's kind of a cheat code in terms of free throws at the end of draft season like I did a couple drafts the last day before the regular season started and James Harden was going in like the mid to late 50s like and that includes in my my nfkc where you typically don't you know people are willing to take chances on guys like hardened in that format and even He Slipped their knowing what we now know that he was able to successfully forces way to the Clippers really only missed like five or six games to begin the year you regret you know not taking James Harden not being more aggressive or were you aggressive in still targeting him despite the cloud of uncertainty that was hanging over him during draft season know I thought he was still thought he was being overdrafted even though he's got a great history and in terms of putting up numbers and in this fantasy Department still wasn't really sure how it was all going to work and what and how he was gonna fit with the Clippers and we also I mean we didn't know I we thought that he would end up with the clippers but you didn't know where he was gonna end up and I don't really want to venture into that level of mystery there was all so still a chance that Philadelphia just sat him down and said we can't find a trade partner and Daryl Morey was gonna play hardball with him so I want to know part of it just dealing with that headache and a guy that was potentially gonna miss a lot of time now that he is with the Clippers and he's already put up a decent stat line in his first game at the Garden the other night I regretted a little bit probably probably  was in hindsight being drafted at the right value but at the time I just wasn't it wasn't an investment I was willing to take on I'm curious to get your thought on this because it seemed like the biggest impact was Paul George ironically enough I just figured James Harden would come in facilitate facilitate facilitate and that is not what happened yeah I we talked about his you know props on the NBA Show on Sirius XM NBA Radio on Monday and you know the one that I really liked was his assist because I thought the same thing I thought he'd come in and just kind of float around do James Harden things which you know in Philly he was not a guy that was consistently pushing 25 30 points per game like I think he kind of moved into this this new phase of his career and no longer wanted to try to lead the league in scoring and instead was just gonna be the assistant guy he still went over I think the prop was five and a half he had six assists on Monday but yeah you're right it's too early to say that oh man this is gonna be a huge drain on Paul George fantasy value I still think PG's gonna be fine I mean it's probably it's a slight reduction across the board for for guys like PG Kawaii Russell Westbrook to me is ultimately the guy that's gonna suffer long-term I know they're trying to start them both right now  I just I don't think that's I don't think that's gonna be sustainable you can't you got like the worst shooter in the NBA in Russell Westbrook you got a complete non shooter in zubac I don't think you can that's not really the recipe right if James Harden is going to be your primary ball handler and look Kawaii and Paul George or both great driving kick players as well you need Shooters around those guys and I think eventually they're gonna move off of Westbrook in the starting lineup but I still think it could be productive Off the Bench but Russell's somebody that I'm just kind of done with in fantasy that makes sense and I see that we have we've got questions coming in about Russell Westbrook a guy that I think is very he's always been sort of format dependent when it comes to Fantasy and now the even in the format where he was thriving in a points League I'm just not sure that he's giving you enough I think it's I play in almost exclusively Rota leaks so that's why I say I'm out like on points whatever special if it's your league doesn't do turnovers you know if it's a points leave with a categories you know perfect that's fine you know if most points obviously don't value percentages so you know in that case I'm still okay with him you know if you're if you're realistic about what is expectations are what is realistic expectation then when he because he's probably gonna settle into a bench role in not too long  no Russell Westbrook and I think he's still gonna play like himself when he's out there and the Clippers you know they shed so Much Death in that trade that like if you're asking Russell Westbrook to still play 27 to 30 minutes a game and lead your bench unit like I actually think you might be in some ways more productive in that role where you know right now he's like very clearly the number four option in the starting lineup but if you're if you're staggering him and he's only out there with one of those other three guys I think that's actually better for him yeah I don't know how much that's gonna I guess that's the way that they probably tie Loop probably draws this up is that Russell Westbrook comes off the bench but it's not like it's just him out there yeah it's him with Paul George or Tim with Kawhi Leonard but  the fact that they couldn't come through the other night the Nicks have been struggling mightily I think that's just a symptom of of trying to work somebody into your rotation that is a heavy usage guy like James Harden so that's it was one of those spots it was a mysterious line the other night because the I think the Clippers are only favored by one and they've been the far superior team this year those are the kind of things you got to look out for  um where were you at on Albertsons we got a question from from Jack here we love the the bol bol Aviary and it feels like he's playing really well so far if you're in a roto League he ranks like 50th overall and that's because he's a terrible free throw shooter although he's taking a little over three a game so it's not it's not just killing you you know if you was taking five six seven that'd be a much more severe situation but you know the county stats have been fantastic for Shane and the only thing is you know last year Brandon he was basically a one block per game player and he has one total block on the year so it's been weird like the points assists rebounds those have been awesome yeah I think in a lot of ways he's been the the Rocket's best player in a lot of nights but the defensive numbers in the free throw percentage are kind of offsetting what he's doing in those other categories right yeah the passing is there he's actually he's got a couple of steals a night so far as well I think he's sort of been I guess kind of what you signed up for right I mean this is um I think this is the Alpine you kind of thought you were gonna get this is the problem with drafting Rockets players and to go back to the original conversation we were having about regret I thought Jabari Smith was gonna take this big leap and this this was the concern side of that sort of draft pick and I think Shane is experiencing some of that as well there's only one ball to go around Dillon Brooks Dillon Brooks wants to get his Fred Van Vleet is going to patrol the offense so it's it's kind of hard to it's hard to predict night tonight and I think those two guys in the front quarter kind of seeing the brunt of maybe a diminished role but I also don't think for Shane going up it's not a concern I'm concerned about Jabari Smith I think Shane going is fine kind of  where he's at another big Miss for me Jalen Duren you know his ADP you could get him in like you know the 110 to 115 range in a lot of drafts I mean so far he has been a top 35 guy he's you know playing under 30 minutes a game like my big concern was man they have all these big man they're gonna try to try to get a look at Wiseman they're still cleaning just some hope with Marvin Bagley Isaiah Stewart I just thought it would be a little bit convoluted you know you worry about the free throw percentage actually hasn't been that bad for him this year is that like 73% obviously Ultra Elite in terms of field goal percentage pretty much everything is a dunker a layup you know he's not not blocking shots at like an extremely high rate for how big and how athletic he is 1.3 per game so far but you know the passing a couple around too we saw flashes of this last season but he's averaging almost three assists per game obviously gonna be a monster on the on the boards you know almost 15 points per game so far as well and I think it's gonna be sustainable right I mean James Westman James why has been is not gonna be in this rotation you know the only game I think he's played the season is when do was out and yeah I think they pretty clearly recognize that during the center of the future so is he going to finish top 35 on the year probably not but even if you regresses to like that 50 60 overall range I mean you're still getting massive value there yeah I really like watching him play he knows exactly what kind of player he is he's super mature for his age and if you look at the just where he's kind of thriving near the basket 28 in made twos on the year so far I mean so that he's hovering around players like Jalen Brunson Jaron Jackson Jr mikal Bridges Tyler hero so you're talking about some fantasy Superstars definitely a guy that I it wasn't even like I was low on during I think I just over there are certain guys at that point in the draft that you can't love everybody and you just end up there's the hi guys the low guys and then the just the overlooked group and I think during fell into that for me I agree that I mean that has to be if you don't have one on your team  you've got to be regretting that one we're talking about a lot of the things that we did wrong do you have any any players two weeks in in your back pocket where you're like man I just completely nailed that that was aggressive in targeting him and it's looking like it's gonna work out well I was a total Victor Romania Mark so that that one's that one's working out great Donovan Mitchell was somebody that I targeted at the top of drafts I'm a magic homer so this is partially for paying dividends for that reason but Cole Anthony has been outstanding coming off of the magic bench and he's actually playing better defense then we've ever given him credit for and quite frankly that he's ever deserved he had to block shots just the other night at Amway against the Dallas Mavericks won that he pinned against the backboard which was awesome and definitely definitely feel good about that selection so those like Shane on Sharp Victor woman Yama Donovan Mitchell Cole Anthony drafting Cole not just having him on my team but specifically  taking him ahead of some of the other guys that I saw drafted in front of him like Anthony black who is getting his opportunities right now but those are kind of the guys at the top of my list what about you oh you know I feel like I haven't had a ton of like wow what a Steel type of type of pics I actually I got CJ McCollum pretty late in my nfbc it was feeling awesome about that he had looked great but you know that has that has collapsed pun intended for at least the next several weeks and we'll see hopefully CJ McCollum is back soon I think he missed like six-ish weeks last time he dealt with this in 2021 so you know it's not anything major long-term but you know Rudy gobert was somebody that I was in on and you know overall he ranks barely inside the top 100 so I wouldn't say it's like a great value but I actually like what I've seen from gobert so far I think he looks like he's gonna ingratiated a lot better with this team and Minnesota's been the best defensive team in the league so far he's up to 2.2 blocks on the year which is a nice improvement over last season like I drafted it for the blocks first and foremost and the rebounds and and those are both been there the field goal percentage is kind of the issue right now like he's never gonna be a high assist player obviously he's never gonna be a great  asset for free throw percentage he's always gonna hurt you there but you know in his peak days in Utah I mean he was like 65 close to 70% from the field and he's down at 53 right now so that's that's been a little bit worrisome but you know if you were targeting gobert and thinking that there was any sort of bounce back here like I I still feel pretty confident about just how he's looked at in terms of the eye test yeah in Minnesota's playing well I think last year we expected it sometimes we expect these things to gel quicker than they're actually going to in reality and that trade looked like a disaster I don't think that's necessarily the case anymore look at what they were able to do the other night they beat the Boston Celtics first team to do so and Rudy gobert is definitely been playing a role in that so the stats are going to follow this team's playing well right now  yeah market end was another guy for me you know he's not really exceeding where he was drafted just because he was going so high but feel pretty comfortable even with Utah looking like they're gonna be a bad team that he's going to replicate what he did last season you know I mean we really only had one year of the sample of him being an elite fantasy player so I think there was some question of like all right is this a fluke like he's been he's a pretty average to below average player for like the first five years of his career but you know he's basically looked the part so far all right well we'll hit a few more questions in the chat here in a second but got some message just passed along from rival fantasy and

is one of his big hits he got him with pick number 36 that's right about 80P for Desmond Bane I think there was a little bit of hesitancy just because it still it still feels to be it's like you don't think of Desmond Bane it's like a superstar level player but when you take into account John Moran missing 25 games you know the fact that does Bane is pretty clearly their best Creator their best shooter even though Memphis has been a disaster so far in terms of wins and losses that is paying off means a top 15 weeks yeah he's got three or four I'm sorry three Thirty point games in his last four outings so they're losing but he's putting up numbers you kind of figured that would be the case because offensively it is a one-man show in Memphis and that's where when it kind of works it serving two masters here and that they they can't they  can't generate enough offense to win games but Desmond beans good enough to support you in fantasy so that's where you know he's he's coming through for you will it last when John comes back I think the efficiency probably gets better but the overall volume certainly going to take a downtick I think it's up in some ways it's a math equation right where if Desmond Bane gives you 25 to 30 Games as a top 15 player and then he gives you the rest of the season as like the 35th best player like that's still fine right I mean right have you have such a long Runway 25 games is a third of the Season you know so I think even when Morant comes back like yeah he's gonna regress a little bit but unless he completely drops off a cliff which I don't think is gonna happen you you're getting what you paid for for that first third of the season and then you expect a little bit of a drop off after that you know Jack asks any regrets if you drafted Austin Reeves where do you think he will end up by the end of the year I'm not really regretting it at this point I I think you know Reeves is actually played really well the last couple of games you've got off to a really slow start felt like everybody who played for Team USA got off to a bad start absolutely you know Reeves was going in like the mid-80s so unless you really jumped ATP I don't think you're you're regretting that all that much but he's the 98th right player right now and Roto League's the field goal percentage just gonna rise you know he had a couple bad shooting games early on that are that are kind of sinking that right now you know the free throw percentage should get better as well everything else to me has been fine he was one and a half steals per game is great you know it's five rebounds four assists per game we'd like to see a little more scoring out of Austin Reeves you know 14 points per game seems a little bit low I just think the Lakers need to tighten up this rotation a bit when we need to see we need to see way less D'Angelo Russell we probably need to see less of Cam reddish who Clank the wide open game winner the other night I get some Miami Heat but with Reeves now I'm not I'm not really concerned I think you are there's a pretty good chance at Austin Reeves ends up EX eating you know his ADP I think he could pretty easily be a top 70 guy in 31% from 3-point range so far and the concern there and he didn't play that much relative to what he did last year we really became a star in his role type of player for the LA Lakers but he was a 31% three-point shooter and his first year in the NBA jumped up to 40% last year and now it's a very limited sample size he's back down to 31% the concern is that last year was the outlier and that that's not really who he is it's not fair to make that determination yet but that would be the concern I think you want to see this team get a healthy and that's gonna help him in terms of his facilitation he's a great passer I don't think the numbers are jumping off the page but yeah if you're talking about top 70 he should be able to to finish in that range but I think people that were drafting him just because of the star that he became last year might have been expecting a little bit more out of  him on that note Brooks asks would you trade Malcolm Brogden for Austin Reeves I think I would I think I would I don't know that Malcolm Brogden is going to be remaining on this Blazers team but it's been a good start so far no he's kind of the the Elder Statesman on what's otherwise just a pretty bad roster but you know despite that it again kind of depends on format like in Roto leaks he's closer to the 90th ranked player right now like he's only he's like less than a round ahead of Austin Reeves and it feels like Reeves has played really badly and it feels like frog is played really well so even if you think Brogden sticks around in Portland like I I would try to capitalize on his hot start you know the thing that's holding him back right now is the field goal percentage you know points he ranks ranks way higher but you know he's at 39% for the field right now that number probably comes up but I would I would make that deal I think I'd rather have reach what about you yeah I think you're right in terms of the it depends a lot with type of League you're in because if you talk about just even in he's scoring a lot more than I thought he would with the Blazers and maybe the scoot Henderson and Anthony Simons injury is a factor in that but he scored as many points as quite Leonard and Zion Williamson and so far this year that probably when you say that out loud is that something that really seems like it's gonna hold up well no but I'm also there is a little bit concern for me when it comes to us and Reeves so I I feel like you're sort of just I don't know that you're actually getting better with that deal that that's my problem could you do it sure like if you're just in the mood to make a trade fine but does it really make you that much better I'm not I'm not sure it does I mean it's not gonna  completely swing your season but I you mentioned it was Simon's too I mean that's part of the reason that brockton's place so well is you know you got your number one score out of the lineup basically right away so I think once he's back we see Brogden take a step back as well maybe you're not time do we have a time line on Simon's though this is what this is part of the concern with teams like this that have no interest in winning is that these timelines tend to get stretched out pretty good they said four to six weeks that was the initial TimeWise and then we got that was like a little over a week ago so I think the the hope is that he's back you know a week before Christmas or so and if that's the case that's fine I mean I it's too early I if this happened in February yeah then I'd be like how I don't know man they might hold him out I don't think he's coming back but I don't think we're looking at like a Lost season for Anthony so I'm in I think the Blazers could be as bad as they want with Anthony Simon's is the way that frame that and you might be able to hold you might be able to hold on on Brogden for a moment and get something better he's producing really well it's only wins right now Nick yeah I suppose I suppose let's let's talk Zion real quickly because he brought him up and then we will go back and hit a bunch of the questions from the chat  Zion Rick's 158 right now  and eighth category leaks per game  that is not good you know I I think the concern was on is not his production it's how many games is he going to play this is pretty shocking right I mean the the points for game have been there he's at about 22 but you know he was hovering closer to 30 points per game you know before he got hurt two seasons ago seven rebounds that's fine almost five assists that's fantastic you know seeing the passing come along Ziad does not have a single block shot through six games Brandon zero blocks zero Blocks he's under steel per game as well he's not taking any threes he's not made a 3-pointers you know and the field goal percentage is good at 50.5 but for a guy who doesn't take threes and for a guy who finishes and is that physical as he is that's still feels a little bit low and that free throw percentage down at 60.5 for a guy who's taking over six free throws a game that is that is really damaging so I think Zion Williamson through six games again small sample it has to go down to some of an early regret yeah and I mean it's not even getting to the line that much I he right now it is frustrating because  this is the the intersection of fantasy and reality I think Zions playing really well for New Orleans but it's not translating that it's not translating in the Box Score I think part of the reason why it's working right now is that he sort of just playing a complementary role and we expect Zion Williamson to be the star of the basketball team I think it's working for New Orleans right now but certainly not working for Fantasy managers  all right let's hit some of the questions in the chat keep those coming guys we'll we'll do about 20 more minutes here and then get out free key asks  Gafford or PJ Tucker who would you keep to me this is very clearly Gafford  outside with you I don't really have a take on this yeah I mean PJ Tucker's just not a good fantasy player at this point better much better real life player than fantasy I know it's been off to a little bit of a slow start we've got a few questions on Gafford but you know the minutes have been frustrating he still over two blocks the game and that's ultimately why you drafted him was to get those blocks and I think those are going to be there so yeah if you're choosing between those two absolutely go with with Daniel Gafford you know Fork three here so that's that Kevin herder has really led him down this year speaking of guys you may be regret drafting I mean not not an exorbitant draft cost of course for herder he was going you know in the 130 range but you know it's not been a great start for him feels like he's been marginalized a little bit only playing 24 minutes per game they were seeing more more Bleak you know they brought in Christchurch as well to be a part of that rotation I think at this point Kevin heard is probably a drop in most League's got off to a great start last year's been a high volume three point shooter that's what you're targeting and wrote a leaks but he's shooting the ball terribly he's not playing that many minutes and he's barely giving you a 3-point or per game so yeah if you're looking for advice on her I would say you could pretty safely cut bait right now it's pretty baffling because he's one of those guys that you think every team in the NBA wants to get their hands on and needs to have somebody like that and he is just I don't know if it's because he's fallen off or he's not being used properly but definitely could be a trade candidate  at the deadline I'll keep our eyes on that  Brian asked should I drop Middleton for Bruce Brown  I I think I'd rather have Milton I know it's I know it's frustrating I know it's like year three of this knee issue and kind of in and out and lower minutes but I think we get to the point where Middleton is back to you know his normal workload at least in the next few weeks and I like Bruce brown but he's not even in the top 150 so far like he's playing a lot of minutes that's great but he's really giving you nothing on defense and that's a lot of the appeal with Bruce Brown is the the Steals and you know some lower end blocks he likes Zion does not have a single block this year he's under a steal per game the assistant haven't really been there you know field goal percentage just been fine but not Elite so I I would start with Middleton in this one yeah Middleton still has the upside of somebody that can help you win games down the road Bruce Brown is just kind of a roster filler more than anything else  got a question about Jordan Hawkins Brandon in New Orleans is the Jordan Hawkins hype train a trap it's a very good question I mean we saw on Monday 31 points 7 threes from Jordan Hawkins in 38 minutes even before CJ McCollum went down I mean Jordan Hawkins was playing pretty serious minutes for this New Orleans team I mean somebody who I think it's a bit more NBA ready maybe than we expected right away and with the call about I think it's gonna continue you know obviously Trey Murphy's gonna be back hopefully in the next week or two you know herb Jones is banged up right now with a leg injury he might end up missing a couple of games nothing serious but yeah I wouldn't say it's a total trap I mean obviously he's not gonna give you 30 plus points every single night but he's taking he's taking a ton of three so if you're if you're in a rodeo league and you're just looking to you know grab somebody who still might be available who can give you two to three three pointers per game for the next few weeks I I would do it I mean he's taking eight threes a game and shoot 36% which if you watch him at all at Yukon this shouldn't be that surprising yeah the I think this one's tough for me because everything that we saw all leading up to the regular season was this big red flashing light that said we've got a problem here Jordan Hawkins did not look good in summer league it did not look good in preseason and those were the only indicators that we had of him playing NBA level competition obviously if you watch the NCAA tournament you loved what you saw from Jordan Hawkins the guy was a sniper so I guess we can we can start to feel a little bit better about his NBA prospects after that game but outside of that monster performance which is not an easy thing to do  just put up 31 points yeah and NBA game doesn't just sort of happen by accident so I'll give him credit there but if I'm gonna buy in on on hype I probably need to see I need to see that for a couple of games not 30 but if I can see him get close to maybe average around 18 for a couple of nights when he's giving an opportunity I'll start to buy a little bit more  Jay asked  Jordan Poole for Zack Levine  or basically just take your pick of these two guys Brandon Paul ranks higher he's been better so far we talked about some of the pitfalls with him and and some of the the minutes issues you know Levine's off to a slow start the Bulls just look like a disaster and a team that's going to blow it up sooner than later I think Levine certainly could be traded at the deadline if not sooner I this is really tough I think these guys are gonna finish right the same range I think they'll be in the same like General round by the end of the year Levine to me though has the pedigree I I don't know if I would necessarily be looking to give up Jordan Poole for him but Levine is a by low for me for sure  I think they're I think they're both buy lows right now are you really feeling great about Jordan Poole I like Jordan I like Jordan Poole a lot coming into this season from the fantasy lens and I'm not really ready to change my perception on that because I haven't seen anything that that I feel like altars what I thought he'd be coming into the season kind of like we talked about earlier so he's somebody that I've I'm kind of  as as dangerous as this can be I'm kind of planting my flag and Jordan pulled the fantasy asset and and I'm just not excited about Zach LaVine what he gives you a cross the board yeah you gotta be realistic of course but I think with Levine like the players that I'm willing to buy low on are the guys who are struggling shooting the ball and like everything else to be looks good like exactly was just shooting his normal percentages I don't think we'd have any concerns I think he would basically be putting up the same numbers that he has been for the last few years he always had 41% from the field 32% from three and we're still only eight games in like I think those numbers will rise you know the assists have been down that would be the one category of some some concern but I I think you know exactly is not going to finish as like the 90th rank fantasy player this season so if you can go out in and snags exactly being in a Buy Low trade I would encourage you to do that freaky asks can PJ Washington keep top 109 cat value he's kind of hanging on borderline top 100 right now somebody that in some ways I think it's a better real life player Dan fantasy like it feels like he's off to this great start but it's really it's really like points and threes dependent for Washington and he still shoots a really good percentage for a guy  who takes a lot of Threes but it was only at five rebounds a game and he's playing almost you know he's playing almost 34 minutes it doesn't really give you anything in terms of assist like blocks and steals tend to come and go I answer the question I think he could be a top 100 player I don't know if he could be higher than like 80th yeah no I'm a big PJ Washington fan and they need his production Steve Clifford isn't going to mess around with with guys that kind of don't give it their their 100% game in game out PJ Washington's the kind of guy that's gonna bring it right tonight and yeah like what I see so far I mean he's been putting up numbers and he's a solid player so you look at that last game 20 points four rebounds he's not going to share the the basketball very much but if he can keep those if he can keep the three-point attempts up I think he can be somebody that you feel really good about moving forward  Junior asks us Trey Jones or your guy Brandon Cole Anthony so I'll defer to you on this one you are the Orlando Magic expert on the pod  well I mean obviously I'm going to say Cole Anthony here  sort of par for the course it's use a golf reference in for my guy Nick over here yeah no he's been Cole Anthony's been really good so far and part of the reason that I like coal is that not only can he get hot from the field he'll also get you a couple of assists per game he's starting to block shots and he has heard all the noise about how bad his defense is and how he's a minus Defender and I think he's bringing it on that end so he's I mean his role is entrenched in this team he is their Sixth Man and you're talking about a team that struggles to generate offense he's always going to have his role I think he's a really good fantasy asset specialty for the price I mean it's um he was somebody that was really undervalued coming in because I just don't think he gets the fantasy Community excited  our Scotty Barnes number's sustainable Brandon he's been he's well I don't know man he's been somebody we've gotten a lot of questions about you know should I sell High  I mean is it sustainable at the current level maybe not but I don't know man I mean it's been pretty sustainable so far like where is the big drop off come  I  mean it might to believe that all the sudden he's like a top 10 player in the NBA that's my that's the issue it's it's not that I think all the sudden he's gonna revert back or or become he's taking a real step is what I'm saying but as he taken the step that the numbers would show you that he has I think that that's unrealistic he's been putting up numbers like he's a top 10 player in the league Scotty Barnes is good he's not that good so if yours when you say when you say sustainable he Scotty Barnes is has to be the the best sell High candidate in all of fantasy basketball right now  because of the star power that you could get back  true that is true and look if you could trade him for somebody who has top 15 top 20 pedigree over the last five years then yeah I would I would explore that certainly but it's just really hard to like get rid of a player who's giving you over two blocks a game and over yeah six of six like I I want to keep riding this out as long as I can I think I guess the concern is is what that eventually you know Pascal siakam kind of closes that Gap and usage rate I mean it feels like that's that's gonna happen at some point but I mean we're seven games in and it's Gotti bars to be when you watch the Raptors like he's clearly the guy he's very clearly the guy that they want you know kind of running things and I think the fact that he had such an underwhelming sophomore year you know kind of threw us off the scent a little bit like this was maybe not to this level but like this is what people thought Scotty Barnes was going to turn into last year and then the fact that he didn't everybody's like all right maybe he's not gonna be that guy but if you think about how we how we talked about Scotty Barnes coming out of his rookie season if he's following that progression like I don't think they should be that shocking I mean the two blocks per game that that to be is what's like all right that's probably not sustainable but the rest of it maybe  I think what you said about caca is the biggest reason why it's Scotty Barnes doesn't even have to take a step back in terms of the way that he's playing in order for his numbers to drop you you're talking about a fringe All-Star level player who's been terrible is that really gonna sustain itself the fact that this isn't a Nick nurse coach team anymore they're Under New Management that definitely plays a role the there's definitely a different approach here like if you want to if you want to buy the sustainability of it you don't want to sell them by all means that's the beauty of of nailing a pic like this is you don't have to do anything but if you're talking about players that are playing at a level that they probably can't quite sustained I think Scotty Barnes would be towards the top of my list him and him and cam Thomas like I guess  the different way all right we have an update by the way Brandon on the Daniel Gafford or PJ Tucker question it turns out he meant PJ Washington is that a PJ Tucker which makes a whole lot more wondering why we were rusting PJ Tucker yeah yeah I was like yeah I would definitely go for there I I personally would still lean Gafford I think there's some more upside there I want the blocks you know it depends what your targeting you know if you need points you need threes and short and you maybe you want Washington but if you're just trying to look at it objectively I would I would go Gafford over PJ Washington definitely PJ Washington over PJ Tucker for what it's worth  got a couple questions from Justin on Killian Hays thoughts on him rest of season is he worth rostering rest of season  I'm not a Killian Hayes guy I've been been pretty out on him all along I don't really think he's proven to be a very good player but I see the last couple of games you know it really is last three is playing a ton of minutes 15 points 7 assists you know the 3-point shooting is Gonna Come and Go it's been hot lately but historically you know he's not been a very good shooter although you know we'll see if he's made some progress there he's been some 30% every year of his career and through eight games you know he's hovering around 35th that's part of the reason that he's playing so many minutes alerts has been out Joe Harris has been out if you want to hold him sure I still don't really have an overly positive outlook like I'd be I'd be shocked if he's a top 100 player at the end of the year yeah they're dealing with a lot of injuries over there so it's kind of hard to get a gauge of exactly what the true rotation is gonna be in Detroit but you talk about that 3-point percentage bit of a mirage in two of the last three games he shot over 50% from 3-point range that's that's kind of hard for to keep up for most definitely for somebody who's shot in the 20s throughout the course of their career so I think it's a little bit of fool's gold right now  is if it's a zubac a drop  for me know partially because we want to see a little bit more about what's going on with this this Basin plumblee injury MCL sprain but we haven't had a timeline yet but big man dealing with the knee injury I mean this could very easily be a multi-week thing and you know zubac and we've got a minute since plumblee came in Midway through last year but we saw you know immediately play 30 minutes the other night against the Knicks have three blocks you know again you gotta be realistic like he is so far clearly you know that the number five option for the Steam and like you know we're using the term option pretty liberally and it's basically just you know Second Chance points dunks things like that he was never going to be he's never gonna be a high score yeah the rebound numbers have been down a little bit so far this year I think those probably come back up with basically out and you know he's giving you more blocks already that he was last year so no not a drop for me I mean again he's a lower end player but you know you almost every format that you play in whether it's points or Roto like you need you know most legs are two Center like you want guys who are Center eligible and you know a guy like Zubat to somebody I love roster like he's never gonna kill you  yeah I was honestly a little confused by the question because you're talking about a guy that is one of the better rebounders in the NBA and bigs are hard to come by and fantasy basketball so I can I can I always think about it like this whenever I get a question like that and in any fantasy sphere is what would I do as a manager in that league if I saw that player on the waiver wire I would immediately go pick up zubats which which answers your question you should not make him available to others Brandon do we think Keegan Murray digs himself out of this hole has not been shooting the ball well in the early going for the Kings 35% from the field 26% from three you know for a guy who what the 70% of his attempts come from three and the field goal percentage is going to be tied directly to how he's shooting the three he still taking over eight per game he still playing a ton of minutes like they're allowing him to play through his early season struggles I think like a lot of these players that are kind of fringy top 100 guys you have to be realistic like you know he's giving you six rebounds a game that's nice I think that's sustainable if he could continue to play Big minutes if you could be a 1.2 steals per game guy that's huge I would say yes he digs himself out of this I mean I think he can Murray already last season was a 41% 3-point shooter to me this is just a slab to begin the year and he'll end up being just fine so I wouldn't be trying to get off of him yeah this is a rock solid player he's got a good approach he's not somebody that's you know he he's  locked in it there's some guys that you worry about when they're not performing well is it because they don't care  he can Murray is not that guy so you can bet that he's gonna try and figure out how to as the person right here dig himself out of that hole good Defender he's a solid 3-point shooter like Nick said they're giving him the opportunities to to get back on track so I would remain patient with Keegan interesting question from Arthur Brandon 12 team had to head league would you dropped Jeremy Sohan for Jordan Hawkins  that's tempting  that is tempting I don't think I would though  I think I still rather have Sohan  yeah I I don't really love so hot at all I'm just I'm a little skittish on the Hawkins thing you know again if you need threes go get Jordan Hawkins if you don't need threes I don't think he's gonna give you really anything else and then you worry about when McCollum comes back in a special one straight bury comes back because I think they want Murphy to be 25-30 minutes a game and you know I don't think they want to siphon too many minutes away from her Jones Jose Alvarado I think it's gonna have something to say when he's healthy in this rotation as well so I you know short-term  maybe but I also like I mean so I spent just terrible so far right like I guess he's a slight bump in assist because he's playing point guard but like the minutes are basically exactly where they were last year it's not like he's playing 35 game the rebounds are down you know he's been woefully inefficient if you're playing in the category League he's killing you and field goal percentage he's killing you and free throw percentage even though he doesn't take that many so I'm not against dropping Sohan I would I would just be a little bit cautious and you know temporary expectations for Hawkins I also and maybe this is for you know you're setting your lineup for the day and trying to figure that out  keep an eye out on how he looks tonight the Spurs are dealing with a bunch of injuries in their backcourt this could be a Sohan game so I that's one of the reasons that I had pause with it is it specifically today I'm not trying to drop Jeremy so on I actually think you could have a nice fantasy outing  yep Spurs are at the New York Knicks tonight as part of that 14 game slate all right we'll hit a couple more Brandon and we'll be on our way it's called Bridges worth holding yes yes he is wouldn't really be looking to sell him right now I mean if there's somebody who's really high on Bridges and things he could be you know that top 20 top 15 guy that that's some people were talking about him as and you can get you know somebody who's a little more proven that sheriff but I wouldn't be really looking to get off of him I think he's been just fine so far  Damaris says he regrets drafting Anthony as his eighth overall pick over Shae Gill just Alexander I will assume this is Anthony Edwards Brandon and not Cole Anthony or yeah or Anthony Davis or Anthony Davis yes they went with shea not Alexander yeah so I want to go yeah they're going first names here well either way I mean Davis or or Edwards versus J is is interesting you know add going into Monday night was the number one player in fantasy so you know it was working out but then of course we had the I think the first ever growing spasm in NBA history I had never heard of that injury before it's like only Anthony Davis can have a growing spasm mid-game but that's a locker room twice that's what you sign up for man that's what you signed up for with Anthony Davis it's horrible it really is every year it just it is what it is and if you played fantasy basketball before you know this but I think the bigger thing is you know do you if you're somebody who passed on SGA you know later in the first round you regret it I probably right I mean he looks like he's just gonna be doing what he did last year and you know the Thunder have more Talent than they did a season to go like everybody seems to be playing pretty well to begin the year and you know SGA scoring is down that's the thing you know I don't think he's gonna be like 32 points a game  but he's 2.3 steals almost seven assists seven rebounds percentages are great 90% at the line on five and a half attempts per game  yeah I don't think if you took Anthony Edwards specifically that you're going to it's not going to kill your season but yeah you probably wish you had SGA if it is Anthony Davis I understand it you you're sitting in that spot in the draft where you could take a guy that you never have to worry about and  Shae Gill just Alexander is that guy and so I understand that Anthony Edwards  yeah he he's like you said he's not gonna take your team by any means but I also don't think he gives you the you know he's gonna give you the full array of categories like like she does  Good Question from Jerome what do you do with Ben mathurin really rough start for mathurin so far I haven't really heard much about it which is not a good thing moved into the starting lineup but only playing 22 minutes a game I do wonder you know this is he a Rick Carlisle type of player like this could be something where it just doesn't really doesn't really gel with a veteran head coach and I really like bathroom a lot I roster them on some teams last year and it worked out but you know I also think and this was the case as a rookie to to me much better real life player than fantasy yeah he's just kind of a microwave score you should give you more threes that he's giving you so far you know the shooting has been a huge issue but he's still getting to the line at a decent rate you'd like to see the defensive numbers improves specifically the steals like he is a great on ball Defender he was an elite Defender at Arizona and that hasn't really translated to defensive production so far so yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't be in like a full-on panic on bathroom but it's not it's not looking good the minutes are really concerning these hit one three and his last four games so it's almost hard to Fathom for somebody that  that wants to get up as many shots as he does but yeah you're right he's a good Defender he'll still give you some he'll give you a steal per game at the very least but I think there's reason to be concerned out of the gate we've seen enough bad games now to wonder if this is a trend that's going to continue would you drop Wendell Carter Junior for Mitchell Robinson Carter of course injured right now  I think I probably would I think I'd rather Robinson  oh I don't know that anybody out there is rushing to pick up Wendell Carter Junior right now he's gonna miss the next three weeks and that's at a minimum so you never know how that's gonna get stretched out but  yeah I would rather have Mitchell Robinson right now yeah 12.4 rebounds per game so far for Robinson 1.7 steals that's fantastic probably some regression coming there but it should see some progression on the Block shots he's barely blocking a shot per game and you should 46% for the field I mean he's a not even possible he's like a career 75% shooter that is that is preposterous I don't I have not watched the Knicks closely enough to know how he somehow shooting 46% but that number will come up as well and despite that you know he's still a top 100 guys so I think even even if Carter wasn't hurt I think I might just rather have Mitchell Robinson straight up right now all right we'll do two more  Hunter for folks presumably this is DeAndre Hunter for markelle fultz once again we have a magic question Brandon so I'll default to you  folks is tough right now because he's not playing I think I I think I'd rather have markelle fultz he's going to make his way back into the lineup he's good for  he's good for assists he'll get you steal per game he doesn't take bad shots because he kind of knows  his limitations for the most part so I I think now is a good time if you want to add folks to your bench but you have to be patient with it yeah I'd rather have folks to you know Hunter it's like every year I grabbed DeAndre Hunter and he's like in my lineup for three weeks at some point when I have a trees and it's just it's so up and down it's disappointing you know have the Boom games he'll have games where he gives you like six points of two rebounds he's just do not understand the exact same guy for the last five years and that's fine like he is just a solid rotation player in the NBA he's not a great fantasy player it's just you know it's kind of points lower in threes every now and then some steals will be there you know percentages are okay but just not there's not just I just don't like there's really any upside there whereas with folds like I'm still kind of curious what he could be all right A D I asked this is a big one Brandon wow who are his drops he's got to activate Derek white Darren Fox Booker and Claxton classic you know could be several more weeks on that but man uh look at this list I mean it's I would probably be looking to drop Tim Hardaway and Wagner  you know I guess we'll read it off for the audio only crew here he's got Finney Smith Tim Hardaway Jordan Hawkins MOG ties Jones Gafford Camp Thomas Drew holiday Zach Collins and this is somehow a 15 category League what are the 15 categories  you know I guess you could always find another category in basketball but that's yeah that's interesting I think so we're dropping  how many were we dropping here one  two I think I think we're trying to drop at least three  okay you can drop Jordan Hawkins  I think it's Fool's Gold I would drop Zack Collins and  I don't really want to drop more he's the better of the two bigs that are playing for the magic right now eventually you're going to want to drop him but I guess Gafford  yeah I don't know I dropped off her I don't I mean it's not like Wendell Carter's missing four months right like I think whatever I mean ultimately Wagner's the backup center for the next few weeks and I don't think there's a ton of upside there all right here he's giving us the category so it's normal nine cat plus double doubles field goals made free throws made three pointers made triple doubles I guess and what does ffs that flagrant fouls  that's a good one yeah I don't know maybe you should drop Wagner then yeah  let's see and strictly follows up on our discussion of DeAndre Hunter by asking is he the East Coast Harrison Barnes that's perfect he might be I think there's a part is better but yeah I think that's actually a pretty good cop at this point in his career all right last one alright well and on this because I need to talk to Jenny Schroeder just Dentistry keep this up  that's a guy that if you took a chance on late to draft you are profiting right now and I I could attest to that in one League though it's not the you know not one of the big money leaks for me I I think to some degree he can there's no one else in that back court you know I've always been somebody who's had some like Malachi Flynn curiosity I loved him at San Diego State I thought he would be a bigger piece for them by this point in his career but you know he's playing like 12 minutes a game off the bench you know unless we see like a complete shake-up and they would like send route or out somewhere which is possible I think he's gonna keep it up just because there's like there's nobody like coming back like there's nobody ever waiting for to come back from injury and steel minutes like he's unless they you know dramatically changed this roster I think he's a 30 plus minute for game guy I think that's exactly it he's been pretty consistent over the course of seven ten games how many of they played but yeah he I haven't seen anything that seems like it's a huge outlier I think this is just his role in their offense so that's the kind of stuff that I look for when I say fool's gold or Mirage are you doing something that that rests outside of the norm for what you're producing  Schroeder is giving you pretty much the same production every single night across the board so I don't see any reason why that would go away all right we'll wrap it up here guys we appreciate all of the commentary in the chat we did have confirmation Brandon that ffs is indeed flagrant fouls that is nailed it firstly I've ever seen that counts Flagger files is that a positive or A negative did you get you get points if somebody commits a flagrant nothing so I'm pretty sure that works against you all right well maybe try to implement that in and run of the Rogue staff leaks next season but again we appreciate all the commentary everybody following Along on Twitter on YouTube please like subscribe to our videos we'll throw the timestamps in there as well if you want to go back and and watch any of those we will have Dr a and Rick Campbell coming at you tomorrow in the morning that'll be 10 a.m.
